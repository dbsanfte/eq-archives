<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was with a druid the other night that Dire Charmed a mob, and it kicked butt.<br />
<br />
It got me thinking, we havent had a charm worth crap since what, level 34 or so? That's lame.<br />
<br />
What if we got a Dire Charm of spirits? That is .. Dire Charm ghosts and the such. Seems like it would go along with the Shaman spirits theme, and would give us a boost of DPS where dog dog is lacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Necros get DC for undead, so we would be taking one of their abilities.  I think SOE would consider DC overpowering for a shaman though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">and we all know the absolute last thing sony would ever do is give someone an overpowering charm spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, I think Charming / Dire charming is overpowered, and should be nerfed rather than handed out to other sundry other classes.<br />
<br />
Specifically in the case of shaman, I don't really see the point of giving us significant charming or dire charming ability anyway. Certainly I would rather see other things get fixed first - you know the issues already on the list.<br />
<br />
I always felt our charm ability at lower levels was a bit of a novelty toy - I mean, did anyone ever do anything useful with it? I just used to charm elephants in South Karana for the giggles of having a elephant running around behind you...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey SoE think everything they give us is overpowering so no change there. :)<br />
Seriously though if i wanted to charm id play a chanter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont think its a shaman thing at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Charm requires you to dominate a target first of all. We commune with the spirits, not dominate them and i know what happens in EQ2 and its heresy so we will not speak of it here :p<br />
<br />
 The necros can charm the undead yes, but undead and spirits are different. Undead have no spirit actualy, its animated flesh and bone, no soul, no life.<br />
<br />
<br />
So either way, i dont see why we should get anything like that. Though i would like it for fun just FYI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FACT: I fixed your quote<br />
<br />
But I'm not wanting a charm spell anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: added a not that was supposed to be there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If we got charm, we'd be getting it back.  Shamans had charm a very long time ago.  Then it got taken away and, for those who had scribed it, it was listed in the spell book as level 61.  Too bad it didn't survive the advent of PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DC has been brushed aside with current expansions as it was too powerful. When was the last expansion with mobs that could be dc'd in current zones, PoP? <br />
<br />
Unrestricted charm is far too powerful anyways. As anyone who has seen a pooka at work can atest. <br />
<br />
Less charm, not more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um I can think of a relativly recent expansion where DC was upgraded to level 65 mobs, which include the ones inside the current content. I think it was called Omens of War. And I think druids, necro's, and enchanters got it.<br />
<br />
Yea, it's been neglected.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Dire Charm got boosted to a level 65 level cap in Omens?  Dang, I didn't know that.  Is it through AA's?  What level can they do it at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They removed that ability as far as I know before the expansion went live and even so it had only upped the cap from like 45 to 55 on DC.<br />
<br />
edit- just verifed that advanced dire charm was planned for approx level 55 cap but it never went live in any form. Never was planned for anything like lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, I thought that seemed a little (alot) overpowering, and I didn't remember seeing it at the end of beta (I betabuffed a druid to 65 and didn't see that in the list of AA's).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't go wishing for a good charm. The druid ability to charm pets is held against them in dps discussions with devs, it's one reason druid DoTs completely suck compared to shaman DoTs.<br />
<br />
If shamans were to get a good charm, they would take away dps in some other area, because a tiny handful of shamans would output tons of dps with the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sorry for my sarcasm then. :) I played beta, and decided to cancell both of my accounts before beta ended. <br />
<br />
So therefore I just assumed everything that was overpowered for the blessed druids necro's and enchanters, were 100% sure to go through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Oogga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Honestly, I find it amazing to see people calling for nerfs here at the Crucible. <br />
<br />
I for one felt really sorry for enchanters every time that their charm got nerfed - it made them distinctive.  And I can't understand the mindset of people who think that &quot;the chanter is helping us clear this trial too fast, they are way overpowered&quot;.<br />
<br />
So what if they can do this in ONE zone? or even two? Good for them! And good for us, since we group with them.<br />
<br />
I think I speak for most when I say I'm sick of nerfs, and I'm sick of seeing people calling for nerfs on other classes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Long long ago Shamans used to have what was back then, a decent charm spell - why do you think Charisma was considered to be a 'green' stat in character creation for so long?<br />
<br />
I forgot why they removed it but they forgot to unflag charisma as an 'important' stat for so long hence why we have the myth of higher cha = better chance of slow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why bother asking for charm? Just ask for more avoidance / DPS on the pets we already get.<br />
<br />
An enchanter's animation should not be hacking for more damage than DogDog, dammit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i had an idea to change rabid bear to a dc like mob, it is not a dc mob though. What it would need it that mobs that can be dc`d by druids (ie animals) drop a soul shard (or something similar) this is a no rent no drop lore item , possible poofs on zoning. Anyway what we sumon with rabid bear is, well,  a rabid bear (possible berserker class, dc pets double attack but dont generally dual weild) this pet is much better than our wolf doing about the same dps (or close) to a dc pet. change the hasten rabidity to new pet similar to new dc. i mean i know people would like rabid bear to be a longer duration buff but as it is we dont use it, if it could change to my idea i would use it. Its no a charm its a summon animal spirit:) so fits better but has the same dc restrictions:)<br />
<br />
if not rabid bear, could just call it summon higher spirit or somin same idea but for more fun could summon random animal pet graphics from zone or class pets:) (including beast ones) but still beserker:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So in the latest 2 expansions, if we got DC we could charm what, dogdog?  Right, this gets me all slobbery, oh wait nvm that's just dogdog.<br />
<br />
edit:  Forgot, we could also DC a SK pet for an upgrade to dogdog np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">don't want charm. aye, it's powerful, but for us imo, it would be even more seriously overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I remember being level 50 sitting in oasis and charming the deepwater croc's.  Giving them all our buffs and then carting him around as a pet.  Some group would get pissed because i'm walking around with what the percieved as thier XP.  So when they got mad at me i let the charm wear off..rooted it next to them and backed off.  Poor poor chaps :(...DW croc 6....pc's 0...anyhow i used him as a pet to kite around sand giants for fun.  i just dont like selfish people lol.<br />
