<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've canceled my account, but can't quite kick the habit, so I like keeping abreast of things.  But was just curious about a development question.<br />
<br />
If priests heal on a ratio of 100:67:46, shouldn't the amount of damage we are able to consistently put out work in the opposite direction?  ie, if clerics heal at 100, they should do damage at 46% of what shamans put out, since we heal at 46% of what they heal.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wouldn't mind healing at 46% if that was actually the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it probably theoretically is at that threshold but it's unattainable due to agro. Druids are the 100, we're next, then the clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SoE are druid lovers...this isn't anything new....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well in soe's favor druids were put in eq as THE easy class, and they are still just as powerful as they ever were, druids are for people who dont need or want a difficult class but want some power and versitility. <br />
<br />
but the healing ratio is total 100% pulled out of some crack heads ass *** were you thinking crap.<br />
<br />
druids are solid nukers/dotters/healers/soloers/buffers, how do you justify shaman getting the stinky end of the stick in almost every single catagory while druids are near the top in all of the catagories they fall into? <br />
<br />
dont nerf druids, give the shaman some love already.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not in short fights bud...not in short fights....maybe if you stack all your disease, poison, and curse dots and watch them as they tick up...but no...a druid hand down can kill a mob faster than you will ever think about doing it....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shamans own druids in the ability to dps in solo situations over time, where mana regen is an issue.  Shamans can throw more spells in a shorter amount of time, stack dots, and basicly outcast a druid over a series of pulls.  In a single fight scenario, a druid can still out-dps a shaman using nukes.<br />
<br />
Druids own shamans in group DPS situations, where mobs aggro the shaman when he stacks dots and the druid can nuke.  If the druid has to heal, the shaman can out-dps him, depending on how often he has to cast heal spells and if he's required to snare.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but you don't know how to play your druid to his full potential then.  If you have DC alone you can out damage your shaman 99%.  My brother and I play a shaman druid combo and he kicks my arse in zones were he can either DC or charm animals.  I don't know a single shaman that can make in AA solo in 45 mins to hour without working at it like a druid can charming.  In a zone were he has no DC or charm the cold debuff and cold blast make them a criting machine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my druid can (well, could) nuke for 1705 - 2046 (with ID 4) dmg, approximately every 7 seconds with no fear of agro, with one nuke.  He has a variety of other spells, including stuns, rains and virtually unresistable dots that he can throw on for a bit more damage.  That's not counting charm, of course.  That Vxed where I used him as main healer and running a charmed Hynid was nice and quick.<br />
<br />
for my shaman to match the damage per tick (1467 no focus - 1753 full focus) that the druid can put out using one nuke, I would have to be running:<br />
Blood of Saryrn(328)<br />
Bane(420)<br />
Ancient Scourge of Nife (254)<br />
Bane of Nife (214) <br />
hmmm that's only 1216.  <br />
<br />
Well, let's give some generous numbers for BA 4...max possible would be 393, 504, 305, 257 that adds up to 1459.  Which is still less than the druids best current nuke, without focus.<br />
<br />
How exactly does your shaman character do an insanely larger amount of DPS than your druid?</div></div><hr />

If he's anything like most of the druids I've grouped or raided with, then that druid stands up, casts snare, and maybe clicks ES vambraces before sitting again, and says he's done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
;p</div></div><hr />

And yes, I remember the otter hate ;) Faked a patch message with it.</div></div><hr />
