<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at 200 in three different tradeskills (brewing, fletching, baking), and I'm not sure which, if any of those, or others to take to 250.<br />
<br />
Which tradeskill did you take to 250?  Are you pleased with the choice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure how lucrative fletching is nowadays, but it seems to favor wood elf rangers who take up cultural more than other races. There are some PoP bows that look nice, the market's already flooded with Nightmarewood Compond Bows.<br />
<br />
Baking makes the 10 lb Halas Meat Pies and Misty Thicket Picnics which sell like hot cakes, pardon the pun. Doesn't seem to me like brewing brings in as much dough (just yeast mainly). I'd say go with baking.<br />
<br />
I'm at 227 smithing myself. I've made some bucks selling sickles and troll cultural weapons, but it's mostly gone back to buying gems and BDs for the next set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well none of those 3 skills will make you rich <br />
id go for brewing, all store bought components<br />
<br />
sooner you hit 250 sooner you can go for the skill trophy .. its worth it, if only for the bag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Ceno<br />
<br />
none of those will make you real rich, unless your server literally has no one selling the nightmare bows or misty thicket/10lb pies... used to be great until everyone started doing tradeskills...<br />
<br />
personally im working on JC (jewel craft) just cuz that and smithing seem to be the ones that bring in the most money.. also you can make some nice items for yourself as well when you get high enough and the components while levelling... (valorium ring, glittering ring of judgment, whatever u like)<br />
<br />
dont forget that AA's allow you to go to 200+ with more than only 1 skill, so you can always decide on the next one if you think uve made a bad choice now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Baking is pretty easy to get up with and is actually fairly useful from time to time.  Even just spending an hour making Halas Meat Pies can give you food for a month and save you a ton of cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just got 241 in pottery and got my grand masters potter's sculptor on the first try. :)<br />
<br />
Pottery's market is ruined - people selling star ruby steins for 150pp when it costs 200pp for the average potter to make (with failures). I only pushed through by making imbued idols of erol. marr.<br />
<br />
But I made several faithstones for friends, and made them very happy. I think I'm done with tradeskills for awhile... the market is trashed and I'm tired of endless combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are LOTS of really handy focus IV items a potter can make in PoP.<br />
<br />
Like the Afflication Haste IV Ceramic Skull of Decay I got.<br />
Easily sell that sort of item for 20kpp just for the focus effect (stats are crap but 33 percent spell haste for Slows/Debuffs/DoTs/Charms kicks ass).<br />
<br />
Go check out the PoP section of www.eqtraders.com.<br />
<br />
Yes you do need some rare components from different planes (Like 1 from CoD and 2 from PoD for the Skull I just mentioned). <br />
Trival &gt; 250 but 238 + geerlock is max effective skill anyway....<br />
<br />
If you are unable to get keyed for the Plane in question, ask a high level friend or two to collect any of the bits the happen to see drop  :)<br />
<br />
Personally I have just started the long haul to get smithing from188 to 238 so I can make Barbarian Cultural armor to sell to shamans and warriors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, I do know about the pop ceramics.<br />

However, I personally think the stats are so crappy, I can't imagine may people buying them. I might make the ceramic gravel of justice just to swap in when I'm dotting and soloing, but generally, the crappy stats just suck. 2 hours and the talisman of beneviolence quest and you'll have an item better than anything I can make with pottery, except for the focus effect.<br />
<br />
Some people might not mind constantly swapping stuff in and out, I don't know if I really want to remember &quot;did I swap in my hammer of justice&quot; before I cast pox.</div></div><hr />

If they do you might want to go for another skill.<br />
<br />
I wish I had done this before GMing brewing on Zebux.   First day out with Kaladim Constitutionals I got in a price war with two other brewers and the market for high end brewing was wrecked for a month.  I went down to 15pp each before I bailed out and sold the lot to another player for a bargain price and never made anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fishing? Have you gotten your fishing to 200? (Can be done with skill points). Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Tailoring is imo, a very profitable skill. It is also a COSTLY skill. Had a GM (* More on this in a moment) tailor tell me it cost her 200k to get to 250. She was charging 1k per success (3/8) on Tunarean armor for my Ranger. <br />
<br />
Note I provided every single component.<br />
<br />
Don't scoff at pottery. To get to 188 or so is relatively cheap. As with all the TS's tho - to get to 250 increases EXPONENTIALLY in cost.<br />
<br />
But those items people are talking about DO sell.  Ext buff duration items (Hint &quot;Selling ext duration KEI in South Wing&quot;)<br />

Items that allow you to cast faster are nice, but the darned recast change sucks.<br />

Check my magelo, I have the circlet of the faulkaen, which has haste III. Haste IV is really not required - I don't have my 63 and 65 dots yet, and even then, an extra second or two off of them wouldn't really be worth the hassle of swapping stuff in and out.<br />
<br />
It's more of a hassle issue, these things have such poor stats that you don't want to wear them full time, but to do the switcher-roo before you cast a spell is a real pain.</div></div><hr />

I'm not scoffing pottery :) I just blew 6k to get to 241 this weekend, powerleveled a human cleric to 29 to get imbued star rose quartz, and abused every single enchanter I knew for vials of clear mana. And I'm still only 241. Which is not bad, but not 250.<br />
<br />
I do checks on the high end pop pottery items, and I only see one for sale ever - the ceramic skull of decay. And it's been for sale for 20k for 2 weeks now. I have never seen anyone sell the ceramic hammer of justice. And using  TWO metalic liquids for the ceramic shield of valor? Not going to happen.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm through with pottery, at least, through with abusing my friends for vials of clear mana. Maybe in a week or two I'll regain the spirit, but my enchanter friends are in hiding, my twink has spent two days doing nothing but stand, cast 4, sit, and I'm frustrated.</div></div><hr />

want a cheap skill for GM?  Do Jewelcraft.  We lost our GM JC mule this week in guild and so in about 8hrs and for 10k I got my JC to 250.  Wiped out my bank on my 3 fails on my GM trophy though, that was fun.<br />
<br />
pottery was my first over 200 skill.  I don't know if I can manage to get it any higher than 226.  Skillups are on the order of 150 skillup combines (with each skillup combine having at least 2 subcombines) these days.  <br />

I really want a ceramic rod of storms to nuke with and some of the higher end pottery items have really nice effects.   250 stormwatchers later and no drop of the component.  :(<br />

Baking I just did because its fun heh :)  Tailoring I'm doing because that was one of my goals since I started this game, and knew practically anything about it.  Tailoring is no easy, pushover skill to GM though.  It required a LOT of farming and a LOT of money. Average price is around 130k to go from 188-250 depending on your servers economy and thats with some farming too :) <br />

I currently have 275 Hides saved up in my bank and 500 Small Pieces of Acylia ore, gonna push a big Tailoring run soon.</div></div><hr />

Was this you as in Shaman or you as in Enchanter / JC type? 8k?  Ouch.  If you can - get an Enchanter to enchant the bars. Will save you TONS of money.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Interesting thread.  Nobody wants to say anything concrete on the serverwide tradeskill channel, or anywhere else, usually, on how much it costs to level any particular tradeskill.  Perhaps people don't want competition or whatever, but I've always gotten nothing but snotty sarcasm or evasive answers when asking such a simple question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Most tradeskillers do their skill-ups over a long period of time.  <br />
<br />
I started brewing at level two (Vah Shir need to for a quest) and GMed it at almost 50 so I can only give the most basic estimate of how much I spent.<br />
<br />
The first 248 points were cheap, painful, but cheap.  Well under 1kpp.  The last two points can vary depending on the recipie.   If you choose champagne and get unlucky the last 2 points can cost more than 2kpp.  If you go with the more assured Kaladim Constitutionals you will need to buy a corking device (about 3kpp+) but the cost per combine is pretty trivial (about 4pp each) and you should get the last two points for less than 200pp.<br />
<br />
I would estimate that I spent more than 5kpp on brewing to 250 but I took a round about way and did some combines that weren't the lowest cost choices.<br />
<br />
Brewing can start making money earlier than most skill with a sellable recipie that trivials in the 40s (heady kiolas) but they are a huge pain for the amount of profit they can generate.  Not much sellable after that till you get near 200 though.<br />
<br />
As you can see, it would be pretty hard for me to give a definate answer to the question of &quot;How much?&quot; and I'm pretty sure it's the same for most tradeskillers.  We're not being evasive, we just don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">5k was a perfectly good answer.  So were some of the other answers here.  Lots of people pay attention to these things, though not all do.  <br />
<br />
I think some are just more helpful than others.  Trying to get any info on the serverwide tradeskill channel about almost anything can be like pulling teeth.  Smart remarks are all the rage, though.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your own contribution; it was specific and just what the doctor ordered.  5k for brewing, someone said 1.4k for jewelry while another said 10k(the difference between buying enchanter services and just enchanting stuff yourself, I suppose) -- some good info here.  The bit about 130k to take tailoring past 188 was very good too.  Sometimes people make it sound like 500k is a drop in the bucket.  The pottery stuff is interesting too; I was all set to try taking pottery past the 128 or so I have it at, but now am not so sure.  <br />
<br />
It sounds like hell getting stuff from chanters for much of this stuff.  I think I might look into leveling a chanter a bit to do some enchanting for trades...I'll have to see how practical that is.  I have a chanter friend, but don't want to be twisting his arm every time he sees me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Blargx I have a 61 Enchanter who is a pretty substantial TS'er.<br />
<br />
Here's my estimates on certain skills with my level in said skill in parentheses:<br />
<br />
1) Fishing (200) - generally cheap as all get out to 200.(The max) 500 pp at MOST.  CAN be maxxed using training points.  Other than that - is boring, and fishing poles can break at random. Faern still has his very first pole from the days of sitting on Halas docks dredging up sandals etc.  My Monk OTOH breaks a pole 1/10 casts. Favorite spot? CS - love the music and the otters running around.  Can go from 1-200 in one sitting if you have enough bait and poles. (and patience)<br />
<br />
2) Smithing (167) - Repetitious to the extreme. Must make a lot of sub components for combines. Depending on your race / religion you can make serious BANK. Realize that once you sell a top of the line item to a person - you're not going to see them for awhile. Smithing is like gambling - you may be up for a time as you sell items to a vendor - but in the end - you're going home with empty pockets. Think it has cost me 8K to this point. I estimate 10K per 10 points until 250.  You will run around more than a newbie drood with first time aggro. Supplies are all OVER the place and often not conveniently next to a forge.<br />
<br />
3) Baking (191) - Cheap and easy to get to this point. Figure 1k. To get to 227 you can keep doing Halas 10 pound pies. A LOT of clicking. Fish, Bat Wings to 135; and then Halas Pies.  Mammoth Meats (The limiting factor in Halas 10 pound pies) are your friend. I estimate 2K to get to 227. Not sure after that. Not that much running around.<br />
<br />
4) Tailoring (162) - is the DEVIL. You are going to be SICK of silks, swatches, heady Kiola's etc. Once you get past Wu's - it gets REALLY expensive. Figure 6K through WU's then 100K + to 200. Hopper pelts and Acrylia can be farmed - BORING - or bought - EXPENSIVE. Not a lot of going from zone to zone to buy supplies - but to farm supplies.<br />
<br />
5) Brewing (189) - is click central. To attempt ONE combine at this level I need to click the mouse about 8 times. Cheap  yes. Do the Cyclops skull to 151 or so. A Side bennie is that Halas is a great place to work this skill.  Think it has taken me 3-4K to get here.  Pain in the butt moving from zone to zone. <br />
<br />
6) Pottery (188) - cheap, cheap to this level. Maybe 2-3K. PAST this point is apparently plat city. Vendor farm zombie skins and pelts for the poison vials. Or go to unrest and buy them. Bazaar is rip-off central.  Thurgadin is not too bad if you have supplies - otherwise, you will be running about.<br />
<br />
7) Fletching (165) - Figure 3K to 200. Can make boatloads of arrows (Bows are a suckers bet) and the limiting factor to 200 is your wrist. PAST 200 it gets prohibitively expensive and unless you have a Ranger - I'm not sure why a Shaman would go this route. There are no Tribunal Bows etc.  Can go from 1-200 in one sitting in front of one vendor.<br />
<br />
I have an advantage with an Enchanter as illusion and Collaboration allow me to enter ANY city pre-luclin. Heck, I've done enough faction work I can walk around a lot of em in Tier'dal form. A Shaman will NOT have this option unless they have some sort of mask (ala Juujuu and his halfling mask) or pre-nerfed mask of deception. I can also buff my Charisma to the magical 105 level. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to add. Some of these skills require items from other TS's. (ie Tailoring requiring heady Kiola's)<br />
<br />
Also - you need a way to generate plat in droves. TS's will drain your account unless you are moneybags. (My Enchanter sells KEI - call me a pimp - but it pays the bills).<br />
<br />
Sell Focus, sell your ability to Malo, offer to solo that Dragon in WW and sell tickets - I dunno - but you need to make money cuz TS's COST money.<br />
<br />
EDIT # 2 - Damn, forgot <br />
<br />
Jewelcraft (250) - Ok, can be done in one (LONG A55) sitting. For you as a non-bar-enchanting Shaman expect what Henora paid 8K.  If you can Enchant the bars I did it for 1.4k with my Enchanter. Not a big market for this stuff anymore. I have maybe one request / 6 months for BD items. North Freeport is decent, they're a bit prejudiced, but at least you can buff your CHA to 105+.<br />
<br />
EDIT # 3 - BUY A GEERLOCK, BUY A GEERLOK, BUY A GEERLOK. They pay for themselves VERY rapidly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks very much Faern.  I copied it all so I can look it up whenever I need to make decisions on which skills to take up when.  Very nice indeed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you're looking for an easy time to 250, then don't choose pottery or fletching.  Verant's recent &quot;adjustments&quot; to skillup rates for these trades was way overdone as Henora already pointed out, the chances of getting a skillup were greatly reduced.<br />
<br />
I think that for a combined fun and profit factor, baking is the way to go, or perhaps jewelcraft.  Baking is becoming very popular with new quests, and can be profitable (ie justice fruit pies, hero sandwich), while jewelcraft can get you a rare uber item from PoP that sell for big money.<br />
<br />
I've been struggling with tailoring now for about a year and a half and I'm still at 187, getting rockhoppers hides in quantity is a total nightmare, they are camped so heavily by dire charm druids that you will be lucky to even see any live hoppers when they are up. <br />
<br />
Smithing can be a good money maker with the new PoP crafted armors but to get your skill from 188-225 or so will require some heavy farming of greens and is quite a time sink.  Only pick this if you are prepared for the time sink.  By the way getting smithing components for PoP armors is very difficult, as it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My advice on smithing (243 skill now)<br />
<br />
Check your server. Does your race have a gm smith? If so, your odds of making back the cash to make the MASSIVE timesink of smithing worth your effort is pretty low. They have been selling blue diamond armor for a while. Their customers have been reselling blue diamond armor for a while. You are just starting out, and likely having lower success rates, so cant compete as well on a price market.<br />
<br />
Sickles will take you to 250. The question is, how many more can your market hold? The answer is not many most likely. The potc earring has been out a while. People have their mains and prime alts with them already. With the PITA of flagging in POP, people have sidelined alts heavily. Perhaps with the slew of frogloks coming out you can hit a decent run. I made 20 sickles well over a month or 2 ago, and priced lowest in the bazaar nearly non stop, I still have a few.<br />
<br />
Shadowscream: It can take you to 250, but its a huge hassle. Hope you enjoy farming greens for about 3-4 hours per point of skill from 188 onwards, cuz its the boat you are in. Dont forget the irritating buggy hollowshade war and huge undercons of shadows in the twilight sea. Oh, no drop and no rent componets are also really fun.<br />
<br />
POP armor: LOL RIGHT. Drop rates are pretty great dont ya think? This is not a skill up option, and if you dont have a high skill, I wouldnt waste the components.<br />
<br />
Smithing is one of those skills where you have sadly missed the boat at this point. If I wasnt at my skill before all the skilling nerfs, I would have never taken up the path. <br />
<br />
If you are going to gm one, I would try baking if you can forage or have buddies who can. Its fun, cheap, can be done in the field, people consume their wares, and no one resells a MTP when they are ready to upgrade to the next level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*wave Henora* :)<br />
<br />
Here's what I did to help....<br />
<br />
Now there are 3 things to make at 226 that are not *extremely* expensive. I'm not counting faithstones or tunare idols as those use iron oxide, sell slowly - I've been selling a tunare idol for 2 weeks now at 2k - and involve distilled mana - $$$.<br />
<br />
The three things are -<br />
<br />
Crucibles of Escape- Trivial 236 - requires farming heavy clay from the Gorge of Xorbb, 6pp per combine.<br />
Star Ruby Steins - Trivial 250 - costs 70pp per combine and celestial essence (another combine). Requires magic clay. (Level 8 enchanter + clay)<br />
Imbued Idols of Erosilli Marr - costs ~17pp per combine. Requires vials of clear mana (29 enchanter + emerald + vial). Requies imbued star rose quartz (29 human cleric + star rose quartz). Requires magic clay. (Level 8 enchanter + clay).<br />
<br />
Now I have a level 12 enchanter, and I spent two weeks getting a level 29 human cleric (it bored me to tears so I did it off and on). I've abused every 29+ enchanter I know to get vials of clear mana. I've bought out the bazaar supply. But, that's how I got to 241 on about 6k from 227. That and imbued peridots idols while I waited for my cleric to get to 29....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Tradeskill are not something i would do to make money. It takes alot of money and a fair bit of luck to make money at tradeskills. Personally I'm a GM Smith, jeweler and brewer on different chars already and have 2 8th shawls compleated on different chars. I did make alot of money doing smithing but I was lucky to be into it at the right time with the right resources.<br />
<br />
As far as cost of tradeskills to master it's really hard to price mosts. Price depends on too many factors and often times depends on the situation. What recipe you choose, your luck on combines, your stats (effect skill up rate) are all going to end up effecting your cost. Also your economy is going to effect most trade skill. For me smithing cost me probably about 25k to get from 190ish to 232 skill. At that point i started making sickles and cultural armor and was actually making money while skilling up to 250. In the end I ended up making lots of money. If you wanted to you could legitimately say I probably made half a mill pp getting my skill to 250 since all my combines from 232 on up where made on something I could easily sell for profit and did. Now a days how ever the market is alot worse for sickles and cultural armor since alot of people already have thiers and there is more people making it. I could sell half a dozen sickles in a night when I was first making them. Now you'd seem to be lucky to do that in a week.<br />

Brewing has got to be one of the easiest skills to raise. All store bought all the way up to 250 and can be done pretty cheaply. Mino hero brews take a fair number of components but is alot easier now that you can have more than 2 bags open at once.<br />
<br />
Baking is pretty easy too. Probably requires next to no money. Can probably make a profit even skilling up. Can get to 191 pretty easily on cheap and easy combines with fish rolls and patty melts and easily sells for enough to cover costs. After that it take some collecting of items but skilling up on Halas meat pies and misty picnics isn't very difficult as far as gathering components. For the pies you get 10 per meat and for the picnics you get something like 400 picnics per brownie part and then just need some foraged veggies. Either should sell for at least enough to cover costs.<br />
<br />
Jc is easy. Everything vendor bought. If your an enchanter and actually spend the time to enchanter all your metals you can do it very cheaply. With out enchanter it's more expensive but still not that bad. 10k sounds pretty reasonable to me with no enchanting. I'd have to check my records but off hand I'd say about 3-4k for my enchanter where I enchanted when ever i had mana.<br />
<br />
Fletching is pretty cheap and easy upto 202. Making arrows is pretty easy and sell back is good. Past 202 it gets time consuming or expensive or both. Either making bows or acrylia arrows.<br />
<br />
Pottery is like fletching. Pretty dirt cheap and easy upto 199? or something like that on vials and casarole dishes. Past that your stuck making idols, steins or something. Requiring money, or time or both. The star ruby steins used to be good for skill up and you could make a profit selling them for the Solstice earring quest. Now a days most servers seem to have too many people have tried that and you can't even beak even anymore on them.<br />
<br />
Smithing is a pain in the rear and time consuming and expensive. Personally I wouldn't touch high end smithing in most situations. Too much work to just compeate with all the established smiths.<br />
<br />
Tayloring is about as bad or worse than smithing depending on who you talk to. Expensive and timeconsuming to GM.<br />
<br />
Smithing and tayloring do have a shortcut if your lucky enough to be able to pick up a 15% skill mod item. Other wise your looking at a long and painful road.<br />
<br />
For those dedicated enough or crazy enough depending on who you ask to spend 18 aa points and all the time to GM all the skills there is an earring quest in PoK. Currently the earring is at 15ac 15str dex sta wis int agi 100hps/mana 15 sv all effect aura of regeneration effect. There is also at least 1 more step on the quest.</div></div><hr />

&quot;affliction hasteIV and a cleric spell haste makes a 1.7sec turgurs and a 2.8sec malo <br />
<br />
my mobs are malo'd &amp; slowed before your even done casting malo on yours &quot;<br />
<br />
Check my magelo, I have the circlet of the faulkaen, which has haste III. Haste IV is really not required - I don't have my 63 and 65 dots yet, and even then, an extra second or two off of them wouldn't really be worth the hassle of swapping stuff in and out.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I guess it will only become an issue when people get Malos/Malosinia/Malicious Decay/PoP dots or when chain casting Cloud of Grummus to slow something very nasty and highly MR.<br />
<br />
I have both my PoP dots and most days I've bagged my epic to hold my little no-stats Ceramic Skull dollie.<br />
<br />
Ceramic skull of decay is also VERY useful for Enchanters casting PoP charms, etc.<br />
Any saving in re-charm time could save their lives when a PoP mob is kicking the crap out of them!<br />
<br />
Besides, given that I am KoS to most velious factions, a Circlet of the Faulkaen would be a bish to get (also I want something with more AC/HP like a Tormax crown or something). :)</div></div><hr />

Tradeskills to me epitomize the carrot that is EQ. &quot;Just one more combine.&quot; &quot;Just one more skill up.&quot; <br />
<br />
It starts off small...&quot;Oh I'll just do baking.&quot;  Next thing you know you're into brewing to maximize your food stat buffs etc. <br />
<br />
A week later you're farming silks in EK because, well you saw that the recipe for Heady Kiola was only 46 (or something), and besides you tell yourself, some of that Wu's would kick butt on your baby Monk.<br />
<br />
Well, shoot - everybody SAYS I can get to 250 JC for just 8k....so you spend an evening or two combining in Freeport.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills will CONSUME you. (And occupy a large portion of your inventory)<br />
<br />
It is fun tho to outfit yourself with a lot of food, arrows, clothing etc. Even more fun to sell some stuff to people or help guildies.</div></div><hr />

For the baking it might be. It's relatively easy and cheap to get to 191 skill with Fish roll and patty melts. At that point you can make the pies yourself with reasonable success. At that point it then becomes do you want to take the time to find the wolf and mammoth meat do all the combines yourself or just pay someone for them. Personally I have the skill i'd just rather pay someone else for them right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Well, I have a feeling they won't ever make smithing reasonably easy again, and already I'm seeing there are lots of high level smiths around on my server, so I put aside smithing.  I will probably get it high enough to do a buncha combines necessary for making throwing javelins for my twinks, and for doing things I might need for other trades.  (Faern sounds like he's describing me when he's talking about falling into doing just a little bit of one skill to help out another, then finding another helps another. ;)  )<br />
<br />
My baking has been at 135 forever already, so figuring I had a head start and it's one of the easiest ones, I've been putting a lot of time into it over the weekend and this week so far.  It's taking more time than I thought it would!<br />
<br />
Yesterday I did halas meat pie combines alone for a little over six hours.  For almost exactly SIX hours I didn't get any skill ups!  I started and remained at 203 skill, more than ten points into the range where the pies give you skills, have 253 wisdom and a geerlok equipped.  Sheesh!  Then I suddenly got two skill-ups in three combines.  What a relief!  With that, I logged and went blearily off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Sure was lucky to find mammoth and wolf meat too!  Took a good long time hunting and buying and checking every Halas and Thurgadin vendor.  Got 51 mammoth meats from a guy hunting outside Halas for 10pp each and considered myself very very lucky.  Just getting meats took at least a couple hours.  Didn't find that much either.  Bought a little more here and there in bazaar.  Some chumps were charging insane prices for the meat too. :P  And luckily I've saved just about every egg I've seen since I started the game.  Had stacks of basilisk eggs, and went through them all even though they produce 15 dough each!  Went through really massive numbers of eggs.<br />
<br />
Just the sub-combines alone for the halas meat pies take a very long time.  Preparing a few backpacks full took a couple of hours, the eventually of course I had to do it again.  Combines include cream, then creamy fennel sauce, dough, fillets, creamy fillets of four different meats -- blecch.<br />
<br />
So, six hours plus for TWO skill point increases. :P  At that rate, I figure, it would take 270 hours to get bakery to 250!  Not even counting the time to gather components.<br />
<br />
Hope I don't run into a bad run like THAT again!<br />
<br />
Good thing I have a lot of mules, cuz I sure have a lot of halas meat pies.  There's no such thing as too many mules when you're making these things.<br />
<br />
Pricing them at the lowest price that bazaar traders seem to have agreed on in any number, like everyone else does who doesn't just want to sell everything overnight, I've sold, oh...a couple handfuls heheh. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The one thing I've noticed about smithing, and this probably applies to tailoring and pottery too, is that every once in a while, we get to make the HOT item that everybody wants. Then, other wannabe GM smiths jump on the bandwagon and start producing them, and then the price wars start, and after a couple of months or so you can't give these items away. This started with Acrylia plate armor and Black Acrylia Halberds. <br />
<br />
Sickles are still hot now, but it's a matter of time till they're as common as toothpicks. Cultural armor is starting to come down in price as BDs are becoming more available. I'm the only troll GM smith on my server, so at least my Honed Yaks are hot items. My only competitors are the middlemen who buy them and mark them up 50%. Hellooooo, my customers know who my mule is by now, they're practically camping him. They don't wanna buy from pond scum like you.<br />
<br />
There is one other hot item out there now, but I'm not gonna say what it is. I wanna make some $$$ off it first. RAR!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I am a GM Brewer and can say that as far as the various trade skills that its is by far the less painful option; you can sit in Halas in one store and literally go from 120 skill to 248 skill in one sitting if you so choose.....granted you will have carpal tunnel and be drooling from the mind numbing tedium and boredom, but hey, its better than UO :)<br />
Smithing and Tailoring are god aweful hard to raise now...thankfully there are plentiful supplies in Bazaar on most servers, just you have to have deep pockets to abuse it well...tailoring for the right race is a instant money maker....halflings and their weight reducing bags have almost made me play one of the hairy footed freaks just to work on that skill....so far though I cant bring myself to do it though....but the 100% wt reduction bags are a insta 5k on Karana with people often auctioning WTB in the trade channel, so it might be worth the effort.<br />
I personally love brewing, I cook up Kaladim Constitutionals for myself and my alts, Grobb Liquid Meat for some RL friends of mine that prefer it (/shrug one less stamina and +5 to all saves seems to be better to me, but what do I know :D) and occasionally make Demi Sec Champagne for people on request....I am also working on changing my factions around so I can whore out coldain ring war combines (I have seen this work very well as a money maker and is the only reason that I can see cuddling up to the darn shorties).<br />
It basically boils down to what your interested in and what you can tolerate as far as cash layouts and time sinks...you can go solo acriyla drops and hide drops so tailoring or smithing is a viable option, but it takes from exp grinding and grouping. Brewing, pottery and Jewelcraft are pretty common, but work well and are almost all vendor bought (I know pottery is a pain for hides to make poison vials though).</div></div><hr />
