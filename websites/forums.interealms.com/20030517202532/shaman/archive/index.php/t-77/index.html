<br />
10. You get an uncontrollable urge to root and run when a co-worker you hate corners you in the break room.<br />
<br />
9. You get halfway home on the freeway and then smack your forehead and think &quot;I could have just gated!&quot;<br />
<br />
8. Your friend is moving his desk, but instead of offering to help, you offer a STR buff so he can do it himself<br />
<br />
7. Instead of yelling &quot;Here, Rover&quot; you just try to cast Summon Companion<br />
<br />
6. You try to comfort your four-year-old with a Minor Healing instead of a band-aid for his boo-boo<br />
<br />
5. When the cop tries to pull you over, you speed up and yell &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE!&quot;<br />
<br />
4. The SPCA has you up on animal cruelty charges for telling your dog to &quot;Get Lost&quot; and abandoning him<br />
<br />
3. You keep trying to cast Curse of the Spirits on the slow drivers on the freeway<br />
<br />
2. You're preparing dinner with a hammer because you can't equip the knife<br />
<br />
And the number one reason -<br />
<br />
1. You find yourself standing up and sitting down while watching television so you can cannibalize up some mana to work the remote</div></div><hr />
