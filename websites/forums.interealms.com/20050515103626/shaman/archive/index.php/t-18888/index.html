<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hurrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure how many of you remember me, been almost 11 months to the day since I last posted in this forum.  Simply put....I been a shaman for a long long time.<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna analyze the AA list offered for us in GoD.  I won't do it for new spells either.  However, I think its kinda clear the shaman devaluation continues.<br />
<br />
Perhaps what I dislike the most about our devaluation though is that so many people that post in this site resist organizing Shaman players to ask for significant change.  I have speculated there are SOE employees posting here in the guise of players, it has been so strongly worded.<br />
<br />
The list of class nerfs/ability sharing to other classes is legion.  Dating all the way back to our charm nerf, if anyone here actually remembers that.  Ok, so they have nerfed us out and shared away all our unique class abilites.  How about something new?  Well, really, I dont think we have seen anything significantly new since Focus, and that was what, 5 expansions ago counting GoD?<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, our debuffs made us critical to raiding guilds.  Now...lots of people can debuff, we just need to make sure we can MGB Focus.  Yes, that does describe a BOT more than a primary player class.  And yes, that does tend to lend more momentum to the concept of switching to BST.<br />
<br />
But this is just my opinion.  My opinion is strictly based on spending many years as a raiding shaman.  Living through all the changes.<br />
<br />
I made this post because I am weary of the continual class devaluation that comes with every expansion.  Because we have slipped not only from our one time position of very good class power, but to quite possibly below the very bottom tier.  But mostly because I am seeing once again how so many of you are unhappy with yet another offering of crap in a new expansion.....and so many more of you are all set to once again try to defuse the unhappiness and convince people it's all ok, that we're just fine, that we are superbly balanced.<br />
<br />
Do you still really believe this?  Once upon a time the shaman class united, and made some changes.  Remember the epic?  Honestly, take a good look at what you have got since Velious.  Look at how other classes have changed since Velious.  Think about it.  If you like it, ok.  I just disagree with you, but I won't try to convince you.  But if not, can you give some thought to trying to get something significantly new and useful for us?  Restore to the class some greater value than being a MGB Focus BOT?  Yes, perhaps a united voice is a lost cause.....but somehow I like trying better than laying down.<br />
<br />
Or we can just do nothing at all.  And it will just be how it is.</div></div><hr />

the boat is getting farther away from the dock, and few people realize we don't have a paddle.<br />
<br />
worse, a large percentage of the people who realize it, come back with something along the lines of &quot;Trust Sony&quot;.  that just makes me /cry.<br />
<br />
Sony has been able to successfully split the shaman community so that we are ineffective as a unit.  <br />

 I'd say the new slow line with the resist modifiers is EXACTLY what we complained about the most. SOE is answering, it just takes them a year or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not a long term player, been here about a year or so but have played my shaman into the elementals so i have at least seen some of the issues first hand. My point is that I came in after many of these nerfs took place, so I do not know life before the Beastlord, or mitigating slow, as examples.<br />
<br />
While I don't think it devalues my opinion I think it makes it harder for me to understand your frustrations. I enjoy playing my Shaman but am not naive enough to miss the fact that you old timers are angry and there must be a reason. <br />
<br />
How about the site admins do something radical here. Open a post that folks can nominate people for Shaman council. Then, after a week run a voting booth. One week passes and you can have your council. Those folks can prepare an outline of how the Shaman community feels as a whole and present it for edit.<br />
<br />
Then go ahead and pursue changes. We should be able to find a common ground, but open forum is not going to work. At least not from watching the boards for a long time.<br />
<br />
At least use this as a base for trying to set up a common voice before you cry &quot;F-off noob&quot;.<br />

It's guaranteed that nothing will happen if discussion continues to swirl pointlessly in different threads on the forum.  There are too many ideas buried in too many places for Sony to tease them out and take favorable action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find that statement to be a bit ridiculous.  Shaman are far from the bottom of the barrel.<br />
<br />
Raiding can be a big part of the game but not everybody raids and I don't think you can base the value of a class on one type of situation.  It seems like the only real serious complaint anyone ever makes about shaman is in regards to raiding - and even then it's usually something like, 'I cannot do this, but I can do this or this or this,' which indicates that as always, a resourceful shaman can find a way to contribute.<br />
<br />
What class really does anything amazing on a raid?  You have one MT, so all the rest of the tanks are just autoattacking...woopee.  Clerics are just gonna be healing...and probably in some kind of rotation - boy, that's thrilling.  Pet classes and nukers send their pets - and hope the critter isn't totally magic resistant reducing them to bystanders.  I have no clue what druids do...  It would seem that most classes have limited roles in raids only a few people in any given raid are really gonna have a truly significant role.  It would seem that if your raid force is so big that you have several shaman than it's more of a zerg than anything...<br />
<br />
And, yes, I would say that any class that can solo (with ease based on the tales posted here) in the elemental planes isn't very likely to be getting any kind of significant boost in power.  How many classes can solo the elemental planes with ease?  How do you boost a class in a significant way without making it more powerful as a soloist?<br />
<br />
In a normal xp group situation we have numerous possible roles.<br />
<br />
I think some folks that've seen everything and done everything 10x over are maybe just a bit bored, which leads to much more complaining and stating of unrealistic expectations on forums!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I definately haven't seen and done everything, but even I realize as a class we are falling significantly behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, the new slow line is exactly what many of us wanted and finally lends a gentle push of credibility to our &quot;king of the slow spells&quot; title.  It will have an interesting effect on raiding and grouping in DPS groups, but much of the focus is on DoTs.  I don't think the planned expansion really screws us as the crit DoTs, and the new DoT series (which I expect they will improve, hence the OK comment to follow) are OK, but show a total lack of understanding of what MOST of the shaman community really does.  Most of us nuke and heal when we're not out debuffing the MoBs of Norrath and our nukes have fallen even further behind everyone else's with this expansion.  MOST of us have little or no nead for another long term DoT.  I have very few beefs about these planned abilities and spells other than I'll never use them.  If I don't use them, I haven't gained anything and my class is further mitigated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well said Hurrk!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Face it, with the new expansion, and the tempted fate of putting the regen of what replaced stamina on shaman, they are delegating us to buff bots.  Now we have three functions on a riad<br />
<br />
1) MGB focus<br />
2) slow the mob<br />
3) regen the melees stamina<br />
<br />
This will do one of two things.<br />
<br />
1) with the limited amount of &quot;good playing&quot; shaman out there you will become a commodity to be wanted.<br />
<br />
or (the reality)<br />
<br />
2) people will make shaman bots and PL the hell out of them just so their raid can have the necessary buffs.<br />
<br />
Looking at the aa's every class gets something that makes them more unique, except us, we get jack and unless we as a community do something, like the warriors did, we are going to continue to be sold down the river.<br />
<br />
either way you feel, we need to be fixed, we used to be the jack of all trades, but with the upcoming aa's we are going to be a questionable use and the stigma of &quot;are you a bot or a real shaman&quot; will come up more often as with clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There are two main reasons preventing the shaman class from uniting.<br />
<br />
1. We don't know what we want<br />
<br />
Individually we know exactly what we want. Each and every one of us has an idea of how to improve the shaman class. However, the vast gear, experience, and play style differences among us make it impossible for us to form a consensus.<br />
<br />
The more experienced players cannot convince the less experienced players that they are right, because the only reason they can come up with is &quot;I know better than you, just listen to what I say&quot;. Obviously, that reason doesn't work so well, even though it has a grain of truth. Conversely, casual players accuse hard core players that their gear blinds them to what the shaman class truly needs. Again, obviously this reason isn't received well, but it also holds a grain of truth.<br />
<br />
What is the result? As collective, we are completely clueless.<br />
<br />
2. People don't know what they are talking about.<br />
<br />
There, I said it. I do not say this as an accusation, but as a fact. How many times have you read a post that in essence agrees with your point, and said to yourself &quot;I wish this person would shut up, because he's hurting my cause&quot; because the content of the post did not support the conclusion?<br />
<br />
There are many people out there with the passion for change, but are unable or unwilling to support their claims with facts. As a result, posts containing wild exaggerations and ridiculous claims abound on the Crucible these days. How can one hope garner support from the community with logic and reasons while surrounded by a horde of raving lunatics?<br />
<br />
3. What do we do to fix it?<br />
<br />
I have no idea.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ok, that's not entirely true. I just don't see any reason to use the time and effort to come up with a solution at this point.</div></div><hr />

Woody is a druid.  ANYTHING he says about shamans is suspect.  <br />

Do you really agree with his comic...that shamans were the biggest whiners of EQ in December of 2002?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">1) MGB focus<br />

3) regen the melees stamina<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think part of the problem stems from the idea that we're somehow entitled to do more than those 3 things.  The way I see it, Everquest is ultimately a very simple game.  Nobody really has much of anything to do at a raid.  What does a rogue do?  Stand behind something, hit autoattack and press their backstab hotkey for 5 minutes.  What does a wizard do?  Hit their highest nuke every 30 seconds so they don't get turned into a splat on the wall.  What does a druid do?  Nothing! Haha, but seriously, they heal and do some damage.  Everybody is a one trick pony at a raid, its the combination of tricks between different classes that makes things at all interesting.  <br />
<br />
<br />
We MGB focus, slow and debuff the target, and then spot heal and toss on what dps we can.  That seems like a fair shake to me.  My complaint is the same as many other folks here: most of our abilities are arguably no longer of the same quality as other classes.  If you're bored of your EQ niche, thats probably more because EQ is really kind of a boring game in a lot of ways than a problem with the niche itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>garilore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I definately haven't seen and done everything, but even I realize as a class we are falling significantly behind.<br />
<br />
I am in the same boat.  I have only been playing EQ for a little over a year and just got my Shaman to lvl 65.  I have been more and more frustrated as I leveled past 50.  <br />
<br />
Where I was once the 2cd best healer in the game, after the mid 50's I become a very lame third.  I would like to see us be at least on par with druid heals.<br />
<br />
Currently, I spend more time canabalizing myself than I do actually casting spells.  Don't know what the answer to this one is.<br />
<br />
My combat abilities are a joke.  I have maxed out my pierce, 1hb and offense and still if I can get one hit to land in HoH I consider myself lucky.  I don't know what SOE has done to cause this but I would like to be able to hit the mobs occasionally.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the only ability that we have as a class is that of Slow, but we also share that with necros and chanters.  I understand that each class shares certain abilities with other classes but why is it that Shaman have nothing that is uniquely ours.  I am really tired of feeling that the only reason I am there is to cast focus and slow.  Heck, I almost was kicked out of a group yesterday because I didn't have FA yet!  <br />
<br />
Personally, I often don't see the reason for having a shaman in a good group.  The mobs die to quick for us to use our dots.  We are the worst healers in the game.  Chanters and BSTs can slow almost as good as we can.  Our DD is slow, mana inefiecient and low damage.  What is left for us to do?  The only decent thing that I have seen for me since I started was Bane, but that takes 650 adv pts in a theme that noone wants to go in.  <br />
<br />
I would love to see some of this changed...I just don't know how to do it.  Point me in the direction and I am there.  I love my shaman and have spent lots of time playing him up to 65.  I was never PL'd and never twinked, so I have a special love of the class and can't stand to see them passed up yet again.</div></div><hr />

That's right.  No matter how hard I tried to steer the conversations (while I was a moderator) toward things that were actually beneficial to our class and maybe even feasible  everyone insisted on talking about all these marginal things.<br />
<br />
Well, you guys got what you asked for, a negative MR slow... and so did everyone else.  This is a net decrease in power for shamans...again.  Who knows, maybe we will get some gimped double attack to make up for it, everyone asked for that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Druids united, made a big long thread with lots of bold text and numbers and stuff, and they got damn near every ****ing item on the list.<br />
<br />
Warriors got every other class to complain about them, and got something pretty decent (now fix the damn MM dagger proc to not overwrite it  :mad: <br />
<br />
We need to decide on something, and fast. Right now, The only valid concerns are the following two:<br />
<br />
1) Reduce Marginalization of our enhanced mana generation,<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
2) Give us a method of dealing damage that supports the above.<br />
<br />
Solutions:<br />
<br />
1) Either reduce the mana cost for stuff we cast, add resist modifiers (or an innate malisement AA), or increase the Effect. Very simple.<br />
<br />
2) a DoT spell that drains mana as it deals damage would be cool, in that it ends when the mob dies. There could be an initial mana cost to get it going, and you could choose when to stop it from going.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Increase the length of fights significantly, and jack up the experience accordingly.<br />
<br />
Double attack and bash wouldn't hurt either ^_^</div></div><hr />

I think this is the most sailent point here.  Playing in elemental/time armor is very different from bazaar gear.  but, even a naked shaman with 300 AA's will fare so much better than naked shaman with 50 or 100 AA's that it isnt even worth comparing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">To be honest I don't think shaman ever really had a class identity. They were effectively the &quot;total melee support package&quot; for those races that didn't have priests and chanters. Torpor / Canni is effectively our version of KEI (why would we need a group one? the rest of the race classes are going to be melee). The class power is almost entirely connected to the fact that slow proved to be brokenly powerful and to become ever more powerful as mobs scale.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe the shaman class needs a substantial re-design. The class goal and spells are a bit of a mess and lack identity. In addition with more mana regen and SoE trying to reduce the power of slow (which they need to) our old advantages continue to ablate.</div></div><hr />

You're not the only one that's tried Henora.  I think an organization of the beneficial upgrades to the class, either in the form of a multi post poll (first poll=most desired upgraded, 2nd poll=second most desired upgrade etc), a regular post with constant editing, or whatever, would take a sticky of some sort to get off the ground. If people cant organize on that-- then our fate will and deserves to lie in Sonys hands.<br />

 I'd say the new slow line with the resist modifiers is EXACTLY what we complained about the most. SOE is answering, it just takes them a year or two.<br />
<br />
What new slow line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm not gonna analyze the AA list offered for us in GoD.  I won't do it for new spells either.  However, I think its kinda clear the shaman devaluation continues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed, although it isn't clear other classes really get much out of GoD either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps what I dislike the most about our devaluation though is that so many people that post in this site resist organizing Shaman players to ask for significant change.  I have speculated there are SOE employees posting here in the guise of players, it has been so strongly worded.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think a lot of this comes from the fact that when I turn around and look at clerics and druids, no matter how much they give them, I *still* feel like the most powerful class.  I know clerics and druids heal and nuke a lot better (and the gap is widening), but I still feel like DoTs, slow, and insane mana regen make shaman the best of the three classes.  Am I living in the past or denial?  Maybe.  I haven't done parses to see how my damage stacks up to the other two.  But I've played both druid and cleric, and soloing alone imo gives us the edge over clerics in terms of 'fun'... druid is tougher; they may be as good/better than shammies now.  I don't know.<br />
<br />
<br />
The list of class nerfs/ability sharing to other classes is legion.  Dating all the way back to our charm nerf, if anyone here actually remembers that.  Ok, so they have nerfed us out and shared away all our unique class abilites.  How about something new?  Well, really, I dont think we have seen anything significantly new since Focus, and that was what, 5 expansions ago counting GoD?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, this is something of an exaggeration.  Luclin gave us Canni5, PoP gave us pet swarm, dots that don't break root, knockback root, and radiant cure.  And, love it or hate it, LoY gave us a unique thing in Blood of Nadox.<br />
<br />
But I see your point and somewhat agree with it.  I think that shamans were quite overpowered compared to clr/dru around the time of Luclin.  With PoP, I think they were so concerned about the shaman mana regen power that they really swung the nerf bat hard, going overboard merely by *not* giving us a good cold nuke (among other things).  That fear (that shamans are overpowered) seems to continue to this day... they're afraid to give us anything good because of our mana regen.  All they'd have to do is make it cost a ton to balance it, too (e.g. 1200 nuke for 500 mana).  <br />
<br />
We also had to deal with the introduction of the BST, which devalued us somewhat.  But I still think a well-geared shm owns a well-geared bst.  Their dps is actually pretty close (when doing nothing but), and the shaman can solo things the beast can't dream of doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, our debuffs made us critical to raiding guilds.  Now...lots of people can debuff, we just need to make sure we can MGB Focus.  Yes, that does describe a BOT more than a primary player class.  And yes, that does tend to lend more momentum to the concept of switching to BST.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would add nadox to that list of critical things shaman do, but yeah, that isn't much (only a few fights here and there), and it's not like other classes can't cure, too (although a bit less effectively).<br />
  <br />
<br />
I made this post because I am weary of the continual class devaluation that comes with every expansion.  Because we have slipped not only from our one time position of very good class power, but to quite possibly below the very bottom tier.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree with this, though... maybe you're just depressed about GoD (and I don't blame you).  But shaman were near the top of the game around Velious.  Now they've slipped to somewhere in the middle.  But no way are they near the bottom.  They're still a supremely flexible class (solo well, get groups easy).  I think it's mainly our raid importance that has been diminished so far, and, as a raiding shaman, you feel that very acutely.<br />
<br />
<br />
But mostly because I am seeing once again how so many of you are unhappy with yet another offering of crap in a new expansion.....and so many more of you are all set to once again try to defuse the unhappiness and convince people it's all ok, that we're just fine, that we are superbly balanced.<br />
<br />
Do you still really believe this?  Once upon a time the shaman class united, and made some changes.  Remember the epic?  Honestly, take a good look at what you have got since Velious.  Look at how other classes have changed since Velious.  Think about it.  If you like it, ok.  I just disagree with you, but I won't try to convince you.  But if not, can you give some thought to trying to get something significantly new and useful for us?  Restore to the class some greater value than being a MGB Focus BOT?  Yes, perhaps a united voice is a lost cause.....but somehow I like trying better than laying down.<br />
<br />
Or we can just do nothing at all.  And it will just be how it is.<br />
<br />
I think the first step would be, as others have noted, to agree on what we'd actually want.  A lot of the problem is that shammies can do so many things... it's hard to pick which one of them to pick to improve upon.  <br />
<br />
Even improving our pets (the approach Sony has taken with GoD) doesn't have to be a bad idea, but if they were going to go that route, why not go all out?  Give us a better pet, a new pet spell, make them dual wield innately, give a dps upgrade, etc.  Otherwise, those upgrades are pointless.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think shaman nukes being so close to rangers' is just stupid; 925 is way too low, especially if clerics/chanters get new nukes in GoD.  925 was a kneejerk/overkill number, and doing things like putting Spear of Torment focus on elemental gloves didn't help.  Our nuking is a little (not a lot, but a little) below where it should be.  <br />
<br />
Any sort of upgrade to canni/slow/cripple would have been nice, although let's face it: upgrading cripple wouldn't be some huge change (though so many seem to clamor for it).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I *do* think the GoD aas look pretty miserable, but I take some comfort in the fact they look miserable for lots of other classes, too.  I still think shaman is a great class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Right now there are 2 sets of problems.  First is the in-game problem: Shaman upgrades are marginal, and the class is being marginalized.  The second is the in-forum problem: People don't believe there is a first problem.<br />
<br />
I'll address them in the other order, because if we don't think there is a problem, we can't even talk about fixing it.<br />
<br />
Shaman who aren't in elemental+ gear and guilds say things like:<br />
<br />
And, yes, I would say that any class that can solo (with ease based on the tales posted here) in the elemental planes isn't very likely to be getting any kind of significant boost in power. How many classes can solo the elemental planes with ease? How do you boost a class in a significant way without making it more powerful as a soloist?<br />
<br />
But the problem is that almost all casters can solo Fire (nothing summons - its no harder than soloing Velious mobs, just longer).  And no one, shaman included, can solo the other 3.  I think a lot of folks have missed that point, but to reiterate ... the reason we can solo redcons in the back of Fire is one reason and one reason alone.  They do not summon.  That's it, has nothing to do with the power of slow, or our amazing dps ... anyone with root (or snare) can do it.<br />
<br />
And, sure, there ARE things we can solo that others probably can't, like Zelnithak in Umbral Plains.  However, the &quot;wow, that's old content&quot; argument aside, we cannot do so -efficiently-.  Being able to take 2 hours to solo a mob does not indicate the strength of a class.  For a class to be strong, it needs to do things in a useful setting - either grouped or on raids, and in a timely manner.  If your measure of greatness for a class is what you can solo given infinite time, PLEASE do not take part in the discussion; your values are not in line with Sony's, and your opinions will confuse the issues - no offense.<br />
<br />
Instead, we will look at how the shaman compare to the other priest classes, to beastlords, and in some cases to other classes.<br />
<br />
1) Mass Group Buff utility.<br />
Having a mid-combat useful MGB option is important, because it allows multiple members of a class to have a valuable contribution.  This works to counteract marginalization - specifically, it works to ensure that more than 1 of a class is useful for a raid.<br />
<br />
Clerics have Ethereal Elixir.  Druids have Protection of Wood.  Beastlords have Paragon of Spirit.  Shaman do not have a equivelent.<br />
<br />
2) Healing<br />
Since the dawn of Everquest, the 3 wis casters have been the masters of healing.  Clerics, by nature, are the superior healers; we have no right to compete thus.  <br />
<br />
CLASS....................FAST heal/LARGE heal<br />
Cleric.....................2750/7500<br />
Druid......................1750/4680<br />
Paladin....................850/900*<br />
Shaman..................1300/1950<br />
*group heal<br />
<br />
As it stands, we are distinctly third in the healing race, with paladins reasonably close, and circumstantially preferable.<br />
<br />
3) Direct damage<br />
While not intended to be a strong point of the shaman class, the issues involved in dots and the speed of PoP events makes direct damage valuable.<br />
<br />
3A) Standard nukes.<br />
<br />
CLASS....................Damage/Mana (Efficiency)<br />
Cleric.....................1100/365 (3.01)<br />
Druid......................1550/390 (3.97)<br />
Enchanter...............1100/300 (3.67)<br />
Ranger....................610/220 (2.77)<br />
Shaman..................925/300 (3.08)<br />
<br />
Again, of the priest classes, we are decidedly third, and are not far ahead of the frontrunner hybrid class.  Additionally, we are greatly eclipsed by Enchanters, a class formerly referred to as a &quot;low-dps&quot; class, and for which direct damage is also not meant to be a primary focus.<br />
<br />
3B) Non-standard nukes<br />
Rains have proven to be a reasonable source of damage for shaman.  However, our rains are still not particularly viable.<br />
<br />
Considered as if it were a standard nuke, a 3x 650/450 rain provides 4.33 efficiency.  However, maximally efficient rains are rare.  More commonly, onyl 2 of the 3 waves will hit, and this also serves to better approximate the more limited situations in which the spells are available.  This equates to a 1300/450 nuke, with a 2.89 efficiency.  In other words, unless all 3 waves of the rain land, our best rain is in fact a poorer mana-to-damage ratio than our nuke!  To its credit, it is more time efficient, which is why it still gets used.<br />
<br />
Certianly some people will take umbrage to the means by which I considered the rain damage.  That said, a justifiable direct comparison would be to compare our special-situation direct damage to other special-situation direct damage (such as undead nukes).<br />
<br />
CLASS....................Damage/Mana (Efficiency)<br />
Cleric.....................1200/300 (4.00) (undead)<br />
Druid......................1200/300 (4.00) (summoned)<br />
Shaman..................1950/450 (4.33) (rain)<br />
<br />
We do thus have the highest damage and efficiency use-restricted nuke among the priests.  However, as noted above, the damage (and thus efficiency) of our use-restricted nuke is questionable.  Whether or not there are sufficient undead/summoned mobs available to warrant the other classes' nukes is not an issue that I am prepared to discuss here.  Regardless, the net result is that our lead here, as it stands, is a small one.<br />
<br />
4) HP Buffs<br />
Buffing is an essential part of this class, regardless of its potential to relegate shaman to bot-status.  Because of the current state of equipment, the only buffs that make a significant impact are +hp buffs (and, to a lesser extent +ATK buffs)<br />
<br />
CLASS....................+HP buff<br />
Cleric......................1405* <br />
Druid.......................618<br />
Shaman...................544<br />
Paladin....................330<br />
*or 910, stacks with druid.<br />
<br />
Even at this, our purported strength, we are third among the priest classes, with a hybrid not far behind.<br />
<br />
We do not even perform well in regards to other, less directly valuable buffs.  We have a +55% movement speed buff.  Rangers get +60%.  Druids get +65%.  Shaman -do- have the best poison and disease resist buffs in game, but the quality of that buff is lower than the equivelent spells received by other classes.  Talisman of the Tribunal is +65 pr/dr.  Protection of Seasons is +72 fr/cr.  Guard of Druzzil is +75 mr.<br />
<br />
5) What else is there?<br />
Well, despite all the complaints in that regard, we DO have the best slow.  Malos is the best broad-spectrum debuffer.  Quiescence fills a niche role for sustainable heal-over-time.  However, these should not be used to justify our huge shortcomings across the board in other areas, because they are matched by other, equivelent effects.  We have slow, true - but druids have snare, and clerics stun; all these are mob management effects, and each class is the best at their particular one.  But beyond this, there is a clear conclusion ... slow (especially in the era where it is no longer uniquely tied to shaman), malos, and quiescence are insufficient to justify the number of key feature in which shaman are 3rd among 3.  &quot;But you have slow&quot; is simply inadequate compensation.  In Kunark, certainly.  Post-PoP, no - and doubly so because this &quot;key&quot; spell that seems to hold back out other spell progression dates back from the very first expansion.  We are the only class that still depends on a Kunark spell on a daily basis, with no possible upgrade.*<br />
<br />
*Wizard fans will note that Concussion is a Kunark spell, and the only generally available wizard de-aggro spell.  However, despite its relative scarcity, there IS an extant upgrade, Ancient: Greater Concussion.  That's not a viable upgrade for most wizards, but it does exist.  Shaman do not possess even this option.<br />
<br />
6) Where to go from here?<br />
<br />
It is difficult to say.  I could set my opinions about the relative priority of these problems, and which ones I would prefer shaman to be boosted in, but another player would likely view them differently.  In the end, it IS up to Sony, like it or not, to dictate the balance between the classes in this manner.  It might behoove us to propose specific spells to &quot;fix&quot; some of the inequities; it might not.  At a minimum, I would posit that we should demonstrate our unified support in the desire for SOME change, that our dissatisfaction is not that druids heal better or that enchanters nuke better, but that our ire is drawn instead from the volume and consistency with with we are supplanted and marginalized.  That, more than anything is how to unify the shaman community.  It might not get us the exact change each of us would want - but at this point, a rally for change in and of itself is perhaps our last, best motivating force.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, very impressive!  The one flaw I see is in the hp buff comparison.  The fact that the focus line stacks with other hps buffs puts it in a seperate catagory.  Its more of a supplementary hp buffs as opposed to the ac/hp buffs of cleric and druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well, thou I am fairly new to the forms i am not new to the class, i have a 65 shammy w/ epic, and i have seen an experienced many of the problems i read about, heres my take on the problems and possible solutions<br />
<br />
Problems<br />
<br />
1) Why have a shaman in your group when u can have a Beastlord, thier DPS is 10x better and thier slow is only 10% beind and even if it does get resisted they are melee anyway so them getting agro doesnt mean instant death...<br />
<br />
2) Our healing powers are only used as back up cuz they simply dont heal enough fast enough...<br />
<br />
3) &quot;Hey we have the malise line of spells!&quot;..yup so do mages..and chanters have Tash<br />
<br />
4) Haha! our Poison DoTs and Disease Long term DoTs may not be so hot cuz the enemy gets dropped so fast, thank god i have Bane!  <br />
 ---you begin casting Bane---<br />
 ---Your Bane was resisted---<br />
 DAMN!!, someone wake me up when its cool down is over<br />
<br />
5) SoW was cool till the higher lvls, when everyone has Innate run 3 or SoE<br />
<br />
6) Soandso tells you,'Hey can u MGB Fot7 for us?'<br />
    you tell Soandso,' Sure, lemme mem it'<br />
    Soandso tells you ,' bah nvm, ill just have my twinked shaman alt do it, he already has it up, u can go home now, thankz ;-)'<br />
    you tell Soandso,' I see....'<br />
<br />
7) Well even thou my slow is only a hair better then everyone elses..I still have my AoE slow! <br />
 ---you begin casting Tirgirs insects---<br />
 ---Everything u casted it on resisted, sorry, better just tell the BL to get em, better luck next time kiddo---<br />
 ---The stuff u casted on just killed you, loading bind point---<br />
 <br />
okay those seem to be the most apperant problems, here are some ideas i feel could help shaman become balanced again<br />
<br />
1) F. Avatar is nice but the fact that it only can hit one person at a time and has a nasty cool down makes it...not as effective..I'd Like to see Group based Avatar that mabye isnt as strong, but can be tgb'd, this might help give us a reason to stick around on raids now =p<br />
<br />
2) this problem with our slows only bein slightly better cannot really be helped...we cant nerf the others, not amp ours up cuz..90% slow is a lil nutz, id like to see a slow that would slow 71%(to beat chanters), Do some form of cripple, and a weak snare or mabye even a root<br />
<br />
3) AoE Malo id think would be fun...then our AoE Slow may be more effective<br />
<br />
4) an AA that would enhance DoTs so that, if the DoT did not deal full damage by the time the mob is almost dead, u could click a lil AA ability that would remove the DoT from the mob ad deal 3/4 of whatever damage the DoT had left to do in DD form<br />
<br />
5) Somthing like canni3 at lvl 64 , that is targetable, its seems SoE likes to spread the joy of originally unique ideas to another class so, if we could get a way to twitch mana via a targetable canni, we might be a lil more wanted in that respect, or if this is a no can do i think they should re do acumen so instead of Sta regen which they took off, it gives a slight bit of mana regen or mabye adds to mana pool<br />
<br />
6) or mabye we just cant really keep a good hold on slow advantage anymore so add something new, a Curse type spell that would, as long as the target is effected by it, give the target a % chance of MISSING whatever he has agro on, such as at 44 we get 5%, 54 15%, and 65 25%<br />
<br />
7) as for nukes..im not gonna touch that topic...Id rather the DoT recall idea than a 1200/350 nuke, then we would just start steaming off the wizzies<br />
<br />
Well, those are my ideas, if i had to pick one i favored the most it would have to be the % chance of missing thing....naturally i believe it should havea considerable cool doown time and cost enough mana so u cant kep blasting mindlessly with it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Thats the best post ive seen so far..... Great Job Shabura. This is exactly what soe needs to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">As far as DoTs go since we know they can do effects per tic, and relay the information to the person casting the DoT. Why can't they take off a portion of the dots mana for tic. Instead of spending all 490 mana for bane when you cast it they take off 82 mana for tic. If mob dies before DoT runs its corse we didn't waste a bunch of mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen! LOL<br />
 <br />
To further add to the mud present in this post, I would like to add my own bits to the wishlist: better tanking and at least some melee ability.<br />
<br />
Useless for raiding, I know, but I think this is one area that we could collectively (1) agree needs to be improved, and (2) realistically have a chance of actually getting.<br />
<br />
Rabid bear would seem to have so much potential, if only we could get a little love on the reuse time and such...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, that's a non-issue.  Kazaad stacks with Nine with Focus with BSS.  While Virtue is the more impressive 1k+ hp, its -actually- that second cleric number that's the real problem.  I won't even get into the fact that the druid buff is both +hp and +mana regen, while STILL being more +hp than ours.</div></div><hr />

I dont think that the comparison here is out of line; the Brells paladin line, rangers Tunare line, and beastlords vigor line are all comparable to each other as supplemental buffs, due to there relatively low amount buffed, and the supplemental benefits that they provide. Focus on the other hand is a considerable hit point buff, and in some groups may be the only hit point buff available. The stat boost is somewhat lackluster and not as useful as the effects from the other high end buffs (IE high Ac boost and mana regen).<br />
I think a truer buff comparsion should be made not just of higher end buffs (Focus7, HoV, PoT9) with the level 60 buffs, which they are supposed to be upgrades of; Focus clearly isnt that much of an upgrade in comparison, and as I said before, the stat bost is somewhat lackluster, especially in the high end game. <br />
Focus doesnt necessarily need to be &quot;fixed&quot; per say, but I do think that it does need something to make it more appealing than a stackable hit point buff.</div></div><hr />

Copy Shabura's post and send it to SoE.  Please add my shaman's name for support.  <br />
<br />
And Shabura - there are very few long posts that I will read word for word.  I read your's twice - then logged on and checked some things out.  I can now safely say I am more dissatisfied than I was 45 minutes ago.<br />
<br />
Also, I am editing my sig to include ... &quot;GoD does exist, and he hates shaman!&quot;  That is truly a classic.<br />
<br />
And for those that think we should check other boards and see the whines there .. what for?  I don't play another class.  I didn't spend 4 years as Lori, sweating through tradeskills, sitting on the darn ships learning languages, waiting on long long lists in High Keep and Sol and Cazic Thule in the old days, grinding aa's in BoT or Tactics, going brain dead working to get the VT key, adventuring in LDoN or  raiding, raiding with more raiding .... so I could become a buff bot.<br />
<br />
One of the few things that keeps me in the game is the virtual kommunity of friends I have.  Delegate me to buff bot and you have taken away the last iota of what brings me to eq. <br />
<br />
Actually, now that I think about it ... what BUFF BOT?  On any given day, any given time, I could go to PoK, ooc &quot;MGB fot7 at nexus stone in 5 minutes&quot;.  have  a fairly nice group there ready for the mgb, and then see in ooc &quot;MGB HOV behind Bank in 1 minute&quot; ... and watch that group disappear.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Very nice post, Shabura - can't be said often enough  :) .<br />
<br />
Two remarks:<br />
<br />
1. Personally i would like to include Heal over Times as part of the healing comparison (at least for the 65 crowd with Q and it is a solid strength of the cleric class). This will lower the difference between shaman and druids a bit, but isn't sufficient to close the gap in the big heal department of course.<br />
<br />
2. Regarding your point about shaman dependant on good old slow, clerics are in the same boat somehow with their CH. Both spells can be too powerful and both are closely interacting with basic game mechanics and encounters. So you can't change them easily and every change in those mechanics effect the usage/usefulness of such spells directly.<br />
<br />
Note that at least Clerics got some fun tools for their core ability (through AAs, f.e. DA) and SoE tried to give them a bit different perspective with hammers - though you could argue, how successful that move was in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Threads with really good posts always attract the trolls. <br />
<br />
Heres the classes I play or occasionally play and what I think of their current states:<br />
<br />
Shaman - needs the most help as they've fallen significantly behind others and changes to slow have signifcantly reduced the one true advantage we ever had. <br />
<br />
Cleric - Personally I think they are just fine. I get bugged to group with my cleric all the time, they can put out respecatable DPS through melee+nuke, and they have some really nice extras like spell haste.<br />
<br />
Monk - Still could use a little help, I don't think the melee rework is done yet though. Looks like they getting some ok AA in GoD that might up their DPS a bit.<br />
<br />
Enchanter - About the only thing I'd ask for at all for a chanter would be single target C3-C5. Charm is still overpowered. <br />
<br />
Mage - Got slapped hard by pet canni change. If the new GoD pet AA's increase DPS enough for pet I think they will be square again.<br />
<br />
Druid - Don't see any problems at all in druid land. Yah their GoD AA's really suck too, but they didn't really need any help to begin with. Great healing with great DPS (insane DPS with any animals around to charm). <br />
<br />
So no, I'm not a whiny little 10 year old. I play a lot of high level classes and can take a reasonable view of what they need IMO. Shaman are falling behind the progression of all the others. I still would have put pure melee ahead last month, but if they go through with the rest of the changes I think they'll finally be getting put back up where they are supposed to be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">A couple ideas...in no particular order, and just for kicks.  When we said &quot;hey, we don't like front end loaded dot's&quot;  SOE took the front end DD off.  When we said &quot;hey, that nadox spell is the same thing as disinfecting aura&quot; they changed it to a group version.  In short, I think they need specifics, not generalities.<br />
<br />
So, here's a couple things that stay in our realm of expertise, that would be pretty easy to implement, and that address some of the issues raised in this thread:<br />
<br />
1. Group Q (MGB-able)<br />
2. Resist adjusted slow (in the pipe, it looks like)<br />
3. Bigger/expensive nuke (cause its fun)<br />
4. Group F Avatar<br />
5. Bigger direct heal, upgrade to the mini CH.  I don't think any shaman uses the mini-ch we have now.<br />
6. Proc for Spot (to borrow from the BL's)<br />
7. Chance to crit dots (in the pipe as an AA)<br />
8. Some kind of de-aggro spell/ability<br />
9. Fixed duration self only invis<br />
10. Workable/Useful Rabid Bear<br />
11. Long duration SOW, SOE-ish long.  No upgrade to a level 9 spell is embarassing.<br />
12  Endurance regen (in the pipe, as an AA ability)<br />
13. Something to use our endurance bar on, just because we have one</div></div><hr />

#11 has long be a sore spot with me.  We get it before Druids yet never get a workable upgrade.  They (Druids) get upgrades to Sow like SoE or the wolf line (faster then Sow)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously, I have read most every post regarding class balance, and  I have tried my hardest to understand the many parses done.  I have only been playing my Shaman for under a year as a casual player, but in that time I have seen other classes excel in ability and capability, while we stay relatively stagnate.  I'm not just talking of our ability to solo - but our usefulness in a group scenario in general as well.  I have no raid experience so I will leave those comments to those more qualified.<br />
<br />
I also agree that if there is to be any hope for our class to remain a viable contribution to the game, we need to make a concerted effort to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">That was a wierd post Bonestomper.  Some weird way of gear stroking?  Ok.....<br />
<br />
Anyway, shaman have diminished in power/role.  That's a good thing in many respects because it should stop the flood of bazaar baby max-min power gamers.  <br />
<br />
What I see as lost is the vision on dps.  Now, it's considered sophisticated to say, &quot;we're not a dps class&quot;.  Like hell.  When we used to lay out ebolt, that was all about dps baby.  It had impact; that was cool.  <br />
<br />
Also pre-Kunark, our best nuke was roughly half the best wizard nuke.  Now, wizard nuking power is so far greater it's not in the same universe.  Obviously they should nuke a lot better, but the concept that only some classes should be &quot;dps&quot; classes is a bad concept, and it's weird that so many players have apparently bought into it.  Even warriors for christ sake, and that's just pathetic.  <br />
<br />
I wish we had some effective dps ability.  I don't care about more buffing power.  <br />
<br />
The disparity in the ability to produce dps is what has changed the most.<br />
<br />

<br />
While the tone is off, in essence I agree that shaman remain a powerful and viable class.  There is a lot of complaining, although it's understandable to an extent.  I just don't care for how our role has evolved too much.  I guess I want a 1500 nuke.  :)<br />
<br />

oh, we can still do a lot of damage, it just takes half an hour.<br />
<br />
as to the gear comment, shaman are played so many different ways due to gear and racial specific gear that perhaps there is no correct way to play.  but whereas we think of ourselves as the Jack-of-all trades, the EQ site uses that exact description for Bards; and not us.<br />
<br />
i would rather have someone with the inferences i get on their playstyle, like i get by looking at your gear, talk about the future of shaman; than i would someone that i think might be sitting in the back with the druids in an experience group.  because those people are prepared to off tank a mob, or spot heal, or nuke, or root park, or whatever.  but i don't want the shaman voice to be someone that when i look at their gear i don't see the utility potential that we have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are not specialists.  This is our strength and our weakness, and while I agree that we need SOME kind of power-up, I am at the same time very glad that there isn't anything so glaringly wrong with us that it's obvious to everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Zerrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">After much thought, I've come up with what I'd like to see for shaman in the future. Given past upgrades we've gotten, I think this is something that would follow in the same form as past spell upgrades for shaman. Also this addresses the lack of dot/debuff slots on raid mobs. I'd love to get a better heal, or dot, but in the case that doesnt happen, I think a new slow upgrade would be feasible.<br />
<br />
In the past, we had, talisman of Kragg for HP buffs:<br />
<br />
Talisman of Kragg  <br />
1:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 365 (L55) to 395 (L65) <br />
2:  Increase HP when cast by 365 (L55) to 395 (L65) <br />
<br />
And it was a pain in the ass to have to cast dex and strength on some tanks, and buff slots became scarce. We got Focus of Spirit, which included Dex and Str, and it was good.<br />
 <br />
Focus of Spirit  <br />
1:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 405 (L60) to 420 (L65) <br />
2:  Increase HP when cast by 405 (L60) to 420 (L65) <br />
4:  Increase STR by 67 <br />
5:  Increase DEX by 60 <br />
 <br />
<br />
Now, we have a much upgraded version of this, focus of the seventh.<br />
<br />
Focus of the Seventh <br />
1:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 544 <br />
2:  Increase HP when cast by 544 <br />
4:  Increase STR by 75 <br />
5:  Increase DEX by 70 <br />
 <br />
My thoughts, are, that a crippling slow would be much preferable to the short duration one that is slated for us in GoD. It would combine the spell cripple, and Turgur's Insects into 1, thus saving a dot/debuff slot, which have become scarcer on raids these days, and it would save the shaman time in xp groups by not having to cast Cripple after slowing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crippling Slow <br />
1:  Decrease Attack Speed by 66% (L51) to 75% (L60) <br />
2:  Increase Disease Counter by 16 <br />
3:  Decrease DEX by 58 (L53) to 70 (L65) <br />
4:  Decrease AGI by 68 (L53) to 80 (L65) <br />
5:  Decrease STR by 68 (L53) to 80 (L65) <br />
6:  Decrease AC by 30 (L53) to 34 (L65) <br />
<br />
Mana: 300 <br />
Skill: Alteration <br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Recast Time: 6 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.25 <br />
Resist: Magic <br />
Range: 200 <br />
Location: Any <br />
Time of Day: <br />
Target Type: Single <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental <br />
Classes: SHM/61 <br />
Duration: 5.1 mins @L51 to 6.5 mins @L65 <br />
 <br />
I've noticed cripple wont take hold on some mobs in Ldon, so perhaps it could be similar to the Enchanter line of nukes, in that, the spell would be 2 part, the slow will land, and the cripple might be resisted.<br />
<br />
No idea, if anyone else would find it useful, but, heres hoping for feedback <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Since its been brought up....<br />
<br />
Compare:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
1:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 544 <br />
2:  Increase HP when cast by 544 <br />
4:  Increase STR by 75 <br />
5:  Increase DEX by 70 <br />
Mana: 1800<br />
<br />
Paladin (Pally can also symbol if you have no Cleric for another 640hp)<br />
Brell's Stalwart Shield<br />
Increase Max Hitpoints by 330<br />
Mana: 250<br />
<br />
Ranger (Can also cast Naturskin for another 391)<br />
1:  Increase ATK by 60  <br />
4:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 125 <br />
Mana: 250<br />
<br />
Beastlord (BL can also cast Talisman of Kragg which stacks and is 395 hp more)<br />
Spiritual Vigor<br />
1:  Increase ATK by 40 <br />
4:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 225 <br />
Mana: 250 <br />
<br />
Druid<br />
Blessing of the Nine <br />
1:  Increase AC by 32 <br />
2:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 618 <br />
3:  Increase HP when cast by 618 <br />
4:  Increase Mana by 8 per tick <br />
Mana: 1700<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
Hand of Virtue<br />
2:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 1405 <br />
3:  Increase HP when cast by 1405 <br />
4:  Increase AC by 72 <br />
Mana: 2500<br />
<br />
<br />
So in comaprison not even looking at the outrageous mana cost we have to pay for it....<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Brell alone is right behind us at 330hp to our 544.<br />
Considering that stats have diminishing returns after 255 (huge diminish too) The str and dex are about worthless even for those not in Elementals where the melee are capped anyway.<br />
214hp difference is not much considering they also have another hp buff they can use even if it does have stacking issues.<br />
Our hp buffs do not stack with themselves Pally hp buffs DO.<br />
<br />
Ranger<br />
I think the Ranger hp buff with its attack bonus is pretty much ok in comparision by itself. But considering they also have Naturskin to cast when a Druid or Cleric is not available I think that is a bit of a problem.<br />
Again their hp buffs at least stack with each other ours do not.<br />
Not overpowering but still there. Do not feel this a major issue.<br />
<br />
Beastlord<br />
between Vigor and Kragg then add in Spiritual Dominion and Ferocity they efectively buff way better than a Shaman. Stats are useless. They get 2 hp buffs that stack and a mana regen. The only advantage we have to that is we only have 1 buff slot used up. Can5? Great for me but I cant give mana to the whole group now can I? Now if they added a mana dump to us that might actually balance in the mana regen stuff.<br />
Still though just looking at the hp buffs we lose.<br />
Not even looking at their does attack.... which really is much better than str/dex.<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
No comparison here really Bot9 may have stacking issues with Virtue but combines with Symbol for even better hp and it has mana regen.<br />
Also I wont complain about it really. It does sort of balance in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
Again no comparison.<br />
Also no huge complaints.<br />
The only thing you can really say is they got a bigger upgrade they we did. That doesnt make them wrong or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall we get outbuffed by BL, Pally are too close and situationally better especially if you have a Druid over a Cleric for a healer.<br />
Stat buffs are pretty much useless is the overall problem.<br />
The other problem is others hp buffs might have stacking issues with others but ours do not stack with themselves.<br />
Theirs combine to make better use.<br />
<br />
My solution to balance all that?<br />
Add attack to Focus (or even better combine Focus and Avatar leaving focuses duration) and make it either more hp itself or make it stack with Kragg an that whole line... Last part doesnt make much sense but it would fix the hp problem.<br />
I dont think there would be any doubt that even with stats being fairly useless a focus with 140 attack and say 140 to agi/str/dex stats with Fo7 duration would  rock and it kills 2 birds with 1 stone.<br />
Then again we have been complaining about this since before PoP was released so its not like they are really going to fix that.<br />
<br />
Do I want a mana dump? Heck no...<br />
Would it fix the fact that our mana regen is self only when all others are GROUP regen? Maybe not and it would impeach a bit on SK and Necros but I dont really see a better solution there.<br />
<br />
It isnt just us losing ground in hp buffs or anything though.<br />
We have slowly lost ground in every area over every expansion.<br />
We are not going to take losing more ground in GoD.<br />
Matter of fact its time we gained just a tad bit of some of that lost ground back!<br />
<br />
Whining? *shrug* personally I just hear Twisted Sister playing We are not going to take it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is a great idea.<br />
<br />
We can't realistically ask for a better (% wise) slow; if anything, 75% is bit extreme as it is.  However, it is clear that we need some sort of improvement to our slow line to maintain class distinctions and advancement since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Either adding an additional debuff effect, such as you suggest, or making a new slow with a -MR adjust (which is in right now, as I understand it) is the best solution.<br />
<br />
Of course, this would have to stack with chanter/SK/Necro/etc. AC and ATK debuffs to be really useful, but I definitely think this the right direction to go in developing this very necessary upgrade.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I also wouldn't be unhappy with a reduction of our existing 51 slow to cap at maybe 60%, with this slow + cripple capping out at 65-70% at 65.  Of course, that would also require that top BL and chanter slows be detuned to maybe 50% and 65% respectively, and that slow mitigation be limited to named boss mobs.  This won't happen, but I think such a change would make future tuning a bit easier, while preserving the clear lead that shammies should enjoy in slowing mobs.</div></div><hr />

I'd expect it to be a 2 part spell, with the cripple portion having the same stackability as our current Cripple spell. Should they desire to have some mobs immune to the cripple effect, then it could be a partial land, giving the message, Soandso mob is immune to the cripple portion of your spell.</div></div><hr />

Most beautiful post.  Exactly what shaman could use.  We can deal some ok dps, if it weren't for the aggro on dots and slows, which is what #8 is for.  Group spells in #1 and 4 give the other 5 shaman on the raid something to mass after fos is done.  I would really really like to see something changed for rabid bear, like making it stack with avatar instead, and give us 200 double attack skill and 200 bash skill and maybe some other bonus for the duration.  Only thing I'd modify from the list is change #5 to be a better fast heal, rather than a cheal type spell.  H8 cheals.  That, and #8 wouldn't be necessary if the aggro on dots was fixed to be more in line with the aggro produced from similarly sized nukes.<br />
<br />
I really don't think you could get a good concensus on what the shaman class needs from people here.  There's way too many people that when I read their posts I just think &quot;what a f'ing dumbass&quot;.  They ask for the stupidest things that we'd never get that don't fit our class.  I like how our class is designed right now, and if anything was to get changed, just enhance a few aspects like in the list above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">And, love it or hate it, LoY gave us a unique thing in Blood of Nadox.<br />
<br />
This isn't exactly true.  Originally, LoY gave us the same spell (Pure Blood) that the other priests got.  But we already had another spell that did the same thing, so they changed that spell (Disinfecting Aura) to a disease only cure.  Only when shamans made a big issue of the fact did they return DA to its original function and replaced Pure Blood with Blood of Nadox.<br />
<br />
And who can forget the tripe that we were fed in PoP, where we were given hugely useless single target stat buffs.  Again, much noise was made and we got the useless stat debuffs replaced with an insipd group haste and a limited group shrink.<br />
<br />
The pattern in recent expansions has been to produce weak spells for our class and then patch together some kind of &quot;fix&quot; later.  Although not everything gets fixed, e.g., Rabid Bear and Alchemy Mastery.<br />
<br />
What has really marginalized us is the fact that recent expansions have featured fast paced, high DPS encounters, yet our class contributes little if anything to such encounters.  Mobs are mitigated or die quickly, so slow is less important.  Our main source of DPS takes too long to work effectively or is gimped with ridiculous recast times (Bane).  Our pet is weak, our DD's the lowest of any casting class, our rains highly resisted and if we stand too close will hit us wasting damage that could be done on mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">My thoughts, are, that a crippling slow would be much preferable to the short duration one that is slated for us in GoD. It would combine the spell cripple, and Turgur's Insects into 1, thus saving a dot/debuff slot, which have become scarcer on raids these days, and it would save the shaman time in xp groups by not having to cast Cripple after slowing.<br />
<br />
<br />

4:  Decrease AGI by 68 (L53) to 80 (L65) <br />
5:  Decrease STR by 68 (L53) to 80 (L65) <br />
6:  Decrease AC by 30 (L53) to 34 (L65) <br />
<br />
Mana: 300 <br />
Skill: Alteration <br />
Casting Time: 3<br />
Recast Time: 6 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.25 <br />
Resist: Magic <br />
Range: 200 <br />
Location: Any <br />
Time of Day: <br />
Target Type: Single <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental <br />
Classes: SHM/61 <br />
Duration: 5.1 mins @L51 to 6.5 mins @L65 <br />
 <br />
I've noticed cripple wont take hold on some mobs in Ldon, so perhaps it could be similar to the Enchanter line of nukes, in that, the spell would be 2 part, the slow will land, and the cripple might be resisted.<br />
<br />
No idea, if anyone else would find it useful, but, heres hoping for feedback <br />

The only thing I'd change on this is perhaps move it to Classes: SHM/65. There's been some speculation that the BST 65 slow seems to be resisted less because of it's level.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking keep it low, so its much easier to channel. Altho, I'd prefer the lesser resist rate you suggested =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">good post Shabura Naarteban <br />
<br />
my main concern is that we are just too slow now,, so really we are beast at being slow!:)<br />
<br />
time to cast recast etc in this new age of quick battles we are  plainly just too slow.<br />
<br />
and that it the crux of it.</div></div><hr />

Lvl 40 right now, and I'm happy with my role. I know your all talking about the &quot;end-game&quot; but the end-game isn't the whole game... Seems SoE has been focusing on the end game since kunark, doesn't even give the lvl 40&lt; characters jack. Early game is pretty much trying to get to 65 as fast as possible, which is just boring. But back on topic, lvl 40, I usually will slow, throw in a heal, ask what buffs who wants, slow more, yatta yatta. It's boring, but its repetitive and easy, which is what I like. Of course, I'm weird like that, so most people would want some change. Personally, I coudln't care less right now.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing wrong with shaman level 50 and under.  But once you get to 51 it's a LONG haul to 60 (im still thinking pre-pop here).  Around level 54 ish you should start to feel the loss of power which picks up at level 60(Malo, Topor).  Down hill from there.<br />
<br />
Some of my fondest memories are 49/50 in lower guk (before Kunark's release).<br />
<br />
PS there is some really excellent Pre 55 content out now that I did not have when I was coming up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Really wish I could find some of that nice content, but still sitting here thinking about it, not much comes to mind...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">There's a good reason to not concentrate too heavily on the lower levels.  You don't stay in those levels all that long and there is a ton of content already available... Really, the only thing to worry about for level 1-60 is ensuring that the classes are balanced, which of course has never been a strong point of SoE.<br />
<br />
If you've seen ALL of the content available to you at levels 1-60... then it's time you levelled up a bit more and see the last of it ;).  If you're level 45 and you can honestly say you've seen everything there is for a level 45 or below toon, then why wouldn't you level up?  That's the whole point of EQ isn't it?  Become the hero, get more powerful and take on stronger enemies, and so on... <br />
<br />
You've run out of stuff to do at level 50?  Well, there are 15 more levels to gain and things to do in those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">The lvling is the hard part, hehe. If they aren't going to make it interesting, the least SoE could do is make it easier to get to the more interesting parts of the game... Lvl 40 now, chugging along obsenely slow...</div></div><hr />
