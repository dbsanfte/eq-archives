I recently hit 61 and switched my exp to AA's. I was looking at some posts here about the best course of action regarding AA's and strangely, most everyone seems to swear by Run3. Now, I can see it being a no-brainer pre-ldon and if you're not a shaman/druid, but I bought Pack Shrew already and it seems to me like a waste of AA points when I can already keep me at at least 30% run speed anywhere now.<br />
<br />
I put my first 3 AA points with my 63 warrior to get Run3 and still would do the same decision today, but for shamans and druids, it seems useless, any thoughts on this from more experienced shamans?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking more in the line of a combination of Innate Stamina and Regen.<br />
<br />
I should note that I'm guildless and I do not raid. Mostly just do LDON adventures or solo so I always have a buff slot for Shrew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to feel the same way before I started doing AA experience.  When it came time to spend my 3 saved up points (I had regen 3 and saved another 3 til I had to decide) I ended up going run 3 myself.  Run3 could come in handy if I ever raid and need buff slots and could come in handy if I ever get completely dispelled.  So far it's been useless but I figure the potential of run3 is greater than any of the other things available in general.  I couldn't see doing a +stat when I can get +6 stat from an aug easily enough...and I don't use my drogmar enough at this point to warrant the metabolism thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Buff slot. Spell gem. Isn't dispelled. Few reasons why Run3 will always be viable and a good investment.<br />

Nothing else offers any comparative benefit at all.  Running fast innately is a lot better than relying on some stupid buff that be dispelled that you have burn ldon points on.</div></div><hr />

Let's think about this a minute...you are wanting to spend 3 aa points to get 18(!) more hitpoints instead of always on jboot speed...</div></div><hr />

<br />
what I said:<br />
<br />
 As for your original question, I would advise just doing run3 anyways. As far as I am concerned, there are only 3 general abilities that are not completely useless:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3<br />
Metab3<br />
<br />
Some people choose to do stamina or wisdom but that is a poor choice. You'll reach the soft cap fairly easily and eventually the hard cap. The bonuses you get from 6 extra points of wis and stamina are pretty trivial. Regen3, as well, is mediocre now imho. Before PoP came out, regen was pretty good, but now mobs hit so hard and fights are so fast that it just doesn't matter. It is nice to have, of course, but it isn't vital at all.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, run3 is something which I still find useful today. Sure, you can get the same effects by casting pack shrew, but I WILL NEVER HAVE TO CAST THAT SPELL EVER. To me, that is worth 3aa. I hate casting bih'li, and I'm pretty sure I would hate casting shrew as well. Run3 saves a buffslot and saves yourself some hassle. To get an idea of how nice it is having run3, try this: Put your epic boots in the bank for a week, and go back to casting sow whenever it fades. If you say that you don't mind and it doesnt bother you, then by all means skip run3. I, personally, couldn't stand it. Also, it DOES wear off, and can wear off at the worst times. I have had to train out of ldon dungeons before. I have had to train out of tactics as well. I've had to kite SRT mobs for several minutes before I got enough room to mem and cast gate. All these things have happened many times. In all these situations, if my spirit of shrew had faded, I could have easily died. With run3, though, I never have to worry about my shrew fading.<br />
<br />
Your last option for general skills is metab3. I use stat food and I have metab3 trained, but I also have over 300aa. I wouldn't really suggest something this trivial to someone just starting out on AA.<br />
<br />
Out of all these, run3 is really the only AA I feel strongly about training out of the general abilities. Once you have that, it is really a tossup for me between regen3 and metab3. Nothing else is really useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">innate &gt; spells.<br />
<br />
like the man said a few posts up. buffs tend to run out when you need them the most. running out of a dungeon and having your pack shrew run out is not fun, plus why cast another spell?  its only 3 AA points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love my black fur boots, favorite piece of gear for outside, but unless they come out with a indoor version run 3 will still be very valuable. Like everyone else said after it gets dispelled your screwed, or of course the timelyness of it wearin off and you needed a free gem slot for something else!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also have Shrew, but wouldn't you rather know that you can count on run3 in the heat of battle (or retreat for that matter) instead of hoping you have Shrew memmed?  That is if you could even cast it in time to save your butt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Run3 &gt; Shrew, no question.<br />
<br />
Been said many times... Run3 doesn't take up a buff slot, and cannot be dispelled. No idea why someone would need to be convinced of this.<br />
<br />
I may have gotten the spell if they had added +atk or something to it instead of ultravision.<br />
<br />
However, since the spell becomes available at level 34 for Shaman, it would be useful until able to get Run3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Run 3 is great like people said because it's always on, doesn't take a buff slot or mana. I also agree run 3, regen 3 and metabolism 3 are really the only choices for inital 6 points. New tannan in nice for the appropriate situations but rarely in the first 6 points for people. Innate resists are eventually useful but rarely done in the initial batch. Any innate stats like sta or wis are worthless IMO. Not only are they capped but they are also both things we can buff. Gear just keeps getting better with more and more stats on it and they both become less effective past 255. With LDoN you can even augment what ever stats you want into any peice of gear. Need more sta, get a sta augment. Need more wis, get a wis augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ancere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Another argument for Run3... Picture this.<br />
<br />
You and your party are deep in a dungeon and a train just happens to be heading your way. Let's say your only chance is to run, no time/mana to gate and no evacer. So you begin running, and the rest of your mates have run3 and are passing you on the way to the zone out... You are at the back end of your party and the mobs are about to pounce. Who will be killed?<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how fast you can run, only that you can outrun everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Buffs do.  Inevitably they wear off at the worst possible time...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shazgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't view Run3 as a requirement either for shamans. You can always go back and get Run3 at any time. I started AA's at L65 and at the time I was getting feared a lot at raids so I needed innate Sv Magic 3 more than I needed Run3. (A shaman getting feared is a worthless shaman.)<br />
<br />
Black Fur Boots is always in my 1st inventory slot anyway, and casting shrew is almost a reflex action. When raid buffed and you need an extra slot, you're not gonna care about how fast you can run away from some dragon or boss. In fact I can't think of any situation I've ever been in where having Run3 would have saved my life or my group, but I'm sure I'll end up getting it anyway eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Shrew and its pack forms are aimed at the 50 and under crowd, plain and simple.<br />
People tend to forget that LDoN has spells that range from the very lowest levels that access it (20) to the highest (65s); level 20s obviously dont have access to run3, thus Shrew.<br />
Absolutely shrew does not replace run3. Now that being said, I have leveled to 65 with 76 AA and have yet to spend a point on Run Speed...I decided to go innate metabolisim and regen vs the run speed. The decision was based on the fact that I was always outside at the time that I worked my first AAs, back when luclin first came out, and I almost never went into a dungeon setting.<br />
There are a few times that I wish I had it, and when I am finished with a few things AA wise, I will eventually work on it.</div></div><hr />

Nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm still too lazy to get run 3. Don't be like me!

<br />
Um...the shrew spells last quite a while....it's not like you really chain cast it.  It's not NEARLY as bad as when we have to be the groups haste caster!  I usually Bih'li my group right before zone in (almost every tank I've ever met likes +attack, even the 65's with 300aa) and I'll cast pack shrew once inside...sometimes twice if the run goes full duration which is now rare for me doing 63+ average group level LDoNs.<br />
<br />
I play a support shaman and I cast a LOT of spells in addition to nearly chain casting canni4 (canni5 is coming soon which may alleviate that some).  If you don't like to cast spells I'm not sure why you're a shaman, since we probably have the most diverse spellbook in the game and probably cast more spells than any other class.  Anyways.  I group with a lot of regulars...but I have no idea what AAs they have...and I still cast pack shrew at 64 just in case someone doesn't have run3 (I often see people with no titles at my level since some folks push for 65 before doing heavy AA, which is also often recommended by vets here).  With my mana pool pack shrew is beyond trivial to cast and is just one more thing I can do to potentially enhance my group.  If I was 65 with 300+ aa and only grouped with similar folks, I probably wouldn't cast it - but I'm far from that point.<br />
<br />
I've earned over 3k pts in LDoN and will earn lots more.  It's 14pts (?) for single target shrew and 36 pts for pack shrew.  That's a tiny investment for 2 very useful and awesome spells considering how much use you can get out of them if you ONLY use them pre-AA availability.  I lost track of how many times I was thanked for doing pack shrew before 51st level.  Shaman get the shrew spells for far less than any other class.  I got pack shrew first and picked up single target shrew recently for more utility.  I like to be able to give runspeed to my pet indoors.<br />
<br />
I group exclusively and buff slots have yet to be an issue.  If I ever join a guild and raid I can see buff slots being an issue.  Dispelling is also rarely an issue and is never very pleasant.  Dispelling also doesn't usually mean it's time to run or there's gonna be a group wipe.  I don't know about you, but I have one spell slot that I'm constantly swapping out for whatever spell I need at the moment.  Recasting a spell - omg - what a big deal!  How can I survive doing something I do constantly anyways!  If you have to recast SoW or shrew is it REALLY that big a deal?  Some of you must live perfect EQ lives if you never have to recast/repeat cast any shaman spells.  I feel more sorry for the clerics/enchanters that have to recast big buffs like virtue/kei when they get dispelled.  I never have mana problems - casting or recasting a spell is trivial.<br />
<br />
With my style, and the fact that I'm just now approaching hitting 65, the shrew spells work great for me and worked great for me for many levels.  I'd also think they're a great investment for any other up and coming shaman.  I guess if you're 65 with oodles of AA and only fight the very upper tier critters, or if your a masochistic soloist that fights known dispellers for some odd reason, then, sure, shrew spells are  probably not that useful for you.<br />
<br />
So, anyways, I have run3 and I think it's 2nd best of the general AA (I have to place regen first even if it's tiny because all regen is good to me - it all adds up).  The general AAs are all gimpy and just stepping stones to better AAs anyways.  I went with run3 because the other general AA are pretty much entirely useless...not because run3 is that amazing or indispensible.  I don't consider the shrew spells to be trivial - I think they're a great addition to our utility, extremely cheap as far as LDoN stuff goes, and something that one can get a LOT of use out of before AA are available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tuibumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It would never be a waste of points getting Run3 but I went with Run1 Metab2. It all depends on your play style. If you dungeon crawl most of the time, go with Run3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well, I recently came back from a break, and didn't have LDoN (still don't - meaning to get it eventually lol). But when I saw someone selling pack shrew in Baz, I immediately ran over and bought it (2500 - thought it was well worth it for indoor SoW). Since I was out of the loop, I then found out it's only run3 speed, like 30%, and not SoW speed. Well, I have never memmed it yet, and think it's a completely useless spell for the 50+ crowd, and I curse myself for wasting the money on it - guess I will research new spells next time hehe :)<br />
<br />
Get run3 for the reasons listed before. It's the one thing that about 95% of the people in the game probably agree on getting right away.</div></div><hr />
