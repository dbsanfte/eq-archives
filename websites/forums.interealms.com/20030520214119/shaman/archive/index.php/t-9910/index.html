the following was written by one of the most effective pvp Rangers in the game.  it is old (over a year).  it is long.  and it is for lower lvls than those that normally read here.<br />
<br />
do not bash me just because you are lvl 65 and have 200+AAs; i honestly don't care.<br />
<br />
i reproduce it here for two reasons.  First, i consider information to be worthy as long as it is taken with a grain of salt.   Secondly, i think it goes to show the view of a shaman from a class outside, as well as how young shaman get the feeling about themselves.<br />

Grimshade’s guide on Dirty, Rotten, Mean, Viscous Pking as a solo midlevel ranger. (With some exceptions)<br />
<br />
Well now you’ve gone and done it. You picked of all things a damned ranger. Everyone says you suck. You got no game. You blow. You can’t outtank a warrior, outmelee a monk or rogue, god knows you can’t outnuke jack @#%$, and your defense is crap. But for all that you do get a bow! Heh. Aint that a great substitute? Well, no it isn’t, but guess what, you don’t really suck you just have to not buy the hype. Rangers, as far as I see them are one of the most versatile playah killers in the game, but are very misunderstood, and underestimated. Some classes that normally make great PvP classes can have a hard time with rangers. But don’t forget fighting’s cardinal rule, location, surprise, and situation are everything.<br />
<br />
Gear<br />
<br />
First thing you need as a ranger is of course, decent gear. Frankly mine (excluding two items) is horrible, but I have the minimum you need to survive. You are going to need at least a 65mr to have a chance, something that I have, but barely, and often at the cost of precious armor class, something rangers have in short supply. As for weapons personally I use a big, mean two hander to kill people. Some people like two nice one handed slashers, but until you get a lot of haste gear, personally this isn’t my cup of tea. I would recommend a black alloy bastard sword or better, myself. The next thing you are gonna need is pumice, just in case. Frankly, I don’t have much of this and don’t use it that often, but its always ready in case. Those are the essentials, other stuff I would highly recommend include:<br />
<br />
· Fish Scales (You will thank me)<br />
· Decent Bow (Ashwood or better)<br />
· Chipped Bone Rod (for body finding, unfortunately you will need it)<br />
· Other piece of resist gear to toss into the ranged slot in case you are out of arrows (I have a chill dagger, but can dream of an Rune Bone Fork)<br />
· Arrow components<br />
· If you can swing it a piece of see invis gear. Not necessary but big damned plus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fundamentals <br />
<br />
Here are a few things to remember when going about wreaking your own peculiar blend of havoc.<br />
<br />
1) Put up buffs at all times.-- Buff yourself with everything you can at all times. Each little bit, of AC/Attack and resist helps. Spirit of wolf should be up at all times duh….. and a refresh cannot hurt, before you go into combat.<br />
2) Make sure your skills are up.-- Rangers have a lot of tough skills to raise, including archery, swimming sense direction, and all their casting spells. Swimming is especially important. Of course make sure all your standard combat skills are raised.<br />
3) Wear your resist gear at all times—You aren’t here to get exp. You are here to kill people, you get snared/ darked near a group of bad guys…you are dead. Better to take harder hits from melees than make it easier for them to catch you.<br />
4) Lack of Speed Kills—Your greatest advantage as a ranger is that you both have the ability to slow people down, and move faster than them. Use it. I personally have grasping roots and snare memmed at all times. More to follow as to why.<br />
5) Learn how to strafe—Practice moving your character using the arrow keys and the mouse, eventually practice how to circle an opponent. <br />
6) Bite off what you can chew----- No you cannot kill reds solo. Say it with me…no, you cannot kill reds solo……well….unless they are at a sliver of life and fighting a mob, but that is different. Do not attack groups solo unless they are melee heavy and caster light, cause you probably will kill most casters before the melees kill you. My rule is I try not to attack a group of even cons greater than three in number.<br />
7) Take advantage of situations--- Someone low on health, kill em. Someone fighting a mob, kill em. Someone got a train on em, snare them, then try to killshot them. People are medding, hit them hard.<br />
Know the terrain, and know it well—Know where to hide, and where most people like to group for exp, know the hills, the mountains, the backdoors the alleyways. Know where most people look for people who hide, and avoid that spot. If you do not know a zone get the maps off www.eqatlas.com<br />
9) Stay off the beaten path--- See the road, do not use it. See the river do not follow it. Do not rest near landmarks, if possible do not pk near landmarks. Do not give your target a good spot to shout “L33t Ranger_01 Pking near xxxxxx” <br />
10) Know how fast you zone—It is important in pursuing enemies. If you zone real slow, don’t freaking bother chasing. Your enemies will just get the jump on you, then zone dance repeatedly while calling for help. Don’t waste your time, they got away. If you zone fast, see if you zone ahead of them….if so you have the edge. Personally I don’t pk people near zones if at all possible. Its too big a landmark, and my targets get away too easily. <br />
11) Hide at all times- Always move around invis. Why help someone who possibly cannot see you? Hide skill is good while medding.<br />
<br />
<br />
12) Know the mobs in the zone--- Know how hard they hit, where they are, and most importantly what sees through your invis. Decaying skeletons in warsilks woods for instance see through invis while in WC they do not. Know what faction they are. Many npcs and green monsters instantly attack you when you jump a pc nearby. As do guards. <br />
13)Pick your ambush spots carefully-- Don’t attack a monk in the middle of a group of hostile mobs. Don’t attack a rogue in close quarters, etc.<br />
14)Do not fight battles on other people’s terms.--- Ever. Do not respond to taunts, jeerings, etc done in OOC and shout. Let other people type, it’s tougher to fight that way. And never ever duel someone who wants to duel you. You are just setting yourself up for a possible trap. <br />
15)Don’t kill greens-- Unless they are close to your level or they jump you and/or a teammate. They are a waste of health and mana. You get nothing for them. <br />
16)Keep Moving--- Don’t pk in one spot for too long, don’t hang around an area for too long. If possible attack targets in many different zones. <br />
17)Keep the element of surprise fresh---- You only get a certain period of time before the zone is alerted to your presence, and swarm of high levels come looking for you, and all the even cons get together. Log for a few minutes, zone, etc. If possible buff before you zone so you can attack upon entering the zone, and therefore get as much jump on the enemy as possible.<br />
1 Don’t piss off your enemy more than you have to---- Don’t Camp people’s corpses, or bind camp folks. They will repay the favor. You do not want that favor.<br />
19) Kill casters first--- As a rule you will kill a caster in a group before the melees can do jack about it. The melees will hurt you, but ignore them until your start to hear crunching.<br />
20)Get out at half health---When you hit half health its time to go. When you hit that mark fast its really time to go.<br />
<br />
Tracking<br />
<br />
Tracking is a pain in the arse in PvP. Mainly because a lot of things can throw it off. Shadowstepping, invising, hill lag, gating etc, can all screw it up easy. First off, the most useful way I have found to find people is by using /tracksort distance. This sorts the targets by proximity. So basically those at the top are closest, and the ones deeper are farther away. This is invaluable when figuring out who is in what group, and who is laying an ambush. You know group size before you get there. <br />
Shadowstep however is not a cure all. Many smart Sk’s and Necros Shadowstep to toss off track then…*duh* summon a pet. The pet is far easier to track and rarely leads to ghosts. So if you are hunting your typical “smart” necro, just track his pet. Pet also gives you an idea of level, as the higher the pet, often the much higher the guy who cast it.<br />
Nothing beats checking good old exp spots for your kills. Many people who do not show up on long distance track, show up when you get close to a give location. Also do not forget to check track often. Personally I check it practically all the time, and have it in my hotkey bank as I do other stuff. Just be prepared to be frustrated. Tracking means a lot of false leads.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tips tricks and strategies against the classes<br />
<br />
Enchanters<br />
<br />
What they do: An enchanter will most often tash you first, as it makes practically every spell he has more effective. Then they got a lot they can do. At the midlevels, I rarely see them try to use their pet, as it is weak at this point, and pretty much is little more than a nuisance, this changes at higher levels from what I understand. After this they do one of two things, they dot kite you, rooting you or messing you if you get unruly, or nuke you outright. The dot is often more mana efficient, but some foolhardy ones nuke outright all the time. (they are easier, often an even con will go OOM nuking you) In a group enchanters are a damn pain. They basically make everyone else pvp spells that much better, and rune themselves and others. They are much better grouped than solo by far. <br />
<br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
Well, well ,well. An enchanter. As a ranger you have soooooooo many tools at your disposable to deal with even a red enchanter (unless they are real high) First off, enchanters do not have a lot of hit points, and cannot shadowstep. For the most part they are subsequently meat to a well prepared Ranger. There are three spells in particular that are invaluable. Flame Lick or stinging swarm, Ignite or burst of fire, and cure poison. Flame lick or stinging swarm cast on yourself to make sure their mezz doesn’t stick. Use ignite or burst of fire when rooted, and use cure poison to eliminate tashes in one pop. Also don’t forget you can still bind, or even camp while mezzed so don’t forget these as options. Without tash, root, and mez, and enchanter is in deep trouble, watching helplessly as you crunch into them. With good magic resistance, they are in even deeper trouble. Snare em and crunch away. In a group kill them first, after healers. I love fighting enchanters. <br />
<br />
Rogues<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
Dance! Dance! Dance! A rogues greatest weapon is ease of movement. If they get in close and stay in close, they will outdamage you. Rogues, depending on skill, will try three styles depending on level of skill. They will circle strafe you, making it look like they are vanishing from your front view and appear elsewhere, they will joust, taking a run at you, trying to land a backstab as they go by, or they will just try to stay close. Smart ones will use poison to restrict your movement and take away your best weapon as a ranger, speed. Another tactic often used at lower levels is the attack/hide, attack hide…*damn* tough without see invis. Basically a good rogue will pile up damage, while you can’t even see them, much less target them. Many rogues will pumice you off the git, so be ready. In a group they will pile up damage, but will often not kill you before you kill someone else, so go for casters first.<br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
Get out your trusty two hander, and force them to joust. If possible get a damage shield up in advance. Even though its weak, it helps against a rogue, in case he roots you with poison. And if you really want to screw a rogue up, snare him/her, and/ or root. Take away movement and you severely handicap their jousting ability. As you run by, with sow, crunching away, snared opponents have a tougher time landing flying backstabs. If you snare a rogue, you can also dot him, bow kite, nuke peck him, etc and laugh while they toss shurikens (hopefully not throwing boulders), as you kite them to death. Don’t forget the flame lick spell too! It is an excellent AC debuff, letting those two handed passes crunch home. A useful technique I also use against a rogue that tries to invis, is that I like to give the rogue the impression he’s “better” I play dumb, just spinning to his circle strafe, and barely moving, all the while him telling me how I suck and I can’t move. I let the fight get close then try for a slash/kick nuke triple hit to finish him off. Never underestimate the power of underestimation, hehe.<br />
<br />
Warriors<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
<br />
They grunt, they look mean and stuff. They are also very tough to finish off as a ranger. Usually (if smart) they will try to pumice you, and then move in for bone-crunching hits with some fearsome two hander that can kill you in a few hits. They have more hit points, and much better ac, so toe to toe, you are a dead man against an even con. (although iskar AC kinda sucks) Some will use two one handed weapons, and hope to kill you that way. Warriors, like you also get crits with bow. Snaring/rooting an even con warrior can be a tough affair as well due to innate MR, and you know they are gonna have it up if they see you coming. <br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
<br />
First off, don’t buy the crap, that you are a coward if you don’t sit there and let them wail on you. Warriors for some reason (probably because they suck at moving sometimes) seem to use this taunt the most. The old :”Stop moving you puss” has been uttered by many a warrior. A combat involving a warrior is basically gonna involve some kiting. Its that simple. Ignite them, ignite them, ignite them. You will wear them down, Your bow as well will weaken them. Your dots will piss em off. Use flame lick. Not many warriors will resist your fire spells. They don’t think that far ahead. When you think the warrior is unprepared, sneak in a quick slash attempt, and then run back out and peck him to death. Do not joust a warrior, exclusively. They will pull out some piece of crap like a weighted axe and own you. <br />
<br />
Shadowknights<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are a prime example of a class that had a bunch of crap added to them to make them more effective for pve, that basically made them friggin GODlike in player vs player. An idiot can pvp with them (and many do) Still they can be taken down. What they usually try to do is dark you. If over 30 they use heat blood. Easily one of the biggest pain in the ass spells in pvp. A damn hybrid should not have this spell IMO, but hey we gotta live with it. They also will str drain you, to screw up your movement even more. Many sks can also use bash. Some can use a weighted axe for jousting, and many do. They also lifetap you, draining your hps and adding it to theirs, and make pets. This doesn’t even count Harm touch, which is an excellent finisher. (dumb sks use a harm touch at the outset, allowing me to better measure where I am in the battle), and if somehow all of that crap fails, they get a near insta cast spell to get away in shadowstep ARRRRRGH. Before 30, and heat blood sks are much more vulnerable. Sks also use their pet to track you. They are so smart.<br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
<br />
Well, at 30 a good SK is pretty much a marathon fight alone. The most important thing against an sk is to GET YOUR MAGIC RESISTANCE UP. If they do not dark you, you got a chance. If they do, its pumice time/and or cancel magic, and you might have to flee the field, preferably towards water. There are many tactics against an sk, some of which start to get dirty. The first is tojump em while they are on a mob. If you catch them without their MR gear on and snare them, they sometimes panic. The mob tactic also brings up another interesting trick in that it helps screw up shadowstep. The mob acts as an instant tracker for you. Beware of feign death however…nono fun. The mob aggros on you, but you do get a free slash or two sometimes on the sk anyways. If you see a “ghost” for awhile after a shadowstep it means they went far, far away. If they vanish instantly they are close. Look around for em. Another tactic is to drag away their pet if its up, and snare it. Sk pets suck, so it might get killed quick by a mob which will then often agro on the SK. More help. Other than that your sow is your saviour. Hope they don’t have harm touch up, joust them, while dotting their ass off and nuking the crap out of em and you probably will have a 50/50 shot of finishing them. They key to killing an SK, along with many other classes, is to be better prepared than they are. If they whine about how they were not ready, you did your job. <br />
<br />
Druids<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
<br />
They try to do what all druids do…kite. They aint gonna melee you so basically they are going to snare you, and dot/nuke you into oblivion. I would elaborate, but often pvp with druids isn’t real sophisticated. <br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
<br />
First off if you follow my general rules above you will be much better off, as you get a FR bonus and a FR buff. Fire resist will help you big time against a druid, as their primary attack is fire based. As with many other classes, try to snare them off the git. (at least at lower levels)You severely hamper their ability to run, limiting it to port/gate/evac, when they get in trouble. Druids are honestly cake for rangers. You can run as fast as they can unless they cheetah. Just get close and wail the crap out of them. Make sure you do not get snared in the process. Dots are your greatest concern from a druid. You might have to pumice them off if you are snared. Also do not forget your bow! Shoot/nuke/shoot/nuke has a good chance of screwing up his spells. Of course keep your MR as high as possible. Also don’t forget your cancel magic spell…negating their sow will severely screw them up. <br />
<br />
Necromancers<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
<br />
OOOOOoh necromancers the “best” pvp class on the planet. Also probably the easiet to kill, at my level anyways. If they didn’t have shadowstep, I would probably have 100 more kills, because frankly poorly played pvp necros suck…and well, if you attack a necro while hes attacking a monster, they will suck. They do have a few strategies however so you gotta be ready for what they are going to do. Often a necro will sick his pet on you if he has one, and run around trying to cast spells hoping the pet does damage and bashes (stuns) you enough for a spell to get in. Well, what you do depends on what the necro does. If your snare or root fails on the necro, snare the pet and ignore it. If your root/snare succeeds just attack the necro. Now once a necro is snared…they will try to shadowstep kite you, or flat out run, or sit there and try to channel lifetaps until they die, or you do Shadowstep kiting involves them stepping, getting a distance away, then them casting a lifetap, nuke or dot, and repeating as you chase them around. Very few necros are good at this outdoors however, when they cannot take advantage of line of sight. But the ones that do are the toughest opponents. Few necros I have encountered use their damage shield, though more should. Necro dots are nasty. They blow. Half the necros I fight however either forget to use them, or start shadowstepping so fast they screw themselves over. A good necro will dot you or dark you, then slowly work you over with his pet/dots. And yes they will try to pet track you as well. Just stay in a big zone and keep moving and this track sucks for em’ however. They will also rune for a bit, so be ready for it. <br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
<br />
Snare them. Get in close and wail the crap out of them. They have crappy hit points and ac, so you will find home a lot of the time. If you get a dot on you the clock is ticking….watch your health bar. If you go below half, time to go. Necros are nasty finishers, albeit poor starters. Catching them while medding is ideal, and you can often get three swings in before they start moving. A few keys to a good ambush include catching a necro in a valley. You snare a necro in a valley, or in a cave, or in close quarters, their shadowstep will blow, in which you can easily follow them around and kill them quick. I still use a two hander. The dot is the nasty spell a necro casts, but he only has one good one, so a lifetap or two wont kill you before you kill him, with a good chopper. Also don’t spend all your time trying to snare him if the first couple of tries fail. You don’t want the necro to get a chance at a darkness spell landing. If a dot and dark land, you are in deep crap. Unless you are sure the necro is alone, and you can finish him, time to go. That’s two dots on you. One weak, one strong. Necros often know the valley thing and try to crawl or slither to a high spot…where shadowstep will often take you farther. That is what your root is for. I like to snare and root my enemies just for this reason. <br />
<br />
Magicians<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
<br />
Mages are brave when they have pets and mana. They are cowards (often with good reason) when they don’t have either. A mage pet is more effective than any other pet at my hunting level. Earth pet is normally the nastiest, as they can root. They then just nuke the crap out of ya with rather good nukes for the level, while their pet keeps either stunning you, or rooting you. They can kill you but often mages make better griefers killing lowbies with a pet, mowing them down like dry grass. Their damage shield is nasty. <br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
<br />
You can snare the pet, then just snare/root mage and whallop the crap out of him. It isn’t rocket science. He then tries to gate, or just pulls a dirty trick link pulling off a hp item. Just sit and wail, try to interrupt nukes…they hurt, but mages overall are not the best at pvp. Catch them without a pet, and they suck at midlevels. At high, that pet can be a bitch. Use your two hander to avoid significant damage shield damage.<br />
<br />
Wizards<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
<br />
Wizards are the mean in pvp. They hit hard. They kill fast, they root you and can run away easily by casting shadowstep. First off, a good pvp wizard will have his rune up so he can try a nuke and/or root. If he fails, he then runs around like a madman trying to root you or channel through you slashes. The nukes hurt lots, and are no fun. You want to make sure you get hit with as few of them as possible. They often will also shadowstep to get distance then auto click their nuke, or levitate off terrain to make themselves impossible to reach. Wizards greatest friend is distance, make sure that their friend eludes them.<br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
<br />
Well, stay in close, and kick the crap out of em as best you can. When facing a wizard remember that if their root lands, your nukes hurts less than theirs, so nuke yourself out of the root. Sometimes their nukes will do this too. If they are leved, use your cancel magic spell (mine is memmed at all times) to send them crashing down to earth. Then whallop on them. Quite often when in trouble they will start chain shadowstepping and then gate. Hopefully they are in a valley, or cave so the shadowstep doesn’t work. Click on a damaging spell icon after they shadowstep as well, if it doesn’t work, then they are out of your range too. Remember with shadowstep, if you see a ghostly outline for awhile and get “target is too far away” messages, they have SS’ed a long ways away. If they disappear instantly immediately look around for the telltale circular fog that lets you know where they went. If that fails, track em. Tracking still works unless they ghost away. Snare as usual is hell for any caster. If it lands they are toast, and will try like mad to get away using gate/SS/yonder. <br />
<br />
Bards<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
<br />
I hate bards. You hate bards. Everyone hates bards. They are annoying little gnats. But they can be very nasty if you underestimate them. Bards, frankly are probably the class I fear most. A determined, skilled one, will always kill you, unless they are poorly versed in their class. They have a lot of ways to kill you as well. They can fear kite you, using an ae fear spell. They can damage kite you, running around using a damage song, they can stun kite you to death. They can charm mobs on you. They can do any combination of what I just mentioned, and worst of all they can weasel away if all of those fail using shadowstep and bard speed. A well prepared bard has high MR too so often snare doesn’t land. They are easily the toughest class for me to take out….unless they screw up. <br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
<br />
Well here is the thing, you have to be pretty prepared against a bard…but you have got to have good MR. Most if not all of their attacks are magic based, so a good MR will save you a lot of trouble. The important thing with bards, probablymore than any other class, is that you will have to outdamage them range wise. You gotta have a good bow, cause you cannot depend on your bread and butter snare to land even fifty percent of the time. You gotta quick nuke and shoot-em full of holes with your bow. If they are dumb enough to use an ae fear or song and fail, it doesn’t hurt to be close to monsters, so the bard gets the aggro. Careful however…this is not always reliable. Bards in melee at least are not as good. They have some good weapons, but in stright up melee a ranger should be able to take out a bard. But I would recommend using a two hander and jousting above any other tactic. Bard speed makes this tough, however, so be ready. Snare is not a lost cause however. Bards strength comes from speed, so anything you can do to eliminate that advantage puts you in the drivers seat. Some bards, who don’t have pumice, freak out and start Ssing, etc or stand and die, trying to damage you and swing their swords till you go down. Flame lick is fun on bards, the more you can eliminate off their AC the better. The best way to kill them is to stay in close….usually. If they go to running pull out the bow.<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
<br />
They swing swords, wear plate, and heal themselves silly. Paladins are ten times braver when they have LoH up as well. Basically, they buff themselves to hell with hit point buffs, then try a never ending chain of blinds and roots to get the edge while they whip out a nasty two hander and try to kick the crap out of you. More often than not a pally who is losing a battle has LoH up, so he can heal himself to full. I haven’t fought an extended battle with a pally who didn’t use it near the end. LoH is also a deal breaker. You often cant kill an even con that has it up. You will smack em around a lot, and they will heal, heal, blind, root, heal, etc. Paladins often also are good jousters because usually their best weapon against a melee is their two hander. Being blind is not fun. I find that the best thing to do is to circle strafe, because its hard for melees to hit you. Running in a straight line is often less effective, unless you know the way is clear, and no mobs are present, before you get blinded. Audio cues are the most importantthing of course when you are blinded, and make sure you have your spells hoykeyed, so you know what you are casting while blind. Also don’t forget your tab key changes targets…so that might be useful as well. <br />
<br />
What you do:<br />
<br />
Hybrids as usual are a bugger. You gotta think MR first ac second as a lot of roots and blinds will get you killed if you are facing a halfway decent player, and a good jouster. Try to interrupt as many heals as possible without compromising your safety. And pour on the damage, any way you can. If you find hes low on health and still fighting expect a Lay on hands, and assess based upon damage taken so far, is you can make it through another set of hps. Don’t forget to nuke yourself if rooted, again this is a good way to get out of it. Paladins also have the curse that you can outdamage them both at range and in close with your spells. So use it, make himplay into whatever style you think appropriate. Paladins are hard kills, but often very easy to get away from.<br />
<br />
Clerics<br />
<br />
What they do:<br />
<br />
Clerics can be surprisingly tough. One of their advantages is that they are often underestimated in pvp. Usually a cleric will often root you and blind you, much like a paladin, and then either nuke you, or invuln themselves. Cleric also have level that their class shines. Generally the first level a cleric gets a nuke….it is very powerful for that level, gradually getting worse and worse until their next nuke. Clerics don’t have dots, and other than nuking don’t have a large damage output. But get rooted, and blinded and the next thing you could be looking at is your bind location-<br />
<br />

Get mr gear and lots of it. Their nukes are mr based, as are their blinds and roots. If they cannot land those spells you often are golden. Stick to them as best you can, and hack away. They will go down slower than most casters, but they will eventually go down. The thing is with clerics, is that they can last a loooong time before dying, if they heal themselves, so try to kill them as quick as possible, lest they call in reinforcements. A lot run to the aid of the nice man who is going to rez them later in EQ life. <br />

Shamen for rangers are actually not that tough, at least at midelvels. They will often run first, assess the situation, then try to malaise you, lowering your resists so everything else sticks better. Malaise I seem to resist surprisingly well with an mr of 68 for some reason. When it sticks, you can be in trouble. Shamen often use their movement edge to their advantage, and like to cook you with dots before moving in for the kill, with a cold based nuke. If they are high enough to have a pet it’s a pain in the ass. Buffed up, the pet can do solid damage, and often its sowed so its tough to get away from. Many shamen use their pets to track in this fashion, using the /pet attack command. Their nuke is not terribly mana efficient but their dots are, so beware them more than anything else. <br />

Well, perhaps I have been lucky but I have yet to have a shaman beat me solo. I think the main reason is that we can keep up with them, so getting away is harder for them. Stick to them as close as possible, and of course use your mr gear above all else. Their poison and disease dots are gonna hurt, but often those dots wont kill you before you kill him. If you have time to prepare, do not forget your cold buffs. They aid against their rather poor (yet sometimes effective nukes). A good shaman will try to kite you, while his dog beats on you, so be ready for this, snare the dog, and/or shaman, then just keep up with them and bring them down. Do not foregt your cure poison and your weak healing as well, you can often turn the tide with your feeble healing powers. <br />

Spell Line Up<br />
<br />
Here is what I typically keep up in PvP situations and why:<br />
<br />
Cancel Magic- Great spell, use it to cancel lev, dispel sow on enemies,a dn kill darkness on yourself…plus it’s a great backup for pumice<br />
<br />
Flame Lick-small dot, ac debuff, I use it to screw with an enchanters mez and hit much harder with my melee weps<br />
<br />
Ignite- A piddly 39 nuke damage, but a lot of enemies don’t have FR up against a ranger. Plus it’s a great finisher. When the body warps away from you slightly but is unconscious you want to kill it quick, before your victim dies to pain, or some mob kills him. Your melee wep often gets a “too far away message” <br />
<br />
Spirit of Wolf- Always keep this up if you can. Everyone and their momma tries to dispel it, and then think you are dead without it. Right until you refresh it. Plus it seems to drop at the worst possible times…like right before you are about to get the drop on someone. <br />
<br />
Snare- Low mana hope killer…land one of these they are in deep *&amp;^%. Just don’t nuke it off. Also this is a pet remover. It can take them nearly out of a battle if used right.<br />
<br />
Grasping Roots- I like to use this near zones, or when I have someone snared who is strafing to screw up melee. When this and snare land on an even con caster they start Shadowstepping and praying for gate.<br />
<br />
Light Healing- Healing amidst a battle is always big. Even a crappy one, a few of these heals off a nuke often, so don’t forget about it. <br />
<br />
Camoflage- Invis at all times outdoors, very important to sneak up on your enemy as much as possible. Why worry about dodging hostile mobs when you can walk right past them?<br />
<br />
Also don’t forget:<br />
<br />
Stinging Swarm- Dot that’s not too nasty but eats away at em. Also irresistible for the most part.<br />
<br />
Cure poison – To remove poison and Tash spells.<br />
<br />
Damage shield line- to screw with bards, rogues and monks in melee. Can add up in damage.<br />
<br />
Anyways that’s it…enjoy and put some iskar steaks on the BBQ for me.<br />

Stay Frosty<br />

The problem is making sure you survive once they're down.  Ebolt and plague are slow enough that ya can usually kill them before you yourself die.<br />

Not uncommon to see both corpses lying there after the battle :)<br />
