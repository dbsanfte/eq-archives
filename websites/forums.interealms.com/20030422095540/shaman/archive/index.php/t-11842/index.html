<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got my Spear of Fate tonite and I was wondering on the exact workings of the effect on it. I tried going on Lucy but its description says something about not being able to figure something out, or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
I know its a 9 second cast time. I know its a DoT. I know its Splurt type, starts slower and gets bigger to keep aggro under control at the start of the fight. I heard once it was like 1200 hps.<br />
<br />
So I am wondering. How many ticks does it go for? <br />
<br />
What is the total time? <br />
<br />
How much does it do per tick. Like 200,200.400,400 or what? <br />
<br />
What is the effect based on, Poison, Disease, Magic? Is it resistable? <br />
<br />
What is the recast time? I understand it has a 9 second cast time but I am assuming the DoT takes a lot longer to run its course so thats not too much of and issue, but I would like to time the recast so the next one follows the first without wasting a tick and a half. <br />
<br />
Does it stack with our other spell lines? Can you used both Poison/Disease and Epic Dots and the same time.<br />
<br />
Any info would be very welcome. Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The epic DoT runs for 84 seconds, or 14 ticks. It starts by doing 12 damage on the first tick and each tick after that does an extra 12 (ie 12,24,36 ...)<br />
<br />
The effect is magic based, it checks against magic resist to land, and can be removed with dispell magic.<br />
<br />
And it does stack with every other DoT a shaman can cast. I think it also stacks with Splurt.</div></div><hr />
