<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ElrathhSTree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When do you guys think Rangers could bow kite IGs and HGs effciently. I have taken out a few HGs at 47, but they took awhile. Im thinking of just killing IGs awhile at 51 to get Exp and some Cash. Any ideas? I can get a dex of about 200 easily (shammy friend) and I'm gonna get a Steelshaft bow. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lascs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 45 I did it all the time, but with out a tolan's bracer, I'd guess it'd be a PITA.  At 51, it  was a lot easier with the better root.  I root- click stinging swarm from tolans, and sit, stand, shoot, sit.. repeat.  When swarm faded, I knew that root was going to drop.<br />
<br />
I did it with my BFT and the 3dmg tolans arrows NP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brumuuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's slow but steady XP.  A few sugestions if I may - <br />
<br />
I did IG's for a while from 50-51, it probably wasn't the most efficient XP, but it was fun, and I needed to improve my archery anyways.<br />
<br />
I would snare/immolate, then wade in with swarmcaller, if it procced, go to my one-handers, if not, wait til two bubbles, and back out, drop root, and go into zen archery mode.  At 51 ensnare REALLY helped, because fights would last longer than the normal snare would, but I only had a runed oak bow at the time, so........<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What do you call &quot;efficient&quot;? You certainly can do it now, but it's more efficient (in terms of kill rate, and thus exp and loot) to get a healing partner and duo them. It might even be more efficient to just melee them, at least the HGs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, melee with offer much more DT then bowing will. Maybe thats what efficent means</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ElrathhSTree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I mean by efficent is by being worth the time in exp and money. If I get less exp and loot than I would get soloing or grouping in the same time, then it is efficent.</div></div><hr />
