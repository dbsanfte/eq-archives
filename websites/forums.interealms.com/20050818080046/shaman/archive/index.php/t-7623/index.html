<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Currently lvl36 myself, and need to move on from the steady diet of Snow Cougars in IC.  From lvl33-35 they're good exp (generally getting 3-4% exp for every 2 kills), so I'm kinda in the same boat.  I was going to check the ULthorks in EW or possibly head to OT and solo tigers, sarnak and succulent.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to think of better alternatives?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about Overthere? I know, I know, yuck. But it's a staple. Also, I've never been here, but a friend here at work highly recommends it: Kaesora (http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/kaesora.html).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ulthork hunters are quite nice for that level. They're not too nasty but are good for working mele skills. Good exp and good loot. They occasionaly drop a tusk, save them and head to Cobalt Scar with 'em. Turn in four of them to the Othmir Chief Kalan and he'll return a gem with about a 25% chance of it being a Blue Diamond. (Last time I looked BD's were still going for 1500-2000 a pop in the Bazzar.) Last time I headed up there to hunt some Ulthork's there were like 4 or 5 high level druids and wizards farming ulthorks though. :( Reminded me of the Mamoths in EF way too much.  If you're an Ogre or Troll I'd really recomend hitting the lizards in front of CT. Bind in Oggok in front of a merchant because you'll be overloaded with Fine Steel in no time. The exp is incredible (newbie zone bonus) and they frequently drop fine steel making it nicely profitable hunting. You can easily single pull the corner lizards off the pyramid closest to the bridge over the river. Also if it's open the three spawn on the north tip are single pulls also. They have low HP/Ac and go down prety easy with just a slow and mele except for the Tae Ew Justicar/ Justicator. These guys are worth note; they're a cleric mob with 200+ HP nukes and they self heal. Major pain. They're real good practice for learning how to deal with self healing mobs. Mele, heal yourself, and wait for them to start healing, bash, interupt and nuke to finish off. The timing's tricky and they forced me to gate because of low mana more than once, but they're totaly doable at 37. If you're adventurous or can find a guide to show ya around Crystal Caverns is totaly awesome at that level, good experience and loot, but I'd recomend against just wandering around down there alone if you don't know the area, way too easy to get gang mobed if invis drops while looking around. (Been there, done that; and nothing's more fun than a CR in an unknown dungeon trying to backtrack down unknown twists and turns :).) Good luck and good huntin'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bereg Spiritbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">CT lizards sound fun.  I have had success in Eastern Wastes on Ulthorks when its not too crowded.  Just one farmer will make the exp crawl though, as you spend yer time looking for something to kill.<br />
<br />
Any reason that Vah Shir could not do CT pyramid area?  Not sure of my faction in the region though.  With a PoK book to the area, should not be too big a trick to bind at the merchant/bank area in PoK and pop up there to sell, then book it back down.  At what levels do the exps slow enough to want to look elsewhere? Will it go to 40, when I can move to DL for the grouping there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With the PoP books now I can't see any reason at all why a Vah Shir can't do the lizards. I did them to 39 and at 39 the exp seemed to drop some and I was ready for a change of scenery so I headed to the Commons to hunt some Druids and Guards. (BTW for you evils out there the money and exp at the Druid ring in West Commons is very, very nice if you can get the rythem down on hunting them.) Hope this helps ya', good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 37 , I found a fun place to xp solo. Ssra basement to kill the slaves, it was safe and very descent XP. It can probably be done before level 37 too.<br />
<br />
only need to stay away from the named taskmasters, so get invised and run down to slaves quaters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  ....not. Hardly a safe zone at 37.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well, once you are in slaves quaters, it is safe.<br />
<br />
going there is not easy if you don't know the place.<br />
<br />
<br />
by safe, I meant that slaves can be very easily pulled solo, almost never resist a spell and are not kos (no faction there).<br />
 I never died there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The &quot;sweet spot&quot; in FV (loc - pos 3500, neg 2400-ish).<br />
<br />
This spot flat out rocks. I have gone from 34 to 37 here and it is simply amazing. <br />
<br />
Drolvargs, Frogloks, Venemous Lampreys, and Frenzied Leeches abound here. Single pulls are easy, but you have to watch out for the Frogloks, they blend in very well with the terrain and can surprise you at times, and most of them are shamans so it can get hairy. Having the pet makes dealing with more than one shaman a lot easier.<br />
<br />
The loot is decent too. Lichenclover and Honey Berry (for new LoY tradeskills), FS and Bronze weapons and armor, canines for FV faction, decent plat, and a few gems and jewelry here and there.<br />
<br />
In two KEI length sessions last night I went from 52% into level 35 to 4% into level 37. It was steady killing with no one else in sight. Just me and the dog laying waste to the mobs.<br />
<br />
Recommendations:<br />
<br />
1. Get KEI and a druid Pot(G, 9) buff. No real need for Virtue or Aego, but the mana regen on the druid buffs really helps if you can get it.<br />
<br />
2. Don't wander out too far from the camp for pulls. You can easily turn around with your pull only to find that 2 or 3 Froglok shamans have wandered into your path behind you. And as we know, one shaman is enough to ruin your day; 2 or 3 is a downright nightmare. It's best to just sit tight for a bit and let the mobs wander close to your camp.<br />
<br />
3. Give the stones around the camp a wide berth as the frogloks are small and can easily be hidden behind them as they will run around and stop for short periods. I was surprised a couple times on my first visit here. Not to beat a dead horse, but Froglok shamans=trouble.<br />
<br />
Tips:<br />
<br />
1. For good races, Red Eye Jack is a rogue NPC who wanders near the sweet spot occasionally. He's not too tough to solo (I killed him at 33), but he hits pretty hard and will agro without blinking.<br />
<br />
2. For evil races, there is a barbarian NPC that also wanders near the sweet spot. I can't recall his name right off, but he will agro on you just as Red Eye will on the good guys.<br />
<br />
3. An Ancient Jarsanth (Iksar skeleton) will also show up from time to time. He conned red to me at 35 and when I tried to take him, it didn't work out at all. He didn't cast so I was able to easily zone into Swamp of no Hope, but I didn't make a dent in him. He doesn't get too close so isn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
4. The Drolvargs drop &quot;a canine&quot; which can be turned in (4 at a time) to Captain Nealith in the FV outpost for faction, xp, coin, and a food item which is &quot;a hearty meal.&quot; If your FV faction is important, loot up.<br />
<br />
5. The Frogloks run very fast when low health. Have root or instill up in case they get too close to leaving the spot.<br />
<br />
6. You will only get social agro from like mobs. If a Drolvarg and Froglok are standing side-by-side, you can safely tag one or the other and only that one will come to you. Frogs don't help dogs, and dogs don't help frogs, and the leeches and lampreys do their own thing as well.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Depends on tweakness, but Gunthak has treated me well (even ventured into Dulak zone edge). Was soloing very successfully here at 38. Go to the Nadox zone (lava river entrance). Just before zone is a safe spot - no wanderers come that far, 2 mobs spawn nearby (and don't add to attacking the other), can pull from main tunnel without adds.<br />
<br />
EW - kodiaks work well (HQ pelt sells for 750ish on AB server - Coldain Ring quest).<br />
<br />
Echo is ok too - but usually overcamped on AB.<br />
<br />
Stayed away from DL and DSP - too crazy busy to make worthwhile.</div></div><hr />
