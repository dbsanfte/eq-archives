Well both :) Hrothgar is a 99 birthday too... took me lets see... 6months to register for the crucible hehe <br />
<br />
Well congrats on dat der mojopoker Hrothy.<br />
<br />
I guess old school would be those that remember when Shaman had full charm, plague did 5000 damage, no pets and we were waiting for winged courier (doh). Also no shrunken Trolls running around either. Can't forget, alchemy was way broken, what it still is, why you must be kidding me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Congrats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mucho grats there Hrothy. About @#!#$$%@! time.<br />
<br />
Wait a sec, I think I just saw Satan skating to work.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grats foo! /pets the barb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gratz Hrothgar!<br />
<br />
Well I beat you out by a few weeks in getting my spear, but I'm also one of the few even older school that you. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Munkee Bizness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i think ive got ya beat there hrothy been here about as long as you i think and still no epic (lots of bad luck, dont ask)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">GRATZ!  I've had mine for a while but I'm very old school EQ, made Ash in Aug 99 and had started EQ in June (went through 4 lvl 10 characters before I found the joy that is being a shaman)...just took me forever to run across the Crucible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">LOL...<br />
<br />
um...<br />
<br />
you want me to answer that cappi? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You got the icky old models on, blech!<br />
<br />
But still, congrats!  That's quite an accomplishment!  Getting our epic is not as easy as people make it out to be and there's no shame in getting it later in your shaman's life -- important thing is, you got it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, my shaman has a September 99 birthday as well, but since he went on hiatus for over a year at level 5, I don't think he counts as 'old school'.<br />
<br />
I did, however, finish my epic last Thursday night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">GRATS!!!  Took me ferever too :p<br />
<br />
Naagruz &lt;==== never went to school</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I started playing in October of 99..finally got my wife's shaman's (mine now) epic early sunday morning.  Official birthday of Cagna is December 21st 1999 23:51:06<br />
<br />
So I guess that makes me the last :)<br />
<br />
Took getting to 60 and 18 AA points before we were powerful enough to do it with 5 people (minus the tear...which kinda fell into my lap)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">heh, congrats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Still not epiced here......<br />
<br />
Lost my first login here.... but this one is pretty ol.d...<br />
<br />
Also I quit and gave away my original shaman that didnt have his epic....<br />
<br />
All but the last two kills.... 8(.... had the tear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tantobourne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've had Tant since May 10th, 1999.  I took close to a year's break in playing up until last week when I fell of the boat and back into Norrath.<br />
<br />
I was 52 when I left but after leaving my account with a guildmate, Tant is back to 45 with half of his gear stripped and guildless.  Fortunately I have everything for the Epic up until the Hole.  Anyhow moaning aside, if May 10th, '99 qualifies as old school then I'm one of the few who doesn't have his spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Royganth SpiritFang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Congratulations!<br />
<br />
No, you aren't the last.  I don't have mine yet.  I am at the Hole part now.<br />
<br />
Roy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">W00t Hrothy. That rocks.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned the old models.. well.. frankly.. <br />
<br />
old model barbs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new model barbs. Hands down.<br />
<br />
Luclin model barbs look like drunken rednecks. I loathe them with all my being. And it just looks even worse when they move or cast.. ugh.<br />
<br />
Old school barbs are tall and handsome, and have the l33t texas caddy style cow horn helmets!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Can everyone do me a favor and turn on the new ikky models?  They are just way better than the old ones =)<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: Oh and congrats Hroth!  I remember you from the old days when I was playing my Troll SK Inimicus. I still see you around from time to time but not recently anyway .. now I'm playing my new(old) shaman and am having WAY more fun than I did with my druid/enchanter/sk/necro.  Shaman kick butt it just sucks it took me this long to come back to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Gratzi Hx. Fennin powa~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tevek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">old models pwn</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, and new Erudites look like a ghetto coons, I hate them!<br />
<br />
Hurray for double standards!</div></div><hr />
