<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Musaceae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've managed to get my Shammy up to 42, and was just wondering what kind of armour I should be looking for...  This is my first, and pretty well only character, so I'm on a bit of a budget.  As of now, I'm still wearing mostly totemic, which doesn't seem to be bad gear.  If at all possible I'd like to quest/hunt for some new armour, since I'm still pretty poor, and prices on my server (The Rathe) seem to be on the high side.  Any advice would be great, thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 42 you could get a head-start on coldain/dragon faction by hunting the zone lines in Kael.  I'm not sure if zone line mobs drop the giant scalemail armor, but I think I remember them dropping it.  Most pieces have decent ac and some hitpoints, some even have a few wis.  If you want to quest armor, you could look into the twilight sea class armor quests; they're generally suited for roughly level 45ish soloers/groups.  I'd also look in the bazaar; you can modify your search by looking for (for example) only troll shaman items with +hitpoints, and search for each slot.  This will show you the best &quot;bang for the buck&quot; items you can get, assuming you like gear with hitpoints.  If you don't, go make a druid :D  Some suggestions off the top of my head are... coterie general cloak, dusty soriz boots, sarnak battle shield - all under 500pp and have 40hp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ry'Gorr and Kylong are generally dirt cheap and pretty nice upgrades to most Totemic.  There is also quite a bit of nice gear coming out of LoY that is inexpensive.<br />
<br />
The bazaar is a goldmine for starting shammies and you just need to spend a little time searching for items in your price range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Man, my server (Terris-Thule) must be way out of wack (economy wise). I looked for over a week, and had to get my SBS for about 1K.  Anyway, I agree that Kylong or Ry'gorr are a nice way to go, and you MAY find a fairly cheap Polished Tin Mail Shirt too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shand:  I've bought and sold SBSes for 700-900 multiple times, seen them for even less sometimes.  The trick to bazaar is, go there during prime time, check prices, then hit it during off peak hours, when more afk mules are there...then check during prime time again.  Only buy if it's a really great deal (unless it's a really rare item that you hardly ever see in bazaar).  Just don't be hasty and buy something the first time you search for it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I've bought/sold multiple SBSes because I have a bad relationship with my twinks...one week they're twinked...next week I sell them off and buy a 100k drogmor or get alchemy up or something...and eventually the cycle starts over again.   :p</div></div><hr />

im on FV, maybe its the lack of no drop items, but i been looking to get a sarnak to upgrade my clay guardian, and the cheapest i seen one was 1800 i believe, which i think is a little bit rediculous for only a few more ac and hitpoints. under 1k, its all mine, 1800 no thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Please list your armor, by slot, or alternatively, create a magelo account (go to www.magelo.com) and link it in your signature. Without seeing what you are wearing, it is hard to guess what to suggest to upgrade.<br />
<br />
Certainly at 42, you need to upgrade from totemic. Assuming you are wearing totemic in the slots that you can, here are some basic / cheap suggestions<br />
<br />
Head: Metal linked crown<br />
Chest: Tin mail shirt<br />
Arms: Jaundiced bone (bazaar 300 plat)<br />
Wrist1: Jarsarth (free, loot in KC)<br />
Wrist2: Coldain Military (quest)<br />
Hands: Leaf scale (often free loot in PoN, but level restricted, so buy in bazaar 100 - 150plat), crystal chitin gauntlets (600 plat, bazaar)<br />
Legs: Jarsarth (free, loot in KC) or Kromriff military (quest)<br />
Feet: Jaundiced bone (bazaar 300 plat), wolf fur bootie-slippers (epic quest) <br />
<br />
Here are a few other cheapish upgrade &quot;guesses&quot;<br />
Ears: Earring of twisted bark (250plat, bazaar)<br />
Face: Crystal spider Eyes (300 plat, bazaar)<br />
Neck: Imbued Ivory Collar (250plat, bazaar)<br />
Fingers: 6Ac65hp<br />
Shoulders: Elder wolf hide (hard camp in Hollowshade), tattered mantle (200plat bazaar)<br />
Back: Wet Thorn Cloak (500 plat, bazaar) Totemic cloak (quest), Acrylia studded cloak<br />
Waist: Chitinous belt (500 plat, bazaar)<br />
Shield: Sarnak Battle Shield (600 plat, bazaar)<br />
Range: Beginners magic manual (quest, buy the required baked item in bazaar, 150 - 200 plat)<br />
<br />
If you give more info on your gear, i will give better advice)</div></div><hr />
