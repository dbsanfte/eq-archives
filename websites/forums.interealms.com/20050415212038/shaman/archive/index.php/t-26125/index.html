<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">c.c. Medicine Cabinet, but I wanted everyone to see this so I &quot;baited&quot; the title, heh. <br />

From the &quot;Panther Parse vs Katta Banker&quot; or something thread, still makes me laugh OUT LOUD.<br />

May allah infest your lower hairnest with a plague of a thousand camel ticks, Grizlor! May angry men of various sets of religious belief and ethnic backgrounds spit upon you for the boisterous heathen you are! May someone drop-kick your favorite ninja turtle toy into the backyard of your fat neighbor who has that small, yappy hairmop dog that bites everyone and poops all over the place, so that you may never again have him kick Shredder's ass and are forced to rely upon the other three, suckier ninja turtles!<br />
<br />
Damn you for posting useful information! Damn you for taking the time out of your day to provide ingrateful schmucks with information that makes their e-peens both inflate and throb with DPS-happiness! And then HOW DARE YOU allow them to go limp, by bringing upon this house of spirits and spells a fiery shame like the rash I got my from my ex-girlfriend that keeps itching, no matter how much of that antiseptic cream the doctor gave me I apply!</div></div><hr />
