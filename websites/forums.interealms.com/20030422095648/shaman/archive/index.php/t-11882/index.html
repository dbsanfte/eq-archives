Our very freedom and ability to post on a stupid message board is because of their sacrifices.<br />

Course, idiots like this Hadd fellow will curse and use a voodoo doll against the US, but our good will will overcome his treachery.<br />

However you feel about the war with Iraq, our service people need and deserve our prayers and respect.  God be with all of you.</div></div><hr />

The service people of the U.S/U.K and even the supposed &quot;enemy&quot; Iraqis and the civillians alike. Let's hope this is quick and with as little blood shed on all sides.<br />

We'll never make the world a &quot;better place&quot; the best we can possibly hope for is it doesn't get any worse.<br />

Think about what hippies are saying, they oppose war, but the simple fact they can voice dissent is BECAUSE we went to war.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dirty scumbag hypocrits. Instead of burning flags, they should use their non-working asses to help some children or veterans.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would love to drive a friggin M1-A2 through a protest of hippies, get some scumbag traitor grease on them wheels. If I ever see in person somone badmouth the US I will drive my fist down their throats and stomp on their heads.<br />
<br />
<br />
People are dying for freedom, all those opposed should go live in their beloved Iraq and see how fun it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just a few random quotes for Millman to maybe see why those &quot;Dirty scumbag flag  burning hypocritical scumbag traitorous hippies&quot; are doing what they do. <br />
<br />
<br />
Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.<br />
<br />
Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.<br />
<br />
George Washington (1732 - 1799)<br />
<br />
                ----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
We confide in our strength, without boasting of it; we respect that of others, without fearing it.<br />
<br />
The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive.<br />
<br />
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.<br />
<br />
Reason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against error.<br />
<br />
My views and feelings (are) in favor of the abolition of war--and I hope it is practicable, by improving the mind and morals of society, to lessen the disposition to war; but of its abolition I despair.<br />
<br />
A little rebellion now and then...is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government.<br />
<br />
Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.<br />
<br />
I have seen enough of one war never to wish to see another.<br />
<br />
Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.<br />
<br />
The will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government, and to protect its free expression should be our first object.<br />
<br />
Thomas Jefferson (1743 - 1826)<br />
<br />
                                 -------------------------------<br />
<br />
Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.<br />
<br />
Here is the answer which I will give to President Roosevelt... We shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the sudden shock of battle nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and exertion will wear us down. Give us the tools and we will finish the job.<br />
<br />
Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter. The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events.<br />
<br />
The greatest lesson in life is to know that even fools are right sometimes.<br />
<br />
To build may have to be the slow and laborious task of years. To destroy can be the thoughtless act of a single day.<br />
<br />
 You ask, What is our policy? I will say; &quot;It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us: to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy.&quot; You ask, What is our aim? I can answer with one word: Victory - victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival.<br />
<br />
One day President Roosevelt told me that he was asking publicly for suggestions about what the war should be called. I said at once 'The Unnecessary War'.<br />
<br />
Sir Winston Churchill (1874 - 1965)<br />
<br />
<br />
I've not trawled through and taken pro or anti-war stances but anything that trys to give light why people are divided. I pray that one day the waging of war upon another brother is consigned to the dark pages of history. Alas though I fear it shall forever be scribed upon the first and last pages.<br />
<br />
Let future genrations not judge us to harshly for we where young  and foolish.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Umm, somethign you need to know, Churchill called it the unnecessary war because he advocated taking care of Hitler in the 30's, no one would listen to him. JUST LIKE HUSSEIN NOW!!!, we don't take him out, sooner or later, he will kill Americans, and he always kills Iraqis, where are the stupid crunchy ass protesters when Iraqi people are murdered, raped and tortured?<br />
<br />
<br />
If people would have kicked Hitler's ass early, 55 million people wouldnt have been killed, so dont take Winston's words and try to turn them in to a protest, Churchill kicked ass. His grandson was interviewed lately, and he is way pissed off at the French and stuff too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes, you need to beat some ass, Hussein is like a rabid dog, you don't wait untill he bites somone, you put him down.<br />
<br />
Churchill rules, he wouldn't take any of this crap, he would be an even stronger supporter of Bush then Blair, and I love Blair.<br />

 I fail to see your point, you quoted a Great leader, without knowing what he meant, you proved my point for me in fact.<br />
<br />
 Chruchill knew that sometimes, you need to kick ass before a tradgedy, instead of after. But, hopefully the next terrorist attack is against a huge peace rally, boy would that be funny.<br />
