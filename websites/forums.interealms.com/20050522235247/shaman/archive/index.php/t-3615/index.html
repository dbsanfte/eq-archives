<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jedafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wanting to know when I can expect to pull singles in front area of CoM (entrance, stables) etc...Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i went there at level 48 and I could single pull about 80-90% or so. basically, if there are two dark blue mobs near eachother, prepare to get adds almost all the time. light blue can all be singled, but they're not too good for xp of course.<br />
<br />
i could keep the whole front area clear, was pretty decent xp and if you clear it out you can pull as they spawn and avoid adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">52 or 53 I believe you can single pull all the mobs until the locked door.  But as a shaman, you can solo with relative ease much earlier than that, just be prepared to root park.  I spent about six levels soloing in CoM, and I had pretty good success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you need to be 11 levels higher than the mobs you dont want to pull, to single pull a mob in any zone.<br />
<br />
that should give you a pretty good idea.  I don't know the exact levels of the front mobs, and I don't know how you would find that out, but if you have some lower level friends you could ask them to come con them for you and that would give you an idea.  <br />
<br />
or a much simpler solution would be to go up and try it.  If you get 2, then zone out and try to pull the other one, if you always get 2 then you are way under level to single pull and you will have to do things like root park, pet park etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Should be no prob, unless you get within agro range of some of the undead.  Even green, they still try to attack sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Skellis dont assist Golems. Golems dont assist Golems. Skellies assist skellies. Ghosts assist ghosts. Ghosts dont assist Golems.<br />
<br />
That is all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Alandrel Mesmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can single pull past most mobs in COM at 54. Before then you will get assists most places.<br />
<br />
Exceptions to this are mist golems, most phantoms, wraiths, and greater war boned skeletons. These can all be level 45-48 and will assist if you are 54. Of course you can pull them past other lower-level mobs with no problems.<br />
<br />
Goo's are kind of a big unknown as they can vary in range with no name change.<br />
<br />
Harmony pulling works very well in COM and can be done by any ranger or druid who has the spell. Ranger's make pretty good partners in COM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">58 is the magic level for pulling sky goo's off the invis path.  Takes some patience and skill but can easily be done without raining goo'd from the upper level onto your head at 58.  <br />
<br />
Not the answer you were looking for but everyone else covered that. :)</div></div><hr />
