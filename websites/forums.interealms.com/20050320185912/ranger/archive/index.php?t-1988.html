<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that Al Gore has no job, he decided to take a sightseeing vacation to Europe. While visiting England, he is invited to tea with the Queen. <br />
<br />
He asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround herself with intelligent people. <br />
<br />
He asks how she knows if they're intelligent. &quot;I do so by asking them the right questions,&quot; says the Queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me to demonstrate.&quot; She phones Tony Blair and says, &quot;Mr. Prime Minister. Please answer this question: &quot;Your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or sister. Who is it?&quot;<br />
  <br />
Tony Blair responds, &quot;It's me, ma'am.&quot;<br />
  <br />
&quot;Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir,&quot; says the Queen. She hangs up and says, &quot;Did you get that, Mr. Gore?&quot;<br />
  <br />
&quot;Yes ma'am. Thanks a lot. I'll definitely be using that!&quot; Upon returning home, he decides he'd better put some of his old friends to the test. He calls Bill Clinton and says, &quot;Hi, Bill, I wonder if you can answer a question for me.&quot;<br />
  <br />
&quot;Why, of course, Al. What's on your mind?&quot;<br />
  <br />
&quot;Uhh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?&quot;<br />
  <br />
Clinton hems and haws and finally asks, &quot;Can I think about it and get back to you?&quot;<br />
  <br />
Gore agrees, and Clinton hangs up. Clinton immediately calls members of his old staff, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody can come up with an answer. <br />
<br />
Finally, in desperation, Clinton calls Colin Powell at the State Department and explains his problem. &quot;Now look here, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child<br />
is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?&quot;<br />
  <br />
Powell answers immediately, &quot;It's me, of course, you idiot.&quot;<br />
  <br />
Much relieved, Clinton rushes back to call Gore and exclaims, &quot;I know the answer, sir! I know who it is! It's Colin Powell!&quot;<br />
  <br />
And Gore replies in disgust, &quot;Wrong, it's Tony Blair.&quot;<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

George Bush was watching a foot ball game when he decided he wanted something to eat.  He rummage around for a while and finally decided on some nutrious pretzals.  He began to snarf the pretzals when one got caught in his throat.  He then proceeded to black out, and became our only president to injure himself with a snack food.  Of course, this had nothing to do with his heavy &quot;recreational&quot; drinking.<br />

<br />
Sorry but luck only goes so far.  Sure he may not be the best speaker or even an Einstein but the guy knows enough to surround himself with well educated people in their respective areas.<br />
<br />
Clinton on the other led us into recession, let Bin Laden get away several times, had a countless military decisions that were blunders, and was the laughing stock of the world cause he cheated on his wife.  More over with advisors like Janet Reno who totally blew the Branch Dividian incident, the Elian incident in Florida, or Al Gore who couldn't tell a story straight if his life depended on it (invented the internet anyone?).  Sorry but Clinton as an intelligent President is a myth.. Clinton as a panty raider would be more accurate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surrounding yourself with smart people isn't rocket science. You talk to a potential advisor for awhile, then when he says something that confuses you, boom there you go someone smarter than you.<br />
<br />
Clinton's personal life has absolutely nothing to do with his presidential ability.<br />

<br />
First the enonomy was fine until he became President. Then it dropped like a stone off a bridge. If the war on terrorism is going so well why is Osama still out there and why haven't we gone after an other cells in other contries and as for Isreal we have done nothing but talk. Do I think he won the election yes do i think he's a smart man no Clinton was much smart his own father was much smarter. For the record i'm nether democrat or republican I am a true indepenent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
umm guess again... we were well down the road to recession before Bush took office.<br />
<br />
In another thread I posted about the economy turning around you can see a chart of the GDP to prove it.<br />
<br />
Might want to get your facts right.<br />
<br />
Clinton's personal life has absolutely nothing to do with his presidential ability <br />
<br />
You know democrats saying that but then they are the first to try and persecute republicans who have shadier lives.  Make up your minds folks.  Either it applies to everyone or nobody.<br />
<br />
Also if personal lives don't matter to the presidency or for that matter then why do so many people thing that it does.  More over if personal lives are of no import then why do people watch Bush like Hawk for signs of drinking?  Or questioned his drug use when he was younger.  You got a nice hypocritical double standard there Vader and you might want to think it through before making it.<br />
<br />
Further more if personal lifestyles don't affect how well someone can do a job then why is that many jobs of import (bankers, accountants, lawyers, judges, doctors, high security programmers,) have to take tests which ask them very personal things like have you ever stole before?  have you ever cheated on your wife?   or they come up with hypothetical moral situations and expect a certain answer or else they don't hire you.<br />
<br />
Trust me folks personal lives DO affect a persons ability to do a job.  Its like that in several industries especially industries related to leadership positions or positions of financial responsibility or positions where de corum(sp?) is expected to be at its utmost.<br />
<br />
A president would qualify for ALL those facets and in a single job.  So now why is it when ALL of them are combine that personal life doesn't matter?<br />
<br />
As far as Bin Laden escaping Aye perhaps there have been a few errors.  Perhaps he is already dead nobody is certain yet.  But Bush had to go get him out of a sympathetic country where as Clinton had an OFFER from another country who was willing detain him and ship him to us shortly after the Cole incident.  He ignored the offer and let the madman loose.<br />
<br />
More over Bush military endeavors up to this point have been performed with high quality and clear objectivity.  And he is using an Army that is badly in need of parts and recources cause the Clinton administration randomly used the military without replenishing it.<br />
<br />
As far as Isreal is concern what do you expect him to do?  Talk is currently the avenue people wish to see pursued.<br />
<br />
I suppose we could drop down some armored bridaged and air units and just mow down the west bank but Isreal could do that themselves if they wanted.  Or are you one of the Anti-jews and think the US should go and mow down the Isrealis?<br />
<br />
At any rate Bush didn't get as far as he did by being stupid.  He has made some great calls from what I can tell so far as president and when he was governer of Texas, we enjoyed a lot of prosperity and good results from his administration.<br />
<br />
So you may disagree with his policies his choices or direction but they are all carefully thought out in conjunction with some of the brightest American leaders available at the president's request.<br />
<br />
And as history will show the rulers who picked good advisors and administrators to surround themselves usually had the best, longest and more prosperous reigns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a time in this country's distant past, maybe 15-20 years ago, when merely a credible allegation of an extra-marital affair was enough to chase an elected official from office.  Bill Clinton sure fixed that, though, now you can screw around on your wife, LIE about it in court under oath, and not only not go to jail, but still be president too.  And the lumpenproletariat will defend you.<br />

So true. I didn't, and never would, trust Clinton for one second. At least I trust Bush. Is he as smooth as Clinton? No. Is he as smart? I think yes. And I aslo think that most people viewed Clinton as so smart because he is just smooth, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

wrong imo. It has alot to do with it. At least to me it does.<br />

I really don't take a 10 yr old's oppinion on politics too seriously.<br />

I just let them have their say, and leave it at that. Why argue?<br />

A ten-year-old will probably have a poorly-formed opinion on politics, or indeed on most matters.  If so that will be obvious, and it will be easy to refute.  If you find that you can't refute a child's opinion on something...then perhaps your own need re-examination.</div></div><hr />

While I agree to an extent Venture, I would like to point out that most of the debates here are based mostly on oppinions.<br />
<br />
NOONE HAS to tell who they are, it's totally voluntary hehe. I was just interested to see where certain takes came from. If you feel like sharing, kewl, if not, kewl.<br />
<br />
I know for one why I feel the way I do, and was wondering what shapes others thoughts about things.<br />
<br />
I would expect the norm would be for say a 15 yr old person from a single parent home in low income to be totally different from a 50 yr old rich person with a complete family (poor example, but you see what I mean maybe)<br />
<br />
Of course, sometimes this don't hold water, and that would be interesting to see. I have seen it before in RL.<br />
<br />
Notice, I haven't posted on this thread about the main topic, so I really don't care one way or the other about WHAT your oppinion is on it, just wanted to see from what background it came.<br />
<br />
Side note- To me personally and the only reason I put it in, the fact that someone is a citizen and taxpayer of a country gives them much more right to criticize their country than someone who isnt' in those catagories IMHO. Course you all may disagree completely, and that okay.;)</div></div><hr />

I've been a registered Independent since the day I turned 18, but I've almost always voted Republican. In 1988, I worked on George Bush's campaign, and again in 1992. I cried the night he lost - somehow I had always held out hope that he was actually going to win in spite of the polls.<br />
<br />
With Al Gore, I was always afraid that, like Commander Data, someone would find the off switch at the wrong moment. He has no heart. Like an automoton, he meerly exists.<br />
<br />
As far as IQ is concerned, the popular opinion that Clinton's IQ is twice that of GW is completely false. The institute that supposedly did the study doesn't even exists. There is no evidence that Clinton was some super-genious, which an IQ of 182 would indicate. GW graduated from Yale and Havard - not something stupid people do.</div></div><hr />

To everyone arguing over politics... do you really think it matters?  Seriously, does it matter which Old, White, Rich guy is &quot;in charge&quot;.<br />
<br />
Which sleazeball is &quot;President of the United States&quot; affects your lives as much as which wealthy inbred is the Queen of England.<br />
<br />
As someone with a degree in Mechanical Engineering... I'm obsessed with hard facts and cold logic.  Performance should be measured according to strict, reproduceable rules.  By my calculations, Dubya is the greatest president ever because he gave me $300.<br />
<br />
... but he's still a rich, pampered, sleazeball.<br />
<br />
Of course, that description applies to every politician I can think of.<br />
<br />
Arguing over politics implies that there is a measurable difference between the candidates.  There isn't.  They're all shallow, talking-heads who will sell you out for a nice dinner at a 5-star restaraunt.<br />

Anyone telling you otherwise is working for one of them or still has misplaced faith in the shambles of the American political system.</div></div><hr />

All of those guys had affairs as well, yet are considered some of the best Presidents we've ever had...</div></div><hr />

 Originally from Arkansas and have forgotten more about Clinton then most of y'all remember.<br />
 The man was a POS! He is the only president that never gave anything back to his home state.<br />
 He blew out his knee while visiting Greg Norman in Fla, by drinking and trying to carry a co-ed down some stairs.<br />
 He sold military technology to CHINA! China! The largest communist country in the world, a government that hates us.<br />
 He rentd out the Lincoln bedroom.<br />
 The great economy had nothing to do with him. He inherited a positive economy.<br />
 One name... Jocelyn Elders. Nuff Said!<br />
 While govoner in Arkansas his people srewed up a major drug running double murder investigation. His good friend Dan Harmon who was in charge of the investigation, was one of the biggest drug runners in Arkansas.<br />
 And finally how many people that were associated with the Clintons died of mysterious deaths?<br />
 I'm not saying G.W. is a genius, but I feel he is a better man and president then Clinton.</div></div><hr />

Benjamin Franklin was never president of this country.  JFK was a mediocre president at best.  And 200-plus years after the fact, Jefferson's character is up for grabs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround herself with intelligent people. <br />
<br />
He asks how she knows if they're intelligent. &quot;I do so by asking them the right questions,&quot; says the Queen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me to demonstrate.&quot; She phones Tony Blair and says, &quot;Mr. Prime Minister. Please answer this question: &quot;Your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or sister. Who is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tony Blair responds, &quot;It's me, ma'am.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir,&quot; says the Queen. She hangs up and says, &quot;Did you get that, Bob?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma'am. Thanks a lot. I'll definitely be using that!&quot; Upon returning home, he decides he'd better put some of his old friends to the test. He calls Fred and says, &quot;Hi, Fred, I wonder if you can answer a question for me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why, of course, Fred. What's on your mind?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Fred hems and haws and finally asks, &quot;Can I think about it and get back to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Bob agrees, and Fred hangs up. Fred immediately calls members of his old college debate team, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody can come up with an answer. <br />
<br />
Finally, in desperation, Fred calls Joe (who is a smart friend employed at the State Department of Transportation) and explains his problem. &quot;Now look here, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child <br />
is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Joe answers immediately, &quot;It's me, of course, you idiot.&quot; <br />
<br />
Much relieved, Fred rushes back to call Bob and exclaims, &quot;I know the answer, sir! I know who it is! It's Joe my friend from the State Departmet of Transportation!&quot; <br />
<br />
And Bob replies in disgust, &quot;Wrong, it's Tony Blair.&quot; <br />

<br />
I'm 32 years old, currently own a steel fabrication plant where we fabricate structural steel for chemical plants, heavy industrial, power plants etc... We run anywhere from 35 to 55 employees depending on what contracts we have going at the moment.<br />
<br />
At 16 I dropped out of high school and worked minimum wage till age 22 when I moved to another state to enter college. At 28 I finished my Masters of Science degree after getting a double B.S.<br />
<br />
The first year out of college me and 2 other really close friends from college took a huge risk and bought 28,000 acres with financing help from a professor that no one wanted to mess with because one corner of it had an endangered species located on it.<br />
<br />
We sold off parts of it each month to make the monthly payment. During the meantime we cruised the timber on it everyday (7days a week) for 12+ hours a day. In the end we merchandised to the maximum that no corporate timber company never would. Every pole tree was sent to a pole station. Every clear bole was sent to a plywood mill for a clear face plywood peel.<br />
<br />
Anyway after working 7 days a week for 13 months we sold off the remaining land and held onto the endangered species part as it basically isn't worth the paper the deed is on.<br />
<br />
I took that money and bought a multi million dollar steel fabrication shop and got out of the timber industry in preperation of Al Gore to be president and kill the industry.<br />
<br />
At one point in my life I was on Food Stamps but never welfare. From the age of 16 I went from a net worth of exactly nothing to today at age 32 where I gross just a tad under 1million US a year - pay approximately $440,000 a year in federal taxes all through hard work and NO government hand outs including no college loans/grants and/or scholarships.</div></div><hr />

The institute that supposedly did the study doesn't even exists. There is no evidence that Clinton was some super-genious, which an IQ of 182 would indicate. GW graduated from Yale and Havard - not something stupid people do.[/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
While GWB did go to Yale and did graduate, it's interesting to note that he got into Yale not on his grades, but by his fathers influence.  And that he graduated with a gentleman's &quot;C&quot;, meaning they passed him, but not because he was the brainiest guy in the class.<br />

  I agree with Shiphro that American politics has lost its original ideal of &quot;anyman&quot; being able to hold office.<br />
   Even in the starting days of our country it seems that the highest offices went to those who could AFFORD them. The idea that any school kid can grow up to be the president one day has pretty much lost meaning. Unless the kid is in &quot;Uber-prep Old Money School for Future Econimic Sharks&quot; of course....then he's BOUND for greatness :)<br />
   I haven't voted since Reagan....it isn't because I don't care....it's because I don't care for any candidates I've seen since :p</div></div><hr />
