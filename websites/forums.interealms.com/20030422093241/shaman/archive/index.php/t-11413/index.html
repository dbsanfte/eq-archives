<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cmon share your spots with me... i know sister island is the best place for woodelf parts... and LOY zones drop a lot of gnome/troll meat...<br />
<br />
Where do i get for example halfling parts easy? <br />
<br />
just post all the good spots oyu know please an also the number o spawns and spawntime so we can compare them =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Got de/human/troll/ogre meat in Gunthark. Wandering though that cave, eventually you come upon a city of some type, i'd bet the mobs are 40-45th level. One of them also droped &quot;A golden trinket&quot; 4ac 7wis 7sta 7agi? neck slot clr/dru/shm.<br />
<br />
Didnt get a chance to farm up any assling or dwarf meat yet. Barbarian meat would be nice also. Don't have a spot for them as of yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What LOY zones drop gnome meat?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and I was in dulak for about 1 hour maybe... got 4 troll, 2 ogre, 2 erudite, 1 gnome, 1 iksarand 3 human.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Halfling parts drop off spiders (/boggle) in EK pretty commonly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Clearly the spiders' main food is halfling :)<br />
<br />
Like Lockjaw in the oasis drops all sorts of racial parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/info/racialdrops.htm<br />
thanks to all the people over at eqtraders there is a wonderful list of racial meat drops compiled there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I hit CB, you can get DE meats (Rare off dvinn), gnome, dwarf, wood elf, and high elf, all in the same place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yaroar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe I am bringing up something thats old, but I didnt think there was a place to farm iksar meat.  The EQ traders site does not have a listed source, and I have not seen any posted.  Important to non-iksar shaman because iksar illusion would help with the cudgel quest, and probably other quests.<br />
<br />
yet a few posts up Lenine says to have looted iksar meat in Dulak.  Can this be confirmed?  is this a new and only source known for Iksar meat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have gotton one Iksar meat to drop in Dulak's Harbor.  I've killed about a dozen Iksar, so it's not a common drop (or I've been unlucky).<br />
<br />
Iksar meat might have been added to old Iksar with the launch of LoY too.  Seems like that would be a good idea since there's a use for it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scrantoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What about Vah Shir... I can't find the listed mob in the shadeweavers zone.  any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Toon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the big raptors in shadeweavers thicket drop vah shir meat/parts, they're in the north? section, i think, i know its not the newbie section near shar vahl tunnel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Firefall Saureks are on the higher level side of Shadeweaver's Thicket.  You have to pass through the tunnels to get there.  I find most Firefalls near the tunnel to the lava area with the Firefall Guardians but they can roam the entire area.  You can use Sense Animals to help find them faster since the saureks are the only animals in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Torgiran Mines are a great spot for parts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Definitely can confirm iksar meat dropping in Dulak's Harbor, also in Gunthak just before the zone to Dulak I have looted Iksar, DE (very common here), gnome, ogre, troll, and human.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you camp the boats in Dulak, you will get a steady and varied supply of meat n parts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got 20 or 30 dark elf parts from a mage trapped in Najena getting epic bits, poor bastid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Keroppi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Barbarian meat would be nice also. Don't have a spot for them as of yet.<br />
<br />
Barb meat drops from spiders in Everfrost :) I believe its from a Gigantic Wooly Spider.  :)  Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ooh, forgot about those spiders. Thanks Keroppi!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think only the &quot;a carrion spider&quot; drop halfling parts, but I checked the vendors with the farmers around it, and there were about 35 halfling parts there. Might wanna try it =).</div></div><hr />
