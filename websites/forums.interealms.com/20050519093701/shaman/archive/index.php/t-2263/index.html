<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone else have a problem with melee balancing being innate while caster balancing is centered around a list of items?<br />
Personally I think this is a bunch of @#$%. <br />
<br />
yer pal,<br />
Ssik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems typical to me... uber of uber in future will get best as others fight over a couple good combinations of item and caster mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, it makes perfect sense. <br />
<br />
The major imbalance between casters and melee was the simple fact that the power of a melee scaled with the power of the loot they acquired while loot didn't really improve the power of casters. As weapons and armor grew better and better, the power of melee caught up with, then surpassed the power of casters.<br />
<br />
Adding in loot items that allow casters to increase their power in a meaningful way by getting new items should help redress that in the long term.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed Graal...<br />
<br />
What I think  Ssik and Hrothgar seem to be missing is the fact that the inate melee balancing that went into effect was done to balanace the melee classes among them selves, not with other classes, such as wizards or mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Graal - melee power also grew in another way - through their disciplines, which are obtained automatically with leveling.  No loot is required, not even a Chipped Bone Bracer.<br />
<br />
Both Melee and Casters now can get AA skills - which have apparently helped some classes far more than others (see other discussions on this board).<br />
<br />
It appears that VI is trying to balance casters through looted items.  It is not at all clear, as yet, how effective this will be, for those lucky enough to have the affected items in inventory already (can you tell that I am zero for 100 at this point?).  reduced mana usage in summoning a pet may be marginal, but getting another tick out of torpor may be very valuable.  overall ???<br />
<br />
Ssik is right about some of melee power growth coming from disciplines.  You are right about some of the melee power growth coming from loot.<br />
<br />
I am fine with balancing through loot only, but the AA skills, and what I have read about the focus items so far, does not lead me to believe that this will achieve balance for casters.  Here's hoping that there will be some disciplines for casters, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you know, sorta well, how should i say this?<br />
spells, those thingies we cast now and then, they're kinda innate, right? (most of them anyway, some are a tad harder to get ahold of admittedly) we get a few each expansion, right?<br />
did you see melees get any new disc's after kunark?<br />
did they get any new skills in kunark or after? no, increased power, yes, through items (keeping aa's outta this, we all get those, which gets better is another discussion)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a naked shaman at level 60, I could run through the Howling Stones with little problem. I could probably even work my way down to the Observer in Chardok. <br />
<br />
A naked warrior at level 60 couldn't make the run to Chardok, much less make it down to the Observer.<br />
<br />
Now, tell me that melee balancing has little to do with loot. Disciplines are easily countered with the fact that I can raise my HP, lower a mob's HP, make a mob attack slower, heal my dumb ass and, if all fails, make the mob stand still while I run away faster than it or its friends.<br />
<br />
However, check the difference between a level 60 warrior with a BoC and Primal, a Vex Thall BP and a buttload of NToV gear vs a level 60 warrior in assorted Cobalt and Crafted, with a Wurmslayer in one hand and a Yak in the other. The first is doing significantly more damage faster and taunting better than the second. He also has more HP and more AC.<br />
<br />
Now check the difference between a level 60 wizard (or a level 60 cleric, even) in full ToV armor and mad FT drops vs a level 60 wizard in an SMR, wearing some Netted Kelp he bought in Greater Faymart. While the first has more mana and regenerates it somewhat faster, he doesn't nuke harder and he doesn't nuke faster. The gear makes very little difference when compared to the difference the gear makes for a warrior or a ranger or a paladin or a SK, ad infintium.<br />
<br />
Leaving AAs out of this, of course. It's hard to say that our AAs or the AAs of a cleric do for us what crits, flurries, rampages, AE taunt and the like do for a warrior. :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, the purpose of this is to make it so that the power of casters will scale with equipment in the same way that the power of the melee classes scales with better equipment. This has very little to do with the idea of balancing the casting classes against one another, and everything to do with the idea of balancing casting classes as a whole with melee classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, should have been a little more clear.  What I'm sayin is that this caster balancing is in contention WITH melee abilities that were founded with RoK.  VI didn't think of the role of various classes in the post-50 era and it ended up being all meat and potatoes (warriors and clerics).  With caster balancing, they are trying to rectify this.  <br />
<br />
 did they get any new skills in kunark or after? no, increased power, yes, through items  <br />
<br />
See above.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I'd disagree.<br />
<br />
Why can't these focus abilities be innate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">because one of the most annoying things with casters is.. they dont really get better as you get better equipment. somewhat, yes but not nearly as much as a melee. i dunno about you, but i like the idea of having more choice in what equipment i should use. you want to get everything on a silverplatter, i prefer to work for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This has very little to do with the idea of balancing the casting classes against one another <br />
<br />
Hmm, I thought they were balancing caster classes to make them all more group friendly and useful in raid situations, not to actually  balance them with other classes.  Eg. balance them with the environment not vs. other classes. It used to be that pet classes couldn't use pets in high end encounters because of pet uncontrollability issues and various bugs with DoT's and the like.  Also, necros have gotten their target-debuff/group-buff spells to make them more viable in group situations (yay mindwrack!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's another thing about all this. Don't you feel like you are now going to be forced to wear certain items just because of the effect? I understand that they aren't done putting focus on higher end items in the game yet, but I don't like being forced to wear things, just because of the effect.  I feel like such a slave to fashion wearing 7AC boots just because they have FT III on em.  *grumble*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yea, agreed, i'm assuming this lasts a whole 5-6-7 days tho :) i can live with that(no, i'm not wearing a dain cloak, i'm not i'm not i'm not! I WONT! )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Innate caster improvements....<br />
<br />
Removing the non-cleric healing penalty....<br />
<br />
Hmmm....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">good point :)<br />
thats one improvement i want<br />
<br />
&lt;==bored, clicking refresh and waiting for servers to come up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;reduced mana usage in summoning a pet may be marginal, but getting another tick out of torpor may be very valuable. &quot;<br />
<br />
These focus effects will not increase the duration of Torpor, which is 24 seconds in duration. Extended enhancement only affects buffs which are 36 seconds or greater. Torpor, celestial cleansing, celestial healing, and celestial elixir are unaffected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you feel like you are now going to be forced to wear certain items just because of the effect? I understand that they aren't done putting focus on higher end items in the game yet, but I don't like being forced to wear things, just because of the effect. &quot;<br />
<br />
Now you feel the double edge sword that is enhancement through gear. I have an AC 10 belt with some crappy stats, yet I still wear it. Why? It has the effect: haste on it. Melee learned to deal with this a long, long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No melee learned to deal with this a long long long time ago. <br />
But melee learned that now the best items also have the best effects a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ever heard of the FBSS? It is an item with haste that has no stats, no hp, and no AC. That was the absolute best waist item for melees until Vox and Naggy were first killed.<br />
<br />
How many melees wear items that have crappy stats just for the effect? Hint: think Aura of Battle items.<br />
<br />
It's called a tradeoff. If you are replacing an item that you have worn for a while, you are doing so because the new item will increase your power. Will you argue that statement? Worse case scenario, you don't get any stronger than you are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">right on. But the top tier items now have the best effects for melee. They have to make ZERO sacrifices. <br />
<br />
I understand that vi has promised to put these effects on upper tier items for casters too but I am not going to get my hopes up. <br />
<br />
There doesnt seem to be any guidance from people who play this game day in and day out as to what items should have effects and what those effects should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There are a lot of focus items out there now, and multiple choices for each effect. Some of them aren't great items for us (ie. dain cloak, sarnak arcane fetish,etc), but there are plenty of effect level 3 items coming from ntov for example, and even a few good ones from Luclin.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, I was a bit miffed when I saw my bracer was now a hot necromancer item, but I was happy with it when it didn't have any effects on it at all /shrug.<br />
<br />
It's not as if someone's forcing you to change gear, its purely optional. I just hope they fix the bugs. I have a spell haste item as part of my primary gear, and the displayed casting time of all my spells is now 0.0. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I thought caster balancing was supposed to make casters more desirable in groups.  My exp. group has a Cleric, Shaman and warrior as a core.  We look for a chanter and two additional melees.<br />
<br />
Necro's, mage's druids etc?  No thanks.<br />
<br />
So now after the introduction of these focus items - which apparently are going to be irrelevent to non-uber players in the high level game - its Necro's, mage's druids etc?  No thanks.<br />
<br />
If caster balancing is what I think its supposed to be, then its not working as intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Focus with SCR Mastery lasts 36 seconds. Anyone with the skill have an extended enhancement item to see if it is a 2100hp heal now?<br />
<br />
Jormal Dawnhammer<br />
Oracle of Winter<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&gt;Focus with SCR Mastery lasts 36 seconds.<br />
<br />
hehe, I think you mean Topor(24) with SCR(+50%) last 36 seconds (6 tick,300hp/tick )<br />
<br />
<br />
These focus effects will not increase the duration of Torpor, which is 24 seconds in duration. Extended enhancement only affects buffs which are 36 seconds or greater. Torpor, celestial cleansing, celestial healing, and celestial elixir are unaffected. <br />
<br />
read again at castersrealm, Duration Focus Items only not work for Invulnerability and Complete Heal spells and don't have cast time limit, I think their information is right<br />
<br />
Extended Enhancement  + 15% Spell Duration which will give less than one tick (24 x 15% = 3.6 second); so it won't give extra tick untill full 6 second; but it will extended the duration on other spell<br />
<br />
since Extended Enhancement(+ 15%) have same % as 8th shawl so it should stack with SCR<br />
<br />
those difference type of focus item is best way to balance caster, there are many melee have weapon/haste in each expansion that increase their power by double, or triple. it is good start to have varies effect to enchanted spell, I am sure it will have higher % effect in future expansion, maybe Extended Enhancement IV, V and VI ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow, does this mean that there is actually someone at VI that knows how to use a calculator??<br />
<br />
36 * 1.15 = 41.4<br />
37 * 1.15 = 42.55<br />
<br />
So they probably wanted to say &quot;buffs which are 36 seconds or less wont be affected&quot;. But its close enough to be impressive :)</div></div><hr />
