<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tuvo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looking for some advice here.  I have started questing for my epic, determined to do as much of it solo as I can, and have run into some problems initially.  I have killed Surestout, talked with the Drunken Shaman in Freeport, talked to the greater spirit in Freeport, travelled to Erud's Crossing and spoken to the lovely Ooglyn, and followed her down into the ocean nearby to speak to the various other NPC's who claim to be &quot;waiting&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Therein lies my problem.  While waiting for the last NPC in the sequence to spawn, (Abe the Abandoned), I was attacked by a shark.  Since I hadn't even seen a shark around me to this point, I was taken a bit by surprise, and was not successful in killing it.  I had to leave the spawn point in order to survive, and therefore I think I broke the chain of events that make up that part of the quest, The Test of Patience.<br />
<br />
My question is, do I have to start completely over?  I can't see any way around it, because I am afraid that Ooglyn won't lead me back down to the spawn point to complete that part of the quest unless I hand her the gem I got from the greater spririt in Freeport.  The only way to get that is to talk to the Drunken Shaman, and to get him to talk, I'll have to ....blah blah blah, you know where I am going, I'll have to start at the beginning with Surestout again, correct?<br />
<br />
Is there any way to get around this?  I know I don't really have all that much time invested as yet, but I would like to know, just to save time and also so I will know better how to handle similar setbacks which might happen to me later in the quest.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be able to just say 'You can buy booze', or whatever it is to the freeport guy and start from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And keep Invis to Animals on yourself constantly while doing the test of patience.  No more shark attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you do have to start over, go to the bandit camp in Butcherblock Mtns. and kill Pegleg.  Pegleg is just like Surestout and is a starter for the Shammy Epic.  With Pegleg you dont have to worry about any adds. I also believe Pegleg spawns alot faster also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe you can start with the line to the barbarian again as mentioned above.  When I did this quest around level 30 I did 2 big things.  One was keep inv to animals up.  Two was to levitate and sit at the top of the ocean just above water peaking my head in at the line that allows you to see in water.  I was able to see sharks swimming by and also just wait for the right guy to pop.  When it was clear I spoke to him and got out of there as fast as I could.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also, patience is the right word for this test. If I remember correctly, it was almost exactly 60 minutes from talking to Ooglyn to getting the stupid arrow (since deleted) and gem for the next step. I sat on the bottom and kept Enduring Breath and Invis to Animals up. Also, I looked around every few minutes to see if the coast was clear and cast invis to animals at such time. Not too useful to have it wear off right when a shark is overhead. I saw a shark three times during hour. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah, i ended up having to redo that part three different times cause of the stupid shark.  The funny and sad thing is...that the last time that I did it..I was not able to see any of the stupid guys down there cause of a problem with my view and I lost track of where I should have been.  I heard a few of them talking..however the only one that I actually ended up seeing was the spirit.  Oh, and the time before that when I was doing it... the stupid server got shut down on me.  It was an announced shutdown on just my server that got announced that I had an hour left when I was in my first 30 min of the wait.  By the time that Abe had popped it said that I had 15 min left..and frickin 2 min later the server shut down and I lost that freaking 45 min worth of waiting for nothing.  Pissed me off and of course, I tried petitioning for it since they shut them down almost 15 min early..but nothing happened cause of it.</div></div><hr />
