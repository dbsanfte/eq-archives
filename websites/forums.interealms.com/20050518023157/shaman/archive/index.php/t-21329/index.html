<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As they say; The Devil is in the Details. It seems that lately the devil has Kidnapped the <br />
<br />
SOE Detail Guy.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically the Problems is that among the Priest classes  Clerics do best with 1HB, Druids <br />
<br />
can 1 Hand slash, and Shaman Can PIERCE.  and yet almost every priest Weapon From POP on has <br />
<br />
ignored this. While I'm sure Clerics are Thrilled at the Breath of 1HB weapons availible to <br />
<br />
them Priest + Cleric only blunts I'm not happy about it And i'm gonna go out on a limb and <br />
<br />
suggest that druids don't like it much either. every time i go looking for a new weapon all i See is CLR DRU SHM  1Hand Blunts.  Cut it out!<br />
<br />
Searching through a few  Item websites I have found that there are about 4 Shaman only <br />
<br />
spears from Velious, 3 from Luclin and 2 from POP (1 from Time 1 from POJ trials.)  after that....<br />
Nothing for LOY, LDON, or GOD. for that Matter I can't find ANY SHM only items weapons, <br />
<br />
armor or otherwise.  the only thing we got out of all those expansions is Spells!! and some <br />
<br />
are Utterly useless.<br />
<br />
 I can find a bunch of All but cleric and Monk piercers I can find  some Bst only Piercers. I can find several Rog/SHM piercers(close...).  But just plain old Piercers for Shaman only it's almost Nonexistent. I can find several SHM only 1hb. none i would use though as one requires a very long quest and the Other requires a raid in AC. the best NON POP spear is from the Deep. and again requires a Raid force to get it(actually about 2 and a half groups at this point but still!!).  <br />
<br />
Now before you say it's hard to code class specific items I've been able to find tons of <br />
<br />
ranger, Bard, SK, Paladin, Wizard, Druid, Chanter, Rogue, Warrior, Beastlord, cleric, Mage, <br />
<br />
Necro, and even wizard only items. shoot, the first item outta Gates that got linked to me was a New Rogue dagger that had better stats than the JTB.  I can find a Druid only Item from Just about every tier of POP. Sk only weapons?? Everywhere!! Paladin only weapons?? Even in LOY and LDON!  nifty 1hand and 2 hand blunts for the Knights all over da place .<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now i've seen some of these  1hb coming out of Gates and Love the stats But Hate that they are 1HB. A rune 3 Proc are you Kidding me?? that is freakin sweet!! But once again  not a spear!! Oh well it's late and i'm rambling.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Under NO circumstances should you make Epic 2.0 a 1HB. which is what is looks like.</div></div><hr />

How could you forget the REIF?  I've raised three shaman and every one of them grew up with a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang in his hand.  It's usually the first thing they buy with all the money I get from farming tradeskill stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm... I read this rant about the lack of shaman only piercers, and kinda thought, so what?<br />
<br />
I just looked in the bazaar for shaman useable piercers. There's quite a few of them, some of them very decent. Some of them are shaman only, others aren't. So what?<br />
<br />
A LOT of items are CLR DRU SHM. There aren't many single class items at all, and if there were, they'd start rotting after you equip the few people of that class. If you have a priest item for the primary slot, it's gotta be 1hb, 2hb or not a weapon. It does mean that we compete with druids and clerics for the drop, but it also means that they don't rot, or go to alts. I'm okay with that.<br />
<br />
Our epic is shaman only piercing. The best shaman weapon in game (Time's Antithesis) is shaman only piercing. There are plenty of options for piercing up to those so why does it matter if another class can use that spear too?<br />
<br />
We can use all 3 skills, why limit ourselves to piercing? What's WRONG with 1hb anyway?<br />
<br />
I just don't really recognise that there is a problem here.</div></div><hr />

/agree.  Don't like 'em, don't equip 'em.<br />
Itemization of piercers over blunts for priest classes is a non-issue for us.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is a good rant and all, but it really doesnt hold a candle to the state of things when our epic was first released as a spear and at the time probably 1 shaman in all eq had a pierce skill above 0.<br />
<br />
Raising melle skills for a shaman is relativly hard, we only swing once per round.  The way things are now, you dont really need to worry about maxing all your melle skills, you can just work up one of them and you are pretty much set for the whole game.  I would consider that a break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was the only one with high (well over 100, not sure 200) piercing skill  pre kunark?

<br />
Wasn't it only a bronze main gauche and two or three other piercers Shaman usable in the whole game? Not even a rusty spear I don't think. A patch sometime in 2000 finally made most spears Shaman usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yep originally the &quot;standard&quot; spears were not shaman usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At release, the only piercer avaible for shamans was the wonderful bronze main gauche (99% sure about this).<br />
<br />
When the patch who modified most spear in the game came, I had already 90+ in piercing :D, but it was not the best weapon to use :p<br />
<br />
Kedge piercer went in game only after the first revamp of kedge.<br />
<br />
Najena piercer and the one from OOT came only after the patch.<br />
<br />
Then came Kunark with the famous jade prod or the slime coated harpoon :).</div></div><hr />

My 1HB is maxed, my Piercing is around 160 . . . and I'm nowhere near uber.<br />
<br />
For piercing, try Progeny Claws.  Very available in bazaar.  Good stats for Shaman, and very very nice resists.<br />
<br />
Personally, I prefer Soulstripper for 1HB.  Every time that proc goes off, you hit the Can key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We're not the only ones that are wondering what the deal is with Epic 2.0. At least ours is looking like it's going to be a 1 hand weapon, allowing us to continue using a shield/secondary item. The Druid Epic 2.0 looks like a 2hb weapon, which will suck for them because they will lose the Shield/secondary item stats.<br />
<br />
I couldn't care less about what skill ours uses. As long as they don't screw up the effect on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think the point is there's nothing in between the Spear of Fate and Time's Antithesis. For a piercing weapon for a shaman, Time's Antithesis is the only viable upgrade from the SoF. There's nothing you'd buy in the bazaar that you'd use over the SoF. I do agree that it's not that big a deal. 1H Blunt, piercing, hell I don't care if it looks like Paddington Bear in my hand. If it's got good stats and a nice effect I'll wield it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bone spear from rare named in Lavastorm was SHM usable on release.  It was the one weap you could equip and dodge being asked for SoW etc.  There was a spear patch before RoK went live that added a few kool spears tagged for SHM, but spears did not become viable until Kunark.<br />
<br />
The biggest debate over primary slot equip on the Crucible back then was &quot;1h blunt or 2h blunt?&quot; with many deciding that the Barbarian Spiritists Hammer or Withered Totem of Widdershins were the ultimate in shaman achievement.<br />
<br />
I still miss my Screaming Mace. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL clerics don't much care for the 1HB weaps either - they summon better weaps.  <br />
<br />
That leaves Druids and Shaman as the users.  And either class can use 1hb, druids can't use our piercers and we can't use their slicers.  My guess is that 1hb is the lowest common denominator.<br />
<br />
Of course other classes can use piercing, I just don't understand why there are no piercing weaps Shamans can use that even compete with the 1hb weaps out there now.  I gave away my REIT when Soulstripper became available, and the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic is easy to pick up or priced around where REIT is on my server.  A piercer that is equivelant to DOoFM certainly should be available.  And I don't need backstab enhancements lol.</div></div><hr />

that's why we have:<br />
<br />
<br />
druid sword from MM, plus that druid only 1hs from PoJustice<br />
<br />
Cleric hammers from both Saryrn and VZ (plus the time one, plus the PoWater one that you can't give away).<br />
<br />
Ranger only 29/22 elf shoes rot all the time in Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
The only solution is to maybe introduce a quest drop from a mob that can be turned in and cycled for a 1hb, 1hs, or spear? That's really the only way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I remember saving up and getting my first magic weapon, the runed totem staff...

I'll take whatever weapon gives me the best stats :)<br />
<br />
Only good thing about the piercers is no druid or cleric can use 'em, so less competition for 'em.</div></div><hr />

Exactly!! I can find Rogue Piercers and cleric hammers Everywhere! I'd at least like the opportunity to have a shaman spear rot somewhere.  And while i also have a Soulstripper  stuck in my bag(soon to be replaced with teh Sharkspine) I wish they could have stuck something sham only in Kedge 2.0.  Seriously, a water themed zone and no trident to be found.What the heck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Originally there was bronze main gauche AND something, 1? or 2? more.  I remember skilling up with bronze in CT in my low 30's, but i am pretty sure that the snake fang maybe? or something else was also shaman useable (not 100% confident, but fairly) as i remember carrying the bronze main gauche around cuz it was the best or my very few choices....but that i did have a choice or two.  The fs and all others listed were introduced later in the game as already mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Appreciate the posts on piercers/1hs, but I will keep my (2) 1hb weapons. I use one to help with dps (aug'd with 125 DD as well as the already proc of 450DD on it and crits alot with my AAs) in Ldon's and GoD, and one for raids for higher stats and the anger focus for nukes. <br />
