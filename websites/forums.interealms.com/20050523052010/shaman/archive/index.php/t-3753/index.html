<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mmm Canna 5 Is amazing. Love it. I mean really love it. <br />
<br />
Pre torporing then Firing it off seems to save the cleric the OMG factor. (Well that and Aego gives me 3526 total hp now)<br />
<br />
But I was pulling 5-10 critters in chardok at a time (slowing, them all during the pull Ignoreing the 5-6 beating on me as I slow the next one.) After all that With canna 5 I would be able to Torrent down the mass of critters, (Chanter chain stunning, Warrior using earthshaker, Wizard doing the Jylic's two step, thief Happily stabbing away, and cleric keeping all of us healed and even tossing a few earthquakes) And end the fight at 3/5 bubbles. <br />
<br />
Chain pulling after that to keep us all busy till the Wizard gets back to a resonable mana level (And pulling the tougher names and placeholders singly) Then back to a slow AE pull when repops allow, let us really have a high chum rate yesterday. Plus it was fun.<br />
<br />
Next up on the list Rabid bear... RAR!!<br />
<br />
Oh on an unrelated note. Does anyone have a mod to clear the tic's off the group health bars (And self at that) My lil cleric buddy has had an allergic reaction to them. (A dwarf shaking violenty muttering to himself tics..damn tics... Bah.. beer... Mmm navel lint... Tics....  BAH....  Tics... is a scary thing)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had my first near fatal can 5 incident last night! I showed up late to a guild function and wasn't really paying attention and managed to KNOCK MYSELF UNCONSCIOUS with can 5!  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry out of the way referance here.<br />
<br />
Chum is basicly fish parts that are thrown into the water to gather other fish/sharks.<br />
<br />
I tend to refer to the rapid destruction of Mobs in game  as teh chum rate. Or in other words fast killing and pulling of more mobs.<br />
<br />
Normally. A good chum rate for my regular group of people in the pit, is to clear out the captain, bridgekeeper, iksar betrayer, and a few of the tunnel mobs in Chardok.<br />
<br />
By doing the Slow AE pull when the wizard had the mana, and standard pulls We were doing that, Some of the Graveyard are, some of the dogs from deeper down the tunnel towards niblik and the entire Lev tunnel before repops.<br />
<br />
Basicly we were killing em fast. (laughs)<br />
