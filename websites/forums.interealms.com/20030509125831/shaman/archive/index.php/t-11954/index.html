<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thelordtrey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few questions about this zone Ive been curious about (Ive been here a bit soloing the front trash at 51).<br />
<br />
1) What here is KoS to a barb shaman (Im indifferent to the sentries and the high guardians and most of the humanoid prisoners, but opened a door into an enforcer and got obliterated... the high guardians decided to help out and got 2k damage in about 4 seconds)?<br />
<br />
2)What here is on faction, how easy is it to screw up and is it possible at all to fix? Oh, and do you need that faction to do the trials groups at later lvls?<br />
<br />
Any response would be appreciated, thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

1) Prisoners on the first floor will not be KOS to you, you cannot ruin faction with them<br />
    Guards will never be KOS to you except for the HG's near the efreeti that ports into the trial prep area, they are on a faction that you can screw up, afaik you cannot get it back up.<br />
    Enforcers and Punishers in that hall are KOS to all, high guardians which are near them will assist, if you run away, all guards assist.<br />
    I think prisoners in the lower floors are KOS, the snakes and stuff..not sure, i hunted them and there is a prisoners and creatures of justice faction..on them..still not kos to prisoners on top floor, faction never changed with them, they are on no faction iirc.<br />
   <br />
    2) prisoners on lower floors, HG's near the efreeti are on factiton..probably missed a few things. Not sure how many kills to KOS, dont think you can fix it.<br />
       You don't need the faction for trials.</div></div><hr />
