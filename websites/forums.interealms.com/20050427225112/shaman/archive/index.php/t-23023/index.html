<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>anigelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiyas all,<br />
I was wondering at a good place to solo for plat, so I can get better gear than I got now. Any suggestions on where the plat is better than most places? I tried AC Droga but never seems to make it in enough to get the named mobs, before I have to leave due to repops smacking me down. Thanks in advance for help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If droga is too tough try Nurga.  Especially if you are lvl 59 (per your magelo).<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>anigelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whoops... knew i forgot something when I hit 62.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check my Nurga thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=22823)  under quests your head and hands can be greatly upgraded from quests there. (the same head and hands in my magelo)<br />
<br />
Part of the reason you are getting spanked in Droga is low HP and have a few places gear could be upgraded.  Droga is great for PP. exp and upgrades for you at this point, so I'd work on getting your gear up to the level you need to to hunt there, while making some cash in the process.<br />
<br />
Items with no HP and possible upgrades<br />
Neck: Radiant Necklace of Souls, Watchman's Iron-wrought Neckguard<br />
Face: Durable Silver Mask (soloable for you in Nurga), Iron mask of the Wise<br />
Shoulders: Save for the weather beaten, works nice<br />
Back: I understand the love for the Lodi, but for everyday use a Moss covered (cloak OR cape) works<br />
Wrist: the Effect on the SSA is probably not being used much anymore, I'd look for anything wearable by froggies w/ HP<br />
Waist: Buckled Shale<br />
Primary: NO HP!...go farm a Soulstripper and save the Progeny Claws for when you need resists or when in Nurga get an Ancient Crude Club or the Trident of Freed Spirits<br />
Range: No HP, if you take the Nurga route the Tarnished Bronze idol will be of help to you<br />
Hands: quest item would be great<br />
<br />
I'd worry less about money and farm Nurga for head and hands quests as well as face, primary and range<br />
Money in Nurga is descent anyway.  <br />
Later, farm the Soulstripper (decent pp there too)<br />
You can also upgrade one of your rings with the Chardok Quest stuff if you hunt in Nurga enough to get good faction there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your Magelo is up to date and your Defense is 178, then I'd work on that first and Evocation second. Nurga is as good a place to get Defense up as any, although Velks spiders might be easier.<br />
<br />
If you want to do Droga, I recommend camping the 31% haste belt. Nothing spawns in the room next to the Knight, so no adds to worry about as long as you don't let him run. Use the proceeds to beef up your HPs, as others have sais.<br />
<br />
If you do get a wanderer add there, be extra careful since wanderers are higher level in that area, about level 60-61, hit for 200+ and nuke pretty good. Otherwise you should be able to get at least 5 other mobs solo around that camp, which should keep you busy. At 65, I can also solo pull the 3 mobs in the adjacent room, but I don't know if that's possible at 62.<br />
<br />
Finally, you may want to reconsider your AA strategy. The consensus is to go for Canni5 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Havs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Been hunting in FG a bit lately at 62...The shrooms are laughably easy to say the least, but xp is commesurate with the difficulty.<br />
<br />
I basically use it as a place to keep the AAXP bar moving (slightly) when I don't feel like going to the planes.  It's pretty safe from trains and idiots, at least on Fen Ro.<br />
<br />
Supposedly the Mushroom Veil and a few other things drop from shrooms, but I have seen nada so far.</div></div><hr />
