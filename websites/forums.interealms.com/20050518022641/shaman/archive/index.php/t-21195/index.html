<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has killed Time Saryrn 9 times.  She dropped a TA on death 1 and we haven't seen one since.<br />
<br />
We had the same thing happen with BoW off of RZ.  He dropped it the first time for us and then we got another finally on kill 13 I believe.<br />
<br />
Do any of your guilds have this problem?  Does the RNG hate you?  I'd love to hear about it... misery loves company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our guild killed Saryrn 13 times before she dropped a TA at all. However, she did drop one the kill after that too. All told, we got a TA on 13th, 14th, 17th kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1 out of 10 is what i have heard is the common ration of the Antithesis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We got our first TA on our 12th kill. We have killed saryrn 34 times iirc and have had 5 TA's drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">uberguild on terris had 4 TA in 3 kills, and went something like 6 months without seeing another<br />
<br />
we're now 0 for 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We have only had like 2 drop in about 7 kills or so. It's pretty rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JuyshinRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">we have killed saryrn probably 35-40ish? times, 5 TA's. 3 have vanished on inactive peoples ;/ still a few shm without them. darkblades and ranger swords rotting.. sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We have only had like 2 drop in about 7 kills or so. It's pretty rare.<br />
<br />
Lol, *only* 2 in 7? That's high for a TA.<br />
<br />
In the time we were waiting for the first TA to drop, we got 3 serpents and 3 mage masks.... which was kinda irritating. But, it all comes in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You haven't seen anything until you've seen Afterlife's luck with TAs and Saryn.  I'm not sure on the outcome officially, but it was something like 1st at 7, 2nd at 28 and nothing else for a total of 40+ kills.  Gugek or Jenamdar would be best at telling you, but I've heard their luck is the worse.<br />
<br />
We've seen about 11 Timespinner's in 25 Bert kills or so, seems to be our most common weapon by far.  Combine that with 1 cleric hammer and 2 Darkblades, and 4 TAs in about 30+ kills, so we've been fairly bad luck with it.  Only have I think 3 HoHs to which really sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Our first TA dropped last week after 22 kills, we had nearly given up on ever seeing any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So how far into time is saryrn? ;)<br />
<br />
We still need PoEb stuff, rathe, corniav, xeg so a few months yet before I'm in Time, but it's nice to dream ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not that far, 2nd easiest in phase 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">About the same as Galiden 2 for 7. Of course now that I'm next in line we won't see one for 6 months.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just curious, but does this type of post warrant a &quot;65+ Raiding&quot; kind of forum?  I just don't see any relevance to the &quot;General&quot; Shaman community in this post.<br />
<br />
BTW, I am all for a 65+ forum here.  It would be nice to see a section that would be above the topics of farming Droga and where to go as a &quot;61 Shm without torpor&quot; posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We've had one drop 28th of december 2003, none since then, but I like my hammer of hours anyway ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fezik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I got mine on Nov 12th. Since then we have farmed time every 6 days.  As of friday we have only got 1 since. <br />
<br />
The shaman that was to loot the TA was in Time A at the time. Right before he zoned in some ******* zoned up to phase 5. So the shaman popped up to Phase 5 and was not able to loot the TA. Poor guy has been waiting 6 months and nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Averaging 1 TA in 6.<br />
Worst droprate of anything has been chain bp. Luckily the bloodlink drops a lot in KT raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just assume you'll get 1 in 10 kills and you won't be dissapointed, remembering that the RNG is streaky...  If you do better than that, you're one of the lucky guilds. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as all mobs in phase 4 are killed, anyone zoning into time will go straight to phase 5, regardless of whether anyone from the raid goes from phase 4 to phase 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">hehe, sadly our chain bps have dropped so much that twinks have them now, and everyone that has one also has the bloodlink if they want it too.  By far the most dropped bp for us, with around 15 of them in 30 inny kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">it's funny, valsuvious, but for us that wasn't the case at all.  chain bp was by far the rarest bp, and plate bp was by far the most common, i think we have over 30 plate bps and less than half that in chain.  as for bloodlink i don't really mind, as i prefer chronoburn to a common mana presveration effect.  shrug.  <br />
