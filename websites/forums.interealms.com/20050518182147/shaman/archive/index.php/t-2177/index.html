Hi,<br />
<br />
I wanted to take a minute to let you know about some pet upgrades that we've just completed. The changes are fairly significant, and we think they address a lot of concerns that have been brought up by players.<br />
<br />
Here are the changes we've made -<br />
<br />
Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures<br />
All pets now think of mesmerized creatures as being dead. Pets will not break mez, will not attack mesmerized creatures, and will forget any hate they had towards a mesmerized creature.<br />
<br />
In short, if a monster gets mesmerized, your pet will forget about it and stop attacking it. This is good for all pet classes, and especially handy for Enchanters, who can now trust their pets to not break every mez as soon as it lands.<br />
<br />
Pets are neutral to monsters<br />
Monsters will not attack your pet first. All monsters see your pet as a neutral creature, and will leave it alone unless your pet attacks something. This means if your pet wanders off, it won't bring a train of monsters back with it. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind, if your pet chases a fleeing monster, other monsters may still attack it. Your pet is only treated as neutral while it is not acting in a hostile manner.<br />
<br />
Pets no longer take experience in most situations<br />
In the past, pets would take a full share of experience if they did the most damage to a creature. We've changed this rule as follows -<br />
<br />
* Pets take ZERO experience from a creature, unless no player does damage to that creature.<br />
<br />
* Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature - if no player does damage to that creature.<br />
<br />
This means that your pet takes no experience from you or your group unless your pet kills a monster with no help from players. As long as you or your groupmates do damage to a monster, your pet will take ZERO experience.<br />
<br />
Due to the high potential power of dire charmed pets, they will continue to take a share of the experience. In the worst case, dire charmed pets will take a full share of experience - this is the same as it's always been.<br />
<br />
The amount of experience taken by a dire charmed pet scales based on how much damage the pet does. If the dire charmed pet is doing the majority of the damage, it's experience share gets larger. If you or your group are doing reasonable damage to a monster, a dire charmed pet will not take much experience. The more damage you do, the less experience a dire charmed pet will take. In most situations, dire charmed pets will take less experience than they did previously.<br />
<br />
As with all pets, if a dire charmed pet does the majority of damage, and no player does any damage, the dire charmed pet will take 75% of the experience from the kill. <br />
<br />
Overall, these changes are a significant boost to pet classes. The dev team has been hard at work on finding and implementing the right solutions, and we hope you'll enjoy these changes. Thanks for your patience as caster balancing continues, and thanks for playing.<br />

<br />
Muzzle of mardu = wortheless.<br />
Pet haste = capped at 60%.<br />
<br />
Also, the above fix has some nerf points, you can't level AFK anymore with those changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">whoa, this is great :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OH MY GOD NO! MAGES CAN'T GO AFK NOW AND GET FREE XP?! SWEET BABY JESUS THIS IS AWFUL!!!!! WHAT AN AMAZING NERF! WHAT DOES VERANT THINK THEY ARE DOING! <br />
<br />
The changes are great. Anyone who says different is on crack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bout damn time.  <br />
<br />
Of course I won't be happy till they glue my pet to my azz for pathing in dungeons.  I can still see Gaboober running all over creation and warping to exciting locations trying to get at that mob that is 5 feet away.  Pathing is still the REAL issue IMO for most pet classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Man.  Nice changes, but talk about the dumbing down of EQ.<br />
<br />
No need to worry/learn about dying &amp; getting a loc as a lowbie. (Well, that no CR &lt;10th is just for all the twinks anyway).<br />
<br />
No hell levels &lt;50th &amp; increased dungeon xp &lt;30th will make for faster levelling, with potentially less experienced 50+ chars.<br />
<br />
And now, no need to learn how to control your pet.<br />
<br />
What's next?  Monsters going to stand in line if you pull multiples?  I sometimes get the idea that they are making the game too easy - no, I don't think &quot;everyone should have it as rough as I did, when I had to walk uphill to and from the mobs, hip deep in snow&quot;.  But part of the appeal of the game IMO, is the challenge and difficulty of learning how to succeed.  If your guild has ever done raids where you need to be organized, you know what I mean about challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is definately an awesome change.<br />
<br />
I would think iksar necros should be the most happy.  Now their pets won't leech so much experience on top of their already hideous exp penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the shaman pet is useless at level 60, better to just stack dot's and tank the mob. Please dont even say root cause that is nothing more than playing the lotto with my last 3 bucks and hoping i win. wanna know what i found to be just awesome? Friend played for a long ass time and got his cleric to 58 before he was sick of verants dumb ass methods and quit, well i have use of that account now and i just robo him to CH me and nothing else. I can down to about 600 hps and CH myself. Yea i have torpor but i like saving the 200 mana. Now since not every one has 2 pc's this is my little secret but man i can make a yellow in FG in just under an hour if i have my own spot. Even faster is still in raid buffs. Pet? give me a new one and I'll use it then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman pet is useless at 60?<br />
<br />
If you prefer the slow/tank method of soloing, then there's no reason not to have your pet up. It doesn't do a ton of damage, but it is 'free' damage. Don't haste it, and it's still pretty much a 'free' ebolt every mob, with a chance for a bash every 'turn'.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's useless in a straight up fight where it has to hold its own, but when used right, it can shave seconds off of the time it takes to kill a mob, meaning less time, less mana, more mobs, more XP. And if it no longer takes ANY XP at all, then it gets even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmmmm, I was contemplating the /pet hold AA skill just to keep my silly pet from breaking mezzes.<br />
<br />
Is there any point to the AA pet skill now? Or was I just not getting its purpose in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The AA skill still has merit...just not as much as it used to.<br />
<br />
Pets will still attack if it gets hit with an AE spell. The AA skill will prevent Jobaber from running after whatever AE'd him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmmm, with the limit of 4 pets per target, I don't summon Puddles for raids anymore (let's see, crappy shaman pet OR uber mage pet?) so I'm not seeing a lot of advantage to a pet that doesn't aggro on AOEs. I mean, sure, occasionally exp fighting mobs will do it, but it's so terribly common I would spend 5 (6?) points on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bahimiron you will definatly be 100% correct if the said patch effects us, but as it is now, pets taking a percentage of the exps nullifies the bonus of those few seconds. But yea in a solo enviroment a pet adds a little damage depending on what your fighting. In old world norath the pet is sweet. but im never in norrath i hardly ever leave FG when soloing/duoing. I dont  get much time to EXP since my guild is basically raiding or ore farming. I would trade pet disicpline any day of the week for a more class defining skill but that is another post all together.<br />
It is really gonna come down to how people play the game and i for one am biased to grouping and raiding so i will leave it at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cantiz: Shaman pets do NOT take exp from you(As it is now), UNLESS it does over half the damage to the mob. And thats pretty unlikely. In fungus grove, its just dumb not to have a pet up. A shroom have ~8000 hp. and your pet does about 1000-2000 damage when soloing it. Thats quite considerable...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gloriana, ever seen the 'two dozen mages clear sky' thread? Four pets on a mob no longer applies, since when they changed the way that AEs cast by the 'owner' of a pet affect the pet, they changed the pet's status as an NPC. Many mages now believe that it is eight pets per mob. And even with that limitation, that's eight pets hitting the mob at the same time. If you sic ten pets on a mob, those other two pets can still do damage, because chances are greatly in favor of the damage the pets doing being staggered out across the duration of an attack round. So five can do damage, then five more, then the first five. Or three, three, three and one. Or, considering double-attack and duel wield, two and a half, two and a half, two and a half and two and a half. :P<br />
<br />
Cantiz, in FG, my pet regularly hits for his max. If I were to solo in that miserable ****hole of a zone, which I wouldn't if you paid me ten bucks and hour and all the fried mushrooms I could eat, I would definitely use my pet. As it is, when I solo, it's generally either Chardok or Permafrost, where Barfy the Wonder Dog absolutely rolls mobs like mad.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wish they would add an AA skill that let you go invis and not poof your pet. That would really make the summon companion spell more useful.</div></div><hr />
