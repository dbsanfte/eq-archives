Ok we all know about Code Red (Project Red, whatever words we are using), so I figured that I would try it with the summoned hammer we get from the innitiate amulet. (the lowbi Barb quest one)  I found that if I summoned 1, gave it to doggie, then summoned another, and gave the second one to him, he takes both!!??!!  The item reads as no rent, does this apply to pets as well?  I havent figured out if the pet s hitting with both hammers or not.  Anyone else try this?  If this works, wooohooo, no more collecting shivs for puppy!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's 'Project Alpha'...  Anywho, that's an interesting idea - I'll have to check that out.  Does it also read as lore?  No rent definitely isn't an issue, but I'm not sure about lore items on pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pets don't seem to care about &quot;LORE&quot; &quot;NODROP&quot; or whether a weapon is 2 handed or not.<br />
<br />
Very good idea though, I think I may have to look into newbie quests again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it's no drop - Goner will not use it.  Turn off all damage filters and watch his attacks.  If he is 'biting' or 'hitting', the weapons didn't take.  If he is slashing, crushing, or piercing - then he's decided to wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I seem to recall somebody trying this a while back and saying that Dogdog would either only use one hammer, or wouldn't use either.  If I ever remember to do it, I need to try it for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Projest Alpha, yeah, thats it. <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The dog won't equip the weapon.  The class on the summoned hammer is shm, so the dog, being a warrior, won't equip it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Atleast that's my understanding !  May also have something to do with being no drop, but I believe I've given my dog the no drop 1hb's from ME and he equiped it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doesn't work, tried this months ago. No drop is the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah it has nothing to do with the class on the weapon. My doggie has had no problems with monk/bst only ulaks and such and using them. Pets have been unable to wield no drop weapons for a long long time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, the weapons have to fit in primary and secondary slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just buy fishing spears or rusty weapons if you can find them. Fishing spears are on a vendor in potranq and cost a few silver, maybe a gold. There is an endless supply on the vendor I think.</div></div><hr />

all 2 ofthem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hows about we start a petition drive to get the Barbarian Tribunal Amulet quest to be finished?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Krakster,<br />
It isnt the money issue that I was trying to avoid.  I was just hoping to save space in my inventory.  Of course, I'm doing Dulak right now, so shivs fall all the time so it isn't a big deal.  It just would've been cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the weaon is 6/36 ? what a junk and pet won't use weapon that weaker than default hit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i thought tthe pet would could use a &quot;lower than default hit&quot; weapon to get them to dual wield.  No improvement in hits/damage/delay, but they could dual wield.<br />
<br />
I see that forging hammers in Shadow Haven are one silver piece.  That would be quite cost efficient, if it could be used for one of the two weapons.<br />
<br />
At the moment I still have a pack full of broken bottles and shivs from getting the empty flask for Stoicism, so I have not tried it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the weaon is 6/36 ? what a junk and pet won't use weapon that weaker than default hit<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah, the point is not to increase their hit, it's to get them to dual wield.<br />
<br />
therefore any non no drop 1handed weapons are good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hehe I tried something a bit more creative....<br />
Summoned Cleric hammers.<br />
Puppy wont use em though :(<br />
<br />
Would have been dang fun to have pet dual wielding those Cleric hammers though.<br />
<br />
The fishing spears in PoTraq are really cheap and an endless supply.<br />
I really wish I could find something that stacks though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Aye, I stand corrected, Tried it and no go. :(  <br />
<br />
Oh well back to fishing spears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You should take the Shar Vahl port.  Go into Shar Vahl nearby, cross the bridge into the city, make a right, and around the corner there's a &quot;street vendor&quot; kitty who sells wooden practice daggers... under two silver per dagger at good charisma!  Somewhat heavy but who cares.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I dont know about you guys but for me it's the issue of time. I dont care about cost. I dont even care about Inventory space. Whats annoying is how when I decide I want to solo, I have to run to PoK and buy some Shivs, or run to somwhere else and pick up some crappy 1h weapon just so I can make my pet do respectable damage. The idea of being able to summon my own weapons, even of the crappiest sort, sounds great. How about shamans get the level 1 Mage spell summon: Dagger?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chiyu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">this is why i keep a bag of rusty daggers on me at all times, for when puppy needs his fangs :) cheap to buy, fairly lightweight (0.5 each) cant go wrong =^.^=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I use whatever is convienant :p<br />
<br />
Velium, fine steel, loy weapons, CoM weapons, pretty much whatever is there on hand.. if I buy weapons, i buy a bunch at a time. too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've used SSoY, Throneblade of Yakesha, that Darkness proccing rogue dagger from Guk, velium weapons, mage summoned weapons, rusties, fine steel, Zek weapons from daiku in POTactics, Guard weapons, etc etc etc.  <br />
<br />
It don't matter what kind of weapon they are (unless it has a useful proc), puppy will dual wield as long as the weapons are not NO DROP.  I am not sure about LORE weapons.  The reason for him not equipping NO DROP weps is to foil an old school exploit whereby NO DROP items were given to pets, pet owner /q and someone else quickly kills the pet to make a corpse that can be looted.  Ok you say that summoned pets dont make corpses, this is true.  However, CHARMED pets DO make corpses when their owners /q and they get themselves killed.  <br />
<br />
Anyways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I’d love to have a quest item that summoned rusty daggers or something just as useless to sell to vendors.  I buy rusty daggers in Freeport a couple of packs at a time. I do trade skills, so I hate taking up that much space I could be using for the dozens of other trade supplies I keep piled in the bank.  I’d do a search for items that summon such things, but even if there were some that shaman could use, I’d bet the summoned weapon would be no drop.</div></div><hr />

Barbs do get an unfair balance of things. That being said, most shamans are barbs because most people are lazy and dont want to really learn their class. As an iksar your forced to use your spells to their full potential, learn how to travel and draw less aggro.. .I find iksar shamans to be smarter about how to play a shaman, plus i challenge an equally equip barb shaman to beat an equally equip iksar. Iksar &gt; Barb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you trying to say, because I play a barb shaman I didn't learn my class?  Where have you been?  Your spells are the same as mine.  You get that little Iksar regen thing, but cannot wear some armor.  After you ding 60 the armor thing is almost non-existant.  Travel is a non-issue for anyone since PoP came out.  Since Luclin came out, you could level your Iksar on the moon and not worry about kos.  Aggro is controlled by knowing when to slow and is also based on the tank controlling the aggro.  If you are getting more aggro than you should, you aren't doing something right.<br />

Anyway, good discussion before that, maybe we can not feed the trolls and get back on track.<br />
<br />
I'll be making a dedicated search for some item that can summon a melee-equippable item, then.  You can summon shattering hammers, you can summon shissar fangs, and mages can summon a sword of runes, all from equipment... has any shaman ever looted the gloves of bladecalling from Velk?  They don't say &quot;must equip&quot; on them, so I'm VERY curious.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
People do not want to deal with factions issues and xp penalties.. thus the lazy part. <br />
<br />
Iksar shamans do have to work twice as hard as barbs to obtain xp, faction ect. <br />
<br />
Your right, since pop came out travel is pretty much a non issue. However, I'm old school and have been playing since before kunark. Travel used to be an issue.  <br />
<br />
We do not get free DD bracers and other items. Our natural regen was nerfed by VI for high level Iksar's when they did that whole regen &quot;rebalance&quot; issue. <br />

I was not trolling, making an observation.  Was not offending barbs, however, you are a dime a dozen .</div></div><hr />

Furthermore, as a troll, the nearest vendor to our PoK book is quite a run and a zone away, and at that, with those vendors you rely on rusties sold by newbies.. to get a steady supply (where its an item the vendor just HAS, not stuff that's been sold to him/her) you have to run even farther.  I HATE getting to PoG and realizing I forgot rusties, its a giant PITA.  Just as bad is remembering them, but going LD or having to gate, or having your pet poof due to bad pathing and losing them anyway.  I wouldn't b*tch and moan about barb shamans having those hammers made tradeable, it'd be nice for them :)  I can snare, after all.  And best of all, I eat gnomes.  Mmm gnome *drool*</div></div><hr />

Hey Handbag,<br />
<br />
Get a clue.  If I was going to make a cheap generalization I'd point out the whiniest shaman tend to be the lizards who walk around with JBB envy and an inferiority complex.      <br />
<br />
Believe it or not, some of us made barbarians because we like being barbarians.  Not because we were trying to round the best starting stats to three decimal places nor spend the rest of the game second guessing that decision.  <br />
<br />
Forced to use your skills?  Pfffft, give me a break.  Having a tail requires more strategy somehow?  Hell, at least you can see at night.  <br />
Travel and draw less aggro?  You got SoW at level nine right?  Afore you left the newbie womb that is Field of Bone.  <br />
Challenge a barb to beat an iksar?  If you honestly think RACE is a factor in PvP I' encourage you to play the game another week.<br />
