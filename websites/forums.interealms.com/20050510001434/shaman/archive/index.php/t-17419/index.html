<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This post is about high-risk missions only. Normal missions are so easy that I can serve as the sole healer/slower/buffer, and thus achieve high efficiency that way. My typical group for doing these missions is SK CLR ENC SHM RNG MNK. All toons are high AA - I have the lowest total at 140. We are all geared in a mix of Luclin/Elemental stuff for the most part, but no one has Time gear or anything like that.<br />
<br />
The problem on these missions is that I feel pretty marginal. I have trouble coming up with a group configuration in which a shaman would be really desirable - you'd be more likely to settle for a shaman if you couldn't get a more useful class.<br />
<br />
There are 5 main roles that I can see in a high-risk group.<br />
<br />
1) Main healer<br />
2) CC<br />
3) Slower<br />
4) Tank<br />
5) DPS<br />
<br />
At least for me, being main healer is not an option. I can be sole healer for singles if our cleric dies, and I can even handle 2 mobs at once if nothing goes seriously wrong. The pulls of 3 and 4 mobs are just too risky to have me as sole healer. When 3-4 unslowed, 990 hitting mobs come crashing into the group, that's a massive DPS burst. I have no real way to counter this - no group heals, no Divine Arbitration, no Spirit of Wood type AA, nothing. If they all end up on the tank, there is no way chain Tnarg's is going to keep the SK alive against 4 mobs. So, the healer role is generally left to clerics and occasionally druids.<br />
<br />
CC in high-risk is all about mez. There seem to be an abundance of cleric and wizard mobs, which need to be mezzed rather than rooted. This is the province of bards and enchanters. VP would be nice, if it wasn't resisted about half the time.<br />
<br />
Slowing is something we can clearly do. However, since our slow has no resist mod, we are stuck using Malos to make sure it lands 90% of the time. A resisted slow means you're going to have an unslowed 990 quadding mob very mad at you. This is bad news for me, and I have over 6k HP fully buffed, plus good defensive AA (CA3, LR5, CS3, ID1).<br />
<br />
DPS - not so much. Rains are often limited in their usefulness due to mezzed mobs, so they are very situational. Our cold/poison DD is slow, and thus you are looking at ~100 dps with chain nukes. Bane is okay, but you need to Malos first to make it land reliably, and if the chanter has a CoD pet, it often will not run its full course.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, LDoN appears to be nothing more than a DPS time trial, and because of this, shaman are just not that great. By way of comparison, we did 2 missions back to back - one in which the chanter used a CoD pet, and one in which she did not. <br />
<br />
Mission 1 (CoD pet used): Completed in 48 minutes<br />
Mission 2 (no CoD pet): Completed in 80 minutes<br />
<br />
Clearly, an enchanter brings a TON more to the table than we do. Since everything mitigates, the gap between our slows is even smaller than the paltry 5% it normally is. Vastly superior CC and DPS, near-equivalent slow... I found myself wondering if I would ever get into these missions without the benefit of friendship.<br />
<br />
The only group I can see us being useful in is one that is heavy in melee DPS and has a bard to act as puller/mezzer while the shaman slows. Something along the lines of SK/PAL/WAR, CLR, SHM, BRD, ROG, ROG. Even so, I would rather have an enchanter than a shaman, because of the huge DPS boost provided by CoD. A beastlord would also be a better choice, because of near-equivalent slow and significantly better DPS.<br />
<br />
So I have to ask... is anyone else running into the same situation? I'd like to be more valuable, rather than feeling like I should be playing my friend's rogue.<br />
<br />
(FYI, just so you think I'm not doing everything I can think of, here's what I do when I am in this group. I use an alpha pet, maintain FA on the melees, and act as main slower. I use backup heals to conserve cleric mana and I babysit the chanter on charm breaks, and keep her pet Malos'd. DPS is dealt out via pet, using nukes/rains when there's a CoD pet, or via Bane/nukes when there isn't one.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel useful on LDON hard adventures.  <br />
<br />
I don't think anyone in my guild has ever done a guildgrp LDON hard without either Gwain or I.<br />
<br />
I backup the cleric on heals, slow and debuff the mobs (especially important because my CC is always bard) and do damage through FA, nukey and pet.  I handle most CC if bard gets killed.<br />
<br />
I get to use the great flexibility of my class as a healer, buffer, debuffer, CC and even damage dealer.  What more do you want (and that's a serious question)?  You can't always be the star and center of attention, especially as a support class.<br />
<br />
I've completed ldon hard groups with a variety of different configurations including groups with no melee &quot;dps&quot; classes, groups with 2 clerics, groups with 4 priests and many groups with only a monk for tankage.  In groups with 2 clerics it is often my push for DPS alone that allows us to complete the adventure in time. Perhaps it is the fact that my guild has low-end gear (on the large scheme of things) that makes LDON hard more challenging.  In the end I have about 35 wins on hard ldon adventures I think(most before the patch that allowed you to see that), and 2 losses - one was due to half the group going LD and unable to re-connect to the login server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are things the enchanter does not have you do, off the top of my head. Having a backup healer in Hard makes a big difference. That said, there is nothing wrong with having a shaman and an enchanter in the same group as long as you have good DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think shamans flexability is thier strongest point in the hard missions. So far all my mission have had the same general groups. Tank (warrior) healer(Cleric) CC(enchanter) Puller(bard or monk) Dps (monk ranger etc) shaman. In almost all our groups we've had the enchanter charming a pet for additional dps.<br />
<br />
While it is technically true that the enchanter can charm and slow both it isn't really practical IMO. Having a charmed pet that is that powerful also means that he's that dangerous when charm breaks. Once that charm breaks the enchanter is occupied dealing with nothing but that ex-pet untill they can either get it mezed or recharmed. Any mobs that weren't unslowed at that point are just gonna stay that way. Also remember that enchanter slows are slower casting than shaman slows. Another factor is that the addition debuff from malosinia on the charmed mob just makes the charm that much more reliable and safer.<br />
<br />
The same is really true of the cleric too. The cleric can only effectively heal 1 person at a time. Having a secondary healer is pretty important IMO. Yeah they have group heals but they aren't as effective or as quick and have limited ranges on them. When you've got the constant risk of a pet breaking and beating the living snot out of the enchanter that second healer is important.<br />
<br />
Sure we aren't the ranger, wizzy or enchanter bringing the huge dps to the group. We're not the cleric thats the main healer either. What do bring is a little bit of everything to hold things together when things go bad and they always seem to at some point in a hard mission. Avatar to push melee's dps up, fido (never hurts), debuffs including malosinia on the charmed pet, Back up healing and cc and when all else fails nuke and dot.<br />
<br />
Yeah it definitely takes some good dps to be able to get threw hard missions but you also need some substantial support to handle debuffing the mobs, healing the melees and just generally keeping the whole thing moving. I don't care how much dps you have more than a death or 2 and your pretty much sure to fail a hard mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only as a sidetrack comment on hard mobs are more split up so its much easier to get single pulls. Also for a general info, mobs mitigate slow, but its a &quot;mostly successful&quot; messages which is good. More hp on the mobs too so you got more chance of putting a dot on after the slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is probably derailing the topic, but I thought of something while I was readin Taraddar's post.  I may be way off base here, and it may be heresy or something, but the idea just snuck up on me, so I thought I would share my observation and see what others think.<br />
<br />
Isn't this where druids were at about Kunark?  Now, before you start screaming and calling me a damn fool, think about it for a sec.  Our abilities and strengths are a bit different, but they fit into the same niche.  Now, untill Kunark we as shaman didnt find our &quot;primary&quot; role because we didnt get our 'class defining spell' till 51 and we were a buffing class that could do some cool tricks.  <br />
<br />
Maybe Im way off base here, and Im sure that I'll get corrected, but that is what I see.  Maybe this means the next expansion will finally have something for us, because it took druids about 3 expansions worth of complaining to get to where they are now;  I think the next expansion belongs to the shaman.  Maybe something NEW for a shaman to do besides cast stat buffs of dubious quality.  <br />
<br />
Just a note: I love the shaman class and I think that we arent doing to poorly on the whole.  There is room for improvement, sure, but every class  (besides Beastlords) can say that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Taraddar nailed it in his first sentence.  <br />
<br />
I think it was Mung who said the shaman class is basically the &quot;grease&quot; that keeps the group running smoothly.  It is only when you start looking at a single shaman ability and then compare it to similar abilities from other &quot;pure&quot; classes that we start to look useless.<br />
<br />
LDoN on &quot;hard&quot; is the same kind of dungeon exp I have been doing for years and could in no way break what I do down into a single category.  I do know I push more buttons than most bards on adventures though. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think I said the shaman was the &quot;grease&quot; but maybe I stole it - I don't know.  Anyway, lol, I tend to agree with what a lot of folks are saying about the hard adventures. But........(and thank goodness) Bards as far as I am concerned are the kings of pulling in LDON hard.  With a bard a shaman is a solid choice (instead of chanter) for slowing, FA, Pet, Q - I don't know about you guys but on my few hard adv's the cleric could not keep up without me Qing the MA.  <br />
<br />
As far as dps - as I mentioned in another thread I think we are situational.  On single pulls I Malos, slow, Tears of Saryrn, torrent, torrent, tears.... that's a pretty good bunch of smack IMHO and I bet on these mobs puppy and I are the biggest damage dealer.  Now since that is a boat load of mana you need to work pretty hard (and have good FT) to keep it up.<br />
<br />
I do believe that on serious multi pulls even with a good mezzer a shaman is well served in hard adventures to not be too cute and to be ready for emergency heals - thus the serious dps should be on selected singles (see above).<br />
<br />
As an aside, with malos I only average 1 or 2 slow resists per adventure - that's pretty darn good IMHO.<br />
<br />
So, the $100 question are we better than a chanter on a hard adventure?<br />
<br />
1) If the group has a bard, probably so since we probably bring a bit more safety to the group and that counts for something.  <br />
<br />
2) UNLESS&gt;&gt; you have a &quot;brave&quot; and skilled chanter (rare I have found) who will tash on incoming and slow quickly and who has boat loads of runes up and can stun, etc. and who can find a DC pet fast.  That chanter rules all  ie: stud chanter.  Period, end of story....Equally good slowing because of mitigation, insane dps.  But, I only know a few on quellious myself who can do that.<br />
<br />
Next question is are we a better choice than a beasty if there is a chanter in the group?  I would say that a stud beasty rules in that situation if the chanter can tash quickly.  So you need a competent chanter and a beasty who can multitask like a good shaman (not very likely but possible).   <br />
<br />
So, I think the answer to the $100 question is that shaman are a safer choice (not the &quot;powergamers&quot; choice). I think that's pretty fair.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">shaman plus chanter plus cleric = perfect support team.  Substitute Bard for chanter also works just dandy.  The three remaining group members can be primary DPS and a tank.  You'll get done in time, that's not really the issue with Hard missions.  The problem is controlling pulls and adds.  That's the real challenge.  If you can wade on thru a dungeon without having people die, you will generally win.  Cept with assassin missions, those can be really tuff on hard, mainly cuz the boss is so dam tuff.  <br />
<br />
For those who wanna replace shaman with any other class, it will just make it harder, not easier.  There is no &quot;better&quot; choice for the slower/backuphealer slot than a well-played shaman.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, I am far more replaceable on normal missions than on hard ones.  Tho, on normal missions i often can be found 1)slowing 2) healing (primary), and 3) doing CC (no CCer in group).  I don't have a problem accomplishing all three tasks, and often contribute DPS as well as buffing from time to time.  No other class can be the entire group's support.  I can literally walk in with 5 melees/caster DPS's and walk out with skill points and no deaths.  WHAT class can do that with any reliability?  Maybe with perfect pulls a cleric could pull it off, or a druid.  But it would be MUCH slower than my groups where melees are hasted and adds are welcome and hastily dealt with (rooted).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I guess I am accustomed to being somewhat more able to take over certain roles in a group. In LDoN high-risk, I don't feel like I'm more than a desperation substitute for anyone in terms of healing or CC. Maybe this will change as I start to work on the healing AAs, but it doesn't seem likely.<br />
<br />
Historically:<br />
<br />
In Velious type dungeons, I could be the sole healer for a group of melees via canni-dancing + slow up to level 60... and at 60, Torpor gave us godly mana regen so this was a non-issue. We had no trouble tanking mobs.<br />
<br />
In SoL, this trend was continued. AAs made us even better.<br />
<br />
PoP really changed all this. Tanking mobs became a lot less viable for shaman. Still, give me a teir 3 or lower group with just a modicum of CC (even a root-parking ranger) and a decent tank, and I can do the heal/buff/slow thing by myself. There is the occasional death, but in general xp flies along because the group can be loaded with so much DPS. Elementals are a bit tougher, but if I have another decent healer (druid, cleric, or another shaman focused on heals), I can do all of the CC and slowing.<br />
<br />
Now, I can't do the CC as well as an enchanter would, and there are disadvantages to having me do it (need space for root parking, casters are still annoying, etc.) but at least I can fill in. I can't heal as well as a cleric or druid, and the safety margin of the group goes down, but things keep moving.<br />
<br />
Enter LDoN high risk, where I can't realistically be main healer. I can't really be main CC. I can definitely be the main slower - but if all I am responsible for is slow, then a beastlord is a better choice due to significantly higher DPS. In emergencies, I can fill in as CC or healer, but normally my groups progress without too much trouble. Everyone does their job very well, so these backup roles are pretty limited. The chanters I am used to grouping with say it's hard to do CC/charm/slow, but it's exciting.<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of changes I would like specifically, but I would like to stop slipping down the power curve. I don't think we are fatally flawed by any means, but something to give shaman a bit more punch in these DPS time trials would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
LDoN on &quot;hard&quot; is the same kind of dungeon exp I have been doing for years and could in no way break what I do down into a single category.  I do know I push more buttons than most bards on adventures though. :p<br />
<br />
LDoN high-risk isn't the same dungeon xp we've been doing for years, for one reason: the time limit. You don't have time to be splitting all the pulls up nicely, so lots of pulls come with adds. You don't have time to deal with CHing/gating mobs, so mez becomes far, far better than root. I don't recall being kicked out of Seb or Chardok or HS for taking too long to clear to a camp. Name one dungeon you've been doing for years where you didn't make an adequate offtank, or couldn't function as main healer.<br />
<br />
I agree about the button-pushing, though. I've actually worn the ink off of the &quot;8&quot; key (where I have Cann4 mapped) due to pressing it so many times.    :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
IIRC, Torgor's was a 70% slow pre-Kunark. When Kunark was relased SOE nerfed it by stretching out the progression of Torgor's so you didn't reach 70% slow until level 60. So, before Kunark, we still had very effective slows. Mobs just didn't put out the insane DPS they do now, so it wasn't as noticible and it wasn't as important to have a slower as it is now. I think people really started to take notice of how important slow can be after Velious was released. At the time, there were (and still are) a lot of unmezzable mobs in Velious, and so reducing mob DPS became extremely important.<br />

That's my Ideal Hard LDoN group. I focus on the slowing, and keeping the enchanter alive (and his pet Malosinia'd)... Charmed pets crank out 900dps in hard, but an enchanter can't keep up with slowing, CC, AND controlling his pet. so I handle the slows and watch his health. Works fine.<br />
<br />
You don't need a warrior if you have a highend elemental SK, which is just plain awesome in my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agree Grizlor.<br />
<br />
I have done only a few hard missions so far, but i think most enchanters would have problems with keeping up cc, haste and slows in a fast pace situation like LDoN (hard only).<br />
<br />
Figure in 2 or 3 sub-optimal pulls and you are likely to run in serious troubles with your groups mana management, while the timer is still ticking.<br />
<br />
As a sidenote maybe i missed it, but i have yet to see any valuable evidence, that mitigation really decreases the actual gap between shaman slows and other slows. Or was there some data showing that?<br />
<br />
I know there was some long discussion, how the mitigation formula is working, but i don't remember a final conclusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well the thing is, of the 3 classes you compete with (brd/enc/bst) on hard advents, 2 of them are extremely busy doing other things. And you can't afford unslowed mobs in hard, so 1 slower + 1 debuffer, or 2 slowers is helpful.<br />
<br />
The chanter cod has to play very conservatively to maintain his pet, and doesn't bring heals to the table. The bard is gonna be pulling and CCing and his slows get resisted too, and it takes alot longer for bard to slow when mezzing. The bst cannot debuff.<br />
<br />
So in all cases, whether a group has a chanter, bard, or bst there still is a good reason to include a shaman. It's VERY good to have a backup healer too when slow/mez resists, and maloing adds make it real easy to keep mez.<br />
<br />
Hard missions increase the usefulness of debuffing (malo), and make a fast slow more important.</div></div><hr />

Heh, I guess my group pushed it a bit and we luckily ran with some great clerics, but SolA, Unrest, old CT, KK, Sebilis and HS were all dungeons that came with adds that I could not offtank.  Dunno where you guys lived, but shaman healing pre-chloroblast sucked...Superior Fizzle anyone??  Banded armor and my screaming mace were admittedly lacking the hp you can achieve on todays supa-toons though and maybe that is why, to me, LDoN &quot;hard&quot; adventures are so much old hat. :p</div></div><hr />

Hi all,<br />

Well our bard was fully slowing without mitigation so that tells me that mitigation does decrease the gap.<br />

<br />
The fact is that a resisted slow means a dead enchanter. A shaman at least has a chance to survive the initial blows until things get under control. <br />
<br />
My experience in hard missions in the 50ish range (low AA, no time gear, etc), is that you really need a cleric, shaman, and chanter as the basic because they can back each other up if needed. Cleric/chanter pacify. Cleric/shm heal. Chanter/shm slow. etc. etc. Personally, I like pally, rogue, cleric, shaman, chanter with a necro or mage as the 6th. <br />
<br />
In normal missions, I find that things die so fast that my hi level slows are a waste, I use my lower level ones just to keep the melee reassured then nuke or DoT as needed, saving high level slows for named or bosses. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think that any casting class that has inate mana regen is a plus in LDoN. That includes shaman, necros, chanters and mages (reclaiming pets).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There is a bug where if bard slows with epic equipped he gets no mitigation message. Tell you bard to deequip his epic for once, for a test, and he'll get the message.<br />
<br />
In my experience you definitely don't need a enchanter with a good bard. If you want to talk about safety get an evaccer. Won 7 hards, only 2 had chanter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doubt it.  Pure melee classes are in far, far worse shape than we are.<br />
<br />
Besides, &quot;class balance&quot; (whatever it is) seems to be driven almost entirely by the popularity of each class, rather than internal game-play factors.  On my server at least, there is not exactly a shortage of shammies...</div></div><hr />
