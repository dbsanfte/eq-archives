<br />
With the new announcements of not only EQII (set sometime in the future from EQ) but also Playstation EQ (Set some 500 years in the past of EQ), how do you feel about history being set in stone?  Any action taken by an individual, guild, or alliance of guilds has no bearing on future events. Now I know that one could write this off to the GODs and their interventions, but it saddens me that in all the MMORP games I've played, none have given me the satisfaction of changing, even in some small way, the course of history. <br />
<br />
Can any MMORPG even do this? Is it reasonable to ask?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if they did allow player actions to change the world, it would have to be the case that a very, very small minority of players would actually have a chance to do so -- meaning for 99% of the player base, there'd be no difference.<br />
<br />
Look at the Sleeper situation....</div></div><hr />

Would you honestly want them to be able to change your gaming universe?<br />
<br />
I sure as hell wouldn't.<br />

Then again, if ONLY I had the power to change EQ around......coool.<br />

Therein lies the crux of the problem.<br />

There is always some limiting factors.  At best the current crop, and most likely the next few generations, of MMORPGs will be a compromise on the dream.  Never fully realized.  And probably not even close.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean like waking the Sleeper on your server?  <br />
Chances are there are some people on your server who have participated in an EQ event that did directly impact the overall game story direction.  <br />
<br />
However, if you're wondering why &quot;your&quot; character (or someone elses) who did participate in a server event isn't subsequently written into &quot;official&quot; EQ history, well that gets into copyright and intellectual property laws.  Verant cannot simply take your character and write it into their formal history without your consent and offer of reasonable compensation. ( I won't even touch the rampant EULA violations about account information sharing at this point either.)<br />
<br />
To be honest, I'm glad that the game history cannot be impacted by other players.  To me it would be kind of like trying to force to accept the events in someone else's campaign setting as impacting mine as well.  In other words, I really don't care if your 20th level rogue single handedly slew Elminster  and stole Cyric's claims of godhood over assassins.  In my campaign world, Elminster is alive and well, and Cyric is still the god of assassins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it does not state that nor does Verant's EULA even remotely make such a claim.  <br />
<br />
There was a intellectual property case vs. an online provider service a number of years ago where someone posted a series of short stories on one their message boards.  The author eventually sought to get them published and managed to get them sold to a local magazine.  This online service tried to sue for copyright infringement citing that their terms of service gave them sole rights to characters and written materials posted on their boards.  The court found in favor of the author stating that the online service did not possess intellectual property rights in that the author paid for the message board services provided and adhered to the standing regulations for use of those boards at the time.  It was furthermore stated that the online provider's terms of service were a violation in trying to claim ownership of someone else's writings without offering proper compensation but that they do retain the right to use those stories for advertising purposes.<br />
<br />
This ruling has been upheld in several other cases of similiar nature with that and other online provider services since then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Section 11 of the EULA, only applies to character information you sumbit to their official media sites and is in reference to their intellectual property rights they have granted you license to use.  <br />
<br />
Loosely translated:  <br />
<br />
They can post screen shots of your character killing Vox et. al and use it for advertising purposes without offering you any sort of compensation.<br />
<br />
Any information or writings of your character that you post on their official boards can be used for advertising without offering compensation.<br />
<br />
They can mention on their official sites that your character completed action X and was awarded some title or object in game for advertising purposes.  (They cannot make mention of the account holder's name without your consent though, as that's a violation of the Privacy Act.)  <br />
<br />
They can do this because your character likeness is actually made from their content.  You use the choices they provide you with for appearance and equipment.  You have a rented license to do so, this license permits you to write stories or use the EQ setting for non-profit purposes without their consent.  As far as official events go, you consented to participate in a story/event that they created and accepted offered compensation forthwith from them for purposes of advertising.<br />
<br />
They cannot &quot;sell&quot; any of this though without your consent.  They cannot take your writings and sell them for publishing without your consent.  Just as you cannot publish a story of your character in the EQ setting without their consent.  Advertising is not viewed as a source of income but as a means of generating revenue, hence why they can use your character for free advertising.  And this is another reason why they're particular about not allowing people to take copyrighted/famous names.<br />
<br />
They cannot take your character by name and write up a unique story within the EQ setting and post it on their media sites for advertising or attempt to sell it as a story for a novel, comic, short story, or whatever.  That is an infringement of your intellectual property rights.</div></div><hr />

To answer this question, It would take massive GM intervention (and creativity) to change the environments, of the inter-relationship, of the species, classes, religions and continents involved.  <br />
Personally, I think an ever-changing Everquest world be fun to play in. All it would take is a little Imagination.<br />
<br />
Example: GFAY, An invader form another plane is invading GFAY killing both Elf and Orc alike neither the can defend themselves alone from this now common foe…so they join forces….. and now you can play an Orc. <br />
Until they are will be driven off by a brave group of adventures (that figure out the quest) by defeating the ultimate evil……..….bla bla bla…..Where one Player becomes the champion/god/hero (pick one) of the….bla bla bla<br />
<br />
Example: World war breaks out, and if you are a species, not indigenous to that continent you need to get out! (Simple kos change) however you could still adventure. But you need to do local quests until you raise your faction to sell  buy or trade, however if it is learned you are conspiring with the enemy, well, your welcome home may not be to welcome.<br />
<br />
See just a little imagination. <br />
(watch the bastards run with these ideas and make a ton of $$)<br />
<br />
But as we know there is little to no real GM intervention. <br />
