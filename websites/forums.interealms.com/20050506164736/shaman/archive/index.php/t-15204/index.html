It adds 13 counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Okay, I'm even more confused now then. I thought I figured it out and it was 4, but by that token, Remove Curse only removes 8 counters.<br />
<br />
That's Xegony's AE and I was assigned to cure MT. However, I don't have RGC. I was worried bout it so posted here in hopes of a quick reply.<br />
<br />
However, normal RC seems to cure it in one cast.<br />
/boggle  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok here is my guess:<br />
<br />
Whenever a spell has a line line &quot;Increase ____ counters by X&quot;, that spell can be cured, obviously.  Whenever you remove enough counters to cancel out one line of this, you get a &quot;Your target has been cured&quot; message, when in fact the spell still remains until you cure the second line.  This is just a guess, though.  They probably did this just to confuse you :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">However, I don't have RGC <br />
<br />
their is a way to fix that   :D  take a group to ssra pop rags 1  or the alternate way is to spend some dkp on a blackflame sphere ( if your guild is on dkp )  but the casting time is rather slow  but its mana free som im not compllaining :)</div></div><hr />

I think it has to do with stacking.  I think.  The numbers of the slots, 1-6, are important.  If another npc tried to cast a different spell on you that had, say, a change to Attack Speed in slot 5, it wouldn't stack.  That's not a common example though.  Here's a better one, from Lucy:<br />
<br />
Avatar:<br />
3:  Increase ATK by 100 <br />
5:  Increase AGI by 100 <br />
6:  Increase STR by 100 <br />
7:  Increase DEX by 100 <br />
<br />
Voice of the Berserker:<br />
3:  Increase AC by 24 <br />
5:  Increase AGI by 74 (L59) to 80 (L65) <br />
6:  Increase STR by 84 (L59) to 90 (L65) <br />
7:  Increase DEX by 74 (L59) to 80 (L65) <br />
These two spells do not stack with each other, because they affect some of the same stats in the same slots.  They both affect Agi in slot 5, Str in slot 6, and Dex in slot 7.  It is, however, possible for spells to stack even if they affect the same stats, so long as the effects are in different slots.  For example:<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Daiku:<br />
5:  Increase STR by 45 <br />
6:  Increase DEX by 35<br />
This spell stacks with both Avatar and VotB because while they all affect Str and Dex, TotD does it in different slots.  That is why if you click on the Stacking detail for a spell in Lucy, it has separate lists for each slot.<br />
<br />
Now, back to the question of RGC.  I haven't really looked at counters all that much, but now I see something interesting:<br />
Remove Curse:<br />
1:  Decrease Curse Counter by 4 <br />
2:  Decrease Curse Counter by 4 <br />
Remove Greater Curse<br />
1:  Decrease Curse Counter by 9 <br />
2:  Decrease Curse Counter by 9 <br />
3:  Decrease Curse Counter by 9 <br />
4:  Decrease Curse Counter by 9 <br />
5:  Decrease Curse Counter by 9<br />
Is it possible that in order to remove a curse counter, the cure you are casting must remove counters from the same slot?  In that case, RC would never be able to cure the spell you're referring to, while RGC would do it in one cast.  That would be one reason why they might have curse counters on different lines.  The other reason would be that there are other spells with curse counters that they don't want to stack with that one, which doesn't really make any sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Teddey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, it wouldn't need to be in the same slot.  The remove curse line of spells are considered &quot;instant&quot; spells, and therefore wouldn't have any stacking issues whatsoever.  What is more likely is what Jinheim is saying, because for some reason Xenogy's curse has two seperate additions to the curse counter.<br />
<br />
Still /boggle, and absolutely everything that Dandi is sure of is right, but as for what the issue seems to be remains a mystery.  Just get RGC and the problem is solved ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heh, ok, thanks.<br />
