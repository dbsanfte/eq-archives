<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aranim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Aesher is my 24th level Ranger on Fironia Vie. One of the unique things on this server is that there is no  &quot;no drop&quot; items. Consequently I was able to buy all four Ivy runes. However I do not know which is which.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if I have to identify these or will the NPC simply not accept the wrong one and give it back. ( I do remeber the days of handing in wrong items to have them be lost forever).<br />
<br />
I do intend to aquire most of the components myself for the challenge and satifaction but the gems seem awfully expensive. At least to me with my faction and charisma as it is. These days it seems  less expensive just to buy the armor or simmilar armor for just what the gems alone cost. ( In fact I did buy the Ivy bracer for 50 pp.The Fire Emerald alone would cost me 97pp)<br />
I know maximizing charisma and faction will help but is there other ways to aquiring these gems? Do they drop anywhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm pretty sure that at least some of the gems you need for Ivy armor are only able to be bought, for example the Star of Odus can only be obtained from an Erudin merchant.  You could check the quest listings on Allakhazam, they may have more information about that.<br />
<br />
With the new NPC system items that they don't want are just handed back, but you might want to identify them anyway just to avoid confusion.  All int casters can cast identify from about level 16 I think, and there are a couple of cheap ID items you can get, one being the Silvery Mask.  There's also a quested ID item, The Questing Ranger (http://www.questing-ranger.com) has a walkthrough for that quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have someone cast &quot;Identify&quot; on you while holding the runes. They will identify as the Top, Bottom, Left and Right Halves of Rune of Ivy. I know the one from Thistle is for the tunic and the one from the orc is for the bracers. You can check allakazam to find out which ones are for what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tefon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not sure about your server, but you might want to check the bazaar for Ivy armor pieces because people now sell Ivy armor cheaper than you can buy the gems.  Could definitely save you some money, of course you may want to do the quest yourself for the satisfaction. Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You will find most of the gems dropping in either Stonebrunt or Geonids in CC. They are not easy to get though and Im sure if you could hunt either of those places you would get the money for the gem before the gem itself.<br />
<br />
Casting Identify would work on the runes, but may be hard for you to arrange. If you have all the pieces for each item you really should be able to hand them all in and get the pieces. Ive not ever tried it, but I can see no reason why handing all the items in higgeldy piggeldy would not achive the same results, as long as you do it immediately and not leave the area.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taldaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wont quest npcs now hand back items if they aren't teh right ones needed?  so it should all work out if you take your time and nothing messes up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kimexe Calmbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yet I recommend you to identify them. Still some NPC can just eat items. (I'm now searching for NPC who will accept mercenary orders card in SkyShrine. every NPC just eat up the card and say nothing!)<br />
<br />
I have 'Star of Eyes', intermediate product on the way to get Wizard Spell:IceCommet, which has unlimited charges of Identify. I gathered all wand(or spoke of the wheel) by myself, include Neriak, L.Guk hand room etc.<br />
No NoDrop items? then you can... erp, i fear nerf wheel =p ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">there is an item with unlimited charges of identify, but i forget the name.  Its definately a great tool to keep in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Philomel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe it is called a Silvery Mask or something to that extent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Underbrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Correct, silvery mask is questable or droppable in Kael. They are often sold in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Crimsonsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">just about ANYTHING about the ivy quests can be answered here<br />
