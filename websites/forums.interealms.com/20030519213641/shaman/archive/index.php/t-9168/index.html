<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Folks!<br />
<br />
I have a friend leaving EQ who may drop a bunch of plat on me.  He's liquidating his equipment because last time I just held it a few months and gave if back when he reactivated account :)  Hehe.  He's determined to quit this time.  So....<br />
<br />
If you had about 50K, what would you upgrade?<br />
<br />
Here's what I'm wearing:<br />
<br />
Head:  Metal Linked Crown<br />
Ear:  Earring of Solstice<br />
Ear:  Earring of Twisted Leaves<br />
Neck:  Ivory Imbued Collar<br />
Face: Crystal Spider Eye<br />
Arms:  JB<br />
Chest:  Ikky BP<br />
Back:  Acrylia Studded Cloak<br />
Shoulders:  Chokadai Spaulders<br />
Waist:  Girdle of Blood Fiend<br />
Wrist:  Bracelet of Fortitude<br />
Wrist:  Bracelet of Sense<br />
Hands:  Leaf Scale Gloves<br />
Legs:  Kromriff Military Leggings<br />
Feet:  Tribal War Boots<br />
Range:  Gantru Charm<br />
Shield:  Stretched Fungal Shield<br />
Primary:  Spine Chill Spear<br />
Ammo:  Horsey Lasso<br />
<br />
I have a quest EB neck piece from Katta.  I also rarely melee anymore.  I'm in a smaller guild that does not have the +50 people power to camp much that takes more than 1-2 groups of lv. 50-58 folks (we all seem to play different hours :(  ).  So not really looking for camping suggestions unless can be done with one group of lv. 50-58 folks.  I'll eventually get my epic, but not  very soon.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of buying:<br />
<br />
1)  Lodi Shield.  Nice back item, great AC, decent Wis, great Resists and EB--runs about 22-24K on my server.<br />
<br />
2)  Obolous Death Shroud.  Mmmmm tasty focus effect.  These run about 17-19K on my server.<br />
<br />
3)  History of Di'Zok (may have gotten name slightly wrong).  Book for the primary hand with 15 ac plus hitpoints and mana....About 4K on my server.<br />
<br />
or another primary hand item to replace the Spine Chill Spear, maybe REIF???  But I really do rarely melee anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  Would you upgrade differently?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the assistance!!!<br />
<br />

lv. 55 Shaman<br />
<br />
P.S.  At the moment, my AC runs just over 900 self-buffed.  My Hitpoints are around 1950 self-buffed, and my Wisdom hovers around 200 (unless I swap in my pair of +7 Wis rings for the 6/65 I usually wear, then around 214).<br />
<br />
P.P.S.  I was just researching some focus effect items (have no idea what prices are for them on my server), but found two that look great, Amulet of Insight (Extended Enhancement III) and Gem Encrusted Ring (Afflication Efficiency III). I see that Gem Encrusted Ring drops in OS, but allakhazam's only says from &quot;mulitiple mobs&quot; and the comments only fight over which class should get (lmao).  Anyway, anyone know what drops the Gem Encrusted Ring and how rare it is?????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm. Might be good to save some of that cash for your high end spells, and camp the eqipment upgrades.<br />
<br />
1) Lodi is nice, but a Hiero cloak is better IMHO. HP &gt; AC I keep my Lodi bagged for when I ned resists. Hiero runs about 5-7k less on my server.<br />
<br />
2) Nice item. Good upgrade.<br />
<br />
3) I never want to see a shaman carrying a book. Even if you don't melee, pretend you do and carry a spear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">buy a fungi.  or save it for malo if you want to be in a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not really interested in being in a raiding guild, or if I went to a raiding guild, would only a casual one.<br />
<br />
It will probably be 6 months before I ding 60, I'm in no rush, not even hunting in the Planes because I am enjoying exploring the +50 dungeons and older zones with my guildmates.<br />
<br />
/em hangs his head in shame about the book thing.  <br />
I would like to get a new weapon to replace the spine chill, but honestly no weapon I can find (except epic and other high-end stuff that is too hard for me to get atm) offers better overall all stats.  I honestly never whack anything anymore except the occassional greenie.  This is a hard decision.<br />
<br />
Never seen a Fungi on my server for less than 70-80K, and they are VERY hard to find for sale.  Bidding often exceeds 100K.  I'm going to go back to FG and do Summoning Beasties quest  to try and get Fungi Vest (and maybe luck out and get the 1HB Focus Staff that drops there--my shield came from that quest event and I love it).<br />
<br />
I had not thought about Hiero cloak.  Hmmm <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Save up for torpor, no matter what guild you are in, no matter what kind of playing you do, that spell is a godsend...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, or with 50k, you could actually afford to smith to GM status, then actually make money with armor, blk acrylia, and planar stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go with what they said, and about hte Gem Encrusted Ring, it stopped dropping a long time ago, and bidding on my server usually goes to around 70-80k for it, so doubt you'll get a hold of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nebmai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On Prexus, I just picked up Gem Encrusted Ring for 16K, with four other people offering it to me for between 17K and 20K.  I also did the Coldain Bracer quest in GD--and I can tell you that these two focus items have helped immensly!  My slows never wear off, even in long fights, my roots hold longer, my dots are more efficient.  I'd say go for Afflicition Efficiency instead of Mana Preservation, because here are the spells that will save mana:<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficiency (25% off the following)<br />
Roots<br />
Dots<br />
Slows<br />
<br />
Other spells you'd be casting (10% off)<br />
Buffs<br />
Regen<br />
Healing<br />
Pet<br />
Haste<br />
<br />
The cost of Obulus Death Shroud and Gem Encrusted Ring are about the same on most servers, if the servers were around when GER was still dropping.  If you're soloing, you're probably casting a Dot (or two) and a Slow every fight, making Afflicition Efficiency a huge bonus (extra 15% mana savings) over the Death Shroud.  <br />
<br />
In addition, I'd recommend also picking up an Amulet of Insight.  They run 4-5K on my server, and have Extended Enhancement III.  This allows not only for your long duration buffs to last 15% longer, but also to extend the time your short duration buffs (Regen/Haste/Pet Haste) last. <br />
<br />
Let's assume you get a KEI which lasts 3 hours even.<br />
<br />
Base:<br />
Alacrity (to Pet): 115 Mana, 11 Minutes.<br />
Spirit Quickening (to Pet): 50 Mana, 6 Minutes.<br />
Regrowth (Self): 300 Mana, 15 Minutes.<br />
Regrowth (Pet): 300 Mana, 15 Minutes.<br />
<br />
Over a three hour period (no modifiers):<br />
Alacrity: Cast 16 Times (1840 Mana Total).<br />
Spirit Quickening: Cast 30 times (1500 Mana Total)<br />
Regrowth: Cast 24 Times (7200 Mana Total)<br />
Total Mana Used (No modifiers): 10,540<br />
<br />
Over a three hour period (Mana Preservation):<br />
Alacrity: Cast 16 Times (1656 Mana Total)<br />
Spirit Quickening: Cast 30 Times (1350 Mana Total)<br />
Regrowth:  Cast 24 Times (6480 Mana Total)<br />
Total Mana Used (Mana Preservation): 9486 Mana<br />
<br />
Over a three hour period (Extended Enhancement)<br />
Alacrity:  Cast 14 Times (1610 Mana Total)<br />
Spirit Quickening: Cast 26 Times (1300 Mana Total)<br />
Regrowth:  Cast 20 Times (6000 Mana Total)<br />
Total Mana Used (Extended Enhancement): 8910 Mana<br />
<br />
Over a three hour period (EE + MP)<br />
Alacrity: Cast 14 Times (1449 Mana Total)<br />
Spirit Quick: Cast 26 times (1170 Mana Total)<br />
Regrowth: Cast 20 Times (5400 Mana Total)<br />
Total Mana Used (EE + MP): 8019 Mana<br />
<br />
As you can see from the above, Focus items make a huge difference!  However, to a shaman, the most negigable of these is MC3--I'd rank the order of importance to be Afflicition Efficiency (quarter mana cost Dots and Slows), Afflicition Extension (longer dots and slows), Extended Enhancement, and then Mana Conversation.<br />
<br />
Hope this post helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WoW Neb!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the full discussion, I really appreciate it!  I was leaning towards the ODS because I see them discussed often here and they seem readily available in the Bazaar on torv.<br />
<br />
But your post made some good points.  I may hold out and look around for afflication efficiency item (or extension).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the well thought out advice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">fungi would be handy.<br />
go with the heiro over the lodizal, the extra hp is quite good, and 75 mana is quite a bit too.<br />
<br />
if you don't go with the fungi, just look around for buyable items that have a big boost over your current gear, rings, shoulders, belts, necks are good places to start.  <br />
<br />
If you really want mana pres, the crystalline torque from VL is a neck slot with 12 ac and MP3, usually runs a lot cheaper than ODS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Save up for Fungi, Malo, or Torpor.  Anything else is immaterial at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe I did not mention, I'm a cat. <br />
<br />
Fungi VEST 's I have never seen for sale on torv. server.  <br />
<br />
Regular Fungi (which I cannot wear) sell  for 100-120 K I found out.<br />
<br />
Since another 6 months before I dong 60, thinking focus items the way to go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't know how much these run, but barbed rubicite legs are nice (65 hp/droppable). They are even campable, if you can actually convince people to visit CT in this day and age.<br />
<br />
Personally though, I would save for my spells. It's almost trivial to level up in PoP with the xp modifier there, and being 60 means almost nothing without Torpor.</div></div><hr />
