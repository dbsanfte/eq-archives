<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, guild is going to MM this sunday, and they want to try to do the black dire wolf for me. However I am no where near that part in the epic, and therefore dont have warmly faction, which from what i've read is what you need to be able to hail him and have him talk to you. If we just kill him without me talking to him first will he still drop the pelt or skin (forgot which it is) I need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been a while, but I don't think you need any kind of faction check to kill black dire, nor do you need to converse with him.  Once he is spawned, all you have to do is kill him.<br />
<br />
To spawn him, you have to kill the Advisor inside the castle.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have also heard that he is about a 2 hour spawn, so you may not need to kill the Advisor at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Black dire can be done solo. I soloed him at level 56 with jbb. Also i had to kill advisor to get him to pop. I invis up go into room with advisor. I bound at zone by the way. I dotted advisor as much as possible and jbb him to death. You will get attacked by others that are close but i just dealt with it and just killed advisor as fast as possible. When dead, gate out. Invis back up and go to black dire. Go up the hill next to him and I casted slow on him and run back to zone.... wait to see black dire near the zone and then zone out. Zone back in, make pet and buff pet with everything. Med to full before doing black dire. Then send in pet and jbb to death and keep pet alive was pretty easy really.  Also you dont need to have faction.  When he is killed he drops the loot you need everytime.  If black dire is not up you need to kill advisor which i think advisor is on 2 hour spawn not black dire.  Soon as you kill advisor black dire will spawn outside of building.  Then you can continue to do what i have stated.  Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No prob to kill him if u dont have the right faction, <br />
BUT dont turn in the scale untill u are sure u got the right faction. <br />
<br />
Or you will not get the boots of the spirit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I messed this up really bad last night - Black Dire was easy by the way.  I just invised in and killed Advisor with 54 ench, 53 cleric and 52 druid and gated out (overkill really but I wanted him dead fast).  Went to Black Dire and tashed with enchanter and ran to zone pulling everyone else with me. Rinse repeat until he is solo at zonline, med buff up and attack.  I logged in my shaman to Malaise him (stuck at 44 np with tash) and slowed him, then got my druid back on and dotted/nuked to death.<br />
<br />
One small problem - when I went to the spirit I was so pysched I just handed him the pelt ... doh!   <br />
<br />
Remember to give the spirit your gem first, and to go through the dialogue (not sure if talking to the spirit is necessar before the pelt turn-in, but it is necessary afterward).<br />
<br />
Arg back to kill Dire again *sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grezaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You definitely do not need to talk to dire before killing him.<br />
I thought I made a grave error by not talking to him but as long as you follow what you are supposed to with the spirit in EJ you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes there was a shaman there when I went back that insisted I talk to Dire before killing him - well I had already pulled him and he just kinda started debuffing him for me (thanks by the way - saved me a log out and log back in =)).  I killed him and he had the pelt so yes you do not need to talk to Dire at all before you keel heem.</div></div><hr />
