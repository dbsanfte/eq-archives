It was annoying getting a tell right when you zone and not being able to read it until you were done.

A message that says &quot;Entering Zone_Name&quot; appears in the middle of your screen.  It does a nice sort of fade in and fade out effect.  <br />
<br />
I can't decide.  It's kinda neat, but also gives me a vague console game vibe.  Practically speaking, it's useless, because we always have and still do get the &quot;You have entered Zone_Name&quot; message after zoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been on Test Server for quite some time now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree 100% with Helter Skelter.  The zone in message annoyed me the very first time I saw it and I’ve liked it less with each viewing.  Every since PoP I’ve read posts where people have complained that Sony is dumbing down the game.  I agree that the game has become easier, port books being a perfect example, but I never felt like the game was becoming too easy or that I was being spoon-fed.  That all changed with this last patch.<br />
<br />
I don’t need big letters appearing in the center of my screen telling me what zone I’m entering.  I already know what zone I’m entering, that’s why I’m entering it.  And if for some bizarre reason I don’t know what zone I just entered I’m smart enough to look in my text box to find out.  So with the next patch are we going to get even more helpful questions?  You have opened a door. You have sat down. You have cast a spell. You have started to swim.   <br />
<br />
This is the very first patch where I feel Sony is not only spoon-feeding me, they’re shoving the spoon in my mouth whether I want it or not.  With this same patch they also added huge numbers onto our hot buttons.  Not only are these unnecessary, but they make it difficult to read the actual names they've been given.  <br />
<br />
This EQ patch has been brought to you by the number 9 and the letters E and Z.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I know you might be too cool for the new message telling you what zone you are entering. I know I don't need to be told what zone I am entering, if I didn't know it, I wouldn't be going there.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I fail to see how you can consider this &quot;dumbing down&quot; the game, when it already tells you what zone you are entering.  It's not like this is new information never known before and top secret, it's always been right in front of you.<br />
<br />
I'm indifferent about the text, it looks cool though.  Not hiding all windows while zoning is a huge plus in my book though, I always hated staring at someone's back while zoning, or the top of your helmet, or whatever wierd pose your char was in w/ no text or anything else to look at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think maybe if this is pissing you off, you need a break from the game.   Nothings changed... you still can't do anything while zoning, you still miss chat channels , /g, /gu, etc...  what's changed?  Letters on the screen... maybe it's more for the newbies as opposed to the grizzled vets... but it does absolutely nothing bad to the game... if you don't want to see it, don't look at your screen during zoning.</div></div><hr />

Must be nice to have never wandered lost in a dungeon and zoned, and wondered where you were zoning too.  Or forgotten where you bound and gated, then realized half-way through the loading that you don't know where you will end up.  Some of us play a lot of chars and forget which one is bound where, and sometimes we aren't thinking and hit gate before asking ourselves that all important question.<br />
<br />
And on the blinding thing, lol, remember the first time this happened ?  At least for me, and the few folks I've asked, if you don't know what's happening you think your computers crashed!!!  Would love to see a message on the screen instead of a pure blank screen ... maybe just the edges around the outside, or &quot;You are blind&quot; in the middle of the screen, or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I really think the new zoning messages are kinda cool.  There are still a few zones I haven't been to yet, and the message is kinda cool.  I know that some people think they know everything about the game ( probably read off a spoiler site and not really learned personally ) but at least on some servers the unexpected can happen.  There has been more than once when I was in pvp and didn't know of I had died or zoned - hee hee.  Or maybe swimming through the lava to get to Sol C, did you die or find that hidden zoneline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think the lag-o-meter stays around when you are blinded.  Been awhile since I was blinded though.<br />
<br />
I like the new zoning messages, and leaving the windows up while zoning is a plus.  At least SoE didn't implement the true console zoning screen.  The one with the pretty graphic and a bar showing the progress.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">on a side note, anyone notice the numbers behind the hotbuttons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wonder if you can see the zoning message if you are blinded. Really annoying to try casting spells and then seeing that you were doing crap while zoning because you died and that you came back to your bind point.<br />
Really, if you can see the zoning message while blinded, it isn't a bad thing, occasional of course, but still nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I like the new messages and the fact that the chat boxes don't disappear on zoning.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why folks don't like small UI changes that in no way effect game play - they just make information easier to understand and more readily available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">All I know is thank goodness they added the (Exit) to the camp button.  I was so tired of waiting for the servers to come down to log my character off!</div></div><hr />

Don't really care about the zone messages.<br />
<br />
How exactly has the clip plane been &quot;fixed&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">What is up with that?  Am I really so stupid to click on a stone or get a port and not know what zone I'm about to enter?  These msgs annoy the hell out of me.  <br />

I like it, even though it really doesnt tell me anything I dont already know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">For those of you who find this zoning message annoying I have a fix that is easy to implement and works incredibly well.<br />
<br />
As quickly as possible AFTER clickingon/running into the zoneline turn your head approximately 45 degrees to either the left OR the right. This should  obscure the message from your view. if you have incredible peripheral vision increase the angle by 5 degree increments until the message is not visible. Upon audible completion of zoning return head to initial position.<br />
<br />
A bit of a hack, but it works well, try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Lol, good stuff Barbacus.  Like a lot of people have already said I don't really care about the text but it is nice to be able to read tells, group chat, guild chat, etc while zoning.  I don't think that was really dumming down the game since it told you what the zone was once you zoned anyway though I do find the numbers behind the hotbuttons a little insulting.  <br />
<br />
As far as blind goes I kind of like it the way it is, nothing visible, not even the lag bar.  It isn't like you don't know what's happened after the first time you've been blinded and it makes for a great story the first time it happens.  I've always liked blind since a few months ago this newbie kept bugging me and finally offered to duel me.  I just rooted and blinded him for 10 minutes until he must have just shut off his computer because he went ld.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">And it really helps if you're having an official &quot;Millman&quot; night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Not directly related to new message, but appears to have been in the same patch.<br />
<br />
I like the new bazaar feature which tells you the class and level of a spell after clicking on the scroll's name. This seems a very good idea to me.<br />
<br />
Also the ability to open multiple item windows instead of just one. Mixed feelings about this one, but seems a good idea.<br />
<br />
As for the messages on zoning, I dont think that they are much of a help or a hinderance. /shrug<br />
<br />
Anyways just my 2 cents worth :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>wyrdrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I like the multiple item windows, lets you compare items easier.<br />
<br />
Also, when you consent, it tells the consentee what zone in which your corpse resides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The messages on zoning don't bother me a bit. The numbers on hotkeys I don't really mind either.<br />
<br />
I like that you can see the level of another classes spell without having to ask someone from that class.<br />
<br />
I like that you no longer have to camp to get the button to ungrey if you hit &quot;begin trader&quot; when there are 500 traders already, or if you're not quite under the stall.<br />
<br />
I like being able to see more than one item at a time, so you can compare things. It's not exactly hard to hit escape a few times to close them down.<br />
<br />
As for blind - yeah, every time it happens I have a short moment of wondering what's gone wrong with my screen... followed usually by a longer moment wondering what's going on with the group, am I dying, etc. A &quot;You are blind&quot; message might help, though I'm sure some people would moan about it.<br />
<br />
Thinking about being blind, why is it you can't see tells, groupchat, says, etc, when blind? It's not like you're deaf as well. When I'm chatting to a friend and close my eyes, I can still hear him. Maybe the spell should be &quot;sensory deprivation&quot;, and not &quot;blind&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Heh, I think that the &quot;zoning to ...&quot; message is kinda dumb but the &quot;Camp (Exit)&quot; addition to our UI was utterly retarded.  Not since the turning off of the lag bar because it &quot;confused newbs&quot;, have they added somthing SOOOO .... sooo .... so .... well dumb.  I mean really SoE, why don't you just ding ALL new charecters to level 10 cuz untill then there is NO risk involved in any thing you do, they even level you skills for you!  You are so babied that by the time you make it to level 11 and things get &quot;hard&quot;, THEN WHAT!  You should have been learning for the last 10 levels but they made them so easy you get nothing out of it.  Every one has some high level connection it seem though so these worthelss n00bs in uber clothing get all the way to level 55 and 60 and even 65 and they have NO idea how to play their class.  !! True story !!  I ACTUALY grouped wiht a shaman the other day (yeah, yeah, I know, ya dont need two shamans in a group ever but I needed 5% to ding and ... well at least I dinged), and this person was not cannibalizing, when asked why she actualy said &quot;Well I have KEI and I don't want to lose life if I dont have to.&quot;  She was then too low on mana to keep the tank healed (we had not cleric), so I slowed, healed, dotted, nuked, and still had a few mana to spare 'cuz I was on my drogmar, chain casting canni 3.<br />
    *ROAR*  It just peevs me that all the games that are comming out, it seems, are designed with skilless chumps in mind.  AC2 let you bind at the bind stone out side of any dungeon for free, and then your corpse was looted and no exp was lost when you died ... what am I supposed to be afraid of in alot of these new games, cuz death certianley is not a worry.  *sigh* Oh well, I guess I would do the same if 100,000 people want a hard, challanging game and 10,000,000 people want a cake walk and they are all paying the same thing ... give 'em em what they want.<br />
     I actualy went back and busted out the normal Nintendo and played stuff like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1, Blaster Master, Mission: Impossible, and all the old stuff and it was HARD AS HELL!!!  I got owned 6 ways from Sunday.  LOL maby I should get some digital switches added in place of the by-pass and analog crap that is in there now and make it my primary gaming machine again ... hmm *look up at the sky, pondering*.  At any rate, after a quick rant, I feel much better.  Thanks for your time everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lighten up folks. Some of us have played for years. But there are tons of people that just started playing, and these messages will make things more understandable for them. And NONE of the changes hurt any of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">re: the new bazaar interface where each item you inspect opens in a new window.  I think it's mildly annoying the new way.<br />

Is there a way to force the next item to use the same window?  i.e. Click the item to have it appear in a new window, SHIFT-Click the item to have it appear in a currently open window.<br />
<br />
Invariably, if i'm just 'surfin' the bazaar, I end up with 10 item windows opened that I'm not using any longer, and it's a pain in the ass to close all of them.   Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I have to agree, if this really pissed you off you need to take a break.  Go outside, that yellow ball in the sky that is warm and hurts to look at, thats called the Sun.  Go stand out there under it and put some color back on your skin and maybe a zoning message wont seem so annoying anymore  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">These messages are beyond useless to EVERYONE in the game; newbie or veteran.  Their purpose is null, they have none.  I see all the debates about how they help you because the let you know where you are going, and sometimes thats confusing.  Well so what, how does that help you at all, its not like you can do anything about it once you already started zoning.  I dont see how this helps newbies in the slightest.  The very instant you are able to take action, you will know what zone you are in, because it pops up in your chat box.  I dont see how its possible to be anything but indifferent to these messages.</div></div><hr />

I dunno fail to see what it changes since i'm zoning anyway. Nothing i can change because i see the text popping up. Telling me the mob is red to my lvl 4 and asking me if i really wanna attack it is dumbing it down. Slashing my guild leading is a right of passage. Telling me where i am zoning too isnt a whole lot different than telling me where i zoned into.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm I love being able to finally compare shoulder A to shoulder B without having to click them back and forth through one window. But i dont see an option for changing this. &quot;appears&quot; they will have to add a new button for choosing open new window or use same. Any guesses how long that'll take?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I like the zoning message.  I had a RL friend play EQ for the first time recently and he almost rebooted his computer when he hit the qeynos/qeynos hills zoneline.<br />
<br />
I also like the multiple examine box thing.  Definately worth having to close the extra window, because in exchange you can pull up your CURRENT item and the prospective REPLACEMENT item and compare them one on one.<br />
<br />
And, best of all - THEY FIXED AUTORUN!  Hitting up-arrow now takes you out of autorun!  Hooray!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The zoning message seems pointless to me. Not offensive, just pointless. Now if it warned you as you approached a zone line... that would be useful.<br />
<br />
As for the extra inspect windows - I love it.<br />
<br />
As for the various /bazaar bugs - they're infuriating. I can't search the bazaar if there's more than 500 traders, because /bazaar crashes EQ. I can't buy certain items in the bazaar as the buy option is greyed out (diamonds at the moment can't be bought - for me anyway).<br />
<br />
I know, I know, patches require patches, but as it stands the bazaar is unusable for me at peak times.</div></div><hr />

Is there any way to disable this?<br />

Dear god, they make a nice change and people still whine about it - isn't there something more important to occupy your frustration?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I don't understand the effort being put in to make the game friendlier to &quot;new&quot; players.  Check out the newbie zones sometime - empty.  There are very very very few people trying eq for the first time after 4 years.  I would prefer they spend their development dollars on balance issues and content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">One of the goals of the dev team (as with any business) is to bring in new customers. Making the lower end game easier helps to accomplish this, and personally I think it is working. I have seen a HUGE influx of brand new players in the last few months.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">My first day running around, I zoned into Blackburrow, didn't pay attention, and got whacked.<br />
<br />
I had no idea where i'd gone, how i'd gotten there, or what to do. All I knew was that things that looked like blue rat people (that mystified me) had kicked my butt, and now had my butt in their possession.<br />
<br />
If I had seen the &quot;you have entered&quot; message (or known to look), then maybe I could have had someone help me, instead of just wondering where the big cave with a tunnel was in the labyrinth of Everfrost.<br />
<br />
I like 'em</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Well, we sure are reaching for things when we complain about something so trivial :)   But hey, gives ya something to talk about so why not? :P<br />
<br />
<br />
  I can actually see 1 use to em... now you know if when the Flan hit the sheets if the ruid/wizzie cast Evac or sucor.   And if you are ever caught by a malicious wizzie that wants to pop you to Hate/CT without warning.. well now you got warning :)    Wanna know if you managed to zone on time from that train or if you died?   Look at the zone info!<br />
<br />
<br />
  Overall.. it can have some limited use to it, and it doesn't seem to cause more lag or longer zone time, so I don't see any problems with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  I can say that in LDoN it will be quite useful to see as the zoning message will tell you &quot;You are now entering GukF&quot; and the text message will say &quot;You have entered the Lower Dungeons of Guk!&quot; (or wahtever the cool name is for it).  This means that if you zone in SOMEHOW without your group you can at least tell them that you are in F instead of E and make a sensible petition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I dont see how its possible to be anything but indifferent to these messages.<br />
I like it.<br />
I like it for 2 very good reasons.<br />
EQ hangs at times.<br />
EQ will just freeze up on some people's machines, especially often when you zone.<br />
There are times when I die to big hitting mobs and when I look at my screen, I still have 60%+ HP left.<br />
When I die at those times, I have no idea I've actually died.<br />
Instead it looks like my screen froze, and if I'm having a slow day zoning, I'll reboot my computer if it's taking too long.<br />
This way I won't actually reboot my comp because I'll actually KNOW I'm just zoning.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen the second situation yet, but I'd guess it will work properly.<br />
Have you ever been blinded?<br />
Have you ever died while blind?<br />
How did you know you died?<br />
Have you ever had EQ freeze while dying while blind?<br />
I have.<br />
It sucks.<br />
<br />
Wonderful change to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">one thing I have to say to this, what happoned to reading the mannule that came with the game. that told you what camp did. I had no trouble learning that when I first played.<br />
<br />
The little message that pops up in the middle of the sreen is very annoying couse well IF i wanted to know where i had zoned in to I would READ my chat  box, If i did nto I could iqnore the whole deal. now its shoved in my face wether i care for it or not. part of the fun of the game is not knowing exactly where you are and to some extent only haveing a scetchie idea of where your going. Its finding the way around the world. Its learning that this zone is no place for you to be at this lvl. I never raed a class sight before my shaman got to the lvl of 18 to 20 or so. I never heard of the term &quot;camp&quot; meaning staying in one place killing a small handfull of guys to wait for one rare to pop, tell i was near enough to 40 to not realy care anymore. I remember hunting in your newbie zones where you had very few if any people from other races in the zones tuned for your race ( yes I am a iksar and the brand new server thay opened up a while ago was a MESS couse it seemed like EVERY one was in FOB no matter what city thay started in. was utterly funny seeing full groups takeing on stuff in the pit and sertine classes like clerics and chanters being sought out for them groups even though thay should not have been there in the first place. this was all for the fact that the mobs there gave more exp to help compasate for the race/class penaltys of the entire iksar race when Kunark came out ). I short I remaber the game being fun and a challange and the thrill of finding out what you could do with out it being told to you and in some small way feeling that you where then only XXXXX ( insert class ) in the game that had come up with that way of playing or fighting or what ever. <br />
<br />
IMO tghe bazzar killed the &quot;real&quot; newbie game. with everything so easy to get to and with so much compotition the prices have droped to redicules lvles. not to say thay never would have made it there, but part of getting new gear was finding a person willing to part with it. Now we can all just walk in to a Wallyworld lookalike and pick up anythign we realy wanted for cheap ( if you where a very low lvl /newbie ) and every thing since then has gone down hill in the strength of game play that sony has done. No i am not so grizzeled that I forgot what it was like to play on a my first day, I remeber dieing 8 times in about 3 hours since I was learnign that red means about exactly what it said. I still remeber how i felt when i finaly got a full set of banded armor for my self at lvl 20 ( of wich i earned all the plat i paid for it my self ) and how well equiped I felt. I remeber my first boat ride off the mainland to the islands called antonica and how scared I was haveing to swim up to the rear of the boat and kind of stowaway on the hind end and hope nothing came my way couse it would have owned me. I remeber when I was trying to get to overthere and all i knew was you go from this zone to that one and not where or realy how to get there. I zoned in to a few place that immedutly turned back from couse it was dark ( oks I to this DAY do not like warslike or burning woods ). I remeber the first time I went to a EC bazzar ( was isedently the first time I was to EC as well ) and got my self my uber shield of the slayen unicor to use with my pike I had been crafting ( yes I was a warrior on my first charicter ). <br />
<br />
Yes I have a lot of memmories from back then ... and I loved most of them. going to EC was a day trip it FELT like a big deal to me. now it takes 5 minetes or less depending on conection speed. anything that was BIG is becomeing no longer so. That is the only thing I realy hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Zybann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I think that the people who get annoyed over a few words of text placed during zoning need to either a) stop drinking so much coffee, b) put the pipe down, c) psychiatric help is advised d) get a grip.  Its just a few words of text, so what is the big deal.  Everyone at least a half dozen times have entered the wrong zone by accident and at least you ll know ahead of time in case some sort of quick thinking needs to be done.  Kudos on Sony for this feature.<br />
