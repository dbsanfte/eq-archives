<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">FYI<br />
With my buffs I can get my AC over 920 and HPs over 1600.<br />
My Wisdom fluctuates between 160 to 180. Depending on what I have equiped.<br />
<br />
I have farily decent gear, but being lvl 55, I think I can get better. I've gone on raids, but my luck on rolling is.....well not good hehe.<br />
<br />
I'm doing the Shield of Bane Warding Quest (again, sold my last shield), since I can aquire all the pieces solo.<br />
<br />
I usually only have anywhere from 2kpp to 5kpp to spend. Most of that going to spells for lvl 56 (Bane, Regrowth of Dah Khura, etc)<br />
<br />
I'm sporting mostly JBone armor, minus the BP and Legs. <br />
<br />
My Resist Profile is very weak...I know what I need to get, more or less.<br />
<br />
Just looking for decent or even small upgrades to what I have.<br />
The stuff I swap out are in my bags.<br />
<br />
Thnx for the advice and comments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">electrum bs earrings, enshrouded veil, shadel bandit ring, coldain skin gloves, iksar bp/fungi, heiro cloak or cloak of truth, spider fur belt, need to replace hammer with paw of oppola/epic shield at worst, med totem for range slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shadel Bandit ring, Coldain Skin Gloves, Enshrouded Veil, and Heirophant Cloak seem like fairly nice upgrades.<br />
<br />
I already have Epic Shield and Ceremonial Iksar BP :P.<br />
<br />
I don't think I will get a Paw of Opalla, and I'm not sure if Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings are really an upgrade, though I guess they could be. Lets see: I'd lose 2AC, 8 Wis, and 8 Sv Cold in exchange for 70HP and 50 mana.<br />
<br />
I'll go hunt some in Velks, if I happen to get a Spider Fur Belt, then I may switch out my Smiters Girdle.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Can a 55 Shaman solo Shadel Bandits in FG?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no, but you could duo them with a monk/sk</div></div><hr />
