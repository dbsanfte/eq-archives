<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking to start saving up for a good BP/shoes. I have a ton of padding with me and a guildie is going to buy them from me. Plus what I sell to others.<br />
<br />
Now Being a Vah Shir I can't wear fungi if my memory is correct or is it today?<br />
<br />
What is something that I can use in it's place?<br />
<br />
My magelo is out of date, I have problems with the site and can't fix it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks. ATM I am using the foremans tunic and looking to get something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can only wear the patch fungal vest from FG as a vah shir, and only at 51. <br />
<br />
But, Iskar Ceremonial BP is wearable (I wore one for 20 levels) and much cheaper. It is only 5 hp per tick, but it is only about 5k on Rodcet Nife.<br />
<br />
Shoes.<br />
<br />
Shoes are hard.  They are generally very expensive to get good ones. I wore totemic for awhile, then I was lucky to get a mq of thurg from a friend. If you can at all get a thurg mq, do it, they are nice shoes. Otherwise, I hear barbed dragonskin shoes are nice, but they run about 12k on my server. Ouch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ouch, indeed. Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're strapped for cash, the Ry'Gorr chestplate is decent, at 18 AC and nice stats - 'Course if you can get up the 5k, go for the Iksar BP. <br />
<br />
Boots? Boots are easy. Jaundiced Bone. 18 AC for under 400pp average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i'm wearing polished tin boots theyre:<br />
<br />
14 AC +4 Str +5 Sta +3 Wis +30 Mana <br />
<br />
i think id rather have the wis and mana than the extra 4 ac from JB bootses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Could'nt agree more, but if he's 28 and not a twink, the polished booties go for around 1.5-2kpp and the JB goes for 300-400pp.<br />
<br />
Hence I also wear JB. )<br />
<br />
Generally speaking totemic is quite passe, since JB head, arms, feet and hands are all under 500pp each (some much less).<br />
<br />
I feel kinda bad, I took about a year off from EQ (before Bazaar), and all this godly armor 10-20 lvs above me is falling into my hands like cheap rain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh well.<br />
