Granted it's not much of an accomplishment compared to other servers, but we've come along fine I think.  Took us about a thousand attempts at cornaiv, but xegony fell in...hrm something like 13 tries or so and the Rathe fell in 2.  I was pretty impressed with the performance on the Rathe, I was certain we'd be stuck there for a few weeks.  We had a ton of reflagging to do (as most have) that set us back tremendously.<br />
<br />
Most everyone played well, but I've gotta tip my hat to my boys.  Best witchdoctors serverwide... ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine there's less people there, but that also makes getting enough people to take out the late POP stuff quite hard<br />
<br />
also, reading that again, the answer I'm after is simpler than the question looks I think, don't be offended by the i.e of what types of categories I'm lookin for ;)<br />
<br />
also, I seem to have forgotten to say congrats</div></div><hr />

There is a raging 3 raiding organizations on test.  TSF so far has the furthest progression.  We're made up of a pile of guilds and freelance people.  The organization operates basically as a /gu but some of us simply will not share guild tag.  We have about 100 people on the dkp list and field around 70 charactures on a good nite.  <br />
<br />
Behind us is Primal Brood.  They are working on flagging to the elementals and are currently around Bertoxx/Mith Marr or so.  They have cleared VT a few times.<br />
<br />
Slightly behind them is The Alliance, another raiding organization from several guilds.  From what I gather they have done some flagging runs, but not very far.  They have run through VT a few times.<br />
<br />
That's it, there are some small groups of folks that run through some stuff here and there but as far as pop progression of note we have 3.  I think the spacing of the various organizations is an overall bad thing tbh.  We simply do not feel the push and drive to go as far as hard as we can.  There's no rush because the stuff is going to be there when we want it.  Of course...it's nice to know you'll be the only ones in a zone as well, it has good and bad points I guess.</div></div><hr />
