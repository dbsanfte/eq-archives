<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At some point, there should be a better snare than the cheeseball luclin Tangling weeds.<br />
<br />
I don't want to root most mobs, naturally. It's just a bit unsettling that one of my primary desires for groups is a spell that I got at level 9.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a snare with a DoT attached to it, personally. Yeah, we can snare/DoT combo, but why not just combine the two?<br />
<br />
Almost 40 levels after I got snare, it wouldn't be a terrible thing to give us a small upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The trouble with a snare/dot spell is that it will break mez. That is one of the greatest features of that lvl 9 spell ( and its upgrade Ensare at lvl 51).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, but for soloing - unless you have a ranger mez spell that I don't know about, it would be pretty handy. ;)</div></div><hr />
