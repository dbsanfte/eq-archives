<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I have a quick question I thought I'd try asking you before jamming up the petition queue.  Is there anyway to completely reset armor dye?  I'm tired of my current scheme and want to go back to the color of the armor I'm wearing, but as far as I can tell, I'll have to dye it the corrosponding rbg value, which seems kind of silly.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

If memory serves there is a solvent you can use to return it to it's old color, but I may be confusing that with the solvent used to clear a LDON Aug.<br />
<br />
At any rate it's only 30ish plat, is money tight or are you just not sure of the rbg value of the original armor.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing in LDoN that concerns armor dyes.<br />
<br />
Here is what you do:  Set every slot's color to 255,255,255.  That returns it to its original color.  Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the advice, but that just seems to remove any tint whatsoever from a given slot.  (That's actually my current set up, I'm a big silver troll)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Gave it another shot, and it worked.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
