<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.  It's been a while since I've been around here.  Partly because I wasn't EQing as much, and partly because at the time the Crucible had de-evolved into a poor, pathetic shell of what it had used to be (thanks to many callous and flaming members).<br />
<br />
But, I've been thinking about coming back to EQ.  And as always I stopped in on what I knew once was the greatest shaman board.  And, from what I have seen so far, it looks like the Crucible is finally changing back to what it used to be....  before the dark times.  I commend every shaman here for acting civil (maybe there's more flaming posts I just haven't seen yet!).   <br />
<br />
First, I musty commend any high-level shaman who helps younger shaman who have questions.  During the pathetic Crucible days, if you weren't &quot;uber&quot; you weren't worth talking to.  Strike that, you WERE worth talking to, but only to be insulted and laughed off the boards.<br />
<br />
This is much more like the Crucible I used to know.  Keep it up!<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I do have some questions.   And yes, I have read all the patch updates I've missed.  But they can't truly give me the skinny on this class like you guys can.  Oh, and to give you a time-frame reference, I cancelled EQ very shortly after the time Planes of Power came out (played around with free ports, and that's about it).<br />
<br />
1. Is alchemy finally worth something?  I hear they've gotten rid of most negative stats on potions.  This is good.  They also hinted that &quot;grandmasters&quot; get a bonus of some sort.  ??  But are herbs cheaper?   Any new potions?<br />
<br />
2.  What the heck is this about &quot;Fallen Grobb?&quot;  Did the Battletoads take it over or something?  If so, where are the trolls now?  Please don't say Oggok!  :D<br />
<br />
3.  Did they EVER fix the Rallos Zek necklace quest?  The only somewhat working quest I remember were the ones for trolls and their snare necklace (and the other one).  You could start the quest for Ogres (and Barbs if I remember right) but they never added anything more to it.   Has that changed, or is it still deemed not worthy of VI's time?<br />
<br />
4.  Does bearform still use the old-world crappy bear models?  Ok, they're not crappy, but they could be so much cooler.   <br />
<br />
5.  Do our pets still disappear when you're more than 5 feet from them in Luclin and are they still hard to see everywhere else?<br />
<br />
6.  Are disease spells still relatively worthless?  <br />
<br />
7.  Is Spirit of Cheetah still nerfed (recast time used to reset every time you zoned... sigh I miss that)?  <br />
<br />
8.  I seem to recall that monsters are now back to taking full damage from a DoT even if they are running towards you, am I remembering right?<br />
<br />
9.  Anything cool/new happened to the class/game that you think I'd like to know in my year of absence?  I believe I was level 50/51.  Taken me 3 years to get there too.  Heh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good to see some old faces and new ones too.<br />
<br />
Bash good!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The trolls are now in Neriak.<br />
<br />

<br />
The person who created the deity neck quest has left the company and according to the Fan Fair I attended, they have no plan to implement any additional steps for these quests.<br />
<br />
3. Does bearform still use the old-world crappy bear models? Ok, they're not crappy, but they could be so much cooler.   <br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
4. Do our pets still disappear when you're more than 5 feet from them in Luclin and are they still hard to see everywhere else? <br />
<br />
I haven't noticed this.  Were you around when they introduced the level 44 Summon Companion spell?  Very handy to be able to bring your pet back to your side (as long as they aren't on a mob's hate list).<br />
<br />
5. Are disease spells still relatively worthless?  <br />
<br />
You mean disease dots?  They are still pretty useless in a fast killing exp group.  I enjoy them while soloing, especially the new high level disease dot which does no initial damage and therefore doesn't break root.<br />
<br />
6. Is Spirit of Cheetah still nerfed (recast time used to reset every time you zoned... sigh I miss that)?  <br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
7. I seem to recall that monsters are now back to taking full damage from a DoT even if they are running towards you, am I remembering right? <br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hmmmm, I'm enjoying the game much more lately.  I am a huge fan of the map functionality and the POP stones for quick travel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for answering my questions.  I just read on the patch thread that someone missed having mage weapons for his dog in his bank.  Am I to assume that the &quot;Code/Project Alpha&quot; bug is still in effect?  And if so, does VI know about it and have said they don't plan on fixing it?  :D  It was a glorious thing when we found out about it, I remember that much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they know that dogs can dual wield. it is still called project alpha, and yes, it's still neat. esp when your level 61 pet can use mage proc swords...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our 61 pet is also level 58 which lets him actually tank in a lot of situations. It's a huge upgrade from our last pet (at level 55) which is only level 40 or so.<br />
<br />
If you're coming back you may want to get LoY so you can work on the quest for Stoicism. Stoicism is a mini Torpor and needless to say extremely Valuable from levels 44-59. And even nice to have if you want to skip Torpor and go straight for Quiessence at 65 which is Torpor without the side effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bash good!<br />
<br />
Alchemy is still very expensive, but a lot of new potions have been added.<br />
<br />
When Legacy of Yekesha came out, the frogs became a playable race, so the GMs staged these events where frogs invaded Grobb and took over.  Driving the trolls to Neriak, and renaming Grobb to Gukta.<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed any pets dissappearing in Luclin and I spent a lot of time leveling there.<br />
<br />
Our DOTs work fully even if the mobs are moving.<br />
<br />
The cool new thing is Lost Dungeons of Norrath (the newest expansion).  I love it, and I really haven't seen anyone that hates it.  You always get one or two naysayers at least, but for the most part it has been VERY well received.<br />
<br />
Also, the group experience change is very cool.  Gives each person more xps in groups than before.  And you only need 5 people in the group to get the full benefit.  I would still bring six because of the added killing power.<br />
<br />
edit:  Forgot about the niceness of shared bank slots, the LoY cartography system, and LFG tool.  Probably forgot others, but someone else will probably tell you about them.</div></div><hr />

What he meant by that is, the patch today took away the ability to not have no rent items disappear by storing them a certain way in your bank slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is alchemy finally worth something? I hear they've gotten rid of most negative stats on potions. This is good. They also hinted that &quot;grandmasters&quot; get a bonus of some sort. ??  <br />
Potions still pretty much worthless. They added in a &quot;quest&quot; like the other tradeskills where you can create a Grandmasters Medicine Pouch, which basically lets you get a free weight reduction bag and +alchemy skills mod. Nice little perk if you spend the time to max out alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What he meant by that is, the patch today took away the ability to not have no rent items disappear by storing them a certain way in your bank slots.<br />
<br />
Yeah I got that.  But since he mentioned &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;no rent weapons&quot; I went on to assume that Project Alpha was still around.  It was very much new and feared being nerfed when I was still playing.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Mini Torpor?!?!  God!   We friggin' begged for this.  VI:  &quot;It will be a cold day in hell where we also willingly and slowly castrate ourselves with a Q-tip before we EVER give you guys a mini-torpor!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this stoicism a spell you can easily get, or is it another PITA one that you never see until you're a level that really doesn't need it (or are willing to pay out the yin-yang for)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1. Is alchemy finally worth something? I hear they've gotten rid of most negative stats on potions. This is good. They also hinted that &quot;grandmasters&quot; get a bonus of some sort. ?? But are herbs cheaper? Any new potions?<br />
<br />
I love alchemy.  Removing the negatives to stat potions made them actually useful.  Sadly, my best (and usually only) customers for them are my alts.  Non-shaman perceptions on the uselessness of potions have not changed one iota, in spite of the fact that its no longer correct.<br />
<br />
2. What the heck is this about &quot;Fallen Grobb?&quot; Did the Battletoads take it over or something? If so, where are the trolls now? Please don't say Oggok! <br />
<br />
Yes, frogloks took over Grobb, it's now known as Gukta, even though the PoK stone still reads &quot;Grobb&quot;.  This is the most ridiculous bit of storyline progression I've seen so far.  In protest, I have declared my green hopping cleric to be a Todelok, member of a genetic offshoot of the Froglok race that follows Rallos Zek.  Yes, I have too much free time.<br />
<br />
3. Did they EVER fix the Rallos Zek necklace quest? The only somewhat working quest I remember were the ones for trolls and their snare necklace (and the other one). You could start the quest for Ogres (and Barbs if I remember right) but they never added anything more to it. Has that changed, or is it still deemed not worthy of VI's time?<br />
<br />
No.  In fact the rule seems to be that NOTHING that is not from the latest expansion will EVER get fixed, hihi Ring of Fire, Ssra, etc.<br />
<br />
4. Does bearform still use the old-world crappy bear models? Ok, they're not crappy, but they could be so much cooler. <br />
<br />
Yes.  If you didn't already know this, take off your plate hat to avoid the drooling bear look.  Theres actually 3 different bear models (not counting color differences based on race) that are determined by what 'class' of hat you have one (plate, chain, leather).  I prefer the drooling look myself, but opinions vary.<br />
<br />
5. Do our pets still disappear when you're more than 5 feet from them in Luclin and are they still hard to see everywhere else?<br />
<br />
The poofing pet bug isn't as bad as it used to be.  It seems to have been a clipping type bug, as our pets used to sink slightly into whatever surface they were standing on.  I used ot get this all the time in ME, but haven't for several patches now.  However I dont spend much time in Luclin these days, at least not with a pet, so I could be way off base.<br />
<br />
6. Are disease spells still relatively worthless? <br />
<br />
For grouping purposes they are more useless than ever, as mobs die incredibly fast these days.  They continue to rule for soloing though.<br />
<br />
7. Is Spirit of Cheetah still nerfed (recast time used to reset every time you zoned... sigh I miss that)? <br />
<br />
No idea.  Memmed it exactly once, never saw it refresh, assumed it was broken, deleted it.<br />
<br />
8. I seem to recall that monsters are now back to taking full damage from a DoT even if they are running towards you, am I remembering right?<br />
<br />
Yup, dots now do full damage regardless of the mobs movement or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
9. Anything cool/new happened to the class/game that you think I'd like to know in my year of absence? I believe I was level 50/51. Taken me 3 years to get there too. Heh.<br />
<br />
I finally got a Dathor Great Hammer.  Hitting for 310 is fun, even if it's only once every 5 minutes.  :)  Seriously though, no, no major earthshattering changes in gameplay itself, at least for shamans.  Still the most fun class in the game, IMO.  The ldon dungeon system is kinda neat though, if you're going to start playing again I highly recommend buying it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Welcome back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guide to Stoicism Quest (http://www.interealms.com/shaman/guides/stoicism.html) <br />
<br />
I didn't complete the quest myself since I was level 60 with Torpor, but I did complete Blood of Nadox (the other LOY quest) and it wasn't too bad.  The quest components and the spell itself are no drop (except for the FV server, I guess).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mini Torpor?!?!  God!   We friggin' begged for this.  VI:  &quot;It will be a cold day in hell where we also willingly and slowly castrate ourselves with a Q-tip before we EVER give you guys a mini-torpor!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this stoicism a spell you can easily get, or is it another PITA one that you never see until you're a level that really doesn't need it (or are willing to pay out the yin-yang for)?<br />
<br />
I got stoicism at 43 so it would be ready to be scribed at 44.  Me and a mid 40s level paladin went and killed the drunken pirates.  The empty flask dropped on the second and third pirate.  The second flask actually rotted because the zone was empty.  Flotsam and Jetsam were easy also because I just asked a guy at the lighthouse if he would help me for about two minutes.  I offered to pay 50pp, but he did it for free.  I more than likely could have soloed them, but I didn't want to chance it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Stoc was one the single best additions to the 44-60 level shaman in a long time I feel well worth the purchase of the exspansion.  The added bank slots was nice bonus.  Spell research has now been added as well bring down the price of many of out level 55-60 spells from those stupidly high prices of +60K.  I too aggree if nothing else the LDoN exspansion has been the most fun for long time.  Even better if you have friends you like to group with regularly.  They tend to be fast passed with decent cash loot / Aug drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is this stoicism a spell you can easily get, or is it another PITA one that you never see until you're a level that really doesn't need it (or are willing to pay out the yin-yang for)?<br />
<br />
you can get it at the level appropriate..but definitely a PITA as far as drop rate on the flask... Took me an entire day (~10-12 hours straight..)<br />
Granted, that was months ago heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's been a huge year for EQ, lots and lots of great changes since POP came out this time last year.<br />
<br />
LDON is super - Think of it as your own personal camp spot with no annoying /ooc, no trains, and no camp stealers.  Decent XP and cash loot, possibility of reasonable drops, and Adventure Points to buy additional treasure with as a bonus.<br />
<br />
Some nice new spells available to us now.  There is a real difference between 60 and 65.  The two new DOTs - Blood of Saryrn and Breath of Ultor - have no DD component so they don't break root, and they do a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
DOT damage is now reported to you.  This is a great thing, really nice to see what you have running.<br />
<br />
POP abilities Radiant Cure and Virulent Paralysis are nice.<br />
<br />
They un-nerfed XP in old world zones to the point that it's possible to get a reasonable amount of XP while grinding for gear, helping lower level friends, etc.  I wouldn't go to Seb to grind XP, but if I'm there, I want SOMETHING to show for it, and now you can get it.<br />
<br />
New zones - all the LoY stuff, Veksar, Chardok B, revamps of Siren's Grotto, Veeshan's Peak, Plane of Mischief, and others... a significant amount of new content over and above the large chunk LDoN offers.<br />
<br />
For me, it's a bit hard to distinguish between what's new by getting to level 65 from what's new in the game itself, but you may well be in the same boat.  65 is definately worth it.  I have never felt like I had so many options as I do now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Now there's a name from the past. Which server are you looking at coming back to, Numbuk? If it's the Nameless I'd be happy to help out with the Stoicism quest and anything else you might need to get back on your feet. If it's the server you swapped to (i'm sorry, but I can't recall the name), then I'm afraid I can't help much there.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power and Lost Dungeons of Norrath pretty much trivialised levelling, which is both a boon and a curse. It's much easier to catch up (I was gone for eighteen months myself), but some of the people you'll meet at 65 with tons of AAs may not be particularly good at playing your class. Trusting players in pickup groups to do their jobs is more perilous than ever.<br />
<br />
The answers in the thred are all right on. Regardless of which server you come back to, it's good to see you around!</div></div><hr />
