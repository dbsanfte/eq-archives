<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have two accounts, loaded in separate directories on my HD, and although I upgraded both of them to Ykesha when it came out, I remember it being a hassle and having to get Sony to clear a flag or something before I could upgrade the second account.  From what I remember, once I loaded the expansion, whenever I tried to download or install it in the second directory it would tell me it was already installed.<br />
<br />
Last night, after installing LDoN off of the CD (yes, I like having the disc) into the first directory, the install program would not let me designate the second directory as the install destination.  It would note that the expansion was already installed in the first directory and not let me install in any other.  <br />
<br />
Granted, I realize I need another copy/key in order to register and actually play the expansion on my second account.  However, I fear that even another copy will detect the first and not give me the option to load in a different directory.<br />
<br />
My question, has anyone loaded on two different accounts and directories and how did you do it?  Thanks in advance, I'm sure you will save me many hours of frustration.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grubnuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EverQuest uses .ini files instead of the registry for it's settings.  You should be able to simply copy the contents of your first EQ directory to the alternate location and run with no problems.<br />
<br />
That's how I backed up my EQ data when I had to reinstall my OS.  Copied it to another PC via the network, installed the OS, and just copied it back once I was done.  Works flawlessly...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just out of curiosity, why do you install 2 copies of EQ?  I have 3 accounts and run them all from one copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are running multiple simultaneous instances of EQ on one machine, it runs much better if each instance is running from a seperate directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried that for that reason, Difference is unnoticeable (at least on my machine) the slow-down is from sony's implementation of the windowed mode. If you really want to see an improvement that validates this, use eqwindows. THAT is an improvement.<br />
<br />
Putting the files in different directories only really helps when EQ does WRITING to the files, reading doesnt matter much. When writing, the files are locked so that no other writing can take place at the exact same time (that would be bad), however 2 programs can read the same file (DLL files are used by many programs at once) the OS queues the reads and will deliver the requested data as fast as the hard-drive can spit it out. So when reading data, you are limited by hard drive speed, regardless of whether the files are the same or 2 different files in different places the hard drive can only read one at a time period (because obviously the read head on the drive can only be in one place at any one time).<br />
<br />
The faster your hard-drive RPM's are the faster it can handle data output, and that is your limit.. Placing files in different directories still limits you to your hard-drive output. With the only exeption being file WRITES which must be locked and then unlocked before another write can occur. EQ does very little writing.<br />
<br />
If you want better performance, save your hard drive space, have only one eq directory therefore removing the problem this thread is about, and install eqwindows which uses built in OS-Hooks to control window mode rather than software controlled method that Sony uses.<br />
<br />
Hope this wasnt too confusing...<br />
