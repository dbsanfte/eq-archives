So I was wondering if anything _really_ useful for rangers has been discovered yet?<br />
<br />
I noticed that we can wear certain parts of Brellium, but is there anything we really might want to consider purchasing/smithing? It's not like im going to powderize my BD's just for a 12ac bracer...<br />
<br />
Maybe we could make one single sticky with all recipes sorted in it?</div></div><hr />
