<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doranur_Aleguzzler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">after years of lurking. I never bothered posting before, because anything I had to say seemed to have already been said by the time I finished reading a thread. To me, posting a, &quot;Yeah you're right!&quot; post is pointless. Still, this has been a great source of information to me since I found it almost three years ago.<br />
<br />
I know most members of this forum look at the EQLive forums with disdain or outright hatred, but if somebody does start playing the game, that is likely the first site they will find. I have yet to have a thread locked or deleted, let alone get a warning from moderators, and I by no means give lip service to SOE. <br />
<br />
As far as my views on the class as a whole, yes there are lots of big things that need to be fixed. FA didn't make my Top 5, but did make my top 10. The person or persons that suggested MGB Shrink be added to the initial list should be drawn and quartered to a purple state, then Q'd back to full health so we can do it again. Watch that be the one thing the devs give us. My biggest beef is the perception that shaman are mostly impotent which directly affects my grouping, or lack thereof. Not to mention the fact that PoP made having shaman mandatory, so every guild PL'd several up as pocket bots which dlitued the grouping market for us full timers.<br />
<br />
Enough ranting for me today. Sudedor/Banditman, don't quit. You're doing as good a job as any of us could given the limitations SOE handed you. Samanna, just wanted to say hi, and glad to see you're having fun on MM, too bad you aren't still on Terris. <br />

<br />
If you do well in groups, people will get to know you, and look for you. I was logged in but not lfg last night, and I got like four group invite tells while running to the raid. It's up to you to convince the people that are on when you are that you are indeed an asset to their group. It's not easy at first, but it does get easier and better as more and more people go from 'shaman suck' to 'that shaman is good' to 'don't we want a shaman?' paradigms.<br />
<br />
Say hi to Judana, Yesak, Ctomkii, Lobato, and any of the other old UP crew you see for me. If you raid, see if Mythica has any openings. I hear they're doing very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The reason people ask for an MGB shrink is for raiding. In my guild, shrinking on a raid is mandatory. Since we might hit three or more targets on a raid night, that means non shrinking classes go through ant poitions or tinkered shrinking devices very quickly. So saying, most shammies would rather MGB a Fo7 or a Sta buff than a shrink and, compared to lots of other things in the list, it is not that important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is not that important but it is very annoying not to be able to MGB shrink or shrink other groups. They should just add a confirmation box for shrinking others out of group like TL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, there are quite a few issues that are plain !&quot;#¤%ing circus on that list. Groupable MGB and alchemy price is NOTHING to our usefulness in fast damage  / fast heal groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I must be forgetting something.  I can't think of any reasons why shaman were mandatory for any pop raids that I've been on.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, I'd like mgb shrink or a yes/no box for raiding for sure, but I agree, I'm not sure I'd rank it in the top 10.</div></div><hr />

Dont think he was referring to raids.<br />
<br />
Shaman werent mandatory in group content in PoP but were highly sort after.<br />

<br />
Yup! and each and everyone of the raid should have the means to shrink themselves why should it be the shaman's responsibility to blow an MGB on shrink! So what if you need max shrink do you get 3 shamans to blow their MGB just because some lazy melle could'nt find the time to buy some shrink pots in advance, or buy a clicky shrink contraption? This would not enhance our class, just make us a poor excuse to have on a raid so we can shrink everyone! pfft!<br />
<br />
The first thing I do when I zone into a raid area is shrink my group or re-shrink the dead members of my group when rezzed....  that's it! that's my responsibility over, Ive got enough to do, and not enough spell slots to do it! let people be responsible for shrinking themselves or receive a TL if you don't comply works for us :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi Doranur, you should post more often - it's good fun usually.  Anyway I couldn't agree more with you that people's perception is a large ingredient in being able to achieve experience groups.  And yes, I think that Shaman moaning about this and that has hurt the class especially in getting groups in GoD content.  But the catch22 is that if Shaman didn't moan then the lame developers would not no how dissatisfied many of us are.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I for one like my Shaman and I think that I contribute nicely in most every EQ situation.  Now that being said and trying to be as objective as possible I think that we do need to be re-tuned a bit to be competitive for the higher level content experience groups and to be valuable additions to raiding situations.<br />
<br />
Let's just hope Sony isn't yanking our chain about the &quot;retuning of the classes&quot; from the input on the various class boards.<br />
<br />
Anyway I think I am a bit different than some Shaman that post here since I don't think we are completely broken.  I would prefer that the irritating and illogical items like FA duration, group haste %, malos refresh, dd casting time, puppy duel wield, etc. be fixed before even #1 and #2 on our top 10.  Fun gameplay is important to me as much or more than raw power.<br />

Heh make your minds up you lot i keep reading how shamans on raids feel like spare wheels etc nothing to do etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No need to make it MGB, simply make it like Translocate.  You can target anyone or any group and they get a confirmation box.  So both the single target anf group version would be much more useful.<br />
<br />
It allows us to shrink our raids, and still mass buff focus and other useful buffs.<br />
<br />
That would be the win/win solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Doranur_Aleguzzler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I logged onto my shaman to do something or other, and got a tell asking to do an LDoN. Of course I jumped on it, and headed to EC. Along the way I asked what role I would play, healer AND slower, back-up healer and slower, or just slower. I was a bit disappointed when I was told only slower. Luckily for myself and the group, I was only slowing. The monk was a zerg puller, which is normally no problem except for the uncanny number of resists even after malos. I fumbled my way through, feeling badly for having given in to altitis for so long.<br />
<br />
The group was a one-shot thing, but I noticed another group looking for more, and asked if I could join. Joined the group, buffed us, and we started. Few resists even without malos this time around, had several single adds from proximity aggro from nearby rooms, which I announced I was offtanking once all were slowed. Did well, did ghetto CC, took over heals when the cleric was LOM after a big pull, meleed as well as landed a few fast DoT's. Felt good to be back on my game, and even better to be able to adjust quickly from playing a gnecro to a wizard to a warrior to a beastlord and back to shaman within only hours of each other during my days off. <br />
<br />
It's almost 8AM (and bedtime for me) so I'll hit the rack in a few, and wake up to try my hand at some soloing with my shaman, something I haven't done in awhile. For today, my philosophy will be to just do what I want to do regardless of bugs/brokenness/lack of TLC from Devs and let the game evolve around me, even if that means I never finish PoP oreven get started on GoD. Odds are, I won't even be able to participate in OoW, so I won't even buy it unless that changes. <br />
