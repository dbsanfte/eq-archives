<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Murgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i haven't done much in those zones, but when i was Dulak going for the water flask for stoicism, i found a real nice spot to pull singles to.  if you go in from gunthak, invis yourself and run along the right wall.  you'll see houses on your left, just stay on the wall.  around the third house or so, you'll see something that looks like a brew barrel against the wall, though it's not really a brew barrel.  i never had any problems with sitting down to med.  no agro or anything.  unfortunately i couldn't find a way to pull and not get about 5 mobs on me.  so invis yourself, run out and check the street first, those were the only adds i ever got.  they should be dark blue to you, they were to me at 50 or 51 (can't remember) and noticeably stronger than the guys in the houses.  if nothing is walking in the streets, open a door, target a guy, go back to the spot, cast slow, and wait.  i didn't have any problems tanking them, just throw on plague and envenomed bolt and they should go down pretty quick.  think i got one add once, but that was because i was too close to a house.  i'm not sure what level these guys in the houses would be to you, so if they're light blue or green, forget anything i said   :)   otherwise, real easy spot to solo at, even though you can't use a pet for the way i pull.  i'm sure someone else has more experience in these zones, just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dulak is a fun zone for the high 40's, low 50's. I am not sure why you don't want the boats. At 52 you can easily solo the lowest boat (Stormwave) and the second one (Dirulia). In both boats invis up at the zone line and run to the ramp for the boat. There is a safe spot once you are on the boat to summon pet and buff up. You run up the ramp onto the boat and then up the ramp to the raised platform at the back of the boat. At the point where the slope up meets the level part stop and stay as close to the edge of the boat as you can. You can sit here all day without agro.<br />
<br />
Summon pet, chuck some weaps at it and start killing. I usually send pet in and let him get some agro, then slow, then ebolt. jbb, jbb, jbb, jbb, loot. If I get agro I just take the hits and melee. You will have plenty of time to heal as pet crunches the next mob. You should be able to single agro/pull every mob on these boats. I have never had an add in many sessions. I am also a 52 shaman and I can sweep Durilia in about the same time it takes for them to start re-popping. This is a constant xp stream, add in the gem drops and pp and I take in around 500-800pp per kei (lol).<br />
<br />
I might be getting confused about the mines, but are they the tunnels that are accessed through the hidden entrance? If they are then they are not too tough to hunt in either. If you plan on soloing them I would start from outside. As you enter the courtyard from the zone line stop halfway along the wall to the left and summon pet, buff, etc. You might get a wanderer but at 52 it will be light  blue and just annoying. Clear the way into the mines and you can just progress along. When you get to the bridge if you take a right and clear the 2 mobs at the entrance you can camp the mob that spawns half way down that tunnel on the left. It is the placeholder for the soulstealer that drops the soulstripper. He can be tough when he pops but I have been able to solo him at level 52 with no kei and self buffed only. Just be careful.<br />
<br />
This is a great zone to hunt in, I have spoken to folks that are still getting great xp on the harder boats in the high 50's.<br />
<br />
If this post is inaccurate be gentle.... this is my first post on these boards.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As Karshak said, the first two boats will be cake for you at 52. I would start on Stormwave (first boat you find when you go right from zone in) and camp it until the Captain spawns and you get the charm he drops. It is the perfect caster charm as it's stats go up as your casting skills increase. In three KEI sessions on Stormwave, I made just under 3k pp and then go the captain to spawn as well.<br />
<br />
Dirulia would be your next boat and it isn't very hard either. I checked out the third boat, and though the mobs may not be a lot tougher, they are packed in a bit more so adds might become a problem. Can't say for sure cuz I only scoped it out while invis.<br />
<br />
Another good spot for just straight xp is the Armory. I'm not sure if any named spawn here but the xp flows steadily at 52 (about 2% for every three kills) and the usual gems, jewelry, and weaps drop. The Zraxthil Forged weaps are great for selling and for pets. They actually have some stats on them. The best spot I found for the armory is at the very back. If you go straight out from zone in you will see large wooden walls on your left. The armory is the first or second section you come to. You will see two guards at the entrance and they are named Armory Guards, so it isn't hard to find. This si the area where you go to Torgiran's Mines as well. When you enter the armory, you will see a wooden ladder on your right. The mines are are up that ladder and along the platform to the left.<br />
<br />
Anyway, once in the armory, go straight back to the far wall, slightly right of center. Do not camp all the way in the right corner because when you drop invis, the architects on the other side of the right wall will aggro you through the wall. Stay just right of center near (if I remember correctly) what looks like mining carts. You should see what looks like a machine to your left as you face the back wall with a troll and iksar mob on either side of it. This is yor camp and at 52 you should be able to single pull about 8 or 9 mobs before respawns.<br />
<br />
I usually tag with slow and immediately send out pet. He almost always gets aggro before the mob has reached me at camp, then I just cripple and JBB them to death. They do run below 20% health, so have a root spell up in case dogdog can't take them down fast.<br />
<br />
There are a couple other good spots, but at 52, I found the xp dropped off a bit and it took 3 kills to get 1% at times, so I won't even mention them. At 52 though, you should definitely be on at least the second boat (Dirulia), but get the charm from Stormwave first. It is too easy to pass up. The xp won't be as good on Stormwave at 52, but the charm and the loot will more than make up for the time invested. You should still see about 2% per three kills though, maybe a bit less. And you should certainly make 500-800pp per KEI session in any of the spots mentioned here.<br />
<br />
I know this is a bit of a ramble, but I'm in a rush. I fyou need more info, post here and I'll tell you more when I have time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would think that Torg Mines and Nadox would be difficult at 52, just because the mobs have so many freakin hitpoints! :-)<br />
<br />
In dulak....  Boats are generally higher hp and higher damage output than the average mob that I've fought when not on the boats.  You will probably kill slower on the boats, but won't have to worry about adds and have a chance at better loot.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to camp a boat,  if you follow right wall to the very first dock (has boat scrubbers on it but no boat attached to it) , that corner by the dock is another safe spot.   If you pull from buildings or along the walkways, etc...  and pull them back to wall you shouldn't get adds.  You don't want them to run far though as there are some fairly hard hitting mobs that wander down those passages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The captain on the stormwave also drops some nice leggings which I have garnered twice now, sold both for over 1K in the bazaar. I have yet to see the charm so I might go back and camp it until I hit the armory. Thanks for the tips.<br />
Karshak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jorlaan,<br />
<br />
Though most mobs in LoY zones tend to be huge undercons based on how hard they hit and HP, they aren't particularly tough for us shamans. In the armory for instance, I can pull with slow, send dogdog in (fully buffed with HoS, Agility, Stamina, Guardian, Regrowth, and Alacrity), and JBB them about 7 or 8 times to drop them. I buff the dog up since he basically tanks. I can easily handle two mobs if I get a bad pull as well. With Turgur's and Cripple, these guys drop easy. I can usually take two or thrre back-to-back before I even heal the dog.<br />
<br />
The boats or armory are definitely the place to go. I have found that most of the mobs inside the town buildings are not as productive with the xp as these others are.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, I was a bit nervous when I first ventured onto the boats and especially going into the armory, but once I got my feet wet I realized that with patience on the pulls and a well buffed pet, this zone is very nice.<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
Karshak,<br />
<br />
Too bad about the charm man. I was lucky and got it on my first kill, though I haven't seen the leggings. Good luck!<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
For all, <br />
<br />
When I dinged 53, I decided to venture into Nadox for the first time (outside of killing the elementals from 44-51) and try the regular troll mobs at the main gunthak zone in. They are significantly tougher but yield a solid 1-1.5% xp per kill. There are a couple shammy mobs there so make sure you hit yourself with a full set of resist buffs. With all of my resists over 100, they rarely hit me at all.<br />
<br />
As I said, they are a lot tougher here, but I was able to kill them steadily and almost took out two at once until a third spawned on my head and I had to zone. Irritated me because I had both of the others down to less than 20%.<br />
<br />
Anyway, at 54 I should be solid here, and at 52-53 this would be an awesome spot to duo with a melee class; especially a paladin who can self heal and really hold aggro. You could blast through these guys with no problem.<br />
<br />
Note: I have yet to attempt Torgiran's Mines yet. The zone in from Dulak's is a cave and tunnel area with narrow passages and lots of twists and bends. I would highly recommend going in with someone who is familiar first, or scope it out invis first. Jumping in without knowing the area could prove deadly. Then again, it could be a cake walk....I just don't know yet.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Torg mines has at least one spot with thin walls and wall aggro.   I was there with my pally, pulled what should have been a single, and ended up with mobs coming down a different hallway that joined with mine.  Tried it several times and it happened about 75% of the time.<br />
<br />
If you are soloing though, you might not make it that deep in ;-)<br />
<br />
Only having the 39 pet on my shaman and not having cripple yet on my enchanter, I can't comment on the difference it would make :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was in nadox last night hoping to get the back room from the Luggald castle entrance in Gunthak; but, a group was already there.  So, I remembered a spot from a previous crawl that may be suitable.  From the Nadox &quot;hidden&quot; hallway entrance, move straight accross and through the room, invis.  From here, you can turn right or left (ramp going up).  On you right, there are too mobs at a tunnel entrance.  Leave them be.  Go left and between the first and second intersection is a safe place to set up camp.  You will have ample room to move and can pull the Furious Blackhands at your leisure.  They con DB at 55 and aren't terribly difficult hitting for 127 max I think.  I was only using my buffs other than KEI, which is just less downtime and not necessary.  Nothing exciting, but a nice spot for good or ill, these mobs don't run on low health = no adds but more pounding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&lt;lvl 55 shammy horse no jbb&gt; I too do like dulak, and it didn't take me long to learn that they agro through walls either. That spot behind the drunken pirates is one of my favorate places. I also  like right next the sharks tavern but don't get too close to the tavern or you will agro. The boats are almost always camped, and I have a hard time killing fast enough to make it to the boat before the warf spawns start catching up to me and agro while I'm on the boat. The armory is nice too low for my lvl but I would imagine the lower 50's would be great. That spot Absurdum  described is were I'm at. When I start  the armory I start by the mines.. nice safe place, there I get pet buff up and regain mana. I have yet to get a gem drop there, the iksar blood does seem to drop a bit more frequent there, making it very worthwhile. For gem drops my fav spot as so far is that big hanger looking place right in front of the drunken pirates. Something like ship technicians, engineers or something like that. I've been getting at least 1 gem drop a round and there easy I pull outsiders while I wait.. hope that helps.. hope my writing is too jumbled :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I found a really good spot in Dulak. You camp at the end of the Dandolak dock and Pull the Oceancrashers and the Shadys. The only wandering mob at the camp spot is the little rats and they wont agro. If you're 54 or higher you can single pull the Oceancrasher bloodclaw out of the building next to the dock by agro then single pull the shadys. The Shadys wont agro when you open the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For all of you trying to solo the first 3 boats in your low 50's and find that ya can't get there by killing the dock mobs fast enough heres a tip. On all 3 boats theres a safe spot where you can pull to/med at where you won't get agro from other mobs. On any boat that doesn't have mobs on the stairs to the stern, half way up hugging the wall is safe. I believe this is the case on the Lady Dirulia. On Dandolak take a right when ya enter the ship and park yourself right between the 2 catapult/crossbow looking things right next to the gangplank. Mobs don't agro there. On Stormwave I think its similiar to Dandolak, only been there once for a short time so can't fully recall. Anyways just invis up and go to the safe spot for the boat, ignore the dock mobs as they are generally lower level and lblue anyways. <br />
I haven't been on the oceancraser or windscorn yet so not sure about them. I'm sure they have a safe spot as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well with Oceancrasher (4th Boat) the main problem is getting adds off the dock (not too bad) or getting adds of Windscorn (VERY BAD).  My suggested lvl to be able to do Oceancrasher is about 55ish solo.  Though solo you will not be able to clear the whole boat before respawn.  You will be able to take good chunk of it.  The bonus is Oceancrasher is not camped often.  With the addition of one other pet class you should be golden.  <br />
<br />
Ok now Do Not's of Oceancrasher...<br />
 ...allow them to leaving the boat. (Root/Snare or ---&gt; = Dock Adds)<br />
 ...pull mobs to the ramp of boat.  (Is Favorite on other boats ---&gt; = Dock Adds)<br />
 ...pull mobs to opposit side of boat to fight. ( = Windscron Adds &lt;CH healers&gt;)<br />
 ...go AFK for extended time frames.  ( No one place to sit out agro range. Goto Treasurey Wall for Afk more then 10 mins ) <br />
<br />
Ok now the Do's of Oceancrasher...<br />
 ...set up shop to the right of the ramp to boat up the stairs.  ( No Dock agro from here )<br />
 ...kill the lady on the stairs first on arrival at the base of the stairs.<br />
 ...mobs pretty much clock wise off the Boat.  ( Give them plenty of room to do thier death crawl before they reach the dock ramp. )<br />
 ...one additional friend opens up the safty factor by a hundred percent. (pet classes are trully under rated here. Pets &gt; all)<br />
<br />
I personally started on Oceancrasher at 55 and had no problems.  Though one additional person and it became mostly a cake walk.  Mages were the best then beastlord in usefullness.  Just make sure your fighting up on the upper deck.  The lower deck for some reason on dockside agros the ones on the dock quite easly if your fighting there.  And on off dock side I understand can agro the Windscorn dock residents.  And some those being casters and CH healers which are never fun to play with when your not ready for them.  Up on that upper deck though your a nice distance from the dock so no adds there and your nice distance for Windscorn so no adds from there.  I mainly try to stay on the dock side the ship and pull with slow.  Never had add there unless I was trying to rush in another kill before the respawn ( Appox 12-15min ).  I just have feel though for the respawn have not ever really timed it.  Though they spawn much faster then the lower boats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mootski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My wife &amp; I are doing the boats at the moment.  We've moved along until the Dandolek which is tough but good.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone have info on what boat drops what?  I need lewts!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Stormwave has a captain that pops occasionally, ph is the left hand mob directly across from you as you head up the ramp. Drops oxidized leggings, staff, and charm.<br />
<br />
Dirulia's captains ph is the right hand mob of the three at the front of the boat in a triangular shape as you head up the ramp and turn left to face the front. Drops a sea worn ring, and something else I have never seen.<br />
<br />
Haven't seen any other captains as I have only ventured onto Dandolak for a few cycles.<br />
<br />
All drop gems and assorted pet weapons. I have noticed a sharp reduction in the gem rate lately, not sure if I have been on a run of bad luck however I have heard rumblings from others in the zone to the same effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shirkamon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I began hunting in Dulak at 39 with my shaman/beastlord Duo.  I am now at 55 and have been on every boat except Windscorn.  The boats are fun but very predictable.  The drop items are good from the captains.  Stormwave, The Lady Dirulia, and Dandolak can all be single pulled without adds and have a safe spot on each boat.  The safe spot is is against the rail to the front (fore) side of the dock ramp.  <br />
<br />
At 55, experience is a little slow; however, I can make between 750p and 1500p in about 4 hours playing time on plat loot and vendor loot.  Weopons bring in between 4 and 5 plat and there are gem drops and jewelry drops (amulets, rings, and bracelets).  Gems and jewelry sell between 12 and 238 plat (blue diamonds).  I have the Rust Encrusted pants from the Dandolak Captain.  A Rust Encrusted Bracer from Oceancrasher mobs.  I also have a Seaworn ring from the Dirulia captain.  I have never had one drop, but the Rust Encrusted BP from the Dandolak captain has regen.  Hope to get one eventually.<br />
<br />
An alternate to the boats and armory are the Sharkbar located on the docs between Stormwave and Dirulia.  You can set up outside the bar and single pull to clear the bar.  Once the bar is clear, you can set up near the shark pit trap in the rear.  The named chef drops a couple of nice pieces.<br />
<br />
Another good spot is across from the armory in the courtyard of the interior buildings.  There is another bar where you will see dark-elf assasin's, spawn.  I find this area just as good exp as the Dandolak and just as profitable.  It is rarely camped and with the exception of a guard roamer every now and then, it is relatively safe.  I set up camp directly across from the bar not quite agains the back of the building (just in cast there is aggro through the wall).  There is an ogre on the right side of the building that you should take out first.  <br />
<br />
There are no casters in Dulak, expcept on Windscorn, so slow, root, dot, and dogdog are perfect for the solo player.  Together with a melee tank, either a monk, pally, warrior, or beastie, you can rule Dulak.   Also, invis is your friend.<br />
<br />
As for Torgiran's Mines, I have made it as far as the Bloodguards that drop the Grobb Hide Mask and Cowl.  For the most part, plat loot is lower in TM that in Dulak. Gem drops are about the same, but the equipment drops are much better.  Torgiran's is a straight dungeon crawl.  Everything can be slowed and up to the Bloodguards, there are no casters.  Trains are rare on the prexus server; as my 2 characters are generally the only ones in the zone.  If you want to camp the bloodguard drops, get a melee or pet class companion.  They hit hard and have about 7k in hit points.  <br />
<br />
Good luck in hunting LoY.  I'm off to Nadox.<br />

Is there anything special you need to do to get the Dandolak captain to spawn? I heard you have to clear the entire boat before re-spawn, however at 57 I just don't have the DPS. I usually have 2 left then they start their re-pop.... Also, where does he spawn?<br />
<br />
Note: still no charm from Stormwave. Captain has only popped once in 13 hours of camping. I have pretty much had it with this, which is a shame given the timesink, and the fact that farming Storm takes away a good boat from lower levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, as for Captain Rockbelly, he is completely random.  I have seen people just camp the captain PH, which is on the far side lower level to the right of the mast as you enter the boat.  Personally, I have camped the Dandolak about 30 hours off and on.  I have never found a pattern.  I two box with my Vah Shir beastlord.  I started doing Dandolak at about 52 and at that level could not clear the boat without the first spawn.  The captain would still pop.  As I began to clear the boat more often at 55, the captain would spawn just as often.  <br />
<br />
I have camped Stormwave least of all the boats.  The captain is a rare spawn and I don't remember ever having him spawn while I was soloing.  I was with a group once when he spawned, but no charm.  I agree it is an awful waste of time and takes away from lower levels being able to camp the boat.  Unfortunately, for the both of us, I have never been able to get any good drops off of Stormwave.<br />

Nope, absolutely no truth to that what-so-ever. Cleared the deck last night (mainly to test this theory), and kept it cleared. Even killed the 2 harbor fisherman standing at the foot of the ramp just to be sure. No captain spawned during the 2 hours I was there.<br />
<br />
However...walked away with about 1k in gems/plat/weapon drops, so it wasn't total loss. Plenty of 1hs/piercing weaps for dog dog + cash for peridots for rezbot. So-so exp. 3% each for my Shaman &amp; Druid, 5% for my Warrior, and 6% for my Cleric. Nice spot to get some leisurely experience and coinage with little to no pressure. Relaxing.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I have pretty much given up on Dulak now. Was awesome easy xp and coin but I just can't stand the thought of camping Stormwave again, and I know I would take the boat if it was offered. /sigh.<br />

It's a mindless spot like the boats in Dulak, and a PITA if you dont 2 box a druid or wizzy to succor you across zone. But it's not extremely hard to get to using invis.<br />

I started here at 52 and like it alot better then the boats. You should beable to clear 1/2 of room (at least) before repops. Nadox initaites are a shm caster mobs.. but cast pretty weak spells that I resist often, they also have significant less HP's then bruisers.<br />
I went to 59 here and did all my AA for canni 5.<br />

The one thing I really like about the cathedral is go at your own pace (like the boats) KEI is not really needed here nor is virtue. Altho your kill output increases if ya can manage to get KEI and Pot9.</div></div><hr />
