<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The day Wow comes out, im going to get it and play it all day and night. If i decide its something i can keep playing and leave EQ behind, im going to make a post on the SoE forums and explain why im leaving EQ and explain to them how bad their CR is and how i am leaving cause of how poorly they treated us all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im going to link it here and on my server forum and give it to all my friends so we can make 1 big post just packed with people telling SoE what they did wrong and why we are all leaving and the best part is they will all be in 1 thread which im hoping will over flow with people signing off from EQ for ever.<br />
<br />
They didnt hear us when we asked nicely, they ignored us when we pleaded franticly and laughed at us when we yelled in frustation.<br />
<br />
Well it will be us having the last laugh as we waltz out the door with a smile on our face and a finger in the air, on to greener pastures .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually while WoW is fun to play and the graphics are really cool it is always fun to play somthing new.  Female gnome warriors are kinda cute.  Human healers are really neat and have great solo ability.  Actually every class seems to be able to solo.  Eating food actually increases you rate of HP regen.  The game is simple yet very immersive.  You can bet tho there will be problems and depending on the responsiveness of the GM's/ Cust Service will be what I base my choice on.  If its the same non responsive attitude I will quit all online games and not feel bad about it.  But after having invested a ton of time into EQ I doubt any other game would liekly grab my interest.  Including EQ2.  I like EQ as it is I have fun raiding and just goofing off.  I will prolly not cancel my account tho until enough of my friends do that I have no one to chat with online and we are all using AIM or something lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Blizzard has a long and solid history of good customer service.  Yes they've screwed up in the past, but overall they tend to do what's right.  For instance, at one point it came to light that they were secretly tracking CD Keys or something for Starcraft when people logged on B.Net.  Now this wasn't anything all that big, but because people got upset about Blizzard doing it secretly, the company responded by not checking CD keys at all.  This allowed one person to to make hundreds of pirate copies of Starcraft, give them to all his friends, and everyone could use the same CD key to play on B.Net at the same time.  However, Blizzard chose to allow this rather than piss off their paying customers.<br />
<br />
While everything I've heard about the new WoW game excites me, it's really the old Blizzard history that makes me want to switch.  Blizzard knows how to treat their customers, and I for one expect to be adding a post to Litgruv's thread on the SOE forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bitter? :)<br />
<br />
Just a smidge ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problem isn't really EQ or even SOE. Every game has the same issues, every Sony product has people complaining about their total lack of interest in anything approaching customer service. All of their products have the same problem whether it be Online Games, Computers or even Stereo systems. <br />
<br />
I teach Consumer Behavior at a large university and as part of my class I always ask the students to discuss who is good at customer service, who is bad and how do they differ. Sony always comes out as having crappy customer service. Everyone on every product says the same thing - Sony is only interested in mollifying the customer until he quits bothering them. Sony is NOT interested in actually helping the customer only in their money and in not pissing them off so much they quit giving Sony money. The problem is the whole corporate system not just SOE. They have some awesome products and a lot of really great ideas. Their implementation is usually good - right up to the point that the customer starts to use it.<br />
<br />
There is no real way to reduce this kind of customer apathy without simply not buying Sony products any more.</div></div><hr />

Hence the point of the post to begin with brother. Leave for WoW i would naturaly end my billing, though i have already done this myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh, I knew what you meant, just saying that getting hundreds of people to go post won't do anything... unless they also hit their end billing button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">can you even post on their boards without a payed account?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">These would all be paying people, ending their billing to move to WoW. Thats the idea im expressing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just ran across this on the vanguard forums. It sums it up so perfectly i had to share it here too.<br />

I hate to break it to you, but the reason ALL mmorpgs are compared against Everquest is because Everquest is the single most successful MMORPG to date due in large part to the great folks that created it for which now work on Vanguard. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personaly i cant wait for this game, if this is done right i think it can eclipse even WoW. I cant agree more on how its not that EQ sucks, cause its great till a certain point. Its great till you start getting into the world of SoE creation. Where they are forced to leave the framework that the &quot;ancients&quot; so to speak, made and have to make something new on their own. They dont have the vision for it, the creative ability. Its like taking a wallstreet executive out of a office, handing him a paint brush and asking him to redo the mona lisa. Its just not in his realm. Not to say you cant teach him to paint, but for that, they have to be willing to listen to the people that know how to paint, which SoE is not.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just wish i knew when this game was coming. Thats the bummer is, it looks like its still pretty early and with all the stuff going on in this game, i dont expect to play it for a very very long time. Oh well, thats what WoW is for right ? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's a good thing you're going to put it all in one post, the mods will be able to delete it faster from their board that way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Make sure you post before you end billing.  You can't post on their boards without an active account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You know, posting it on the Sony boards is kind of a waste of c/p time, right? The whole shebang is run my fascist penguins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">fascist penguins<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you are very unfair to the penguin community now by comparing them to SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yea, leave the penguins alone man. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nothing against Penguins.<br />
<br />
Just the fascist ones that SoE employs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'll bet Brenlo and his gang hire extra mods to delete &quot;WoW is great!&quot; posts on release day.<br />
<br />
If it really gets out of hand they'll just shut down the boards.<br />
<br />
Not really work the work to go post anything on SOE's boards unless it follows the &quot;ALL HAIL SOE, SOE IS ALMIGHTY!&quot; format.</div></div><hr />
