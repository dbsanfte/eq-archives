<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Browu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks.  About 8 months I decided to quit playing as my life was quite busy.  At the time, I felt I was finished playing and that in about 6 months or so I might be playing Galaxies, but that isn't going to happen- I don't care for it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I had deleted my Shaman at the time and I am told that the cutoff for backups is 6 months.  Has anyone ever had any luck getting characters restored that had been gone for longer?  It would be nice to play for a few months until something else comes along.<br />
<br />
I really don't want to play anything other than a Shaman, and I'm not interested in starting from scatch.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know some people that had their character restored and they had been gone for over a year. email sony with your request and so to their website and find out who the main gm is foryour server, and send him an email too. shouldnt be too much of a problem. good luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Browu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I tried that and the response I got was that deleted characters are lost after 6 months, but I have heard anecdotal evidence to the contrary.  I'm hoping there is a way to get it done if I talk to the right person.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might be able to get a restor you never know. It's worth a try anyway. If you do though don't delete your characters next time you quit because I bet 9 out of 10 people end up coming back to the game after they quit at least for a little while anyway. Very few people actually quit and dont come back at least once.<br />
<br />
I'm on hmm my 3rd time playing now heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I'd say if they already answered you and said characters were irretreivable after 6 months - you already got your answer. Time to start a new character.<br />
<br />
Those people who come back after a year or whatever, probably didnt delete their character - they just cancelled the account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nah people have gotten restores over 6 months,  The after 6 months thing is just a standard answer. Keep bugging them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They changed the way character data is stored a few months ago. A friend had his character deleted and sony was unable to restore it because it happened the weekend of the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bryan2137</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i deleted my character just after luclin came out and they couldnt restore it. Took me almost 2 months to get back to 65 which sucked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Coming from someone who has been playing since release and STILL isn't level 65, I think I can speak on behalf of others like me....<br />
<br />
MY HEART BLEEDS PEANUT BUTTER FOR JOO!<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost 2 months to get back to 65&quot;?<br />
<br />
WAAAH! :) Life is rough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I quit EQ for 18 months, and when I came back all my characters on all servers were still there.<br />
<br />
I came back about 2 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Valgoth the amount of characters you have could be why your not 65. Besides he probably leveled like crazy and I can see his view point it sucks being low level again. I can't stand playing pre 49 myself now a days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You started another Shaman from scratch?<br />
<br />
It took you only 2 months to get to 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Teddey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just don't tell them how long it has been.  What they don't know can't hurt them ;)</div></div><hr />

No argument with any of your points. However, I still enjoy the pre-50 game more-so than the post 50. I guess the number and level of my characters makes that pretty clear, 'eh? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yep. Just different for some people I can't stand pre 50 myself, too basica and easy overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Keep trying, since a RL friend of mine decided to quit. To enforce this thinking, he deleted his toons (55 warrior, 54 shaman, 35 Monk). He used one of those game cards, so his account was active for 6 months, came back and started an SK. Well, he started missing his other toons, sent in an e-mail to the server GM, and lo an' behold, his shaman was restored. Then he wanted his warrior/monk back, and someone said that was impossible, after being persistant, he got them all. Anything No drop on his toons remain'd, and in some cases, the GM gave him some very nice started equipment. One thing that sucked, the warrior and shaman were restored to level 45. The GM said that they had to go back several months to some old backup tape to find the toons, but they found them.<br />
<br />
GL with that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Aye keep trying.  The 6-month bs is just a way of getting out of having a ton of people try and get their old char's restored.  VI and now SOE has actually never deleted a character, surprising, but true.  Your luck will vary though as it depends really on who happens to answer the email, which is why you should keep trying.<br />
<br />
Also, don't use a sob story.  The CS people don't like reading long emails ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Browu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I sent another email, short and sweet, explaining the situation.  We'll see how it goes.</div></div><hr />
