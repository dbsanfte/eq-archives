<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw the project shaman post that had been bumped but i thought we really need a new thread to put down ideas.<br />
What i would like to see is no that will never be given or we are the best class already nuff said.<br />
The why i see it for most our level we are perfect near enough and need no change there certainly 1 to 50 is fine. 50 to 60 is good too where i see most problem is 61 to 65.<br />
<br />
With the state of the game now grouping based rather that solo play, which is good though you can still solo, i see the need for shaman to become .. well faster..<br />
<br />
We do everything ok but mainly over time that has now disappeared.<br />
<br />
so here are my ideas, i would like good critism or praise if something is unbalance say so and suggest something else . no idea is wrong but helpful idea would be prefered.<br />
i will try do this in order of need. ie what we need at top what would like at bottom.<br />
<br />
SPELLS<br />
faster casting and recast of spells like malo and slow, to make up for this could have higher mana coast ie for turger is 250 mana for new faster slow is 300 mana..this would help with there fears about our mana regen some have mentioned. or slightly shorter duration like 3 mins instead of 6, but NOT 7 ticks. and the same 75% slow.<br />
<br />
faster dd/dots.. i love bane its the way to go. new poison dot similar to this be fine poison can work very fast. new poison dd fast cast time more damage (least same as a cleric normal dd) <br />
<br />
a new shaman only buff with a high attack part, not bother too much about stats (dex str etc) , but hp would help , and with more and more buffs to make our buffs do more in less for more mana?  like dex and str on fos with hp, make stam agil and add to acumen maybe? make the attack hp and regen health one buff? if these cost more mana fine aslong as in line with the spell involved added together.<br />
with this adding foci effects or mellee skill effect like strikethrough.<br />
<br />
a much improve quin, just removeing the slow and root effect from torpor isnt that huge an u/g. the orignal quin should have done 500 /tick, i beleive shaman was orignally the only class to have this then cleric got.. sure;y we can be beter than cleric at the HoT spells? and not be overpowered? the HoT spell will not do the same as the ch 7500 jp heal instant i thinking more like 5k over 6 to 8 ticks maybe? this one prob needs the most imput.<br />
<br />
improved direct heal .<br />
<br />
this are now would like<br />
<br />
a better pet spell at 65 . i dont want a a harder hiting pet (though be nice) or one with more hp.. just more attack so it can hit the higher end stuff or perhaps that just a higher level?. the fact we have to give our pet weapons to dual wield is a draw back enough. i think all others can dual without.. though not sure aout necro.<br />
<br />
a group fa maybe?<br />
<br />
the canni &quot;upgrade&quot;  posiblebly if they did say 450 hp 225 mana recast time 18 sec?<br />
<br />
aa ablilities <br />
<br />
ones there are already there and good?<br />
critical affliction<br />
second forte<br />
<br />
ones that show promise?<br />
call of ancients but depends on exactly how works and usefull ness?<br />
<br />
rabid companion, anceint fury and wolf pack? here because they could be very handy if pet is u/g enough.<br />
<br />
packrat, persistant casting ans the innate stuff  jst the useall ok stuff that can help alittle possible.<br />
<br />
what esle would i like?<br />
 <br />
i know rabid bear is frown at, but it is a class aa and it use a spot .<br />
this need improvement or a complete different aa with good use, they count this as a major class aa and it usuless ass it is and took up a pop aa spot with hasten rabid bear. thats 2 aa that arnt use that could have been improve or somin better replaced it!<br />
<br />
divine avatar.. here cos when i look at lucy it said remove shaman not cleric? is not going to be  a shaman aa?   but  you need it to last aslong as fa and refreshable, or atleast refresh the same time it wears off or you just gonna be using fa all the time and this becomes a pretty useless aa.<br />
<br />
if they didnt want to give us a new pet as a spell, they could give us and aa that increase the effective ness of true spirit, and wolf pack.<br />
<br />
anyhow there just a few ideas , add your own as i sure i missed ideas, please we want constructive ideas! once done we should then get all the best and put then as one thread.<br />
<br />
edit i adding things as poeple suggest or i see. so might have to reread post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my world Enchanters Slow faster than I can(I got a TA and the Enchanters got a Serpent). The basic idea behind the new Slow is a good one. <br />
To fix the issues, the cast time needs to be lowered to 1.0 second flat and the resist mod needs to be upped to -75.<br />
<br />
Canni needs to either become an AA(of the current version on test), a Canni over Time(Stygiana's version) or an upgrade to Canni V(cut the refresh by 50%, whatever AA's you need to get for)<br />
<br />
DoTs are outdated. If you want to fix (Shaman)DoTs, they need a resist mod and work like Splurt/Curse of the Spirits(Epic) with the difference that they should start with the highest tick and end with the lowest.<br />
<br />
If Sony does that, the Shaman class is back in the game. To achieve true balance, there should be either an upgrade to Tnarg's(1650ish, don't even try to add 10% to it, ****ers!) or a substantial Q upgrade(at least 500/tick, 600 if the heal upgrades for the other classes go live).<br />
<br />
There you go. Don't ask why(Sony), just ****ing do it and pretend you came up with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What we need is an substantial upgrade to either our offensive or healing capabilities. This means either a MUCH better nuke than we got atm or a substantial upgrade to tnargs.<br />
<br />
The cannibalize, dot and slow spell is pretty much worthless in it's current incarnation and I would almost never use any of them unless I solo, which I almost never does anymore.<br />
<br />
The aa's that are on test atm is a joke too, like half of them are affecting our pet and dots which are completely ****ing worthless in raid situations. It doesn't matter how nice you present a bag of $hit, it's still gonna be a bag of $hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do not believe that shamans should have a major revamp on nukes. Nukes are in our spellbooks since all priests got them. But our damage over time spells should be definetely reconsidered and upgraded. The damage output from them is way too slow and resists too much, plus causing incredible high aggro on mobs.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking about this this morning.  At the moment at the Time level, once an enchanter gets their Serpent of Vindication our primary advantage over an enchanter in groups is tossed out the window.<br />
<br />
For those that don't know the Serpent is a 3.0 second right click Forlorn Deeds, enchanter's best slow at 70%.  To top that off they have tash (which now isn't the death sentence it used to be) which is much quicker to cast than Malo/Malosinia.  So in the end an enchanter can get slow in quicker than a Time's Antithesis equipped shaman if you include the debuff.<br />
<br />
Forlorn deeds is normally a 6.0 second cast.  Which with focus usually goes down to the 4 to 5 second range.  With the right click though, as we TA equipped shaman know the game basically changes.  And I think it changes way better for enchanters than for us shaman.<br />
<br />
What does an enchanter bring to the table that a shaman doesn't have?<br />
<br />
Charm<br />
Mes<br />
Self-rune<br />
Mem blur<br />
Pacify<br />
Stun<br />
AE Stun<br />
VoQ (Which in a full group with four manausers passivly brings as much mana than what a single shaman can get from Cannibilize nonstop)<br />
<br />
What does a shaman have that an enchanter doesn't?<br />
Heals<br />
Superior dots<br />
Rains<br />
Cannibilize<br />
Focus<br />
Stamina/Dex/Agility/Strength<br />
<br />
Assuming there is already a healer in the group, I know all things being equal and my last group slot is between an enchanter and shaman I know which class I'm taking at the highest end of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>faulcker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Something I've always thought would be a huge benefit would be a shaman only unresistable slow.  It should either be an AA with a high recast time, or a difficult to get spell that is no drop.  The slow would only be 25% or something similar to maintain balance.  This would help tremendously on the big time mobs that are immune or nearly impossible to slow.  The idea would be that this spell would be difficult to get so that not every shaman would have it, making it very valuable and desireable.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this has been brought up before, so please don't burn me too hard, I cannot read the whole site.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />
