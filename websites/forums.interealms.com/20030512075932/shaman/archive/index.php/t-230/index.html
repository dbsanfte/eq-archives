<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zerric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had no problem getting into the crypt in Seb with a 60 monk, but the 2 Imperial Crypt Guardians had us baffled.  They Complete Heal each other and seem to be linked.  We came back later with a bard who could mez and it was easy as pie.  <br />
<br />
Is there a way to feign pull these or otherwise split them?  Or a way for a druid, monk, and shammy to keep them from CH?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/eye<br />
<br />
what's Zerric the monk doing posting on shaman's crucible eh?<br />
You'll never get my l33t strats for the crypt!!  :p <br />
<br />
heh, I hope this is the Zerric I know.  <br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Theirs also a Zerric the Shadowknight on my server.<br />

If I were a monkey I'd be asking on the monkey boards.  But then I'd get 500 msgs about dumb stuff like feign and mend....<br />
<br />
I got in with group help, must've killed about 13 PHs.  Wondering if it would just be better to buy a JBB, but I like getting my own stuff.  Is the JBB rare drop on Arch Duke or common?  Post here said rare but eqmaps.com sez common...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Darn, not the Zerric I know.  :(<br />
<br />
JBB definately seems to be the rare drop to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You don't need to kill the guardians. They don't see invis. Invis from one named room to the other. Fight each named inside its room.<br />
<br />
Just beware of the frog that wanders into the crypt... he does see invis and his HT will break your invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Linora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've gone down to crypt with a small group before and if you really want to kill them this is what we did.<br />
<br />
Puller rushes right pulls golem to stairs out of ch range.<br />
Shaman runs left occupies other golem up where he pops untill the group has finished.<br />
<br />
Be careful though last time the froglok mage agro'd me while I was keeping the golem busy and I was torporing for my life yelling at the group to hurry up :)<br />
<br />
If your shaman doesn't have torpor just have him entertain the golem by rootting it and stay with it incase root breaks.  Don't damage him though or he will start to summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Re: JBB.  Rare spawn, rare drop, rare as hell.  My advise for getting a JBB is to save up 30k, put it in the bank and forget you have it.  Do not spend this cash on _anything_ until you get your bracer. When one comes up for sale, you want to be able to buy it instantly.  If you get it to drop, then cool, you have a pile of cash to spend on something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've split them many times, as a 50's monk... here's how I do it...<br />
<br />
1) Clear out the 3 spawn room at the top of the stairs when you enter the crypt (where the new fallen monk spawns)<br />
<br />
Clear the wanderer (PH for caretaker)<br />
<br />
Monk pulls... trick here, is having a good tagger...<br />
<br />
Monk runs down, waits for ONE of the ICG's to start casting, and runs up the stairs... as soon as that spell hits, monk fd's, tagger tags the ICG that followed the monk... badda bing, they are split.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Hope this is something that might help ya out a bit...</div></div><hr />
