<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daerik Arrowthorn</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had been saving to get  Tox Axe for a while, but came across a good deal on Curved Claws (from Plane of Nightmare) and ended up going with these instead. Only Problem is I get no inventory icon for the claws at all. They show up on my character just fine, but no icon in the inventory at all. I don't have PoP yet and I'm guessing this may be the cause, but wasn't sure why that would affect the inventory icon alone. Not a huge problem, but it's a little scary when looting and the only way I can see the weapon is by hovering the mouse pointer over an empty space. <br />
Makes me nervous :p<br />
<br />
Is the lack of the icon, as i suspect,  just because I don't have PoP installed? <br />
<br />
Edit: Figured this was the reason. Does anyone know what file controls the icons? Thinking perhaps deleting that file and repatching it could help. ...guess I should just get PoP already :p <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
They do have a distinctive inventory graphic</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have PoP. And some items have no icon for me. Wand of the War Wizard as an example. It's very annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chromite</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update your UI.  If your UI doesn't have the added PoP icons it'll show up as a pearl necklace.  If you're not using the new UI then you won't be able to see them because the old UI doesn't have the icons for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try deleteing your Texture cache files.   They end in *.TXC.  <br />
<br />
Or you can turn off Texture caching, run EQ, then turn it back on again.  That might solve the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raenewae</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What worked for me was this:<br />
<br />
Delete all of the dragitem**.tga files,  and repatch.<br />
<br />
After I did that, Items like the Weighty Polearm had thier proper inventory icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daerik Arrowthorn</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem solved. It was the dragitem.tga files like Raenewae said. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice all :)</div></div><hr />
