<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not posting this to start an argument at all, just thought that it was really funny in a sense.  Anyways, here is a thread that was started on the beastlord forums about them having problems slowing somethings in GoD right now.<br />
<br />
If you skip to page 4, you can see my response to it all (under my beastlords name Ticking).  The really funny part was the first response on page 5 though from K9_frenzy.<br />
<br />
Do not go flaming them please.  That isn't the reason why I posted this, and frankly, we have done enough as a community whining about them as it is.<br />

Tash/Slow argument on EQbeastlord (http://www.eqbeastlord.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=11743&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;&amp;start=0)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This made me laugh....really hard:<br />
<br />
Shaman have tremendous DPS. Their pets hit as hard as ours. Give them a couple daggers and haste them and they are beasts. Then add to that their DoTs and their DD along with slow, their better gear, higher HP, more AC and better mana regen and you have a real bad ass.<br />
<br />
And also:<br />
They need to make our slow = to Shamans landing, plus give us an MR debuffer. Call it, whatever, but as a slow class, I dont feel reliable enough to join a GoD group, being the primary slower, with no Tash like buff and a watered down slow.<br />
<br />
None of the slows have a resist mod, and the beast slow casts faster to begin with. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jeebus that is funny.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are a slowing class now.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this hurts Bst feelings but why does Sony have such a hard-on for this class.  Is it because EQ switched from VI to Sony around that time of their induction into EQ.<br />
<br />
Slow should of never gotten above around 45% for BST.  They are our hybrids.<br />
<br />
Do you see a Paladin running around with a 7k heal.<br />
<br />
I have rolled a Berserker in hopes this class is Sony's next obsession.<br />

that made me laugh for real...well that and the part about dog dog being as good as a bst pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">although i dont think they should get malos, i dont really see that getting somin like malaisement, our level 34 debuff  at 60+ would be that bad and the lower ones.<br />
i have played a beast, and there slow get resisted just as often as the shaman one, but it is faster.  they only use it without a shaman,mage groups and if poeple need debuff shaman still way better<br />
<br />
but it was funny about our pet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did they mention anything about our uber melee and tanking abilities? :D <br />
<br />
Now, I am sure Beastlords have their issues, but that...<br />

... is just unreal. Was he serious?<br />
<br />
That statement just so wrong at SO many levels, it's not funny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dogdog = 15 dps<br />
Bst Warder = at least 70 dps (I am guessing)<br />
<br />
Give me a frikkin break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think beasts should get a low level mala spell, nothing wrong with that.  Giving them Malo would be dumb.  <br />
<br />
Also the part about shaman pets being equal to beasts was hilarious.  They aren't even close!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One thing this thread made me think about is how the other classes with slow are penalized for having it.<br />
<br />
For us, we're penalized with inferior healing, zero aggro control, no way deal with a mob hitting us other than running, inferior pet, and inferior buffing. <br />
<br />
Beastlords? Did they get no root because they have slow?  Is that really a big issue for a hybrid.<br />
<br />
Enchanters?  Hmm, not much there.  Nothing in their design which screams we nerfed this because you have slow.  Is Arcane/Eldritch Rune one third of what it should be because they have 70% slow?  Was Doppleganger put in to let them deal with their slow aggro?<br />
<br />
Bards?  Well they can only keep three or four songs up at once.  Oh wait.  Their slow lasts one minute.  Did they get inferior healing because they have slow?  They also got fade so they can deal with their aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe those beasties just need to make sure they have a shaman in-group for Malos at all times. :p<br />
<br />
Class interdependence just sucks....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All I can say is, I hope TiggreUncia never groups with me, cause I have a feeling any mob HE happens to be tanking will just HAPPEN to resist my slow OVER and OVER, and my heals will just HAPPEN to fizzle OVER and OVER.<br />
<br />
Or maybe I'll just spend the 10 seconds casting our Uber incomplete CH on him. Oh, darn, he's dead already. Oh well, at least I'm not incompetent--after all, I TRIED to use the CH bomb!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Their argument holds SOME weight in upper GoD. Try landing slow without ever casting malos on that stuff. The answer isnt a debuff, but a spell like balance of Nihli, neg 20-40 resist adjust with like a 50%. Perhaps a cast time longer than their normal slow. <br />
<br />
IMO Beastlords didnt make us obsolete, content did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yea, I've been enjoying it ever since one of our guild bsts pointed it out to me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We're still far too useless in GoD groups.  Sad that the latest expansion always trivializes the shaman class.  I don't usually cry about shamans being weak, and in all the other areas of the game we are balanced.  But in GoD . . . let's just say, I can't compete with a bard, chanter, or even beastlord (very well) for a spot in a group.  Bards can slow just as well (with mitigation factored in) as I can, they can pull, they can melee, they can buff and overhaste, they can give mana regen, and they can provide CC with mezzes.  I can weakly heal and slow and provide very substandard dps.  None of which is worth keeping me in a group.  This sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IMO Beastlords didnt make us obsolete, content did.<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
Still, I'm suprised by some of the BL comments on our class.  I suppose I expected more understanding from a shaman hybrid.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying what is said here is wrong, or that the beasts are right... every class seems to look at the best of what another class has to offer, and is jealous of it... and you try to put things in the best light for your class.<br />
<br />
No matter if by bug or design, the shaman pet is fairly weak.   But to a beastlord trying to prove that shamans are uber, and beastlords have a weakness, it's <br />

<br />
(Okay, the point about our pets being equal to theirs was a big stretch, but maybe the guy thought it was true... if you don't play a shaman, your exact knowledge of our pets is probably limited).<br />
<br />
And it's the same for us... we paint BSTs as such an uber class... because in reality we're fishing for upgrades.<br />

Not to burst your bubble, but...<br />
<br />
Bst can buff better than us<br />
Bst can slow almost as good as us<br />
Bst have FAR more DPS than us<br />
<br />
We have better armour for the most part..but have you seen a bst pet..they can tank as well as we can..or better.<br />
<br />
Did I mention better buffs..SD, Paragon anyone?...<br />
<br />
That leaves us with the advantage of healing over them.  Their best heal is 428 and ours is 1300.. I said best, not biggest.  <br />
<br />
<br />
To be honest, I would think that Shaman Malos on inc and the Bst slow about the same time that hits would be a better combo than us malos..wait wait, cast Slow.  The numbers might not be quite as good..but might be quite comperable.</div></div><hr />

I told my husband I was a tremendous DPS machine. He laughed at me and pointed out that beastlord obviously hasn't grouped with a shaman. I am going to go sit in a corner and mutter DPS machine over and over with a silly grin on my face    :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think BSTs buff better than us.  They have 1 &quot;better&quot; buff, in the Spiritual Line for mana/hp regen.     Fero is also a very nice buff... but it stacks with FA.<br />
<br />
They also get the Vigor line, which is actually an awesome buff.    It fits in the same &quot;slot&quot; as Paladin and Ranger buffs... making a person choose (or take what they can get) between max hp (Pal) max atk (Ran) or a balance of hp/atk (Bst).<br />
<br />
I don't think our problem is BSTs, I think our problem is that stat caps have not increased with the ease of getting better gear.    To most melee (and no, not ALL, just a lot)... our stat buffs don't mean as much as they would have in the old days, because they all have higher stats.<br />
<br />
So I do not think BSTs buff better than us.   It doesn't matter what they can buff their pet too... those lines are great... mages can basically do the same thing.   They can also get some better numbers by using more buff slots... but as far as I know, we have the same flexibility if we wanted to waste valuble buff slots.<br />
<br />
They can slow almost as good as us.   Yes.    Depending on the situation (they seem to be getting far less resists in an LDON like situation) one may even say as good or better.       This bugged me a lot at first... but then when you consider our slowing package, compared to theirs, we slow much better... and the GoD slow - for its good and bad points - makes us better overall slowers too.<br />
<br />
BSTs do more dps... I hope so... on average anyhow... my only hurt DPS pride is that clerics can melee better (due to proc happy hammer, not actual melee stats) and they have nicer nukes too.     I'd kinda feel bad for the Beastlords if they didn't have some good dps output from them + pet.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is... it's easy to fall into grass is greener.     BSTs are a good class... but they aren't responsible for our problems.    From reading a few replies in other threads... our main problem right now appears to be healing... which I agree with from doing a few GoD trial runs.<br />
<br />
I don't think SoE is really stupid... and if they gave beastlords an unresistable MR debuffer (eg: Malos / Malo ) then... well that would suck for us.     But as Brenlo said in one of his posts here... they juggle &quot;fixing&quot; classes, with making sure they have distinict abilities.   <br />
<br />
And before anyone says it, distinct doesn't really mean ONLY you can do it... mages get Mala and the resistable line of Mal*... but they don't have slow... so they aren't &quot;competition&quot; to our distinct abilities.</div></div><hr />

and they do it with 6 less buff slots. Additionally I am pretty sure te beastlord buffs actually stack, while I am very sure something in the shaman buff stack (16 buffs, yay) does not stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Heh... no only they buff better but half the buffs they're using to do so are Kunark-era shamans buffs. Tells you everything about the 'upgrades' shamans have gotten since.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda funny that we can buff 2 useless stats by 320 and they cap at 305.  (-20 of one for PE stacking I think)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">And neither do Focus and Infusion of Spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I believe most - if not all - of the resist buffing comes from Fero... which I mentioned... but since it stacks with FA, it really doesn't take away from us.<br />
<br />
Avatar would be just as &quot;special&quot; if the stat caps were higher, or players had worse gear relative to the cap... or as someone suggested in one of the other threads, if Avatar could pump you over your caps... like &quot;overhaste&quot;.<br />
<br />
So as it turns out... +resists +atk ends up being better than +atk +stats.<br />
<br />
I guess better is subjective... and I will admit that seeing that breakdown, did put it closer than I had originally thought.<br />
<br />
Fero is a fantastic buff... but I never saw it as competition, I saw it as an uber compliment to FA... with the both of them... it's just an amazing combo.<br />
<br />
I get asked for Focus and Sta all the time... do beastlords get asked to buff all the time whenever a shaman is near?   For Dominion I'm sure they do.</div></div><hr />

This was about who buffs better - beastlords do. Melee damage will be very similar, 10% haste vs 50ATK (80ish ATK on a melee).<br />
beastlords add more HPs and mana regeneration whereas a shaman can cap your strength about 12 times past the cap, which does exactly nothing.<br />
The one thing shaman have on beastlords right now are group buffs.<br />
<br />
[QUOTE='Sariss']Avatar would be just as &quot;special&quot; if the stat caps were higher, or players had worse gear relative to the cap... or as someone suggested in one of the other threads, if Avatar could pump you over your caps... like &quot;overhaste&quot;.<br />
Well, yes, if Avatar was better it would be better. It is not better though. I wish it was, but it isn't.<br />
<br />
So as it turns out... +resists +atk ends up being better than +atk +stats.<br />
And mana regen + HPs are better then a couple AC.<br />
<br />
I get asked for Focus and Sta all the time... do beastlords get asked to buff all the time whenever a shaman is near?   For Dominion I'm sure they do.<br />
I do not see why one would not ask for Spiritual Vigor, I sure do unless I can find a paladin, and the melees would probably take it over Brell's.<br />
And Ferocity is kinda wanted too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: this is a fine example of the way people think of shaman. They just think &quot;hey, of course shaman buffs are better&quot;. Once this wears off group invites are going to get a lot more rare. We are still getting a lot of groups from perceptions of shaman in Luclin / early PoP I think.<br />

I wonder if Nixx would ever have posted about soloing Juggernauts and Dragons if he could have known this.  :p</div></div><hr />

I took out PE and IoS because of stacking issues.  Reworked the numbers.  I definately wouldn't say that 10% more haste makes us the KINGS and QUEENS of buffers.  Makes me a sad shaman. /cry</div></div><hr />

That was the point of my post.  It isn't that the grass is greener...blah blah, it is that Sony has no freakin idea how this game works.  To them, our +200 to stats we can give is a HUGE advantage.  They look at our raw buff numbers and think..FAR SUPERIOR I'm sure.  They have no idea that 90% of the buffing we do is useless.  For most higher end melee, the only thing that makes any difference is +ATK/+AC/+HP/Haste.  Even haste is somewhat subjective since many will be getting near haste caps anyway.  So they beat us in ATK and HP, we beat them in AC/Haste....I think I owuld take ATK/HP over AC/HASTE<br />
<br />
As far as slowing, we do have a higher percentage slow and we can Malos first..However, if the group has a mage or enchanter, the malos advantage is mostly gone.  The % advantage is also mostly gone with immune/partial mobs.  <br />
<br />
DPS, we won't talk about this one.<br />
<br />
Healing.  Yes, we can heal more.  That is our one real advantage.  However, in GoD, we can't heal and they can't heal, so even though we heal more, we are both more or less useless healers.<br />
<br />
I think much of it comes down to Sony's lack of understanding of how the game has changed.  Just adding +75 STR to a buff doesn't make it any better.  With stat caps where they are, and the gear out there the way it is, most of our stat buffs never do 1 point of help.  <br />
<br />
I think what gets me most about beastlords is that they are supposed to be OUR hybred.  They are supposed to be inferior at most things we do, but make up for it with far more melee ability/dps than we  can do.  That is what a hybred does.  Rangers, Paladins, SK....they all fit into that.  I think the BL is the only one that actually does what one of the parent classes does better than the parent.  As a matter of fact, they can come fairly close to a monk for DPS too...  Could they be better than both parents?</div></div><hr />

I don't play a monk or beastlord, so I haven't seen any parses, but what is a monk's melee DPS compared to a beastlords melee/pet/spell DPS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ignorance of a few posters on the BL forums makes me cry too.  Thanksfully there's a few people over there that understand our plight.<br />
<br />
Seems like a few of them haven't realized we aren't playing in antonica anymore.  Sure makes me want to go realize my damage potential though, I'll be sure to use my 1925 point heal once I get aggro too.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">give it to them,<br />
give them our malos and our slows, give them our avatar too, give them cripple and group focus.<br />
give me a great big fast cast poison nuke and a line of quickish cold dots and a big spot heal and i'll change my spec to conjuration and be a dps class with backup heals just like a little gimp druid.</div></div><hr />

How do you get 105? Tribunal is +65 DR / PR and doesn't stack with Resist Disease nor with Talisman of Jasinth nor with Talisman of Epuration.<br />
<br />
And you forgot to add +15attack from Bi'lih for outdoor zones ;)</div></div><hr />

And then give me '/changeclass Beastlord' command :-)<br />

<br />
My own opinion:<br />
The only problem I have with the BL class is that they seem to be the penultimate shaman.  Look at the direction the shaman class was evolving...at the end of that road is the Beastlord.  SOE doesnt want to blur the lines between classes so shamans are left without a clear direction to develop.</div></div><hr />
