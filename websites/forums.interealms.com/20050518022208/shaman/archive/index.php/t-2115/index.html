<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Another thread in this forum (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2101) prompted me to submit this post to the Developer's Corner:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
--start post--<br />
Before I begin, let me just state that I am a huge fan of EverQuest, that I love the game, and that I would never do anything to jeopardize my account status.  In fact, its because of all of this that I am making this post:<br />
<br />
There is a very interesting thread going on at the shaman board right now:<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2101<br />
<br />
What it has made me realize is that a lot of people use eqw.  Before, I knew a few people in RL who used the program, but I was always afraid that I would lose my account if I used it.  But to hear the people talk on this thread, it really doesn't seem like that is the case.<br />
<br />
What it comes down to for me is this:<br />
<br />
1)  Many people currently use the program EQW (as evidenced by the thread I referenced)<br />
2)  These people use the program because it enhances their playing experience (read the thread for more on this) and some would actually quit everquest if it stopped working.<br />
3)  Despite Verant's stated reasons for not allowing EQW (that having a windowed version of EQ would allow macros and other exploits), this program has been existence for a long time, and the game has not been &quot;broken&quot; by it yet.<br />
4)  While many players use EQW, gaining all the benefits of windowed EQ with no reprecussions, the &quot;good&quot; customers are the ones who suffer, because we have to run everquest in full screen.<br />
<br />
(A small side not, the whole thing kinda reminds me of America's war on drugs, but since I don't know your politics or knowledge on the matter, I won't go in to why I see this parrallel).<br />
<br />
What I would really like to see is that the new interface allows for everquest in a window.  Alternatively, I would really like to see a response to this post, if only to explain to legitimate EQ users why we are being penalized.  Alternatively, if you are afraid of encouraging the use of EQW by letting people know about it in the public forum (being afraid to let information spread reminds me of another parrallel, to repressive governments, but again I will bite my tongue) could you at least please respond with some email to me personally, even if it is only to say &quot;I actually did read your email.&quot;  Thanks.<br />
--end post--<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just curious what you all think?  Also, if I don't recieve a response from Verant, I'm very much considering organizing a compaign to get EQW legitimized.   I figured we could draft an actual resolution (something like the four points in my post, with that whole &quot;whereas the Everquest community feels ....&quot; type language, and then post it to all the major EQ boards (class boards, tradeskill boards, general boards on major sites, etc.) and ask people to email Verant showing their support for the resolution (whether or not they use EQW).  Again, what's everyone's thoughts on the matter?  Thanks/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think VI/Sony will keep their current view, regardless of how the *community* feels.... that is, of course, until they can make money from EQW =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While I respect your cynicism, I respectfully disagree.  I've submitted several other posts to the Developer's Corner before (the most notable one being on quivers, which was one of several posts which led to bow haste from quivers) and generally found that as long as  what I am writing is well supported, they do tend to read and respond.  Also, while we all like to bash Verant (myself included :) ) they really are in the business of making EQ the best game possible (even more so than before I think now that they have competition from DaoC and AO).  I honestly believe that if we can show Verant that the community as a whole wants windowed EQ, we can get them to implement it.  The guys that work there play the game too (I have friends who work there who have confirmed that this is true and not just rhetoric from VI), and I think they honestly want what is best for the game.  Unfortunately, they seem to believe (evidence from EQW's existence to the contrary) that allowing EQ to be run in a window would allow exploits that would ruin the game, and so they believe its in the best interest of the game to not allow EQW.  If we can change their mind about it, I think they will allow it.  But this is just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well they do. People dual or triple boxing pay double or triple. It's a bad business decision and (im my view) an unecessary limitation on their product.<br />
<br />
Posting to VIs board is good. Although, i think the drug war analogy is illogical and an unnecessary digression. <br />
<br />
Anway, i think Wildaar should write the petition. He loves things like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can still get it to work.  Open EQW twice.  The first will not work.  The  2nd wont have an arrow cursor (it will ingame and at the character select screen) but you can use the keyboard on that one.   Close the first window and play on the 2nd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think my biggest concern is the *3rd party software* rule. I in no way wish for you to halt your plan on account of a doubt, of course, I just don't think this is an issue they will budge on.<br />
<br />
As for opening 2 EQW's....that sounds like a good plan :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&gt;&gt; Although, i think the drug war analogy is illogical and an<br />
&gt;&gt; unnecessary digression.<br />
<br />
Yeah, in retrospect I agree.  Too bad VI's boards don't have a nice edit post feature like the one's here.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;I think my biggest concern is the *3rd party software* rule<br />
<br />
If VI decided that windowed EQ was ok, they could incorporate it in to the main program, and then it wouldn't require 3rd party software at all, and they could keep their policy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone see this yet?  Very interesting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XmaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Samuqan that is interesting i wonder what that VI guy was thinking... i dont see whats the big deal /shrug i mean there should be a way since all of our items and characters are on there servers for them to tell if someone is hacking there system and not just playing the game in a window format.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wouldn't play if I didn't have EQW.  I like to talk on AIM, post and read here, look up stuff on eqmaps, etc... while I play.  There are many many things to do online and I wouldn't give all of them up just to play EQ.  Also, if I ever get those free account keys that everyone is talking about, I am going to start a second account and twink and PL a monk.  That's $26 a month from me that they wouldn't get if it wasn't for EQW.  Almost everyone I know uses it, and the people that I introduce to it all say it's the greatest thing they've ever seen.<br />
<br />
The guy that updates EQW is really amazing, too.  I woke up yesterday and EQ had been patched and EQW wasn't working any more.  I went out of the evening and when I got back, he had updated it and EQW was working once again.  I wish VI had people like this working for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maui Corpses</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I run EQW it works fine till I get to server select screen.  After trying to get on character select screen it crashes the program.  It won't display the EQ banner to get to Character select screen. <br />
I am running Win XP on a 1700 AMD with 512 DDR ram.  Any help would be appreciated. I have never gotten EQW to work yet and always wanted to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i do agree with the war on drugs analogy, not in the case of hard drugs, but perhaps marijuana.  We are finding that there are positive effects to marijuana, and that the negative effects are less than we thought, yet the government still persecutes for posession of marijuana, i believe because they do not want to back down.  Its a stretch, but it sort of fits.<br />
<br />
btw. no, im not a stoner.<br />
<br />
maui - make sure your computer is running on 16 bit color.  I used to run on 32, tried to run EQW, had the same problem, EQ runs in 16, so anything besides 16 will cause it to quit after server select.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can change your color depth in eq by changing a line in the eqclient.ini file (videomodebits=32 or something like that).  Of course, switching to 32 bits will make your graphics card work a lot harder, and if you are like me you won't even notice the benefit.</div></div><hr />
