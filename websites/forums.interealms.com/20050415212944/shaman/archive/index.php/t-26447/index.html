<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ApemanShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of complaints on these forums, but just play and have fun with what you got. <br />
<br />
This is where I think Eq failed, <br />
<br />
The whole game is based on two things ITEMS and SPELLS. Which is ok up to a point. <br />
<br />
Think about it, what seperates two level 70 shamans of equal levels and AA exp ??       (besides how the person individually plays)<br />
<br />
Items and their obtained spells !<br />
<br />
Now, (for Example) I had played a game called Shadowbane (RPG). It was not as good as EQ (no where near enough content/quests) but the one thing that made it better than EQ was each character you made would be 100% unique than any other character on the server. Depending on how you want to build him and what areas you want to concentrate on. <br />
<br />
IE : Lets say you made a &quot;TANK&quot;<br />
<br />
You could make this tank into a 50% DPS 50% damage absorbtion character or make him 100% one way or another, or any combination you choose (% wise), Depending on how you spend your exp points when you level. Of course there was other abilities and features but not to get into a whole page about it.......<br />
<br />
But do you understant my point ??<br />
<br />
I think EQ 2 tried to do a bit of this by having more types of classes:<br />
EX: Dark Shaman, Light Shaman, the Dark would have stronger Dots but the Light would have the better heals. (A step in the right direction but not enough)<br />
<br />
              So when you get your 10K HP and 10 Mana unbuffed and raided your ass'es off like there was no tomorrow, WHO GIVES A  FLYING FOOK ? You are still a level 70 SHAMAN and your role still stays the same as any other level 70 shaman who has Half the mana pool or HP and who doesn't have all the spells. <br />
<br />
So don't worry about all this class balancing bull****, its all 1 game and its all the same for everyone who plays<br />
<br />
The next RPG that can have the same content as EQ but with this &quot;uniqueness&quot; feature will dominate no doubt</div></div><hr />

Keep dreaming, you ain't got the slightest of clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I could wear all attack gear and only use HP augs and AC augs though... still doesn't make me a melee.<br />
<br />
Same thing with many of those &quot;make your character unique!&quot; type games.. people could do 50% 50% or some variation, but most usually end up min/maxing.  As soon as the &quot;best&quot; character setups, skill choices, etc.. are determined, most the crowd in any game follows that path.<br />
<br />
I actually like EQ in the sense that I don't have to figure out what the &quot;max&quot; settings are for my shaman.  Well.. I do, but it comes from gear. <br />
<br />
Like right now, I'm searching allakhazam.com trying to figure out a focus upgrade path Qvic+.  Its challenging hehe.  EQ may lack character customization, but it certainly is light years ahead of most games in terms of item upgrade paths.<br />
<br />
If I don't choose my gear upgrades wisely, I could harm my ability to be at my &quot;maximum&quot; in terms of healing, damage, and buffing power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQ hasn't failed. when EQ fails, SOE will drop it. the servers will shut down, and you won't be able to log in ever again.<br />
<br />
the &quot;item&quot; oriented mentality is on the gamer's side, which is then responded to by SOE. you can choose to become item oriented, or not.<br />
<br />
its like going to an art museum. many people will go to see a specific exhibit. most people will go just to see what exhibits are there. and a few will go just for the sake of seeing the art.<br />
<br />
each kind of person is a certain kind of expert who will see what they want to see, and all can go to the museum together. the only question is, do you want to see something specific, or something more general?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol obviously this person wasnt around in the begining where you had no stat items for the first 20 lvls or so...  and that was an Aviak Charm  8P...<br />
<br />
and what seperates one 70 shaman from another 70 shaman that is easy my friend...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No mmorpg will ever compare favorably to your first, no matter what it was, because your memories of discovery combine the novelty of the genre as well as that particular game, and you romanticize the things that were very annoying as having been merely inconvenient. <br />
<br />
When you start your next game, you compare to your first, and the rewards are either too little or too much; the combat interface is either too complicated or too simple.<br />
<br />
This is why I will never have a 'next game'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i so /agree with Samanna's post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The whole game is based on two things ITEMS and SPELLS. Which is ok up to a point. <br />
I disagree wholeheartedly. For me, EQ is about playing a game. That means I play the game. I didnt jump over the PoP progression into the EPs. I didnt skip the EPs and just head to Time. I did my hours and hours of grunt work in the Ikkys and Uqua to get to Qvic. <br />
<br />
I play the game known as Everquest. Loots are great. They help me achieve my next level of progression. Spells are awesome. I play a class that relies almost soley on &quot;the book&quot;. But these are tools to achieve a goal, and that goal is playing the game. Currently, I am in Inkutu. Working on Qvic raid mobs, bigger OOW stuff like the RSS Royals, DoN Dragons, etc etc. There are a buttload of guilds I could join and skip right into Anguish. Why? For better loot? I kinda look at that like /godmode in Quake. <br />
So when you get your 10K HP and 10 Mana unbuffed and raided your ass'es off like there was no tomorrow, WHO GIVES A  FLYING FOOK ? You are still a level 70 SHAMAN and your role still stays the same as any other level 70 shaman who has Half the mana pool or HP and who doesn't have all the spells. <br />

/agree with Mu. Clueless. Sorry you cannot seem to enjoy this game the same way I do. Try a new game or 5. Cancel your accout. In fact, I have a better idea. Move servers, apply to the biggest guild there, tell them your original &quot;10K&quot; shaman got hacked, and you bought this &quot;3K&quot; shaman cause you knew you could just skip a bunch of stupid &quot;eq&quot; crap, and get your 10K, then cancel, ok? You obviously have no clue about playing a game. <br />
No mmorpg will ever compare favorably to your first, no matter what it was, because your memories of discovery combine the novelty of the genre as well as that particular game, and you romanticize the things that were very annoying as having been merely inconvenient. <br />

I wish the rep-bump system was still in place, cause this is the type of post it was designed for (of course, I already gave Samm about 20 rep bumps, heh, and mine were pretty good)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gotta agree with Sam on this - I bought WoW today (haven't played yet) and couldn't help but feel that it'll never replace EQ simply because EQ was the first of its kind. It was a completely new concept for most of its players and will always be the staple to which newer MMOs are compared. Many would agree that today's EQ is twisted and quite different (in a negative sense) than it was years ago, but make no mistake, those same people have stories and stories of the good ol' days. <br />
<br />
Personally, I feel Velious &gt; anything about any other game, ever. FF7 was awesome, MGS2 was awesome, participating in a 10th Ring War with 80 other people back when it was challenging, making new strategies on the fly when something went wrong, recouping in between pops, watching the event develop, seeing Narandi finally fall - **** like that is irreplacable simply because you can't boot up your PS2 or Xbox whenever you want and do it all over again. The people you fought with and the fight itself were always unique, and finally watching the hours of work pay off and celebrating with 80-odd other people was the real deal. This doesn't apply just to the 10th War though, you'll always remember other events like spending months keying up for ST/VT and finally zoning in for the first time, first seeing/fighting Naggy/Yelinak/AoW/Emp back when they were King Badasses, getting your epic (back when it was somewhat challenging), actually working to develop plans to fight raid mobs because it was more rewarding than just using Random_UberGuild_014's published strategy and succeeding after repeated failed attempts.<br />
<br />
I'm rambling, my point is: As bad as EQ gets, for a long long time it was the **** - there's no denying that. It'll always be a guideline, and the feeling it created at first will never be duplicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know a lot of folks with more aa and unbuffed hp/mana than should be possible, and they still suck. They don't know basic low level game mechanics, and will never undertsand high level mechanics to its full capacity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll never forget the days in KC when I would slow to get aggro and root park 6 mobs and manage to keep my mana going enough to keep our tanks alive. People always wondered as I sat with 40% health that I was a maniac but I helped the group so much. I still do that nowadays in RSS or MPG but it's just not as possible anymore. Do I expect any new shaman that just started playing this game to be able to do the same? No. There's a skill component, but nowadays it's just not as apparent as it was back in the day as we have the 10k hp 10k mana to back up our mistakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, yes...I loved walking mobs to all 4 corners of a room to park them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Man, KC was so roomy.  You ever do that stuff in Lower Guk? Those deadside rooms get CROWDED with 3-4 mobs in em.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Root Parking two adds.  <br />
Offtanking a add (or two) with torpor up.  <br />
Pet killing one that has 2-3 dots on it.<br />
Epic dot on 5 mobs all at once<br />
Canning like mad.<br />
Clicking the JBB on the same mob pet was on.<br />
