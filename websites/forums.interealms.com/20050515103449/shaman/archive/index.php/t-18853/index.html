<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well...since the wife decided she was tired of waiting on WoW and Horizons was such a disappointment, EQ is sucking me/us back in. One of the main reasons I quit (last time/again) was because she no longer played. That combined with my failed attempt at reforming my guild and the realization that 95% of the people I use to run with no longer played really left me less than interested in playing most of the time. Well...since she's wanting to play again, and a few friends are playing again, you get the picture. :)<br />
<br />
Might still be a week or two away since I have to wait for our game room to be recarpeted (burst water heater in early December, the room is still in a massive state of disarray :)), plus get my wifes new gaming machine built (parts to be ordered on 1/15), but I can say with a modicum of certainty that we'll be playing again before the end of the month.<br />
<br />
Talk about a busy schedule. In the gym 6 days a week for an hour a day, plus writing/recording music (http://www.jamesgang.net/ej/music.asp), plus spending time with my pups (http://www.jamesgang.net/pets/jamesgangkids.jpg), plus EQ? Man oh man!...not sure I'll have time for work now. Hope my boss understands. LOL :)<br />
<br />
Ok...so you can now all tell me &quot;I told ya so&quot;, I'll eat my share of crow, then we can all move on. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Drag your feet a little.  Maybe re-seal the floor before you start on the carpet.  If you can hold out a week or two longer, WoW beta signups start at the end of the month. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lakota = 2 yr M Alaskan Malamute<br />
Skyye = 1.5 yr F Siberian Husky<br />
Bear = 8 yr M Keeshond<br />
Keesha = 11yr F Keeshond<br />
<br />
WoW beta sign ups at end of January more than likely means beta won't actually start till April/May. :) I'm not expecting it to be released until late Q3/early Q4 this year at the earliest. As long as they took to even announce just the beta sign ups, I actually wouldn't be surprised if it gets pushed to early '05.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Welcome back Valgoth, hope to see you guys in game soon</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like others, I don't expect WoW to be released till early 2005, possibly Christmas 2004.  I'm really looking forward to this game.  Check out their website and their forums, some decent updated info.</div></div><hr />
