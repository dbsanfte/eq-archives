<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gludorp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems pretty unanimous among people here that a horse/lizard is one of the most important purchases a shaman can make, along with a jbb and maybe a fungi tunic. But after thinking about it, I'm not sure I totally understand why. Maybe someone can explain.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing with mounts (I'm talking about the cheap no-frills variety here):<br />
<br />
1) They don't give you sitting hp regen ever. (I just read this in one of the recent threads -- I previously thought the opposite was true).<br />
<br />
2) They don't give you sitting mana regen when moving, fighting or casting spells. (This is right, right?)<br />
<br />
So basically, you have to be sitting still and doing nothing to get the regen benefits of a mount. But if I'm still and doing nothing, ain't I gonna be sitting down in that situation anyway, and getting the same mana regen rate as a horse/lizard?<br />
<br />
As far as I can see, the only advantage the mount gives me is that I don't attract aggro from sitting down. But then again, I would get the sit-down hp regen rate by really sitting down, rather than being on a horse. And isn't hp regen more important than mana regen for a shaman because of cannabalize? Am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />

<br />
True,True,False.<br />
<br />
You get Meditation rate while casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also you dont draw sitting agro. One of the most important reasosn for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends on your playstyle I guess...<br />
<br />
I am an active, agressive player.  Even before horses, I never sat.  I was always casting something: debuff, slow, dot, nuke, buff, canni, heal, regen... With the horse, I am regaining mana as if I were sitting around doing nothing while still being able to do what I do.  I literaly cast non stop in exp groups, and my answer to &quot;mana?&quot; is always &quot;full&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mana regen is actually more important than HP regen.  The reason shaman are so interested in HP regen is so we can convert it to mana.  Having a strong mana regen is just cutting out the middle man.  <br />
<br />
Mana regen items are very expensive or very difficult to get and not nearly as effective for the cost.  We can control our own HP regen with our regen line of spells and there are a few items with good HP regen that are available to a shaman.  A good example is the fungi.  15 hp per tick HP regen.  Go to the bazaar and try to find a comarable mana regen item (FT 7.5) for any price.<br />
<br />
The horse is the best mana regen item money can buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup what the others have said. Horse is the best FT you can have.<br />
<br />
The moment I go to a dungeon and can't use me leezard, I become 50% less efficient and effective cause I dun regen mana while casting and standing to avoid taking aggro whenever I sit.<br />
<br />
Plus the fact that  in order to change spells we have to sit and hope that we dun get hit before it is memmed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Buy the horse.<br />
<br />
Saying I'm not getting a horse because you don't get sitting HP regen on horseback (which for me is a whopping 3hp per tick) is like saying I'm not buying a horse because I don't like the colour of the bridle they gave it. Totally irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I've said it before, and I'll say it again - a horse is FT21 at max med skill (1 point of mana regen per 12 points med skill, 252 is max...)<br />
<br />
Yes, that's FT21. More than KEI. And it's permanent...<br />
<br />
Tal<br />
<br />
edit - just in case the point didn't some across... When soloing I get 21 mana per tick whilst tanking mobs... And you can't tank sitting down!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just purchased my horse yesterday morning and OMG yes...SO worth it!<br />
I ended the night playing main healer/buffer/debuffer etc for a group of melees in UP and only had down time when buffs needed to be refreshed and that downtime was very minimal. There is NO way I could have handled all those roles (without considerable downtime) without kei prior to sitting astride my beloved nag. Once I got used to looking at horse ears and saw the difference a horse makes, I kicked myself several times for waiting so long to get one. The no-agro sitting thing to switch out spells is beautiful!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Edarb Everbuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Buy a Lizzy ... No ears and the med rate is awesome.  I just turned 58 and between Lizzy (got most of my pp for it by selling REIF) and Can IV I have a hard time running LOM.</div></div><hr />
