<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skab Wumpuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all, looking to gather some information here on the cudgel quest.  I have ran into a snag on my server, because the 1st NPC needed to turn in the 1st cudgel and other items to is missing.  I was wondering if you could post here what server you play on, and if Heirophant Oxyn is actually spawned in the front room of the shaman guild.  I have checked a few other servers, and have seen him up.  I also doubt this would be some sort of a despawned NPC, becasue he also gives extremely low lvl quests.  If you could post that info here, it would be more than helpful.<br />

Oxyn = NOT SPAWNED</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of NPC's are broken (ie not spawning) at the moment thanks to the focus effect patch. Yes Heirophant Oxyn spawns in the front room of the shaman guild in cabilis, at least he used to ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/petition<br />
<br />
When I came to do the turn-in for the Mud Crabs, and Firsth Cudgel quest, Heirophant Oxyn was missing, so I petitioned him, and the GM showed up, had a look around the zone and couldn't find him. <br />
He said maybe he'd been killed, and I replied he was a quest NPC for lowbie quests, so he then Re-poped the entire zone, and Oxyn reappeared.<br />
<br />
/cheer Drembo the halfling pirate GM.<br />
<br />
So, I would suggest you try petitioning, you might be lucky :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oxyn has been perma-killed on most servers due to an exploit involved in the SK Greenmist quest.  Supposed to be fixed in the next patch but....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah he has bailed on xev.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skab Wumpuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had petitioned and a senior guide had responded, and went and looked.  He said he would forward it on, and Oxyn did end up spawning within the next 2 days.  I am past the use of him now also, this I am glad of if people are killing him with an expliot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Be prepared to wait even longer with the quest.. no rockchanters or the overseer in nurga hehe..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah I noticed that the Overseer wasn't going to spawn after I camped him for 12+ hours .... thank the gods for Warcraft III!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heheh you're smarter then I was.. I camped him for 4... almost 5 straight nights before giving up hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Even the BST trainer is having problems hanging out in the Cab east castle.  When I mentioned to a GM that the trainer and Oxyn were not spawning properly the GM said they wander and I just had not looked hard enough :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I love how when it was Iksar only , no contribution of help solving the quests. But when the works done, the freeloaders all jump on the band wagon for the rewards.  I hope the seriously reconsider letting non Iksar use Iksar quest items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why would anyone have wanted to try to solve a quest that a) they didnt have the faction to try without alot of work and b) very likely couldnt use. Your flame sucks sir.<br />
<br />
Go /feedback about Cloak of Scales and Stone of Morid if you want to bitch about Iksar only items being changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Skab Wumpuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why would we help you solve a quest that we could not even do, and that requires hours and hours of faction work.  You are a complete tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmmm..thought the whole point of EQ was to do quests and have fun??  I'll go back to Crushbone and work on my freeloading skills tho :p</div></div><hr />
