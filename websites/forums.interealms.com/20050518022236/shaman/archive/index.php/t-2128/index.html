<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As long as we are asking about equipment: I am really pleased with almost everything I have on at this point, except for my earrings: I'm still wearing the Tribunal earrings I've had on for 30 levels now, and I'd love suggestions for what to replace them with.<br />
<br />
I've considered the Vindicator earring. As a barbarian, I can't wear the Ivander's Hoop (or whatever it is called). I don't really have access to extreme-high-end items quite yet (can get very nice stuff, like Shield of the Wurm, but not the top-level Luclin sort of stuff).<br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wear the scale of wolf earring from chardok (2ac 1wis 35hp/mana clicky scale of wolf)<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
Carved bone nose spike (4ac 35hp/mana 6dr) which is from one of the luclin mob spawn quests, grimling war perhaps, cant remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good luck with the Vindi earring, it's his rare drop.  I've been to probably 20 Vindi kills, never seen the earring. Heck, I can't even seem to be there when he drops his boots!<br />
<br />
For the moment, I would switch to electrum black sapphire earrings (2 AC 35 hitpoints, 25 mana).  There is a very nice earring that drops in Maiden's Eye (ethereal earring) that can be acquired with one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Earring of Living Thunder? My experience is just the oppisit. It's probably the worst drop off of vindi, and we get it left and right.<br />
<br />
A few VERY good earrings 4ac 8sta 70 hps + others, and 4ac 10sta 75hp + others, drop from Chardok. Some great ones, 5ac 10sta 85hp + other stats drop from CT. Those are all better than EoLT imo, because they have something vitally important---hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">75+ HP earrings in Chardok? You got the same version of that zone as me? :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Ah, *lightbulb* Pearly Sarnak Bauble etc, I've camped Koro's room for many many hours and havent seen this once. Given up now.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe I said I had &quot;considered&quot; Earring of Living Thunder--largely because me guild can't give them away. Nobody really wants them. But I didn't say I wanted one...<br />
<br />
Sounds like I need to spend more time in Chardok (hate that zone, but then, I hate most zones in EQ :D  )<br />
<br />
Any details about who drops these lovely-sounding items?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chardok and CT both have a variety of nice earrings for shaman. Another option if you don't mind some faction work is the sanctum guardian earring. Very nice peice and a relatively easy quest other than having to get your smithing up a bit. <br />
<br />
Another one of my favorite earrings is still the earring of essence from droga. 30 hps 10 mr is a pretty nice earring for resists and hps still.<br />
<br />
I don't know  if you have tried yet or not but the earring from the 10th ring war isn't bad either.<br />
<br />
You don't say what your really looking for in an earring but those are some of my sugguestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm still wearing 2 black sapphire earrings (2ac 35hp 25 mana), works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">get yourself to Cazic Thule<br />
<br />
camp 4-corners the roamers. Terrorclaw is you are looking for<br />
<br />
like most rares in CT. can you say Rocking Horse **** ? well rare as.<br />
<br />
his common is a necro mantle, about the best droppable shoulders for a necro by a clear 20hps. <br />
<br />
his rare is a Raptor Tooth Bauble<br />
<br />
+2ac +10sta +10wis +45mana +45hps +12 disease effect: counteract poison<br />
<br />
can be worn as either a ring or earring <br />
<br />
SEXH<br />
<br />
seems to be if you get yourself one of the CT earrings, earring of pain (i think is also nice), that you can trade for one of the others on a par/par basis.<br />
<br />
OR if you don't like CT try boring yourself senseless for the rare earring drops in Maiden's Eye, nice one drops of the Coteries IIRC<br />
