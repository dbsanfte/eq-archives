<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently started soloing mushrooms in FG. I've heard that they are very good xp - someone quoted about 2 yellows an hour in there. Well, try as I might, I can only seem to get about an hour a yellow. I do get about 1% xp per nearly every kill, but my main problem is they take a lot of mana to kill.<br />
<br />
I was working on a 4-6 patch of mushrooms last night. It started off 4, but towards the end I could swear I was seeing 6 different popping locations.<br />
<br />
My current strategy is this:<br />
Myself: Focus, VoB, KEI, Agility, Disease Resist, Stam, Regrowth, and Form of the Great Bear.<br />
<br />
Pull with a slow.<br />
Sic dog on it. (Dog had haste, nothing else).<br />
Put my back towards a wall to avoid being interrupted as much as possible.<br />
Put pox on it.<br />
Put epic on it.<br />
JBB it to death.<br />
Root it when it starts to run.<br />
<br />
With this method I can do non-stop - almost - pulls, but they take a bit of time to kill. I've tried throwing BoN on it as well, but that ate a bit of mana and meant more sitting time. I'm also not sure if I am getting Form of the Bear regrowth, as it turns me into a shroom, and although the Bear icon is still showing, I turn into a cat once the shroom's spell is over.<br />
<br />
I've tried putting celerity on myself and swinging at it with the epic, but with the shroom's fungal slow on me, I'm moving so slowly it's annoying. I'm almost positive I get better dps with the JBB.<br />
<br />
I don't have malo torpor or Canni V (That's why I'm there, well, for Canni V anyway :)).<br />
<br />
Any advice? I was resisting about 75% of the shroom's attacks, and I wasn't really worried hp wise, since the shriknar bugs are indifferent to me. By the time I had wiped the patch out, it usually started repopping, so I don't think a bigger patch is the answer.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">since you don't have Torpor, so it is good to use JBB<br />
<br />
I have torpor and ususlly pull with slow, cast Pox, plague, Epic then canni or pull next untill OOM; pet will auto jump on mob after slow or Pox; sometime I add bane to speed up kill<br />
<br />
if you kill 6 spawn, you will get 4 Blue/hour(16%); or 9 spawn = 6blue(24%), 12 spawn = 8 blue(32%)<br />
<br />
I have Canni5 and easily do 9 spawn, sometime can do 12 spawn (with some delay) with KEI+Aego<br />
<br />
for buff, I only cast Focus,Stama, PE, ToE, ultravision, bear and other buff like aego+KEI ; I never touch agi/regen/VoG since I am too lazy :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try to give your pet some weaponz with proc, like velium weapon, Shortsword of Yaksha, gnoll hide lariat, than buff pet avator<br />
You will see pet dps increased a lot and proc like mad.<br />
(that's why we get Planar Ability to resummon pet with weapon :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm a fan of the pox, plague, epic route.  Got canni5 with that method.  /bounce  If I alternate cann4/JBB after all the dots are on, it's about dead by the time they're wearing off.<br />
<br />
What's REALLY wierd is that I noticed a difference from ... of all things... spirit quickening.  Dogdog does a LOT of the damage to these low-level bastids.  SQ had him hitting for max a lot more often than without.  And since I wasn't doing anything for damage but pox/plague, I had a spell slot to keep open for it.<br />
<br />
The really nice thing about FG is it's so easy to see the difference between clearing the patch with and without buff X, that you really get a good chance to evaluate what small changes in strategy do for your bottom line.  Yeah, it's boring as hell unless you use it for some statistical analysis.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I use bane, ebolt and epic as far as dots goes and Jbb nuke the whole time. Mobs are usually dying a bit before or after epic wears off. With Ft7, MC3, Affliction extension item, Affliction efficiency item, Cann v aa and SCM 1 now I can keep this up pretty much non stop and can handle a larger patch solo with out much trouble.<br />
<br />
Hoping to get anchient scourge of nife from vt soon here. Not sure yet if i'll just replace bane with anchient or try stacking all 3. I get the  feeling all 3 is going to be a bit of overkill tho.<br />
<br />
What your handling sounds about right for your gear/aa right now. I know cann v made a noticable difference in how fast i could kill shrooms.<br />
<br />
You don't list your gear but if you don't have one an afliction extension item is very useful and the coldain military bracer isn't hard to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, I've got the coldain military bracer. :)<br />
<br />
Also have an amulet of insight so maybe SQ will last longer with it. I like regen and celerity lasting just that little bit longer as I work. I have a FT1 item (earring of solstice), and am working on my coldain prayer shawl (I'm on 5, siren hairs for 6 are eluding me). I've only got 2 aa points so it'll be awhile before I get Canni V. <br />
<br />
I prefer to do shrooms to katta, oddly enough. At least with the shrooms I feel I'm in some sort of danger. With katta, well, I have nathyn's down like a ballet. I was powerleveling an enchanter friend there, killing for him, and he nearly fell asleep, that's how easy I've made killing at Nathyn's. I can get a yellow an hour, but gods it's deadly dull.<br />
<br />
My guild is mid-tier, so SoN is not in my immediate future. Malo might be, we're going after guardian wurms and crypt times to try and get malo for me (amongst other things). There's another shaman ahead of me for torpor so I don't count on that one anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I'll try these things out soon :) I didn't use project alpha last time I calced it (Bad me! Was out of cheap dog gear), so I'll try that, plus SQ, plus plague. <br />
<br />
I'm almost debating dinging 61 just for replenishment and a new pet (I've got replenishment, don't have the new pet), as I think that might speed this up.... :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the ideas :) I'll let you know how it goes :)<br />
<br />
I am always learning....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pull with Slow.  Epic, Bane, EBolt, reapply Bane or EBilt.  Sick fully buffed pet on them.<br />
<br />
Canni4 and Topor to replenish mana constantly I don't bother using the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For me if I am going about as fast as I possibly can (meaning Cann IV constantly, Cann V as soon as it pops) I'm hard pressed to kill 10 mushrooms before respawn.<br />
<br />
Six is easy, few minutes of downtime before pops .... Seven is doable ... Eight starts to get hard ... Nine is maximum sustainable pace, and ten I can do sometimes.<br />
<br />
Doing 8, 9 or 10 it is MUCH easier with KEI ... I'm not sure 9 and 10 are doable for me without KEI.<br />
<br />
As a practical matter its hard to get a patch with more than six spawns, so I often settle for 6 (at least I used to, now I'm 61 I hope I never go back there).<br />
<br />
MC 3 + FT 3, Affliction Efficiency 3 item, ~3000 Self buffed HP, all pre-PoP spells in book.  81 AA points.<br />
<br />
I'd say at my equipment level going balls out would have gotten me an AA in 3 1/2 hours.  I never achieved that pace in practice ... fastest I ever did one start to finish was probably 4:20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I tried some things out last night.<br />
<br />
First off, giving weapons to dog helped greatly. But giving velium weapons didn't seem to make that big of a difference - I didn't bother buffing dog's dex, and I very rarely saw any procing off of his velium weapons. He had one in each paw. So I think I'll stick with Katta guard swords for my dog weapon of choice.<br />
<br />
Secondly, with pox, epic, and plague, the shroom always died before plague wore off (I casted them in that order). Curse went first, then, if the shroom lived, pox, then plague got it. So all three did help to greatly reduce the kill time for each shroom.<br />
<br />
This time I did the shroom patch in the corner after you zone in from twilight. I think I had 8 mushrooms in that patch. <br />
<br />
I had KEI, no Aego, my buffed hp at 61 is 2320. (I'm working on hp gear, honest).<br />
<br />
Each yellow took about  1 hour 10 minutes. My main problem was I did have to sit down after every 4 or so, because even with KEI, bearform, replenishment (+25 hp per tick), I was still running a bit low on mana after that. <br />
<br />
I think Spirit quickening helped. Especially when dog got shrieker slow (40%) against his celerity (%50), that extra 25% from SQ helped him keep bashing. Once or twice he even got aggro from me.<br />
<br />
In the pox/plague vs eb/bane argument...<br />
<br />
Not including Affliction efficency III here, because I don't know those figures:<br />
<br />
A pox/plague combo costs 730 mana for 3305 damage.<br />
A bane/eb combo costs 745 mana for 2780 damage.<br />
<br />
Difference: 15 mana more and 525 damage less.<br />
<br />
Since pox wears off close to or just before the shroom dies, one can assume that most of that damage is delt, with a little bit of plague's damage remaining to be delt. Certainly not 500 of it... so that extra 500 damage must be made up somewhere, through jbb or having the dog chew on it.<br />
<br />
Curse always wears off for me before pox does, and always before the shroom is dead.<br />
<br />
Although it's tempting to try and do the damage quicker, I think pox/plague is the more steady route, as you don't have to reapply any dots or try to finsh the battle nuking. You can rely on the dots to kill it.<br />
<br />
I think getting Regen 3 and MC3 will help speed my work up a bit, at least I hope so. :) If I had torpor, that would help majorly, but alas, I don't. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the reason I use Pox and Plague because it take long to kill each shroom(1 Plague, 1 Pox, 2 epic + Dog);<br />
<br />
I ususlly tanking 3 on me or sometime 4; just slow then apply pox, plague,epic and pull next; and alway recast epic again after 3rd pull then canni time; sometime add 4th after first nearly die or cast bane to 3rd to speed up; alway control your pet on 1st target; it ususlly take 5-6 minute per 3 kill and FM after that; this is lots more fun than single<br />
<br />
with that method, I can clear 9 spawn not problem, or 2 patch if have KEI; the 6 spawn near TL zone is great spot, you can run between 3 other patch nearby for more spawn(3 spawn, 5 spawn,5 spawn) or just kill 2 Bug near you if KOS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So what are the benifits of having 3 or 4 shrooms banging on you instead of pulling them one at a time?<br />
<br />
I usually regain enough mana during a shroom battle to be able to pull another - if I were to blow a fm stack all at once, I'd then have to sit after the last one died. Plus I'd be worried about that shrieker stun which can hit for 200 occasionally, 81 more often - three shrooms casting that could be deep trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use shamams tactics with pox plague. Shrooms have low DPS, I can tank 2-3 slowed shrooms easy. disease dots kill efficiently but take a long time. <br />
<br />
I tend to pull shroom1, turgurs, plague, pox, epic last(interrupts screw DPS)<br />
-then pull shroom2, turgurs, plague, pox, epic<br />
-then torpor/can5, re-epic shroom1<br />
-then pull shroom3+dot (shroom1 dies)<br />
-torpor and bunch of can4, re-epic shroom2.<br />
-then pull shroom4, dot (shroom2 dies)<br />
etc etc<br />
<br />
I usually fight 2 at a time, and try balance canni4/5/torpor so I'm always ready to pull another as one gets to 10% . I find fighting  3+ shrooms can mess my flow up too much as I don't have the hp/mana of tougher oracles ;)<br />
<br />
I need 8-9spawns self buffed now, I will kill constantly without med downtime for over an hour or until I get bored ;) I use minimal buffs, and re-buff myself memming spells between mob swings. <br />
<br />
I get very close to aa% shamam describes, which is nice when I get in from work late and only have an hour or two to xp ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The advantage of having 2 or 3 in camp at a time is you can use most efficient/slower spells (disease dots) and free dots (epic) so you can do more dmg with less mana while still keeping up your kill rate. Since your equipement is weaker and you don't have some of the aa skills like mc3, cann v and scm you probably can't keep up the pace anyway. <br />
<br />
For better equiped shaman with lots of aa it is a good way to kill more faster since you can't really get the kill time for a single 1 much under a minute but you should be able to kill 2 at once in a minute and a half. Net result a shroom dies every 45 seconds and your killing faster.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They are probably green at 65.<br />
<br />
They were 1 yellow an hour at 61, with 50/50 lb db.<br />
<br />
PoV grouping is 2.5 hours to an aa... or 2 yellows an hour.<br />
<br />
Anyway, when I did this I wasn't flagged, had 0 aa's, and hated PoN/PoD (I still do, it's 5 hours to an aa there).<br />
<br />
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 62 or anyone who is flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Man, I'm going to have to check on this this weekend to see how many I was killing in an hour.  I tried to do it once, but I've never been a patient person and quickly lost count of how many I had killed....but I'm sure that it was close to around 10 in that hour.  Basically, I would slow pull one, then cast Pox and Bane on it while my alphaed pet chewed on it from the backside until it turned or until it died.  I was meleeing it with my Diseased War Mace (trying to max 1hb right now with it) and keeping myself torpored at all times while canniing the mana back and tanking it.  I do not have my epic yet, but I'm conducting the Rak fight today hopefully for it, so I'm sure that with it I could up my kill rate a little bit.  By the time that bane was running off, the mob was at 1bub or so, and then Pox would usually run off around 1/2 bub or so.<br />
<br />
When I am soloing there, I am self buffed with my usual FoS, ac, agi, sta, Rage (someone please sell me their VoTB...) and a MR buff and KEI.  Self buffed, and with the food that I use, I am topping usually 1041 ac and 2684 hp with SS boots on, or 1037 ac and 2704 hp with my 19ac 9 sta boots (the name escapes me).  <br />
<br />
I am killing one after the other and do not ever have any downtown for the most part.  Only time I remember having to stop for a second was when the stupid pathing brought in two adds and I was forced to root then for a few min while I dotted thme and got dog dog back to me.  With torporing and canniing during the battle, I usually end up the fight with near full mana and hp.<br />
<br />
Not sure how I can increase my kill rate...other than use the epic when i get it.  I will try to experiment though and also figure out if this is the best place for me to remain grinding out aaxp until I reach canni 5.  I am not flagged yet and I guess that I just haven't had the patience yet to sit there in PoJ for hours at a time and not do anything looking for a group.  I have failed probably a total of 8 times already, so it's kinda annoying to just sit there.  But, if I want to gain aaxps quicker, that is what I might have to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Torpor makes a big difference in this camp; but kraggs is better than nothing.  I did this when I had torpor, but no other AA's besides the minimum leading to canni 5.<br />
<br />
What I did, to earn canni 5, the safest way--you might have to adapt without torpor-- is pull with slow.  The shroom starts casting on me, which makes doggy run to him.  If the shroom is still in the patch, I'm screwed; suddenly six shrooms are on dog, then on me.  So I park dog a ways away from the patch.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on incoming, I cast epic.  The shroom screwing around casting spells usually gives me enough time; I get many more interrupts when he's actually stopped casting and finally run up to me.  <br />
<br />
Then I cast pox and plague.  I canni and get a bit of mana back.  When mob is at half health, I pull another.  Dog will generally stay on the first one and finish it.  When the second one is half health, I pull another.  I JBB and canni whenever I can, just using my judgment.  Torpor(kraggs, whatever) comes in when necessary.<br />
<br />
When I got in my rhythm, I would generally keep three on me at once.  It takes a good bit more concentration in the ghetto gear I had -- 2400 fully self-buffed.  Still, I have done four and even five at that level before, and at one point remember doing seven when I had an insanely messed up train from some noob ranger running around aggroing junk.<br />
<br />
Anything over three takes a great deal of concentration in comparison.<br />
<br />
The reason for doing multiples, as someone indicated, is that your heals can be fast enough to keep up with the damage of multiple shrooms unless they get multiple 200's on you with their spells -- by the way, they shroom a LOT more than they used to, by far.  The camp has become far more difficult lately.  <br />
<br />
Another reason, though, is that you want to keep those spots empty and working on their respawn.  Then go pull some other patch maybe. :) Sometimes it's worth putting a real strain on yourself and killing at a pace that is uncomfortable for you if it means you'll get the maximum number of mobs that are around and eliminate downtime.  FG can be crowded at times, but often there is a patch here or there that is unmolested.  The faster you kill your mobs, the quicker you can go get the extras before others kill THEIR mobs.  Better that you're busting your own chops should give you a shot at extra mobs and exp/hour than that you take it easy and sit around with nothing to do.</div></div><hr />
