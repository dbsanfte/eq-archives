<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't have time to play my twinks anymore, so I sold off their gear, bought malo, and now i have about 50k sitting around that I am not sure what to do with.<br />
<br />
I am 60, have jbb, fungi, and most of my spells.<br />
<br />
However my alchemy is at 0.  I am in a guild that doesn't raid all the time, but we raid a couple times a week.  We don't have anyone that can make the more advanced potions, and i was thinking about working my alchemy up.  I am not interested in making money with the trade skill, but i dont want to drop 20k in it, if it won't be of ANY use to anybody.  BTW, I don't consider making sow potions for my guilds alts to be usefull either.  Are the damage shield/gate/clarity/resist potions worth it?<br />
<br />
I guess the other option would be to go for one of the mid range horses.  I don't spend enough time outdoors to take use of the meditate advantage they give, but it would probably be worth it if they offer a noticable increase in travel speed, how fast are they?<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions on what I should spend this on, or should I just save it for a rainy day?<br />
<br />
I'll place a link to my magelo at the bottom of the page.  Feel free to look over it and give your input, but I am not spending 50k on one item unless its going change my play style drastically, and I don't want to spend 10k on 5 items that are trivial for me to camp by myself or with a group of friends.<br />

EDIT: trying to keep this from being an equipment help post as I can use the search feature on allakazams pretty easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ummm... one that leaps out at me, get a Lodizals shield (30K) or a camp in Iceclad.  There may be better choices, but thats one that I'd do first thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont buy anything but the ghetto horse.  Its a waste of money, and you can sow/lev yaself so who cares how slow ole &quot;glue&quot; is. <br />
<br />
Alchemy is sorta useful...mainly for low level twinks honestly. ITU potions are awesome to have tho. Gate potions are just an added perk. Ever need to get to seb quick? Fire up a field of bone potion and you are just 3 zones away. <br />
<br />
I'd get a stone idol (no drop from ME for ya range (more ac and wis) ) - crystal spider eyes or death mask of the something or other (UP) for the face slot. Otherwise you in pretty good shape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">0 hp on lodi shield, - never catch me wearing one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could buy a ready made Solstice Earring kit - about 12-15k on my server - nice earring :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Getting help twith he solstice earing now,<br />
<br />
Lodi shield doesnt have enough hp,<br />
<br />
Anyone know how much money you have to spend on a horse to get a faster than level 60 sow one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Earring: Solstice (buy)<br />
Earring: Electrum Black Sapphire<br />
Neck: 7/6 talisman (camp, get faction in arena after if you have to)<br />
Face: Mask of War (buy), Enshrouded Veil<br />
Finger: Shadel Bandit Ring (camp)<br />
Range: Talisman of Benevolence (camp), Paebala Fetish (camp)<br />
<br />
A good goal to aim for is 2k hp unbuffed, with Canni5 discipline and Torpor. That's about the only playstyle modifying thing I can think of that you still need.<br />
<br />
Not sure if Alchemy is worth it. I've gone a few months without using it at all on occasion. I'm starting to see a bit of a return of investment by afk selling gate potions in the bazaar... but this also makes the low end market very competitive. Your call there really.</div></div><hr />
