<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Martial Arts/regen scrapper .... I like him but all of his attacks are kicks... so does anyone know of any good H2H side pool powers I can toss on him to move it around a bit?<br />
<br />
Is boxing any good at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Power pool attacks will never do as much damage as a secondary attack (like the Tanker secondaries), nevermind a scrapper primary.<br />
<br />
They can add nice bonus effects, like the knockdown/end fly in Air Superiority.<br />
<br />
I've heard many good things about Tough and Weave in the Fighting pool, and Boxing would be a good way to ladder up into those. Disorient attacks are always nice...and since the damage isn't going to rock your world, you can slot it up with enhanced disorient to make that side of the attack more effective.<br />
<br />
My scrapper can't take power pool attacks because I use Broadsword, and any power pool attack puts the weapon away, forcing me to waste time re-drawing it when I use a primary attack again. I have Air Superiority on my Controller, and it works quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Generally you only want to take pool powers that offer you something you can't get with your primary/secondary power set.  I know what you mean about not having any fist attacks, though.  As a DM scrapper, all of my attacks are punches and I get no kicks.  A power pool kick (jump kick I think) would give me a kick attack, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as effective as a primary power attack.  If you were a controller or something and for some reason wanted a melee attack, it wouldn't be a bad choice though.</div></div><hr />
