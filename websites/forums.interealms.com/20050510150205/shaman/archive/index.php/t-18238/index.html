<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone eals noticed that the aggro in Ldon seems to be a bit tempermental.<br />
You can stand close to a mob, just out of aggro range.  Just to have it aggro<br />
the the second you target it. Same thing with spells your standing there with<br />
the mob targeted and nothing. Start to cast a spell on it and here it comes. I<br />
have also had mobs aggro when they shouldnt during a fight. Mob is pulled I slow<br />
it, the tank has aggro and it has not touched me. Mob hits 80% I &quot;start&quot; to cast<br />
bane and the mob runs over and starts smacking me.<br />
 <br />
This dosent happen all or even part of the time. But it has happened enugh to<br />
make me wonder if there is a bug with aggro. Basicly what happens is. You get<br />
hate points when you start to cast the spell. Then you get hate points agine<br />
when the spell lands or is resisted. This would make for 2X the hate points that<br />
you should have recived for the spell. This couldbe why there is that one mob<br />
that tries to plant your butt into the dirt. Even tho you have done nothing<br />
diffrent from the other mobs that have been pulled. You could possably also be<br />
getting aggro each time you retarget the mob. <br />
 <br />
Like lastnight in a hard Ldon adventure. We was fighting mob 1 at the door to<br />
the room. I had the mob targeted casting a nuke or two till it hit 20%. Standing<br />
in the same spot for the whole fight. I targeted the next mob in the room.<br />
Becuse I knew the pal was going to pull soon and I could be ready with malos.<br />
Has soon has I targted mob 2 it aggroed and aggroed mob 3. So now I have two 900<br />
hitters comeing down on me like a train. They ignor the meles that are finishing<br />
off mob 1 and proceed to chase me all over the place till the meles could get<br />
them off. My hp's never droped below 50%. That was simply way to much aggro from<br />
only targeting the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few things come to mind.<br />
<br />
Proximity agro. There is a chance that if you are closer to the mob then anyone else you will get agro. This is more likely to happen when the mob in question was pulled with proximity agro and not a spell cast on it by the puller. Another case where this could happen is if the mob has been rooted. If a mob is rooted it will agro whoever is closest to it.<br />
<br />
Healing agro. Did you at any time heal anyone during the fight? <br />
<br />
I have never had a mob agro me just for targeting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You sure that mob wasn't rooted?   Alot of times in adventures I aggro pull with root (which can last up to 3 minutes).  The rooted mob will not aggro others in the room until after it paths out to the party, maybe that is what happened.<br />
<br />
However I have noticed the odd mob that hates me way more than it should, so I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I get hit once when I'm casting all the time just to interupt me.  I had hear somewhere that when you are in the middle of casting the agro is treated like you are sitting, but I am not sure that is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So if you begin casting in a BoT tower 'pull' (5-6 mobs) you'll aggro every mob on to you? It doesnt happen. Prox is my first thought, rooted mobs perhaps. Any other previous dots on mob? A tick of damage may just bring you onto the top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
Targetting the next mob and it aggroing is quite inconceivable. The mob will have been pushed into assist range, and therefore will add. Ever used Assidious Vision? Can move form target to targets eye's, most of the way through an open dungeon if your lucky. No aggro at all. <br />
<br />
Someone already mentioned healing aggro. I _think_ it also applies to hp buffs as well. Ive known a pulled mob to suddenly change interest in tank onto me for focusing (HP increase?) the tank as it was pulled.<br />
<br />
Your were nuking a low hp mob. Nukes contain a knockback effect (noticable when you get nuked as well). This probably also helped it get in range of the other adds.<br />
<br />
Edit: &gt; and &lt; dont work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have had this happen to me many times.  It's always while I'm casting, and it does seem like the monster is attacking me just to interrupt me, even if I haven't even cast anything on it yet.  I've had monsters beating away on the tank and I hit my cannibalize hotkey at around 80% health (not low  health aggro) and the monster turns arround to smack me just in time to interrupt my cannibalize, then he turns right back around to the fight. <br />
<br />
Perhaps they have put new code in the ai so monsters try to interrupt player casters when on the hate list and attempting to cast?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds to me like you are within aggro range and just don't realise it. A mob will only aggro from proxomity on a tick. You walked within aggro range of the mob, stood there a second, began casting, and NOW the tick happens. You are within aggro range so the mob aggros. If you want to be absolutely sure that you are not within the aggro range of a mob, stop and wait 7 seconds and see if it aggros, otherwise you don't know for sure.<br />
<br />
Targeting a mob does not give any aggro. Beginning to cast a spell does not give any aggro. Finishing the cast of a spell gives aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The mob wasnt rooted it had its back to us. And if it had been rooted mob 3 would have aggroed at that time. It was problly 10 to 15 seconds after I casted my last nuke befor I targeted mob 2. So I doubt it was becuse of the nukes. Has for proximity aggro I had been standing in the same spot for the whole fight. Why didnt it aggro sooner? The mob clearly aggroed on me when I targeted and came after me.<br />
<br />
Mobs aggroing when targeted is actully old. I rember the skeles doing it a lot in HS back in the day. I have also seen some green cons do this. You can stand right infront of them and they dont aggro till you target them. You can test this in ldon by going up to a door and just stand there looking at the next mob for 3-4 seconds. No aggro. Target it and it aggros. And its not all and every mob it just happens from time to time.<br />
<br />
With the casting aggro I am not saying that just becuse you start to cast a spell every mob aggro you. What I am talking about is this..<br />
Mob is pulled to camp<br />
You slow it, tank holds aggro and the mob dosent come after you.<br />
you wait 5-6 seconds<br />
You start to cast heal/DoT/Nuke/ what ever<br />
Mob runs over and slaps you 1-2 times then runs back to the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've played this game a long time and I can say without the slightest hesitation, mobs do not aggro you if you target them, nor do they aggro you when you start to cast. There is no code in the game that causes a mob to try to interrupt when it sees that you are about to cast a spell.<br />
 You got aggro some other way. There are too many ways to try and list them all. Just think about what else you are doing at the time and you will see what the true cause was.</div></div><hr />

That being said this a phenomenon I have verified in Seru.  While farming shards I would pull the guards sitting in the windows.  I would get line of sight on them and wait.  No aggro.  As soon as I hit my hotkey the bugger would run at me.<br />

I'll just repeat what I posted earlier:<br />

If you want to be absolutely sure that you are not within the aggro range of a mob, stop and wait 7 seconds and see if it aggros, otherwise you don't know for sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ran upto crazed gobbo camp and stopped - no aggro.&quot; YET<br />
<br />
&quot;I would get line of sight on them and wait. No aggro.&quot; YET<br />
<br />
Next time you try that, count to 11 without doing anything. See if you can get past 6 without the mob aggroing on you.<br />
<br />
Your client only updates position data with the server every 6 seconds, on the server heartbeat. You could walk right THROUGH a mass of mobs without getting aggro as long as you moved into and out of aggro range *between* server heartbeats. <br />
<br />
If your client only tells the server where you are every 6 seconds, how is the server going to know that you have moved into aggro range of a mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I believe that's true Graal. And I am guessing is that what happens is when you target a mob you force an update before the normal proximity check. However, I wonder if targeting a mob also causes them to be more &quot;aware&quot; of you. It could just be a side effect but still. I never cared anough to play around but you could test this by standing near a mob but not near enough for it to aggro for more than 11 seconds and then target mob and see if it aggros. I suspect that some mobs will aggro and some will not depending on what they are, level differential, location, etc. All theory and not one I feel like testing but if someone is ambitious...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I dont buy the whole tick deal. If that was the case you could just time the tick and run by red cons with no aggro.<br />
<br />
But the mob becomeing more aware of you when you target it makes more since. It seems to happen when you are right on the eadge of aggro range. So it woudl fit that targeting the mob exstends the aggro range out from the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Could be it Graal hence the question mark in my post, I wasnt sure. Ill try it again with the eleven second delay and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The tick idea does make some sense to me, as I have on occasion scooted right by a mob(with no invis on) and it did not aggro on me - and it was a DB mob.  Not sure about the targeting...I have not paid a great deal of attention as to WHEN a mob aggros me, and if it is only an occasional thing as has been posted, it will be difficult to test it, but I will be paying attention to see if that does happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can scoot right by hostile mobs with no aggro, if you have big balls, FD, or don't care about dying/training when you inevitably @$#! it up. However, it is such a pita that no one really uses it to try and 'tic invis'. You have a less than 6 second window to go from one end of a mobs proximity range to the other, the higher the mobs level in relation to yours the longer you have to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've seen this personally in LDoN.  We'll be beating down a mob.  I'll be well away from it and start to cast a spell, and it will run over and smack me, then turn back on the tank.<br />
<br />
From what I've figured out, it's because I'm second on the hate list (slow really ticks them off).  They must have added a &quot;casting&quot; modifier to the hate list, which jumps me to the top.  It runs over, hits me, and the &quot;casting&quot; modifier is removed (since it just hit me to attempt an interrupt), so it goes back to whoever was at the top of the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I did a little test lastnight befor raid. I had loged out in Nro so I just uesed one of the guards there for this. I wired my /loc button to my up arrow key then started sneaking up on the guard. He aggroed at 3510. The second time I targeted the guard and started inching up on him agine. He aggroed at 3517 the second time. It problly is that the mob becomes more aware of you being there when you have them targeted. Kinda like that prickly feeling on the back of your neck. That someone is watching you.. :P<br />
<br />
I gave some thought to the whole aggro on a tick deal. What I think is happening there is that it is indirect. You get the aggro after the server updates your possition. Not from aggro being on a tick cycel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've noticed this before outside of LDoN a couple times:<br />
<br />
A new shaman in my guild tagged General Reparm with malos before the tank had tagged with an arrow and was killed as quickly as possible.  I started casting malos as well, but ducked and interrupted because the tank still hadn't engaged with an arrow.  Raperman ran past at least half a dozen people, and killed me second, even though I hadn't completed casting.  Looking back on it I suppose I could have gotten aggro from buffing someone on inc, but I don't think that was the case.<br />
<br />
When camping an item recently, I pulled the same mob every ~30 minutes at least a dozen times.  I had to move fairly close to get line of sight in order to cast, but the aggro radius of mobs in the Hole is small, and I never once got aggro before I started casting.  Every single time however, the mob aggrod before the spell landed.  This situation is extremely repeatable because if you don't wedge yourself into a corner you'll get the &quot;You cannot see your target.&quot; message.  I'll go back and test this one to verify that I wasn't getting delayed proximity aggro.<br />
<br />
Edit: Evidently, it was proximity aggro that I saw in the hole after all.  I would still get aggro without casting at all when I moved into the corner and waited several seconds insted of casting right away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He called me codeboy.  :rolleyes: <br />
I've never, ever, gotten aggro from targeting a mob. I've never, ever gotten aggro from starting to cast on a mob. I do LDoN all the time with multiple mobs coming in, and multiple mobs on the tanks and never have a problem with aggro. Everyone gets hit from time to time, maybe you are closer to the mob, or have done more to make him hate you. I target mobs on inc as soon as I possibly can, and have never had a mob jump on me or any other caster for any reason other than the ones that have already been documented.<br />
Try a solo camp where the mobs are packed in tight and you can just single pull with slow. If there is a new aggro script for the mobs, you should be getting aggro before your spell goes off, even before that if the &quot;mob aggroes when targeted&quot; thing is true.<br />
If there was some new mob scripting put into the game, lets see some proof of it. This sounds like a lot of posts you see on message boards where someone sees something they don't understand, makes up a hypothesis about it and puts it out there. If this is true it should be making a big difference in how we all play the game. There is no difference in how I play the game, so I just don't see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">thRover/Ggoomba - I am 100% positive I have gotten aggro from targeting a mob. Review the above and try it yourself, I bet you find the same thing. When I say target, I don't mean something half a mile away, I mean something on the edge of aggro range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What about the Naggy example and the 52 level limit. If there was no aggro untill the spell landed (and then succeeded or resisted) the spell could potentially land, and THEN naggy boots you from the zone. I was under the impression that Naggy aggrod you as you were casting, decided you were over 52, and decided to boot you from the zone. Is this incorrect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually I have tried casting on Naggy before, it isn't that he aggroes as you are casting the spell, he boots you as soon as the spell would have landed and the spell has no effect/never lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Another slightly related thing I've noticed. In certain zones I've noticed the mere act of using /pet attack sends the mob running straight at me. I mostly notice this while farming silks or something. My non sow'd pet will be very very far away from me. I'll /pet attack it on something and the mob will run straight at me and beat on me for several seconds until my pet finally catches up to me and whacks it. I'm not lagged, my pet is no where near close enough to taunt or anything and he obviously didn't cast a ranged spell on the mob to aggro it. I've noticed this on non aggro and aggro mobs alike.<br />
<br />
As for target aggro. I haven't really done extensive testing, but for years I&quot;ve gotten in &quot;near&quot; aggro range and targeted a mob, sometimes even /hailing the mobs(as silly as it sounds). To me placebo or not, it seems to trigger a proximity pull from further away than usual. I always preferred to think it forced the server to update your position and check the mobs aggro. Either way, never really noticed spell casting aggro in an already pulled mob that was odd. I&quot;m guessing the melee got out of melee range for a tick or something that made the mob possibly check its second most hated foe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Watch your screen for &quot;Taunting attacker master&quot;  it seems that pets have a ranged taunt. I have seen that happen meny times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Ok, I tested this myself last night. I went to Qeynos where I'm deeply KOS. I tried proximity aggo on the 2 guards at the city entrance. Then I went back and tried moving up with one targeted, and periodically starting casts. ONLY when I got into proximity aggro range did they come at me. I learned the exact spot I needed to stand on, and you know what I found? <br />
<br />
The last time I did the test I went in with nothing targeted, got just to the proximity aggro range and stood for just a second, no aggro, I just started reaching out my cursor to target the nearest guard and they both came at me. No spell casting, I didn't have time to get him targeted, but if I had been just a fraction of a second faster, it would have looked exactly like they had come because I had targeted one of them. This is why you think targeting, or casting causes it. It takes the same amount of time to target or to start a cast if he is already targeted as it takes the game to realize your within proximity aggro range.<br />
Lets just put this one to bed. I can understand how you may get it into your head that they aggro because of something you happen to be doing at the time, but it simply is not the case. I haven't been trying to insult anyone, or set myself up as smarter in any way, just trying dispell one of those bits of misinformation that gets passed along for no good reason. :)</div></div><hr />

Back when I played my monk you could spam /con to get otherwise unpullable mobs to attack (the alcove bat(s) in solb for example) because it apparently forces the server to update position and check aggro, its possible with the new targetting circle changes that targetting certain mobs/mobs in certain zones is acting the same way /con used to/does, forcing the server to update your position and do an aggro check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Just a thought, but quite a while ago I reading up on a quest that required invising past some mobs and it was mentioned not to target them as this can cause them to aggro you, can't remember where it was though.<br />

Also on the other side of the debate, canni creates aggro and this is what I've seen from having mobs switch to me when all I'm doing in canni-ing and this is at about 80%&gt; health, so that could have got you up the aggro list</div></div><hr />

I have seen this to. If you watch you will see &quot;Taunting attacker master&quot; it would seem that pets have ranged taunt.</div></div><hr />

Something that I noticed when playing my mage, that I never really dwelt upon, is that if I am standing within melee range of a mob, (only really noticed this in LDoN) regardless of how long I have been stood there, as soon as I start to cast my first spell, the mob will hit me once and imediately return to the tank.  This has happened more than once and I do not believe that everytime I cast it just happens to coincide with the &quot;server tick&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, back to the pet agro thing, I have noticed that if I am not stood up and I sent my pet in, the mob will agro me.  If this is the result of my pets taunt, then why doesnt it attack my pet, taunt is after all supposed to help you pet hold agro, not for it to pass agro to me.<br />
<br />
I am using my mage as examples as a shaman has more complex agro issues due to slowing on inc. <br />
<br />
Personally I think it would be a more realistic reaction for a mob to respond to a player starting to cast until its attention is totally focused on the tank.<br />

These are just observations, they may mean Jack, but I thought I would post them anyway =)</div></div><hr />
