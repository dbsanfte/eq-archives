<br />
I did weaponry trial last night &amp; cleric brought out their hammer. I said what the hell &amp; buffed it with Leapord. Whould their hammer get procs. if so this is awesome. Did not get a chance to aske the cleric &amp; they probably have all that spam turned off anyways??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does it have the Craxy proc rate of a pet or the proc rate of a regular player?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thay proc on clr hammer but it dose not proc on any rnaged attach IE bow's or throwing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cleric hammer seems to proc as much as puppy, who seems to proc a little less than Necro pets who seem to proc less than mage pets. I'll parse this over the next few days to make sure, though - I don't like 'feeling' things out with data to back it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well, the spell already has a crazy proc rate, so its pretty safe to say that there is alot to say as far as how weapon proc rates affect this spell.<br />
<br />
one thing to note is that leopard stacks with innate weapon procs. I have had several instances of leopard procing with a proc of my normal weapon simultaneously. actually have a screenshot or two around somewhere, will edit this post when I get home with it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: promised SS<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes I've had my lifetap go off with leopard. Have had other procs go off at the same time as leopard too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No reason why it wouldnt, imbued procs go off simaeltaneously with weapon procs all the time.<br />
<br />
I plan to add the permafrost 150DD on my Staff of Eternal Flames, with SoL and then rabid bear... 400DD/150DD/~400DD/35DD procs ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get the 150 fire dd from RSS.  Same size damage, no points cost, on the resist that your weapon is already on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice, Urdegish, that is about my dream shaman melee scenario.  I'm maxxing out the Spell Casting Fury line not for our wimpy DDs, but for the rain series and the fun of critting while meleeing.<br />
<br />
In your case that would be 800DD/300DD/810/70DD max possible...that is until Destructive Fury...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>duddyfunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used this spell on my pet dueling, and I am unstoppable, have yet to loose a duel to any class since i got this spell (not that I did before) but now, I kill people twice as fast, and the proc is good for interupting peoples spells.  Seems to be procing for 389 on PC's and 405 on NPC's.  Casting this spell on all fast melee swingers about doubles the raids DPS since the proc rate is amazing!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chukara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like stacking this with my Hammer of Hours, aug'd with the Veintapper stone, plus the disease stun from Symbol of the Planesmasters, for a total potential 750/75/75/405.<br />
<br />
One of these days when I get around to putting AAs in crit spell damage I'll see about screenshotting some big nasty procs. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm maxxing out the Spell Casting Fury line not for our wimpy DDs, but for the rain series  <br />
<br />
Yeah, Malosinia combined with the new PR/DR debuff is hella fun with rains, chain casting both and critting say 3 out of 6 times is fun to watch ;)<br />
<br />
p.s. not 69 so no RSS for meee :)</div></div><hr />
