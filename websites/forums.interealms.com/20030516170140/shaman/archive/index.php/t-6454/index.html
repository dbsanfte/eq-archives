<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im looking to equip a few alts with a Ikky BP. I know where they are , but im not sure how the cycle works , how often they drop and so on and so fourth.<br />
<br />
So i can solo my warriors alone , also for my GF mostly , she loves her warrior , but cant stand the down time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ikky BP are usually to be had at a rate of one to two per evening play.  You definitely need a tracker, bard or ranger prefereably.  The pulls can be kind of long, and druids die too often on the way due to adds.<br />
After each forager dies you have about a one in five chance that a named mob will pop, and about a one in 20 chance that it will be the crusader.  Get a list of named mobs, e. g. from Allak, and have your tracker check frequently.<br />
Other decent loot on the forager cycle include the hangman's noose and the shm-only necklace from the large sabertooth tiger.<br />
Full group of high 40's or three 55's can do the cycle without downtime.</div></div><hr />

Just kill foragers and the named until you get Crusader Zoglic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The named spawns can be streaky too. I've gone hours without a named then get 4 or 5 in an hour. <br />
Don't know if you could exactly call that farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The normal ph's are a froglok forager and a froglok hunter (you want to kill the forager btw) and they walk one of three paths<br />
<br />
1. Along the northern zonewall from the ej ent towards the sonh ent<br />
<br />
2. West of the lake and along a north/south line<br />
<br />
3. South of the lake in a west/east line all the way towards seb, follow the wall if nothing else.<br />
<br />
Once you kill a ph or a namned then another (ph/named) will pop directly along one of these routes, so the faster you kill the greater your chance of a decent drop.<br />
<br />
I prefer to pull towards the northern edge of the lake just below the little house with birds where the little stream lets out into the lake (nothing wanders by).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thank you so much for your input . 1 final post i believe will do.<br />
<br />
what is the minimal group you would take . how often is it camped on your server. Finaly , you think this idea is even worth it for  a 1-30 warrior/sk/melee.  maybe i shoul djust sell these and make regen potions ? Would help my skill in alchemy :-x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did it at 52 with a 55 ranger. Foragers arent hard but we on occasion would get two named in a row and if that happens you will get down time unless you have decent dps. <br />
<br />
The key to farming bps is to kill the foragers fast. They are on an (essentialy) instant repop so the faster you kill the better chance you have. We got two bps in two nights. The iskar mask and iky bp are the best items in the cycle. The haste belt is decent for sub-dragon haste but is no-drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here's the thing, you have to get a bard that knows the spawn pts and have them on a cycle.  <br />
<br />
We had a chick that knew the exact loc of the hunter/forager and like Conas says they are essentialy instant repop.  She would run past the hunter/forager for agro and loop back to us, we'd pull off the H/F and what ever adds she had (at most 2 typically none).  She wouldnt even stop but just keep blazing with her seleos, or what ever, and head straight back to the spawn pts and by the time she got there she'd have them again.  The H/F are lvl 45 every time so the lvl 60 rogue we had with us (my rogue was only 30 so this was way way back in the day) with Boon of Garu was Assassinating most of these before anyone could land a boom.<br />
<br />
The xp flew and the named mobs popped up very fast, only did it 1 night but we came away with 5 regen bp, let tons of the Fang Amulets rot, and we were shouting if class armor dropped that none of us could use.<br />
<br />
Get a tracker that is willing to spend some time learning the spawn pts and you'll mop up the gear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wow 5 in 1 night , thats like 30k rofl, well on my server.<br />
<br />
well , ok thank you all very much again, this was massivly helpful :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">there are about 5 spawn spots for the forager, most are close to the stream that goes into the lake but one is close to the city.<br />
<br />
I used to camp this a lot with a 57 druid and it was easy though you had to be careful or people would steal the nameds if you were medding. Rarely got adds and just rooted them, i certainly never died to any add, in fact never died to anything there.</div></div><hr />
