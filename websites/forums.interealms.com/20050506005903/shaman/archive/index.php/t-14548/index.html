<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else having problems with their Spell Book poofing on them?   Both my RL wife's Ranja and myself can't keep spell books open for any period of time without it poofing without any warning.   We don't have lag or any other problems ... it just disappears on us.   Makes it really hard to mem spells ... esp after deaths.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's a result of the new 'save' spell options?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am having the same issues.  Generally, it seems to happen right after I mem a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's happening to everyone.  I have no idea what causes it or triggers it.</div></div><hr />

It is annoying.  I would guess that it is related to the new saved spell scripts that have been recently introduced.<br />
<br />
While I love loading my &quot;Rezsolo&quot;, &quot;Raidrez&quot;, &quot;Raidbuff&quot;, &quot;Combat1&quot;, etc setups, I still find myself forgetting to use them much of the time.  Old habits die hard I guess.<br />
<br />
It is very irritating to be on a page in your book and just have it close on you for no reason.  It isn't a shaman specific problem either btw.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haledin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I submitted a bug report about this a while ago. It can be kind of annoying. Hopefully ironed out soon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeap was having the same problem... but I am really loving the new quick spell drop down list for memming spells. No more spell book maintenance for quickly finding &amp; memming spells.<br />
<br />
I still find myself occasionally opening the spell book forgetting to use the drop down menu, but with getting very comfortable with the location of spells in the drop down menu, opening the spell book takes me twice as long to mem a spell now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only time I use the drop down type menus are on twinks.   My shaman spell book is something I've used so much I know exactly where every spell is and have most all my most used spells in extremely easy to access spots.   But for my wizard I love the new drop downs so I can find the correct nukes, I leveled him fairly fast and just can't keep track of which spells are which type and the most powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been having this same problem...and I was really wondering if it was just me or problems with my UI...until I saw someone in the shaman channel mention it today too. <br />
<br />
Really, it kinda pisses me off when this happens, cause it always happens to me at bad times.  I had it happen to me today when I clicked on my Raid Buffing list...it got about halfway through the list then just clicked out of it.  Then I of course got distracted for a sec...totally forgetting that I hadn't finished memming spells...and ended up not having slow up when someone attacked us cause of it.  Very painful and it sucked.<br />
<br />
Patch coming out tomorrow though...hope that they fix it then.  Would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Working fine for me.<br />
<br />
It took me a while to get used to the fact that when you mem a spell from the spell list it will make you sit down and then stand right back up again after the spell has been memmed. But other than that, I think it's a beautiful thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Happening with me too.  I /bugged it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I used one of the buff macros I setup and it stopped once after it mem'd 3 spells.  I then clicked the macro again and it finished the others.  The book just poofed after the 3rd one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bilanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Happens to me on both my Shaman and my Cleric. Its SO annoying</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Buffrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good glad I'm not the only one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the book isn't poofing... you're standing up.<br />
at least that's what's causing it for me.<br />
<br />
Random standing up.. has happened while camping and while I was medding my druid, while afk.  Came back and he was standing up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with Jaradis though, I can find a spell in my spell book much faster than I can find it in the menus.<br />
<br />
<br />
They are nice for bots/twinks though.  Especially when botting ppl that have a spell book arranged by something retarded like... pretty icons.  /whimper</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yup, thought it was just me till last night when I started askin peeps if they were bugged too.  Turns out quite a few have experienced the same.<br />
<br />
/em keeps his fingers crossed for the next patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It is the spellbook closing itself randomly. Of course this will cause you to stand up if you opened the spellbook from a standing position.<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter if you're memming a spell or just staring at the book, it can close itself on a whim. Ever since the recent patch where they added the Spell Context Menus and Spell Favorites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The ranjah's did it ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Perhaps they are unrelated problems then, but on more than one occassion since the last patch one of my characters has stood up, while I was AFK in POT during a regular /camp.  Spellbooks were closed.<br />
<br />
Similarly, my boxdruid was medding up after dying last night.  He was sitting in POK with his spell book closed.  I got up from the computers and went to take a shower and get ready for bed.  I returned to camp him out and he was no longer sitting and only had about half his mana.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I also experienced a lot of unintended spell book closings.<br />
But I also had a similar bug with the trade window, it poofed 3 times in a row right after i put money in it - ok this saved me some plats for a rez since the cleric was as irritated as i was but anyway it's annoying...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Perhaps they are unrelated problems then, but on more than one occassion since the last patch one of my characters has stood up, while I was AFK in POT during a regular /camp.

<br />
Seems to me that it is a standing up bug, as I haven't seen the problem, but I spend alot of my time on a mount and so a standing up problem wouldn't effect me.  Of course I could just be lucky.<br />

Patch = Fix some things, break others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">has anyone had thier spellbook update itsell and gett any spells you didnt buy yet for whatever reason up to your curent level?
