<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 55 Iksar Shaman who usually root/rots, but sometimes I like a change of pace want to melee. I'll be more inclined to do this now that I don't have to outdamage my pet, too.<br />
<br />
I've maxed piercing, but my 2HB is woeful, so I can't test this very well myself: will I be more effective using my Granite Face Grinder (29/36 2hb) or using my Rune Etched Icewurm Fang (12/19) with Sarnak Battle Shield (25ac)? <br />
<br />
Notice I said &quot;more effective&quot;, not do more damage. I'm giving up a lot of AC with the 2hb. My AC either way is in the 800s, though.<br />
<br />
Also, I have a FBSS on another char and never thought about moving it to my shaman, but if I were able to do significant damage with the GFG, should I swap out my Flayed Turmoilskin Belt for melee time?<br />
<br />
I apologize for asking these questions instead of trying them out myself and parsing the logs, but I always like hearing other shaman's opinions and besides, I'm at work and have nothing better to do. =) Thanks in advance for your opinions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GFG + FBSS is just amazing damage output.<br />
<br />
I used this combo all the time untill 45 when the JBB came to life and habitualy killed exp mobs with only mele damage.  Mana went to slow, haste, buffs and healing.  Damage came from da hammer.<br />
<br />
Mez was smaking for as much as 118 but my magic number was at 88 (most common damage amount) if I remember.<br />
<br />
FBSS substitue for FTB is an easy YES.  This has a greater impact on overall performance then just the ~20 improvement in damage output becuase it shortens fights (less damage taken).<br />
<br />
Don't think shaman get any weapon damage bonuses so the comparison for damage output is all about ratio and weapon skill.  If you get your 2hb skill to the same lvl as your pierce then GFG should outdamage REIF discounting proc.  The ony way to know for sure is try both.<br />
<br />
If mez not have da JBB then I would still be smaking with the GFG and I would not have given my FBSS to the guild equipment mule.<br />
<br />
Lots of factors to consider.<br />
REIF Proc<br />
Change in AC<br />
Repost from Mob.<br />
Caster mob and interups.<br />
<br />
The two setups could be roughly equivalent.<br />
<br />
I think I would  give REIF a guud try again casters.  GFG probably better against mele.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">REIF hits fast, GFG hits HARD.<br />
<br />
the FBS gives you what... 38 AC? thats a helluva lot of AC, and deffinately needs to be taken into consideration.  <br />
<br />
The ability to do a helluva lotta damage w/ 2hb's is always very fun, and if thats what you want go for it.<br />
I personally suggest you try to max out 2hb, and then see what you like better.  Since iksars cant use JBB, it might be worth it to use the GFG</div></div><hr />
