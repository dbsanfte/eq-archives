<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ridgewall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what lvl 39 spells are worth getting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ridgewall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">someone help me out plz!!!!! : (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">These are the ones I bought:<br />
<br />
Resist Poison<br />
Chloroplast<br />
Deftness<br />
Furious Strength <br />
Glamour<br />
Venom of the Snake<br />
Togor's Insects<br />
Insidious Malady<br />
Vigilant Spirit<br />
Tumultuous Strength *Dropped Spell from Velious*<br />
Spirit of Bih'Li *Bought in Luclin at the Shaman Spell vendors*<br />
<br />
Also working on the Canni II quest, if I could just find a Yun Shaman!!!!<br />
<br />
I also bought the Gaurdian Spirit spell while I was in WK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">pet <br />
togors<br />
venom of the snake<br />
chroloplast <br />
<br />
those are the best ones imo.  - and the only super critical ones. <br />
<br />
edit: I also did Canni 2 quest - but with the help of 65 monk and 45 druid.  The spell was worth the 3 / 4 hours it took to complete the quest.<br />
<br />
I also got Bih Li, and group strenght.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Total list of level 39 Shaman spells, in order of importance in my opinion and why I think what I do about them:<br />
<br />
Togor's Insects (better slow = less damage taken)<br />
Vigilant Spirit (Better pet = more damage done)<br />
Chloroplast (Better regen = less need for direct heals and more HP to canny away)<br />
Venom of the Snake (Better poison DoT)<br />
Cannibalize II (Eat yourself faster!)<br />
Spirit of Bih'Li (Group SoW with +ATK. Melees tend to like this spell)<br />
Tumultuous Strength (Group STR)<br />
Deftness (Dex)<br />
Furious Strength (this can probably be skipped, but it is usefull at times to have the single target versions around. especially if you solo alot)<br />
<br />
The spells below here are all quite easy to do without<br />
Blinding Luminance (It is a replacement for Flash of Light. If you regularly use that spell, you might rank this higher than I do)<br />
Resist Poison (You won't be casting this much - by the time Poison resists matter to you, you should have better)<br />
Gale of Poison (Rains are OK, but very situational)<br />
Insidious Malady (Better resists on disease spells is nice, but you will rarely find yourself in a position where the mana cost for this is justified by the resist improvements)<br />
Glamour (OOOHHHH!!!!! Better prices at a vendor)<br />
Extinguish Fatigue (If a melee's STA score is 100+, all an empty yellow bar means is he can't jump, and if his STA isn't 100+ with you around to buff him something is seriously wrong)<br />
Assiduous Vision (Bind sight is only marginally usefull under most circumstances)<br />
Remove Curse (This would rank much higher but it doesn't actually become usefull until somewhere in the 50s).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally, I believe you should get all of your spells if possible. Obviously, some are of more immediate importance than others, so get those first. First and foremost, the slow spell (togor's). If you get only one spell, get that one. Then get the pet and venom of the snake. Both are nice spells. After that, get them as you can. Oh yeah! Try to do the canni 2 quest as soon as you can. You may need help, but the sooner you can get that spell, the better. Don't do like I did and skip it. Canni 1 at level 50 is painful. You've been warned. ;)</div></div><hr />
