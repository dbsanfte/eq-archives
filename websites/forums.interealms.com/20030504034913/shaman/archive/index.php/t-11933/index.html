<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone ever seen more than one drunken pirate in any building? Also I was wondering if killing the other NPC's in the buildings might have an effect on whether or not a pirate with an empty flask spawns or not. I killed about 30 pirates last night without getting a flask, but I've seen worse runs posted on this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had one building with 4 drunken pirates.  I think the mobs in the houses are ph's for each other and a random one can spawn.<br />
<br />
I went through about 30 before getting mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>HaggySB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't seen more than 1 per house myself but then again I didn't have to stay at the drunk houses very long I pull a few mobs and 6 drunken pirates.  On the 6th I got my flask.  After you have the flask the rest is a cake walk. <br />
<br />
Good luck to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was wondering if just killing only the drunken pirate spawns is not as good as strategy as killing any of the npc's in the buildings. When I ran out of drunks, I killed other stuff but never saw more than one drunk in any building.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Murgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">pretty much the same here as well.  there was a building towards the water that had two spawns in it, but they all spawned in the same places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For the 5 levels I've been in Dulaks I've yet to see a drunken pirate pop after a different mob, or ph, was taken out.  The drunks have set spawn spots.  The best area I've seen is along the right wall from the zone in.  There's like 5 spawns, one in each building/shanty and one on a porch.  I don't know how many of the stupid things I killed, but the reward was worth the monotony at least.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a building with more then one in it, but that doesn't mean I've been in every building either :)<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">K gang i have now done this quest twice.  Once for myself and i just MQ ed for a guildy today.  Both times the drunk pirate that dropped the empty bottle was in the building right next to the static spawn standing outside the shanties on the right side of the zonein.  The building next to that static spawn to your left had it.  The first time it took 3 kills for the bottle the 2nd time it was the first kill so i think its very common from this fellow.  I just cleared all the spawns up to the shanties plus the wandering spawns that path by there.  Just camp there and be patient it wont take more than 40 minutes tops.  Or if you have a problem im on the luclin server i would be more than happy to show you where i got the drops at.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">40 min tops?  You've just gotten lucky.  I've done it twice now also.  First time took one kill.  Second time I had a full group there trying to help me get the flask.  We rocked and kept about 9 buildings totally empty and killed all the roamers in the area.  Even with all that, it took us hours to get another flask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think it's been determined the best spot is the 4-5 buildings along the right hand wall after zone in and going in a bit.  Drunks spawn inside of them and a couple outside.  Was there with a full group and kept all the houses plus other spawns emtpy for probably 2 hrs before we got a bottle to drop.  I was with another guild shammy and he let me grab it.  Maybe 2 pirates later another dropped and he was all set.  Seems to be a completely random drop.  The spell is hands down worth all the effort/time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is probably TOTALLY random but i got 2 bottles in a row from the spawn that stands on the steps between the first two houses after the first right hand turn. Doubt any of them have a better chance of dropping it than another but you never know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That was the area I was clearing for that whole time.  That area and more.  We had a whole group of people who were 60+ doing it, so we were able to keep the area clear easily.</div></div><hr />
