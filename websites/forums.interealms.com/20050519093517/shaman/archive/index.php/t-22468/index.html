<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xanier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I have watched this board for a long time. Started playing my Sham at the release of Kunark. I love my sham, never board and always something to do. I love the ability the sham offers to solo. The value, as well they use to bring to groups and in most places still do.<br />
<br />
However, from posts I have read here and things I see in encounters in GoD and probably soon to be OoW we do need something defining. It is my experience that turgurs is becoming pretty much useless and bl's are creeping in as king of slows. I see they get a new slow at lvl 70.  I am not here to gripe and complain because in all honesty I think shamans are one fun class. We are kind of Jack of all trades but we need something more defining for raid / high end content. I would love to see a better slow, or at least a slow that hits better ( I know Balance of Nihili is nice with a neg check but is insane to try to get this spell and many won't ever see it). By mitigating slows they have nullified one of our strongest points.<br />
<br />
So all that to say I would love to see a 75% slow like turgurs with a neg check that is attainable for ALL shamans not just us high enders. And one question would a group DD heal be more useful then a group HoT?  If we got a group lets say 60% or better heal with maybe a semi long reuse we become valuable on raids and valuable to groups.  Pick me apart )  been around a good long while and hate the thought of changing my main but if things don't change in OoW BL here I come lol.  I am optomistic though that they will do something shoot after 4 years they actually fixed (or masked I should say) warrior taunt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Velkoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I personally would suggest a HoT group type spell,not DD....paladins have DD group heals,so a HoT group spell would balance better...most of God encounters have serious AE going so a HoT group spell would do much much better than DD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Group HoT and a lure-slow attainable by all are very good suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just don't me a favor. dont' make it AEable. hahaha.<br />
<br />
i love being able to blow my mgb on raids whenever and not worry bout having to save for CR/paragon/sotw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But making it MGBable would be helpful when you have 5 shamans with MGB on a raid. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, he who is &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot; is better termed &quot;Screwed at everything&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Absolutely not true!  Necros are jacks of more trades than we are, and they aren't screwed at everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Last I heard, even wizards were having problems tapping out thier mana pools going full burn on something (in Gates), hence the viability of Frenzied Devastation. I would think a necro would find even more problems here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I posted this before, but this is what I'd like to see the shaman more like:<br />
<br />
Shaman prime roles:<br />
<br />
1. Increase the damage a mob receives:<br />
----a) Buffing the player<br />
..........i. melee buffs: +attack, +%dmg, +%to hit, strikethrough, etc..<br />
..........ii. caster buffs: focus type effects (mental strength, chance to crit, etc..)<br />
----b) Weakening defense<br />
..........i. help melee hit: reducing AC, agility, etc..<br />
..........ii. help casters hit: reducing resists<br />
<br />
2. Damaging the mob:<br />
----a) Dots: Need a complete overhaul.<br />
..........i. Aggro: Dots should be less aggro than nukes. period.<br />
..........ii. Duration: Suggestion 1) Dots burn mana as they tick, and can run forever if you can keep mana up. Suggestion 2) Dots &quot;splurt&quot; backwards. 800, 500, 200, 100 etc..<br />
----b) Rains/AE: Let this be our &quot;specialty&quot;.<br />
..........i. Reduce the resist rate<br />
..........ii. Increase Variety<br />
__________1) Reintroduce our fire line as a single target 3 wave &quot;nuke&quot; type rain. Highest resist rate, similar to our poison now.<br />
__________2) Buff our poison line. Give it -50pr, increase dmg. 4 target like now.<br />
__________3) Reintroduce disease cloud. True AE, but lower damage, however easiest to land.<br />
----c) Nukes: Bah, let the druids have them<br />
<br />
3. Complimentary healers:<br />
----a) Heal over time<br />
..........i. Largest single target heal over time of any priest.<br />
..........ii. Group Quiessence<br />
----b) Wave healing<br />
..........i. AE Heal in a rain form<br />
..........ii. Single target rain heal.<br />
----c) Weakest direct heals of any priest.<br />
<br />
They can take our slow, cripple, disease dots, and ice nukes and toss them away imo.<br />
<br />
So then we'd have this for priests:<br />
<br />
Cleric: Best fast direct healers and CH, best hp buffs<br />
<br />
Druid: Second best direct healers and CH, best nukes, second best HP buffs<br />
<br />
Shaman: Weakest direct heals but best HoTs to compliment either a cleric or druid, not the best direct damage but more versatile with AE, ability to stack dots on longer battle means we outdamage druids over time, third best hp buffs, but dps increasing player buffs.</div></div><hr />
