<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Swiftraven of The Mystic Order I think it was, a guild on Fennin Ro.  Barb Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya, Swiftraven just didn't win--he dominated.  I'm not 100% sure on this, but I think he was the only one in full Velious armor also.  His pet control was great.</div></div><hr />

k thx bye</div></div><hr />

All &gt; Sorthaz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think he was the only one in full Velious. In fact I'm pretty sure several people had even better gear than him, like Jenamdar and a few others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Torlequin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Swiftraven had full SS armour, yeh. He wasn't the only one with full velious though... I was present for a few of the Fennin matches, Bladefury had almost (if not complete) full SS armour, also guilded in The Mystical Order. I dont remember if there were any full kael shamen there at the time... but they were out there I'm sure ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Prowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did anyone notice any particular stratagies the winners  used during BotB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keep your pet alive, while killing the other person's pet. Since our spells mostly bounce off each other, we had to fight through pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Stratagey should be very different next time around purely 'cos of AA skills.<br />
My feelings<br />
1/. Rabid Bear with a low delay weapon (Facesmasher wont be quick enough to interrupt casting of other Shaman eventhough damage is nice). A weapon with a dd proc will help such as Righteousness,  Winterstorm or a borrowed SoD from your tank buddy ;)<br />
2/. Maxing Quickbuff will allow a 3 second torpor cast.<br />
3/. Channeling Focus will lessen the likelyhood of your casts being interupted.<br />
4/. Cann 5 may help a lot if you have significant HP's. Apparently much of the drops in Marauder's Mire (if it ever goes live on regular servers) off the boss mobs are 100hp,100mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think I read that Swiftraven recently left the game on the TMO board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If there is a second one and they still don't allow right click buff items, then Torpor will usually get dispelled fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The botb finals were alot of fun, but if you didnt have really good pet control as well as spell blocking knowledge you were dead. Swift was very good with his pet, and effectively used his dispells. <br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the equipment question goes, it really didn't play a large part in the results. A few shaman had pretty big mana pools and hps but from what I saw it wasn't the deciding factor.<br />
<br />
One other bit of information many people likely dont know. After shaman botb, fungi was banned. The reason? Cause Gathu and another troll I cant remember the name of fought for over an hour....At one point their fungi's were removed so the fight would have a chance of ending.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did they snare them? That's what was standard practice I thought after the match ran to long. They did that during the server qualifying matches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh they were snared for about an hour, didnt make any difference.</div></div><hr />
