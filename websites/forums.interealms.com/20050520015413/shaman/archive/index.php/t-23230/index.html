<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Nothing of any real significance, new STA buff (75, woot).  Oh, and the upgraded doggy is now a level 67, not 66 (darn, was hoping for a quick upgrade on day one).<br />
<br />
Again, my concern is how hard will it be to get these new spells.  If it's &quot;Gates&quot; hard, then I won't even buy the expansion.  But if there is a chance I can get the spells, along with the levels and aa's, then I guess they'll get my money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm concerned about how we will get spells as well.  We put in our money, time, and effort why not make the spells vendor sold again or at least common drops that people can get.  Heck I'm still one spell short of having my 3 Omen spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">with the NDA i'm not saying much, other than the spells are not class specific and they don't have a no drop tag on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's good enough for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This means I need to save up plat for the spells, seeing how I will be 66 the day of release. I doubt the 10k I have banked and the ornate silk arms will cover the initial cost of spells as the top teir actually use some of the plat in their multi million plat bank accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">as the top teir actually use some of the plat in their multi million plat bank accounts.haha. that's a riot. Most 'ubers' really don't have that much cash, due to lack of cash loot in 'uber' experience zones, or lack of sellable item drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sheesh, go hit Droga or something...  It's not that hard to make some pp in this game if you really want to.  I, for one, am glad that buying them will be an option.  If you don't want to camp some pp to buy them, then go camp the spells directly.  Nice to have options, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Very happy to hear this, Val.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can name a dozen zones quickly where a 65 shaman can farm plat or drops that can be sold for plat and earn bucks, but most people are SOOO obsessed with grinding out that next AA that they refuse to set foot in any zone where the ZEM doesn't get them a blue per kill.<br />
<br />
Screw exp for a day, and you can go earn yourself 20k in plat in one afternoon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are zones where you get a blue per kill?  ***?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One blue??  How about 3.5? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hook a brother up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">3.5? try 4.25!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's good enough for me :)<br />
<br />
Amen brother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/sigh<br />
<br />
And I'm lucky to get .5 blue per kill</div></div><hr />

<br />
 and now you complain that they are dropable (supposedly)   <br />
<br />
<br />
as everyone said  go farm droga  ... or invest in tradeskills .... or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, just because on Beta they are tradeable and all doesn't mean that they will be on live.  In a beta environment spells and abilities HAVE to come out faster so that they can actually TEST them.  Unless of course they enabled the /betaspell command again to give an instant full spellbook (hopefully with canni4 this time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Worry less about spell drop-ability.  Your conditional statement would evaluate true.<br />
<br />
There is an Agreement that prevents me saying more.</div></div><hr />

Thx Sudedor, there may be some hope yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Your lack of plat indicates your lack of doing something different.  Lack of actually adventuring.  Pick a zone you have never been to and go there.  Read up on tradeskills and see whats worth anything, to make or to farm.<br />
<br />
Doing the VP quests got me into zones that I really haven't spent time in, getting stuff from zones no one ever goes to because they are off of the beaten path.  Friend shamans in game ask me where they should go to get some plat, when I tell them I find out they wont even try it, or they don't know how to get to that zone.<br />
<br />
Zones with loot worth plat:<br />
Droga<br />
Chardock<br />
Chardockb<br />
Sirens Grotto<br />
Lost Temple of Cazic Thule<br />
<br />
Thats a partial list, but I bet if you don't have plat, its because you haven't been to half of those listed zones.  In many cases I'm the only one there. <br />
<br />
And you do pretty much gotta choose between pp or exp.  If there is a good camp that has pp AND exp, then someone is there already, or a group is forming up for it already, and it isn't you, because you are just sitting there with LFG on waiting for something to happen.<br />
<br />
Stop grinding for a night or two.  Go someplace you haven't been.  Go someplace no one else is at.  Maybe try to have fun or something for a change.  People get this tunnel vision thing going on and they forget to have fun.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, I agree with this. It is highly unlikely that SOE is interested in testing spell availability. They never did before so why should they start now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">At least with droppable spells, I know two things are true... 1. They will cost a fortune the first few months.   2.  The price will come down in time, just like PoP spells (for the most part).</div></div><hr />
