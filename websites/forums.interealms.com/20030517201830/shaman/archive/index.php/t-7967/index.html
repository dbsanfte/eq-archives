<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Vilefang.<br />
<br />
The last monster I need for my Circlet of the Falukaen quest. <br />
<br />
And my personal nemesis.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know any information on his spawn times, any ph, anything?<br />
<br />
I heard he was up on Tuesday night, while I was asleep. Wednesday, a 60 ranger (retired char) friend started checking up on Vilefang for me in DN.<br />
<br />
Four or five times a day he logs in, invises, runs as far as he can get without aggroing the see-invis mob on the first floor, checks for Vilefang. He can see the snakes in the lake, he's seen Zlandicar. So he's close enough to see Vile.<br />
<br />
Except Vile hasn't shown up since Tuesday. Zlandicar was up on Tuesday, then made another appearance on Saturday. I'm having a hard time understanding why Vile is a rarer spawn than Zlandicar.<br />
<br />
Any advice on getting this bugger to spawn? My ranger friend and I are slowly loosing patience. Arrrgghh.<br />
<br />
I need to get to him before a Zlandicar group runs through him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*bump*<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wish I could help... I have no info on his spawn time.  You're making me feel guilty though... when we did Zland, Vilefang was up, we killed him, I looted the chipped tooth 3 seconds before it rotted because nobody wanted it (or maybe didn't know what it was for).   And I don't even want the dang helm... :(  If you were on the Rathe I would happily MQ it for you.  Which gives me an idea... if you can't find Vilefang up, maybe if Zlandicar is on a rotation on RN you can get in touch with whatever guild is doing Zland and see about an MQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm a bit paranoid about MQ's. Mostly there have been a rash of people scamming others on thurg MQ'ss... while this isn't thurg armour, this one involved killing a very annoying guy in the arena, and I don't want to drag my guild back there cause I got scammed on a mq.<br />
<br />
I guess it boils down to trust. I trust friends and guildmates, but I get nervous about trusting strangers who gain whether or not I succeed in the MQ. Plus there's the faction issue - they would need ally with dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the pool before Zlandicar there is either an Entropy Serpent or Vilefang.  The spawn time is about 30 minutes, it took around 5 spawns to get Vilefang.<br />
<br />
I killed him with Dart and my rogue.  <br />
<br />
To solo him straight up, I haven't tried this, but I bet his blind is curable with counteract poison.  Either that or get good at playing blind :P.  I haven't tried buffing my poison resist either when fighting those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gandalfh, I LOVE you!<br />
<br />
If you ever need something on Rodcet, look me up, I'll try my damnest to help :)<br />
<br />
Sorry, this was driving me and my ranger friend crazy :) <br />
<br />
Now to get my guildmates down there... I hear the xp is good so we can grind while waiting for a pop :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm one step away from needing that fang.  If you get to the point of destroying that fang, let me know before you do and I'll hopefully be ready for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Laylana Angelhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey Harwel.. <br />
<br />
If Seanus ends up not needing it, i'll MQ with you.. this is the last piece i need just been havign trouble getting people out to DN with the whole PoP thing.. :)<br />
<br />
Contact me in game sometime if you are interested.. and of course, i'll gladly pay you... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gandalfh, we went down and bashed the snakes last night.<br />
<br />
It seems the respawn timer is a bit longer than 30 minutes - more like 35-40.<br />
<br />
We weren't able to stay much beyond 40 minutes as we got attacked by 5 bats and had to evac, but we'll be back. Vile didn't pop that time. Damn!<br />
<br />
A few questions:<br />
<br />
1) where's a good camp near Vile? We were down the hall, but if we got too close we could hear the explosion casting that stupid stunning spell. Which put us pretty close to the rats which we didn't want. <br />
<br />
2) Is there any safe spots for an invised person to hang out near Vile? I'm thinking of sticking the ranger right down by him, but I'm not sure with all these shamans and necro rats if there's a safe spot down there.<br />
<br />
3) Thanks again for letting me know about the ph. We got good xp - 1 yellow of aa in an hour and 15 minutes, and a velium brawl stick. We now just need to be able to hold that camp, rather than get run out by 4 bats and 2 rats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you go through the waterfall and hug the left wall, there is a small incline in the large room before Zlandicar's room, nothing paths there.  You need to make sure Zlandicar isn't up, because he will assist the rats and he has a pretty big aggro radius.  He drops a ST key, so people tend to keep him pretty dead.<br />
<br />
When I camped Vilefang though, I actually just hung out in the water, since I was alone and only wanted to kill one mob.  If you hug the left wall halfway across the lake you can setup camp in the water and go AFK, the serpent won't aggro on you there.<br />
<br />
If you hang out in the safe spot before Zlandicar you will have 3 to 4 rats to kill per spawn cycle, and there is a couple of named that pop there too.  Not sure what exciting stuff they drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail gandalfh,<br />
<br />
Could you give a little insight into how you made it to the water area solo?<br />
<br />
I've never been to DN, and was planning on leading my guild in a raid there just to take him out and whatever else was up (Excluding Zlandicar!) that looked interesting in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
I haven't done very much research yet, but was hoping you would share some advice. :)  Please. :D  I never thought this would be something I could get to solo for geographic reasons.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, it may be possible to get there solo, I happened to camp out there when we were down playing with Zlandicar.  <br />
<br />
A lot of stuff doesn't see invis down there, and the traps can be walked around, assuming you know where they are.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind I did this with a level 60 rogue/shaman duo, I bet the fight will be tougher without my rogue.  Biggest problem would be making sure that you don't spend the whole fight blinded.  Crippling him to reduce the proc rate could be handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks Gandalf.<br />
<br />
As for Frekkels, we were able to get down to the rats without any problem. Just invis and leg it. That gets you to the second floor ramp where I think, some rats see invis. So from there you do have issues. We uninvised and fought our way to the lair, 2 warriors, 2 shamans, 1 monk 1 druid. We had little problems - the problem came later when we had 4 bats train us (some trap I guess) plus 2 rats that were in camp. A quick succor saved the day, but put us all the way back at the start again.<br />
<br />
Next time, we'll work on holding the camp :) Getting to it wasn't that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info guys. :)<br />
I've had 9 responses to my raid planning thread so far in only the last 2-3 days.  Unfortunately, only ONE person has ever really raided there before, so it should be a fun adventure for all of us!<br />
<br />
So far I have:<br />
1.  Me (60 Oracle w/ Torpor &amp; Malo)<br />
2.  60 Warrior <br />
3.  60 Mage (w/ epic)<br />
4.  60 Druid<br />
5.  58 Druid <br />
6.  56 Enchanter<br />
 <br />
7.  50 Cleric<br />
8.  52 Warrior<br />
9.  52 Druid <br />
10.52 Monk<br />
<br />
Any idea on the spawn time/rate/rareness of Vilefang?<br />
<br />
I'd hate to lead my family to the rats and end up sitting there forever waiting for this named just so I can get the Circlet.  I was hoping to take 3 groups down there total, but was wondering what the low 50's aggro radius would do to us, and if it would be worth bringing them or keeping it 55+.  Of course, I still have to sweet talk at least one rogue into joining us! :p<br />
<br />
If there are other treasures there (besides PSC) worth hunting, I won't feel as guilty.<br />
<br />
Time to do the research! :D Any other inputs?<br />
Thanks again,</div></div><hr />
