<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could you all come up with a grid that would list the various types of shaman and what skills and gear are most important per that subtype.<br />
<br />
For example the:<br />
<br />
Main Raid Shaman<br />
<br />
Raid Support Shaman<br />
<br />
Small Group Shaman<br />
<br />
Soloist Shaman<br />
<br />
I am sure there are more sub-types.<br />
<br />
Then break down the various skills and equipment so that each kit is described for each type.  I guess this could be done in a list or spread sheet.<br />
<br />
Why don't I do it?  Kind of hoping for a group effort and I really don't know that much about the other types of Shaman and I am not sure if I know exactly what I should be doing to get the most out of my subtype which I would describe as a small group Shaman.  I noticed that there is no clear path for AAs after maybe Canni5 so this got me to thinking that there has to be different types of shaman and asking myself what type of shaman I was (besides teh suck) and what would best serve the type of game I played most.  I cannot afford to have gear for all situations and AAs are not as easy to come buy as I would like.<br />
<br />
Thanks inadvance for ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redspeed-Valoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">given the fairly linear progress of this game, you'll find that no matter what style or type of shaman you're playing the same skills and equipment are going to continually come up as the most needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Raid shaman:<br />
Radiant Cure<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I break it into two groups:<br />
<br />
Shadruid(are those gebs you have on?) and Intehface.<br />
<br />
The gear/aa differences are not relevant, it is the way the player goes about gearing(man, I have 355 wisdom lolz! Too bad I have 1500hp unbuffed) that distinguishes the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LR5 should be in both of those land :p for soloing I'd stick it before pet control. put ND3 in there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the ideas.<br />
<br />
Gear may be more similar, but over the last few months I have been noticing that I use entirely different spells/skill in raids as compared to small group.  Since I small group most, not solo, I am trying to get a handle on what is more important to the small group Shaman.<br />
<br />
Seems HP is much more important for small group.  If I get mashed in raid it does not slow the raid down much.  If I get smashed in small group even with click cleric it add downtime for everyone.<br />
<br />
See my reasoning? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Landrag, for the solo'in shammie, pet control is pretty much useless, Suspend minion 2 is priceless and is what makes pet control useless :)  (IMO as always)<br />

MGB<br />
Haste of Solusek<br />
Improved heal AA/gear<br />
LR5<br />
<br />

Essentially all of the AA :)<br />
<br />
<br />
  Seriously on the soloist (and slighty more restrictive):<br />
Clickable invis<br />
Suspend minion 2<br />
clickable root<br />
non DD dots<br />
Pet gear and level 61 pet<br />
DS potions/items<br />

Homecity gate stone<br />
Horse (fastest reccomended)<br />
High DD proc weapon<br />
tons of hp gear<br />
Insta-heal potions<br />
Quiessence<br />
Improved healing AA/gear<br />
FT (where possible without sacraficing hp)<br />
quickbuff (faster Q)<br />
LR5, ID5<br />
spiritcall<br />
radiant cure<br />
virulent para<br />
(going to force myself to stop here and remind you as I posted earlier... almost everything :P)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  I personally am a soloist above anything else, I do quite well in any other role however.  I did finally break down and get MGB since I do raid a fair amount (but only so I can get better gear and solo more).<br />
<br />
<br />
  If you gear up for solo, you can cover raid backup and small group roles VERY well.   But the main raid shaman and solo shaman do have quite different priorities and it takes a while to gear up to covering both (but is quite possible)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">EQ has no character customization.  Just build your character to be the best at one thing, and they'll end up being the best at all things.<br />
<br />
Root rotters need hp in case they get resisted a lot.<br />
Tank shamans need a large mana pool in case stuff hits the fan and they don't have time to canni or don't have hp left to canni.<br />
Etc., etc.<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to make a unique character, diabloII or something is probably a better choice.  Sure, there are tons of cookie-cutter builds for D2 characters, but you don't HAVE to use them to be effective.  As opposed to EQ, where eventually, every shaman desires nearly the same skills (all AAs) and gear to be the &quot;best.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't want to play Diablows and I am NOT interested in playing a custom character.  I just wanted some idea on what skills and equipement that benefits those skills to get first since I usually play in a 6 person group.<br />
<br />
I understand that we want it all but you can't have it all at once, so what was the best path for a small group shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm also primarily a single-group shaman, and often the only healer.  Here's my thoughts:<br />
<br />
(We'll assume the traditional MC3 / Cann V):<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure.<br />
-----<br />
You need to be able to cure maladies, quick, without targetting or caring too much about what they are.<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis<br />
Spirit Call<br />
-----<br />
Your best crowd control abilities.  VP will let you put an add aside to deal with later, Spirit Call will do the same thing, add a hell of a lot of push, make life really hard for casters, and do 4-5k damage over 60 seconds.  All for no mana.  :)<br />
<br />
SCR/SCRM<br />
-----<br />
Buff less often.  If you're the primary healer, buffs are something you want to do as seldom as possible.  Also makes Torpor last longer so you can bring yourself back after Cann V for less mana.<br />
<br />
Healing Gift<br />
-----<br />
I generally try to heal at about 50%.  This puts the tank up to 80% or so.  If I get a crit heal, it puts them to full health.  Also, crit heals are fun.  Fun is important.<br />
<br />
SCM<br />
-----<br />
Haven't gotten this far yet myself.  Do more stuff with less mana.  Sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
Healing Adept<br />
-----<br />
Heal a little better with every direct heal spell cast.  Percentage based, so effect not incredible considering our heal not incredible to start with.  Still probably worth buying.<br />
<br />
Not sure where I'm going after that.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I highly disagree with healing gift/adept.  You should hardly ever be throwing tnarg's in an exp group.  ND3 and the tanking AAs are more useful, 'cause *rarely* is a crit heal gonna save the tanks ass so much as your not being dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like my healing AAs. Sure, not everytime a TM safed a soul (more because 3.8sec casting time then the healed HP) but it happens several times.<br />
<br />
But it's quite easy to find out what AA you should get first:<br />
If you tend to tank a lot: go for defensive AA.<br />
If you a healer quite often: go for healing AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like the healing AAs. If any class needs em, we do. I use Tnargs all the time in exp groups especially if I am main healer. I HATE that stupid CH and refuse to use it. Q and Tnargs is my bread and butter. That being said, the healing AAs came fairly late in my AA career to this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">FOr me Tnarg crits in an exp group are sorta like free mana.   When we are fighting mobs that put out more DPS than just Quiessence can heal, and I am main healer, I will let the tank slip down a fair ways before I Tnarg, then if it crits it is like getting 2 heals for the price of 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">LR5 is nice yes, gives you 20% increased chance of completely avoiding an attack.  That's very nice, but it costs a hell of a lot.  12 + 15 = 27 AA's for that skill.  Pet Control is handy and only costs 6.  I really liked it while soloing . . but then again I dont have Suspended Minion1 or 2, so I can't judge how effective that is using it for the same thing.  Interesting info tho, I may look into it.  I think i have some more Healing AA's to work on now tho.  Need crit heals now.  They seem to help in all sorts of situations.  My heals are now doing about 1700hps max, costing 30% less, and casting 18% faster.  That's helping quite a lot in groups where I heal, and in raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">These days I seems to be using Tnarg mending all the time, in raid or in group.  With blessing of reverence and my 30% item healing haste, my Tnarg mending is 2.3 sec casting time.<br />
<br />
With max healing AA, I tend to get crit healing in the region of 3,3XX HP every 1 out of 5 heals or around 1700 - 1800 normal heal.<br />
<br />
With SCM (30% chance of activation.  On activation, 50% mana save if your specialisation is Alteration) and also a permanent 15% mana save, it doesn't cost me a lot to cast Tnarg mending.<br />
<br />
The only time I cast Quie is when I am sure there is no danger at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ah, maybe it's just a difference in playstyle that I don't value the healing AAs much.<br />
<br />
I tend to just quies like a mofo.  Only time I use tnarg's is when I feel someone might die if I don't.  (This refers to both main and backup healer in group)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">With SCM (30% chance of activation. On activation, 50% mana save if your specialisation is Alteration) <br />
<br />
Personally I would say that its more like 20% then 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Irontree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Is the idea of the HP that its essentially more of a vessel for cannibilazation, than the actuall ability to recieve damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Is the idea of the HP that its essentially more of a vessel for cannibilazation, than the actuall ability to recieve damage?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's both actually, at least IMHO.<br />
<br />
It's not so much how much mana you have, as it is how quick you can regenerate mana back.  It reduces downtime considerably.  Two nights ago in PoV at Golems, we took a med break after a druid healer and myself were both at 20% after a bad pull.  I Cannied back up to 100% with the help of my drogmor and stoicism, while the druid on the horse only managed to get back to 40% herself.<br />
<br />
Likely the druid has more mana than myself.  At 57 I only have 189 WIS, while she likely had somewere around 250 (didn't think to ask at the time).  I figured however I had just over 4k mana total, and while I was ready to pull, we were still waiting on the druid to med up some more.  So I rebuffed and Cannibalized to full once more by the time she was ready again.<br />
<br />
So more HPs help there when it comes to Cannibalization. <br />
<br />
However I feel HPs are more important in staying alive.  Slowing, especially when resisted, generates HELLUA Aggro.  Which means you're going to get beat on.  If you want to stay alive long enough for the MA to get that MOB off you, you need the HPs to take a beat down.  Those same HPs just also come in handy when it comes to Cannibalizing back your mana afterwards.  <br />
<br />
So HPs serve something of a dual purpose, both of which are very important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Folks thanks for the discussion.<br />
<br />
I really did not mean for this to be a &quot;What AA should I get next&quot; thread.  Sadly many folks who hang out on message boards are sad folks who just sit in wait for someone to flame.  What is really sad is that sometimes those type of folks so want to spit their venom that they react to posts that don&#8217;t say what they think they say.  I am not saying that happened here.  I just want to be clear. I am more interested in a discussion about the types of Shaman and I think that you all have latched on to that idea.  <br />
<br />
Some of you all think that a Shaman is a Shaman and all gear and AA follows the same basic path and I respect that.  I don't believe it but I respect it.  Some say we want it all and I understand that, but since we only get one AA at a time (PoP flags not withstanding) what gear and AAs are first if you do agree that different style Shaman have different priorities?  <br />
<br />
Many have mentioned play style so I am inclined to believe that many of you do think that there are different types of Shaman.  How would you define those types?  I know that there are not clear types and most folks play a percentage of each kind of play, Solo, Small Group and Raid.<br />
<br />
Would a thread labeled:  The Small Group Specialist be something that should find its way into the Medicine Chest forum.  What does a SGS Shaman wear?  What does he go after first when it comes to AA skills?  Where does this Shaman  try to lobby his group into hunting?  <br />
<br />
Can we get more discussion?  I know some of you don&#8217;t agree with this idea, and that is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">/em spits his venom on the post above.<br />
<br />
Actually, that sounds like a good idea for a medicine cabinet post.  A condensed version with multiple aa path suggestions for the different &quot;types&quot; of shaman might also suffice.<br />
<br />
Suggested topics:  AA paths, relative value of different focus effect types, group and/or raid management tips, etc.<br />
<br />
Actually....may want to have seperate threads for each of those topics...not at all related to the &quot;subclass&quot; thing, just a thread for &quot;focus effects&quot;, &quot;group/raid management tips&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
*shrug* I dunno, I'm not gonna be the one to author such a thread anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">With SCM (30% chance of activation.  On activation, 50% mana save if your specialisation is Alteration) and also a permanent 15% mana save, it doesn't cost me a lot to cast Tnarg mending.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to derail the thread but you couldn't have been more wrong in that bit if you tried.<br />
<br />
SCM is a 10% mana savings on everything and is constant. There is no check to see if specialization goes off or not. The description of the aa for scm is compleately wrong.<br />
<br />
Your boots on the other hand and all mana pres items are a random percent up to the max, in your case 15%.<br />
<br />
Assuming you've got spec alteration as your main one you save ~22% from that and scm and then another ~8% from your boots on average so you end up saving ~30% on average.<br />
<br />
The numbers are whats been pulled out of eq by programs like showeq which I have linked to in the past but i don't have infront of me right now. Could probably find them on the forums tho in the last thread about scm.<br />
<br />
As far as the healing aa's go I've gotten myself up to a fair number of aa's now (260 and climbing) and I have enjoyed the healing aa's. Q is great for the efficiency with scrm and my crown but it's very slow. Tnargs with maxed healing aa and a Heal IV is useful especially on a crit. I wouldn't put them in my first 100's but it definitely has made me alot more viable as a healer. I've even had a few lucky crits on raids that have probably saved the mt's.<br />
<br />
As far as difference in aa/focus effects for shaman and thier roles I see 2 main areas where I'd see some difference between them.<br />
On the aa side of things the obvious one is MGB. I find it very handy for shaman on a raid but obviously fairly useless in soloing or standard groups. Most other aa's hve good uses in both situations. Any buff related aa's work on torpor/q and that alone makes them worth while even while soloing for alot of people. ND/LR we get hit raiding or grouping or soloing so useful for all of the above. Healing aa's are far enough down the list on any of them that by that point it doesn't really matter.<br />
<br />
As far as gear the main difference I'd see would be soloing vs anything else. Obviously soloing your gonna want the afliction lines, Burning affliction, affliction efficiency etc since those are gonna be majorly used spells soloing. In raids or groups your gonna tend towards the more general mana pres, buff extension and maybe healing or improved dmg focus effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Can we get more discussion?  I know some of you don’t agree with this idea, and that is fine.<br />
<br />
Here is an idea...<br />
<br />
Play in a small group... look at what might be of the most help from AA, then work to get it. I never asked what AA I should work on, or what path to take. I looked at what *I* needed to better help in exp groups/raids, then worked to develop that particular AA.</div></div><hr />
