<br />
Those who are sick of tabbing screens while playing Everquest just to see what they need for their epic/alchemy or handwriting it down (Then losing the sheet or making a typo), or doing towns of print outs (And we know how expensive and time consuming that is), there is a new way to view the information while playing the game just by a click of a button.<br />
<br />
All you need to do is download these files by right clicking on the Blue link  below and press 'Save Target As...' into your storyline folder in Everquest (E.g. C:\Everquest\Storyline). Then after downloading this go to Stories window while playing EQ to view them.<br />

<br />
Please note that all information was taken from  http://www.eqshaman.com/ and all credit to the original makers who spent their time writing down the guides just to help us lil people! I just converted the text to be viewed in story mode. Also if you want to view all the Epic parts in order while playing EQ then download them in order. Reason is that EQ Storyline goes by the dates and times when it has been downloaded/Saved and not by Alphabetical order.<br />
