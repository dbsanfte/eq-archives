<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have an account that I deleted when my girl left...  Wanting to reactivate it but when I try it says name is unknown...  <br />
<br />
My question is, if I create a new account using the old cdkeys would I have to buy the LoY expansion again or will it be on there?  Daon't care about the characters as I am going to transfer one over to it either way...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I'm sorry, that was uncalled for.   :D <br />
<br />
To answer your question:  I'm pretty darn sure you can't make a second account off the same CD keys.  You'll need to buy EQ all over again.  And if you don't know the original account's login, you won't be able to transfer any characters off of it to the new account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know the account login, but when I try to reactivate the account it says unknown name, it's the account that I used till a month ago...  I have all the original information including the credit card originally used (mine)...<br />
<br />
Tech support has not responded, tried calling no live person to talk to (that what I get for calling 10 minutes before support hours are up)... Tried chatting tech support, no go and have tried emailing still no response...<br />
<br />
Just wanted to know if it's been done before, I don't want to screw things up even more..</div></div><hr />
