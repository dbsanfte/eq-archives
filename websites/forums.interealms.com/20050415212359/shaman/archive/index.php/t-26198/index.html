<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry,  brain is not working.  I can't remember this simple stuff atm, and I can't find the thread I remember reading about it in.<br />
<br />
1.  What was the healing percentages relative to the cleric again?<br />
<br />
something like?<br />
cleric = 100%<br />
druid = 70<br />
shaman = 60 <br />
<br />
and 2.  Someone once tied our 75% slow to our relative healing percent.  How'd they do that again?  I remember the math being an exact fit showing how 75% slowed mob dps = 60% healing to be on par with a cleric's heal.  Grr.  Can't remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">47%.  Counting full 75% slow landed 10sec into a full 1min fight, Shaman need heals 47% as good as clerics to resist the damage from the same mob.<br />
<br />
That 47% is the observable ratio for the heals we have, so (without confirmation) we believe that's where the number originally came from, since it would be a coincidence of monumental proportions if someone throwing darts got that consistent a number.<br />
<br />
The balance issue is that the 47% number was arrived at before slow mitigation, and with much longer fights than is the current norm.  Slow is, obviously, more powerful the longer it's on a mob.  That % healing effectiveness hasn't been revisited since mitigation was introduced in PoP and exploded in GoD.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.  47. that was the number.<br />
<br />
About it being the observable ratio though.. thats not what I remember.  Someone on this board had an actual equation that generated exactly 47% using the 75% slow.  And I'm fairly certain it wasn't obtained by estimating that slow lands 10 seconds into a fight. Hmm.  I'll thread hunt a bit and see if I can find it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and you are right.  he did guess as to the timing of slow, working out an approximate 47% ratio. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman healing in the past and the proposed changes are based on bad reasoning.  The amount of healing a shaman can do should be set regardless of the amount of slow.  Is a cleric or druid's healing overpowered because there is a slower in the group?  Obviously not.  But if a shaman is slowing and healing we are considered overpowered.<br />
<br />
The proposed changes to adjust shaman healing based on the amount the shaman slows is both cumbersome to implement and continues the flawed reasoning.  If there are 2 shaman in the group, should the healing shaman have enhanced heals if the other slows?  What if a beastlord/chanter/bard slows?  If one shaman slows and heals while the other does buffs and dps should that make a difference in the amount of heals the first shaman does?  Of course there is no difference but this nonsense has been around since Kunark.<br />
<br />
If shaman are to be the number 3 healer that's fine.  Just pick a number and set heals accordingly.  Trying to adjust for slow makes no sense in actual game play.  Certainly not at higher levels where everything mitigates slow and all slowers are equal.  At lower levels where everything is fully slowable it might have some sense but don't continue it past about level 50.<br />
<br />
My personal feelings are that I have no interest in being a main healer and think it is a waste of shaman abilities to do so unless there are just no healers available for a group.  I'm very comfortable with a support role in healing and would be more interested in a 1 second casting emergency heal around 1300 hps adjusted up for focus and crits. <br />
<br />
I'm actually very pleased with where shaman are at currently.  Although there are a number of tweaks needed, there is really only one major flaw and that is with the availablity of Nihil.  Come on SoE, everyone knows, and you even have admitted, that GoD was a major fubar.  Make Nihil or a comparable spell reasonably available for a 66 to 68 rune in OoW or to be purchased for crystals in DoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">copied from the Class Balance thread. Please see my idea on the stances approach. I think if they can implement this for druids, they can very well do it for shamans too.<br />
<br />
The shaman specific part shows again that SOE does not seem to be aware of the fact that there are other classes that can slow. The argument, that we have to be balanced around slow was always weak and has been shot completely with mitigation. But this is something anyone visiting these boards for some time knows of course.<br />
<br />
The stance approach seems to be the best one in my opinoin. I could imagine a<br />
- Healer stance, which should bring us close to druid healing i their healer stance and a<br />
- Melee stance maybe, for those who enjoy swinging that big hammer. Alternativly, or in addition a<br />
- Nuker stance with initiate spell speed and damage bonus.<br />
<br />
While in either of those stances, all of our slows are reduced by 50%.<br />
<br />
This way the stackability of shamans on raids could be much improved as well. My guild can still field up to 10 shamans on a 50 person raid and heal and nuke is what most of us try to do in that case.<br />
<br />
In groups, enchanters and beastlords have finally caught up to shamans as slowers. Beasts because of the resist reduced slow and enchanters because the aggro on tash will be reduced. If I am with one of these classes in a group, or even a bard, I would happily assume a different role than slower. Main healer being my favorite choice, because that is what my shaman has been for long time and would like to be again.</div></div><hr />
