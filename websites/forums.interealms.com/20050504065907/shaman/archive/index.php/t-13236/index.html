<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ghazgul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently decided to 2 box my Shaman with another class.  Originally I was going to use a warrior.  Recently I decided that using a bard might prove a fun combo, but Im not sure of the effectiveness / efficiency of the bard/shaman combo.  <br />
<br />
Most the Shaman I know use either a Knight hybrid or Warrior.  I imagine this is because of the effective nature of this combo.  It would be kinda cool to do something different though.  <br />
<br />
The other issue I had was weather I would be able to twist songs well enough to pull this off.  Warrior is probably my no brainer best way to go, but I thought I would see if anyone thought different.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">monk or SK is nice for the FD pulls<br />
ranger and sk nice for snare, you can take the indoor areas with runners...even a necro isn't bad with thier inate mana regen and life tap over time spells<br />
mage is nice for simple dps...just send in the pet and cast 1 rain or dot a fight...once you get CoH it makes FD pulling look weak, but does cost a pearl a shot, but you can always get it in 1 try and never train yourself.<br />
Warrior next..in with paladins and sk for classes needed to really 2 box a melee type past 1st tier PoP. Necro also not a bad choice for doing 2nd tier PoP, just root DoT, fearkiting also very effective in the right spot<br />
<br />
2 boxing gets old if you don't have some good DPS at higher levels. Enchanters don't have great DPS before dire charm, and wizards need clarity to get good dps, though quading can make up for it with availability of c3 or better now. clerics, no dps. bard is ok, but really can't play them to thier fullest while 2 boxing. Druids not bad for root doting and maybe some quading<br />
<br />
beastlord would do well, though many buffs overlap, thier pet can tank well and holds agro good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been two boxing a shaman/ranger after trying a few other combinations. I would say the best mellee partners for a shaman are paladin and ranger as both can pull very well in most places with harmony. Ranger has more dps and snare, but paladins can tank incredibly well with their stuns (makes their damage taken much less). I dont really like SKs because their dps is only about what a paladins is and they take more damage and cant heal as well, though their pet can be somewhat useful. Monks are ok, but their tanking is even worse than a rangers and they are totally dependent on the shaman for healing and such (where as ranger/paladin/sk can heal themselves during downtimes or during fights). I think using a bard would be a very bad idea as, just played as one char, they are quite difficult to master. Generally when a bard duos with a caster they arent tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ghazgul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After some careful consideration I decided to go with Shaman/Mage combo.  I think it will provide me with the solo + group capability that I am after as well as being an interesting combo that I haven't seen a whole lot of.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You've already made your decision, but I'll post anyways.<br />
Go with the shaman/monk duo! 8)<br />
I duo with a monk, and while their tanking abilities may be a little sub-par, it is adequate enough in most scenarios. Their damage is awesome, and (maybe most importantly), they are pretty simplistiic to duel-box with. This is something you shouldnt overlook really, as when the #@$ hits the fan (and honestly, it always does), you'll have to deal with that mage and shammie both getting thwacked....with monk/shaman duo, you just slam your finger on the fd hotkey, and then go into solo mode with shaman until things are rooted and stuff..<br />
just my 2 cents<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rhaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Monks are ok, but their tanking is even worse than a rangers <br />
<br />
Actually no, monks are better tanks than rangers. They have a much higher defense skill cap, and much higher defensive skill (dodge, riposte, block) caps also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another advantage of shaman/mage combo is you don't need to worry as much about finding the rare malo at 60...the mage will have mala, which is good enough for most targets.<br />
I used mala with mage for most of a year before finally getting malo, was still plenty to consistantly land slow on most targets worthy of 2 boxing</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try this, have similarly equiped ranger and monk duel, no dds, but rangers can use whatever self buffs they want. I have done this about 10 times and the ranger (me) always wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like the shaman/mage combo, but I'm lazy.  You get a great DPS increase with the mage, his pet, his summoned items for you and your pets and best of all in my opinion is that it takes a minimum of button pushing.  Assist, pet attack and the occasional nuke and you are gtg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Self buffs easly tips this for the ranger. The ac and more importantly DS that they can self buff with kills the monk especially if they are silly enough to dual wield. Not really an expert at ranger buffs but off hand it looks like a 50 ac 300hps and 20 -30 points of DS at lvl 60. Try them with out self buffs and it might make a difference. The other variable is just dps of monk vs ranger. This really isn't a good test of who is a better tank.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What about 2 Boxing a Necro or a Beastlord?<br />
<br />
WHich shaman buffs wil stick on a necro pet or a BL pet? Also, at higher levels the beastlord clarity is not bad.<br />
<br />
And with a necro, when you are not 2 boxing, you can solo pretty well.<br />
<br />
just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>sebkorsisu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have tried the following combinations:<br />
<br />
Shaman (lvls 56 - 60) with:<br />
<br />
Ranger (lvls 52 - 57) Works well. Good Dps, buffs, snare, and tracking. Starting to get limited due to lack of Ranger tanking ability. Ranger starting to need more heals.<br />
<br />
Monk (lvls 45 - 52) Works well. Similar to Ranger in Dps. Easier to get out of trouble. Monk FD + Shaman gate.<br />
<br />
Paladin (lvl 54) So so. Good tanking, not enough Dps.<br />
<br />
Mage (lvl 53 - 54) OK. Good Dps. Weak tanking. Requires a lot of pet<br />
healing or Shaman tanking. If there is trouble then Mage is most likely dead.<br />
<br />
Warrior (lvl 52) ?? Warrior was not well enough equipped. With 2 good 1 handers, better armor and a couple more levels this might be the best compromise between Dps and tanking ability.<br />
<br />
My experience is that at level 56 and beyond, it was more efficient to get a PoP group than to 2 box with another character. In the time it took to get 1 blue bub 2 boxing, I could get 1 yellow in a PoP group. <br />
<br />
I still 2 box when i don't have anything better to do or when farming or questing. For Xp though, it isnt efficient enough to do anymore. I cant do it for as long without getting tired, and it isn't as much fun as grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baledin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Through guild need,I'm duoing shaman / rogue.<br />
<br />
It works suprisingly well, at least with the rogue at 42, and the shaman at 40.  I think it's because of the damage output of the two. Slows and dps keep the rogue from having to tank TOO long.<br />
<br />
I don't think I'd reccomend it, but it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I duo a shaman/rogue also, not too bad pre-PoP, much harder in PoP so I usually just grab a group, frequently play one out of group for extra dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Self buffs easly tips this for the ranger.

<br />
Actually, if you're 2-boxing with a shaman, it's a very good test. Rangers can buff HP, AC, ATK and damage shield, all of which stack with shaman buffs, and they can buff the shaman too. It's an advantage the monk won't have in a duo, and hence, in my opinion, a valid comparison to make.<br />
<br />
However, either of those classes would be a good partner for a shaman. They can both can dish out the damage and can both tank well enough for the duo. The monk has the edge on damage dealing, and the ranger has the edge on getting agro and utility.<br />
<br />
Recently I've been duoing a fair bit with a beastlord, which seems to be the often overlooked choice for a duo. Our buffs overlap a fair bit, but that suits the beastlord just fine - he lets me buff (all except spiritual purity), and he uses his mana for damage. He's not the best tank, and I' wouldn't suggest having him tank in, say, PoP, but for us it's been working out just fine. Lately we've been in Nadox together. The experience isn't as good as PoP, but it's a nice balance between experience and cash which is important to me, since I'm trying to save up for my level 60 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Shaman/Necro combo....<br />
If it can be slowed and snared, it's normally dead with this combo...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then the monks you are dueling don't know what they are doing or have subpar equipment.  Face a monk once with a t-staff + innerflame....you're done.  I duel rangers and the like often with my Monk.  just takes the T-staff procing  once or twice.....= dead ranger<br />
<br />
of course if you throw in roots and snares......makes things a little funner</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>kronas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">How does one pl a mage with a shaman, say from lvl 1 - lvl 59?  I have pl quite a few melee charaters (monk, warrior, paladin, bl) and am able to get them to lvl 40 with under 1 day played.  How long does it take to get a mage to lvl 40?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">To extend the question a bit further, what are some of the worst 2-boxing combinations? I will be starting to 2-box this summer. June and July are my 2 favorite things about teaching. <br />
<br />
(I do plan to have a Cleric and Druid or Wizard on each account.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I 2boxed a shaman and ranger till both got to 62.  It was a good combination.  I spent a lot of time in UP, where the ranger could tank any of the common mobs (after it was slowed) and a few of the named:  gantru dralkenr, gantru raldukan, fallen sergeant.  In fact, it was a very good combination to hunt down these named for loot.  Track, obviously, was invaluable for this, but the instant camo aa (which I had gotten just for this purpose) helped a great deal as well.  It's far easier to find and pull a mob in UP with an instant camo ranger than a FD'ing monk.  I spent a LOT of time in UP farming named and was able to get some nice gear for both my shaman and my ranger.<br />
<br />
But then I started spending more time in PoP.  I CAN 2box this combo with the trash mob frogs and larvae in Valor, but the xp is NOT as fast as in a full group in any of the camps.  So now, my shaman is 65 and ranger is stuck at 62--it's much easier to find groups with my shaman and I haven't really tried to foist the ranger on a group that invites me.  <br />
<br />
More recently, because I hit 65 and don't really 2box the ranger much any more, I decided to sell a lot of his gear that I had gotten through the months that I'd spent in UP to get Quiescence.  I know I wouldn't have been able to do without his ability to both track and the instant camo aa, but at the same time I regret all the time and effort that I've put into him.  <br />
<br />
Now, I've even been wishing that I would have instead rolled a pally to 2box, but not just to 2box by themselves.  A shaman/pally combo (of high enough level) is a solid base for an xp group in Valor or Storms.  Shaman can handle almost all healing responsibilities.  Pally can buff well enough to get a group by, can tank, keep aggro, has a great stun at 62, and has nice group heals for emergencies.  Both can ghetto CC.  Now just add your friends or guildies who aren't that sought after shaman/chanter/cleric by other groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I would second (or third?) the motion for a Paladin as a great 2-box option.  The DPS isn't really the best with a pally, but the instant agro (stuns), the healing (slightly less than the shaman), and the ability to really TANK PoP-level mobs all combine together to make a paladin/shaman combo near ideal...particularly if you are looking for a melee-based character for your second box.<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, the Pally/Shaman combo is an ideal base for a POP group: all you have to do is throw in as much DPS as you want...or jsut stick to a slightly slower EXP crawl with just the duo.<br />
<br />
There are far too many times when I have gotten a surprise add and my paladin has dropped to low health, to believe that a Ranger or Monk could pull our a 'save' in this situation: the HP/AC of the paladin are decent enough that I can handle 2 mobs for the ammount of time that it takes to get them slowed and/or parked...and you always have LOH as a trump card if things get really hairy.  In a situation like that - getting a surprise add - a Ranger isn't going to be able to cut it with their limited tanking ability.  The monk?  Sure, FD will help save the monk....but then the shaman has to gate.  That, IMHO, isn't a 'win' it is a 'loss' with and astrix next to it: ya didn't DIE, but now you have to go back and set up camp again.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 coppers - your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">There are far too many times when I have gotten a surprise add and my paladin has dropped to low health, to believe that a Ranger or Monk could pull our a 'save' in this situation: the HP/AC of the paladin are decent enough that I can handle 2 mobs for the ammount of time that it takes to get them slowed and/or parked...and you always have LOH as a trump card if things get really hairy.

<br />
I'm not meaning to be defensive; as I said above, I still kinda wish I had started a pally (and I keep debating whether to just PL one up), but when I did 2 box in UP with my ranger, I would occassionally get an add through carelessness.  Don't forget a 60 lvl ranger can /disc weaponshield.  Of course, it's only once every 66 minutes or so, but for 20 seconds, he will parry every attack from the front, which always gave my shaman time to root one, slow the other, split em with ranger and then slow the second.  Keep root on the first with shaman and everything stays under control.<br />
<br />
Weaponshield is awesome.  It's sometimes surprising how many people don't understand how it works.  A ranger doesn't even need aggro to use it, so long as the mob is in front of him AND is pointed in the ranger's direction.  It's great to give a shaman time to get a slow in on a hard hitting boss mob without getting flattened from a resist.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to throw this out in the interests of full information.  Pallies are still awesome to duo with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">These are some great posts - excellent information.  I just wanted to contribute from my experience thusfar.  I 2-box a 63 SK and 65 Shaman.  Combo works really well.  I've been hunting in Tier 2 Planes (Valor, Storms) and some in BoT as well.  The SK has no trouble keeping agro and tanks things quite well.  About 18 months ago, I did the monk/shaman combo, and while it was a blast - I'm finding the SK is far superior as a tank (obviously) and with keeping agro.  The only two downsides are decreased DPS and a bit less reliability with FD (fizzles, casting interruptions).  Overall however, I would have to say that SK/Shaman has been a combo that has nearly limitless potential.  I've been wanting to try the team on some PoS giants (a little nervous) or even in Tactics.  However I may wait until  I get Quiescence.<br />
<br />
Actually I could use some advice myself :)  I just started on Firiona Vie and want to do another 2-box combo.  I have my shaman to lvl 40 and had initially started another SK (he's lvl 30).  However, I'm considering starting a different melee, for variety.  After some long consideration, I decided on Ranger - but I'm concerned about the ranger's tanking ability VS the shaman's healing ability in Tier 1 planes.  I really only anticipate hunting in Tier 1 with this combo - going to be more casual on this run.  This is leading me to consider Paladin as an option.  I know the LoH and the Rez's will be a real bonus.  I'm just concerned about paladin DPS and about absolutely no snare.  I'm also concerned about missing FD with both options.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />
