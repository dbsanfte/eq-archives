This entire Verent cycle of &quot;Releasing a exspansion that promises the moon so people will buy it then worrying about how it will effect the game later on&quot; is just beyond frustrating.<br />

<br />
I want to have a fun event that will actually be entertaining to all involved. Not the regular 100 people being pissed because 10 newbies decided to be asses and ruin it.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should just give the stuff away here.<br />
<br />
Anyone on BB that could use any of the stuff I have don't be afraid to ask, I will gladely hang on to it instead of giving it away.<br />

That's it.  You win this arguement.<br />
<br />
Level 60 didn't kill EQ.<br />
It added a whole new &quot;level&quot; of gameplay.<br />
<br />
Level 51?  Come back in 12 months when you've actually gotten to level 60 and played in that level for a while and have an opinion that matters more than the noisy sounds that come out of my ass.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though if you can't find any flaws in my logic just give up on the argument instead of trying to pull **** like this outta your ass<br />
<br />
(Ya know those 10 newbies who can ruin something for everyone? ;)) Don't worry I plan to ignore these idiots.  Anyone have any ideas? (Yet another grasp to divert the thread back to its original question and away from weak ass flaming attempts)</div></div><hr />

You call people 12 years old then proceed with the playground style namecalling.<br />
<br />
You whine about people attacking you and making Hateful comments, glad we don't see you doing that huh?<br />
<br />
You say that level 60 has ruined the game, and yet you continued to play.  Even more ironically, you've never even been a level 60!<br />
<br />
So, this is a thread about fun ways to distribute loot you say?  (points to title of thread)<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, you ask for fun ways to distribute loot, then you tell us to get a life!  Sounds like a crazy, fun packed life you got there!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pardon me for asking but why is everyone being so rude to this guy?  I have to side with him you're all being kind of stupid.  He has an oppinion, he stated that but that was only the secondary part of his post.  The main thing he was asking was a way to distribute his hard earned gear to deserving people.  Whether he's right about it ruining the game or not, that's his oppinion and I personally don't see anything wrong with it.  I mean I read posts of people complaining about the bazaar opening and how they were quiting because it ruined the game.  So what?  If it's not fun for him he shouldn't play.  He asked a simple question and you all decided to act like a bunch of immature little brats towards him.  I'm sure I'll be flamed for this for the next few posts but later in the day there will be other posts following mine that will agree with me that you guys are being total and complete asses towards a guy that came here asking a very simple and innocent question.  I think it's very nice and thoughtful of him to even think of holding events to get rid of his gear rather then e-baying it or just letting it rot.  It could have made some newbies really happy and they'd have probably had fun participating in the events but instead you all acted like a bunch of asses and called him childish names.  Grats to you!<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just wanted to add that I know people get tired of the &quot;I HATE VI&quot; threads but this one was kind of different.  He just kinda used a stupid subject line.  Doesn't really give a reason to flame though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah you're right, this one was definetly different.

    Anyways to answer your question..give it to a friend or to your guild or something they would appreciate it even more than people you didnt know..and you will know who is and who is not deserving of them. <br />
    Maybe, you could have some kind of a &quot;game night&quot; in the arena...or a run from Nexus.. to so many zones and the peson has to pick up a piece of something from every place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I never saw mren say verant is ghey or any of that nonsense.<br />
How did you know for sure if he has had or has a lvl 60 char?<br />
Since when does being lvl 60 give you a right to an opinion?How do you even know where he has played , who he has played as and again who put the cap lvl in on having an opinion? <br />
<br />
   Besides didnt exactly sucker you into the thread with a suject line that didnt you a clue was something agaisnt verant. Also plenty of people who play eq everyday who bitch about it and play it anyway. Does that really surprise you he might not of been totally happy with the game and played it anyway? Get off your uberness mmkay?<br />
<br />
<br />
   To answer your question Mren maybe do mini quests and give an item away? Doesnt have to be anything hard. More trouble finding actual newbies i think than anything. Barring that maybe find low lvl people of the class that can use. I know your shaman but more classes tag than just shaman. Talk to them a bit see if you can tell if they are true newbies or even sorta newbies. I'm a little jaded about giving stuff to newbies when ive given someting to someone asking and one told me it wasnt enough and the other already had a lore item yet told me they didnt have anything. That being just two examples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Uh if he were speaking from experiance on how bad 50-60 was or if he hadnt made such a dumb statement like the game has been destroyed by raising the level cap to 60 id have let it go by as just another teenage angst &quot;the man is bringing us down&quot; post.<br />
<br />
He has no clue what hes talking about, if the game is destroyed why is he playing it and in fact why are any of us. Going from level 50-51 is hardly a torture. it was easy 2.5 years ago and i have no doubt its easier today with higher exp bonuses and zones with larger zems.<br />

(note: this is not a ploy to get Mren's to give me his things.  I'm on a completely separate server, and wouldn't care to leave my home...  It's just so dissappointing to see selfishness ruin someone else's act of kindness.  Yeesh.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Lessee.   A level 51 shaman comes here, and starts a thread saying he hates Verant because they are raising the maximum level from something he'll never see to something even higher he'll never see.  He says that this maximum level increase is absolutely bad and horrid for the game, though at level 51 he can't have a relavant opinion on exactly what the level 60 cap did with Kunark, but based on his expert opinion, he's decided that raising it from level 60 to 65 is going to make the majority of the game he's ever even experienced even worse off.   Hmm.  I call shananagans on that one!  I'd prefer to think that I enjoy the 50s and level 60 more than I've enjoyed the other parts of the game.  I prefer to take notice that the classes are races are pretty well balanced nowadays.  I prefer to notice that Verant is doing a lot better job at refining EQ.  I prefer to think that maybe the increase from level 60 to 65 won't be done in a slackass way as they've done things in the past, based on the good track record they've made for themselves in the past yearish.  Or, I could listen to the whinings of some mid level shaman that hasn't experienced even half of the game yet, but has an oh so expert opinion of how level 60 made the game suck.  Yeeeeeeeaaaaaah, right.   Maybe monkeys will fly out of my BUTT too!</div></div><hr />

If I were you I would wait until the expansion comes out and read some reviews or try it out. I would be really bad to give all your stuff away then find out that the expansion with the lvl 65 cap actually worked and was a lot of fun but now you have no char to play =\ It's up to you if you wanna leave obviously, but you're being a little hasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>googs1016</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Level 60 destroyed the game??? News to me.<br />

I think it enhanced the game. To tell the truth if the game was left at level 50 that would be a real piece of crap. How would any monsters get killed? But i guess if you never step off antonica youll never learn.<br />
<br />
To tell the truth im glad if you dont like it. Because you are doing the natural thing and gving your stuff away and quitting. Thast what i would do too. But personally i like for things to be out for at least 24hrs b4 i form an opinions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are a bit premature to say levels from 50-60 &quot;ruined&quot; the game.  Most of the really exciting encounters I've had in game happened 50+.<br />
<br />
As to how to distribute your stuff in a fun way:<br />
A naked drunken gnome race from Ak'anon to Halas.<br />
<br />
Everyone must be level 1.  Sell some stuff for cash (or use what pp you have) and buy or brew LOTS of alcohol.  Advertise a week or two ahead of time on your server board.  Nothing equipped except initial no drop weapon and newbie guild tunic.  Level 1 spells are the contestants own business.<br />
<br />
Everyone gets two stacks of booze.  All characters have to be level 1.  Have to finish the booze before the races end.  Each racer ALSO gets ONE sow potion, single shot variety.  Their choice when to use it. ;)<br />
<br />
We did this on E. Marr as an Alliance event and it was a BLAST.  We had around 50 people (more probably, but I didn't keep track as just a racer) run, and it was GREAT fun!  We shouted Vroom Vroom in every zone we passed.  <br />
<br />
It was one of the most fun-to-do things in an evening IG I've ever participated in.  You will likely need some help.  A few people to monitor that everyone actually passes through every zone.  Someone to help distribute alcohol.<br />
<br />
That's one idea for you.  Here's the story of our event. (http://members.cox.net/confused007/GnomeRun/GnomeRun.html) <br />
<br />
The people who finished the race were allowed to look through about 6 bags worth of stuff and pick a prize.  First place chose first, second picked second, and so on.  (I came in 2nd, woot!)<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">How, per se, did the level 60 cap destroy the game?  Are you just spewing out information like that because it is cool these days to be Anti-Verant, or do you have some logical reasoning that lead you to that conclusion?<br />
<br />
Go ahead, give away your stuff.  You'll be back in a few months like 90% of the other folks who have &quot;retired&quot;....including me.  <br />
<br />
With things like Shadowbane (whoops, we lied, its not ready yet...or yet....nope....give us another 4 months....)<br />
<br />
Horizons (*poof*...vaporware)<br />
<br />
AC2 (if its anything like AC1)<br />
<br />
Starwars Online (on down the road a bit, and it's only mildly interesting, perhaps that will change)<br />
<br />
Earth and Beyond (pile of steaming horse crap)<br />
<br />
WoW (Blizzard is the worlds worst with release dates)<br />
<br />
DAOC expansion (woot, more pointless rvr crap with some pve treadmill work required to get there)<br />
<br />
The point is this:  Yes, Verant gets a lot of things wrong.  However, you keep playing.  I keep playing.  Half a million folks around the world keep playing.  Why?  Because, chances are, VI knows more about what they are doing with EQ than we do.  It's really that simple.<br />
<br />
My advice?  Think long and hard before you give away your stuff.  It would suck to come back and be a naked ass 51 shaman, especially when you havent seen but one of the levels that &quot;ruined the game&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Eh, lvl 60 didn't destroy the game obviously, but it did take two expansions for it to work properly.  Raising the level cap in Kunark was done pretty badly and did destroy what the game was pre-Kunark.  It was poorly thought out as are most new additions to the game, and it generally takes a full year before new things are really smoothed out.  I think that's the real gripe, VI is unable to think things through and get it right the first time.  Instead it's implement, and then take a year to really get working correctly.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the opinion of this Mrens guy is pretty ridiculous and plainly uneducated.  He also shows signs of not being terribly social.  Might be a good thing for all concerned (specially himself) if he just quit.  There are other hobbies, other activities, other games, and other experiences.  And failing that, there's always women to take up your time.  Go get married or something Mrens.  Then you'll recall with fondness all the freetime you used to have LOL!<br />
<br />
As to the people who called Juujuu and Chuk trolls . . . well I don't agree with them all the time either but they're long time posters and hardly trolls.  You can disagree without flaming you know.  I thought their replies were sardonic, sarcastic, and perhaps the &quot;retarded&quot; bit was over the top.  But with a silly post like that, you're bound to make some people impatient with you.</div></div><hr />

Flaming and arguing on message boards is like attending a trailer trash Thanksgiving after the turkey (the Wild Turkey, in this case) has been passed out.<br />

I used to say it was like running in the Special Olympics (ie, you may win, but you're still retarded) but one of my kids' friends participates.  And he has far more manners than many of the posters here.  &quot;Retard&quot; might actually be complimentary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I find his delcaration that lvl 60 ruined the game rather funny. If he's lvl 51 now odds are he probably wasn't even playing when they raised the lvl cap from 50 to 60. So odds are he is doing nothing but spewing useless crap that he read someone from someone who was probably just as uneducated as he is.  Since it seems like he probably started playing after the game was already broke why did he keep playing for a period of time to get up to lvl 51 and gather up the gear he's now looking to give away?<br />
<br />
You make so little sense it's funny.<br />

I may have something pos to chip in here:<br />
<br />
 The level cap will increase to 65. Those levels will have inherent benefits much like previous levels. However, they will not be exactly the same. The rate of advancement in character levels is designed to feel more natural and not take the punishing time commitment required between 51 and 60. We understand the frustration that painfully long levels can cause, and hope not to repeat that experience for players. This, combined with the new bonuses for fighting higher level opponents, should make leveling seem less like something that you have to do and more like something that just happens as you play. However some leaks of info from the Test Server seem to indicate that the Level cap may indeed be raised to Level 65. Some theories are that this raise will only be effective within the Planar worlds of the expansion i.e. You would be Level 65 in the Plane of War but only Level 60 in Luclin or Norrath. We will all have to sit back and wait for further information to emerge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">As to the people who called Juujuu and Chuk trolls . . . well I don't agree with them all the time either but they're long time posters and hardly trolls. You can disagree without flaming you know. I thought their replies were sardonic, sarcastic, and perhaps the &quot;retarded&quot; bit was over the top. But with a silly post like that, you're bound to make some people impatient with you.<br />
<br />
Generally, the more outlandish the original claims, the more &quot;colorful&quot; the reply is that I'll give.  This fool comes here, with a level 51 character and states that Verant sucks ass for making the level cap go from 60 to 65.  His reasoning?  Because going from 50 to 60 sucked ass too.  But.....level 51s don't know **** about that.  They can see what other people are doing, but he hasn't experienced that if his level 51 is his only character, which I'm guessing it is, or some of his gear would have been better.  There's nothing wrong with his gear for his level.  But if his 51 was only a twink, he'd have twinked better IMO.  As such, he has no experience to back up his arguement concerning his claims.  On the other hand, me, and many of the other posters have endured the 50s, gotten to level to level 60 about a year ago, raided our assess off, and have started to grind through the AAs.  Aside from this jackass's inflamatory post, I haven't seen a single post from anyone in at least 9 months saying how the level 60 cap ruins the game.  Maybe it's because no one else thinks the same?<br />
<br />
If the original poster had come here in a non confrontational manner and said that he didn't think the 65 cap was going to be a good thing, because he didn't like the 60 cap, I'd ask him why he thought that.  There could be quite valid reasons why he didn't think the 60 cap was a good thing.  But he didn't choose to go that route.  He choose to start shooting off his mouth about how the 60 cap sucketh, and therefore the 65 cap must sucketh worse.  He gave no reasoning for his opinion.  He gave no insights as to why 60 cap is bad.  He just looked like some fanboy for another game going on about Verant hates us! or some other nonsense.  I enjoy a good discussion about things that I have a relevant opinion.  I would have enjoyed talking about the good aspects of the 60 cap that I've discovered.  I would have enjoyed asking him what relevance his level 51 has in deciding why level 60 is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Instead, his attitude he copped when he posts his first post made him a target in my mind.  He was a jibbering idiot.  I gauged my response based on his initial stance.  Confrontation met with harsh resistance.  Seeing this person leave causes me no distress.  Some level 51er I've never met that I'd probably never interact with decides to quit playing over something he's never experienced, and never will.  Pardon my apathy over his distress about leaving.  I really don't even want people like him in this &quot;community&quot;.  It's clear he never even wanted to talk about the matter in a civil manner, so that's why I didn't try.<br />
<br />
Or, you can just ignore my logical reasoning behind the way I post and call me a troll.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I am level 60. <br />
<br />
With three charecters. <br />
<br />
I leveled a Thief to 60 first. A human thief named Feather. I was never in an uberguild. The largest mob that Feather killed was Trakanon, Cazic thule, Innoruk. I have however been down and seen The dragon in DN. I had been to ToV. At one point I was being courted by Magister. (My connection sucked, and I did not want to go the uberguild route. I to this day still hate raids)<br />
<br />
When I decided that Feather was too constrained in playstyle. (Oh look more backstab damage) I picked back up on Snoww.<br />
<br />
(She was level 45ish I belive Might have been 51 from a few days of soloing when Feather couldnt get groups.) <br />
<br />
I was having Fun with Snoww again. Tanking. Soloing. Grouping. It was all there. All of my friends I had outleveled with Feather Were right around Snoww's Level so she was very fun to play again.<br />
<br />
So I played Snoww. 2-3 hours a night. Working 45-50 hours a week. Going out on Weekends. Yet she got to 60. She has over time aquired All of her spells from kunark. (**** Guardian wyrms)<br />
<br />
Snoww Now has 48 AA points as well.<br />
<br />
About the time Snoww was level 59 I got a new computer. My old computer was sitting in a corner. But was able to run Luclin. (Just Barely)<br />
<br />
I Networked them up and Moved over my third charecter from my account to a new account. Pana. My Enchanter.  Our Guild didnt have a chanter and I had a level 43 chanter that a long long time ago was my Main before Velious was out. A Friend who had a 60 enchanter said he would play her so we would have an experianced enchanter. That never worked out he couldnt give up all his gear and epic to play a 43 again.<br />
<br />
So Pana started following Snoww around. Mezzing when need be. Giving clarity and haste to my groups.<br />
<br />
Pana is now 60 with 8 AA points. <br />
<br />
Snoww has zero Skyshrine armour.  Pana has none as well. Neither of them are uber. Pana has sat out of a good 70% of all groups because I wouldnt allow a hot box to take xp from a real live person. <br />
<br />
Yet both are 60 with a few aa. <br />
<br />
Yall know how? I would log off Somewhere close to mobs I can kill. I had friends log off there as well. We would normally log on withen 45 minutes of each other (Thanks Normal schedules) We would hunt till Midnight then I would normally be the first to log off.<br />
<br />
Most of the time 8 Pm to Midnight. With some weekeds long time playing some Zero hours on. <br />
<br />
That is how you get to 60. Not Running around looking for the next peice of loot that will give you 1 more AC and 3 more hp. Not looking for that rare drop to give to your twink. Not spending 2 hours getting everyone together to go try and do some big named mob where only 1 group gets any xp and everyone else fights to get the lucky people more loot.<br />
<br />
Just logging on with 4-6 people and Wandering around zones killing nonstop. (Lots and lots of chardok)<br />
<br />
That is how I have gotten 60. And I have had a hell of alot of fun doing it too.<br />
<br />
60 is not hard to get. If you can kill a single blue mob you can get 60. You just keep killing till you get there. What I did was take the people I had and make sure we did not die. Did not waste time. And did not work to make twinks better. We worked to make each of us better. We did not camp greens to get a peice of loot. We ignored the loot and got some xp in places we should not have been.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to PoP I will be able to go explore and Die in all sorts of new places. The levels will come in time. The gear will come in time. But I want to have fun Right now.<br />

Getting 60 isn't about having no life. You don't have to be a jobless 16 year old to be 60. Kunark has been out for what, two years? A half level a month and you're 60. So let's stop with the &quot;OMG 60 IS UBER L337&quot; crap.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree with this statement.  In all the ways that count and matter to other people playing (gear, levels, aa's, raid attendance, etc) the only deciding factor is time.  So the kids get fast levels, best gear, belong to the best guilds, and do most everything first.  Thus, the unemployed people with no lives = most uber.  <br />

<br />
As usual, Milltard shows his lack of understanding of the game.<br />
1.  Unskilled players don't enter VT.<br />
2.  I play about 3-4 hours per night before I go in to work at my full time job.  That's not a lot of playtime.  I seem to be doing fairly ok, going to Ssra, clearing NToV, PoG, regularly doing the Velious Royals, and having my VT key completed.<br />
3.  People with crap personalities (like yours Millman) don't get anywhere in EQ.  My guild is very picky about who gets in and who doesn't.  It requires a good portion of the guild to vote for the person applying to enter the guild.  Greed and poor attitude give you a quick kick in the ass to send you on your way to some other crap guild that your attitude might work in.<br />
<br />
What you need to do to get to level 60 is:<br />
1.  log in for about 2 hours per day<br />
2.  kill mobs for most of that time period<br />
<br />
If you took 1/10 the time you spent bitching about ubers, and used that to level, you would have been level 60 long before we stopped caring that you stopped playing.</div></div><hr />

Huh, nice generalizations.  I work a full time job, put in a lot of overtime.  My work also requires a lot of travel.  My guild isn't the most uber on the server, most of us are working people, a lot of them older (several 40+).  We might not get to uber content first, but we do get there.  As far as honest and nice people with good personalities, I wouldn't hang out with them if they weren't.<br />
<br />
Unlike some people who expect some kind of magical free pass to 60 and full &quot;temple of the unemployed&quot; gear, we knew it would take us longer than some other guilds, so we settled in to enjoy the ride, not the destination.</div></div><hr />

thats 15 - 20 hours a week (not including the weekend).  Thats ~15% of the ENTIRE DAY spent sitting in front of a computer screen logged into Norrath.  Thats a second job.  I suspect that you spend more time playing EQ than anything else except a) sleeping and b) your first job.<br />

<br />
Being &quot;good at EQ&quot; is like being &quot;good at watching sitcoms on TV&quot;.  It is a fun way to waste time; nothing more, nothing less.  I suppose that there are some people out there whose self-esteem derives from the fact that &quot;I can watch Seinfeld better than anyone else!!&quot;  I pity them, too.<br />
<br />
<br />
(2)  Along the lines of what Tain said, they did F up gama balance pretty badly when they increased the level caps in Kunark.  Let us hope that they do not do the sama again.  The base problem is that the core game mechanics were simply not designed to accomodate nearly so much expansion, which means that everything is built on a very unstable foundation.  The higher they build, the more dangerous this becomes.  They will be lucky to tread water until EQ2, which I expect to be much better in this regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">3-4 hours a day isn't a lot.<br />
As a comparison, any day I go out to the bar, I spend about 4 hours there in total.<br />
If I go out for dinner and a movie or something with a friend, that's about 4-5 hours gone there.<br />
If I go out to play cards with friends, there's about 6 hours used up there.<br />
Before I played EQ I was in university, and spent 3 hours a day travelling to the university and back to my home, commuting each day.<br />
Hell, even just going out for a rollerblade near where I live takes up 2 hours of my time.<br />
<br />
I used to play a lot more, like 6-8 hours a day, just about ever day.<br />
That was a lot.<br />
3-4 hours a day is nothing much.<br />

I suspect the non-eq player spends way more time in front of the TV. I spend just as much time with wife/kid. I work just as hard. I even still make time to read. BUT, I wach ZERO minutes of TV a week - except for the occasional Barney, but that's not my doing. That's the cost to me and my EQ playing friends.<br />

I have 41 days played since Aug 01 - A solid month of my life. <br />
<br />
Juujuu - 3-4 hours isn't an extremely unreasonable amount of time to spend doing one thing...It's just when you look at the numbers over a week that it gets surprising.  If I spent 15 - 20 hours a week in a bar my liver would never forgive me.  <br />
<br />
<br />
mormegil: You just described me.  EQ has replaced TV (except for Raymond) and I usually only get online once the wife is asleep.  Nice to have people to talk and interact with in the late evening hours.<br />
<br />
My point is, it's downright *spooky* how much time we have invested in this game.  And historically, the more time you spend in the game in large blocks, the better content you experience.  No one can log in for 2 hours a night and do the Hole part of our Epic, for example.<br />
<br />
I can't say if it has gotten better or not...I've heard about (in the old days)  3 day straight PoA raids, and 12 - 18 hours in Fear before...dunno if today's high end raids are just as time consuming.  I'm sure more peeps here have the answers as to how long it takes to clear VT.</div></div><hr />

Mill was 4 for 5, sure his generalisations were overboard, but he's still toned down compared to his old posts.<br />
<br />
TRUE=all it takes is time to get to 60<br />
TRUE=you don't need to be skilled to be uber (have you ever had someone fall asleep on a raid? How skilled are they as they drool on the keyboard?  Awake, they might be God's gift to EQ, but that's not necessary.  They just have to be there and put in the time.)<br />
TRUE=the origional poster was &quot;premature&quot;, kind word for foolish, but I'm ok with that.<br />
TRUE=the level cap was absurdly implemented, when it happened that was the popular opinion on this board.<br />
FALSE=&quot;EQ is all about time played, no skill, certainly no personality needed, if you have the time, and the greed, you are uber, if you work, or are an honest nice guy, you are pimped.&quot;<br />
It's NOT ALL about time played, certainly you can achieve anything by putting in the time, but its not what its all about.  I've played for fun all along and I'll hit 60 in a couple weeks playing 10-12 hours a week, raiding, fishing, sitting in a zone chatting with a friend doing nothing but talking cause they're feeling down or whatever and EQ is a convienient chat program.  It would still be removed from my machine if it were not for my friends.  Even so I have almost full HoT armour (minus BP which I don't want because I have better), I'm almost 60, I'm still having fun.  I bet Mill played more than I do ;)<br />
<br />
Snap made a great point about time played.  You can't argue with it unless you compare it with people who play more, which of course further reinforces his point.<br />
<br />
Some people here need to take a freaking pill.  Its JUST a game.  Sometimes I swear its like making a comment about the endgame being gimpy=insulting someone's mother.  Likely not quite that extreme, but some folks seem to be comming off as defensive.</div></div><hr />

Can we see a RL pic of you? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I think people who are lvl 51 should **** about how a lvl cap will affect the game as it won't matter at all to them.  They aren't even at the current lvl cap.<br />
<br />
Flaming this guy was not wrong.  If you post a blatantly foolish statement claiming things as fact that clearly are not and don't expect to be flamed, then maybe you shouldn't post at all.<br />
<br />
This guy said that the lvl 60 cap ruined the game!  He has NO EVIDENCE and considering that the subscription rate has increased since Kunark (or atleast had since the last time they published numbers), I say he's wrong and an idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Pcapone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Well I find it funny that you all attack each other and thats why we arent going to get anywhere. The other classes all unite and get stuff accomplished, while we fight like 12 year olds on a schoolyard. Get it together people and try to work this out.<br />
<br />
its the only chance we have</div></div><hr />

Could you explain exactly why you used this analogy?<br />
And btw, I've spent 3 hours in bars before, especially when Peel's Pub in Montreal still held wet T-Shirt contests :D  Doesn't mean I'm chugging it around the clock.  If I really want to get trashed, I could do it in the space of 15 minutes ordering 5 shots of Prairy Fire (tequila + tabasco).  Rips your throat apart, give it a try one day :)</div></div><hr />
