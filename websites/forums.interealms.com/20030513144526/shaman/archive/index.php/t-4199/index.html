<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so Im playing Counter-Strike, and I get a connection probelm(cable modem) and I think no problem, well, now each time it has 4 reconnects then fails (it always does that) and now I can't connect on to any CS servers. So I say, Ill play EQ, I go and it can't connect/patch. But the catch is, I can go online, and its as fast as its supposed to be. Now this really confuses me cause it was in the middle of the game. Anyone have any idea???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you have a firewall installed? <br />
<br />
Or have you _EVER_ had &quot;ZoneAlarm&quot; or &quot;ZoneAlarmPro&quot; installed on your computer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think I have a Firewall on the network, but not sure. Im pretty sure I don't have zone alarm, and the weird thing is it was in the middle of playing, so its not like I downloaded something, and it was working before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">that's pretty unusual. . . I dunno what to tell you on that one bro :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, im still elvel 48, haven't played for a month and a half, and im pissed. I still can't get in, but Counter-Strike works! So now, its just EQ thats broken. And I go to eq.com to check the tech help there, but that website is down for the week :( . I really want to pla, any ideas?? I double click on EQ shortcut, and it has the mini Patching Everquest (the little one thats gray, and just has an empty bar below it) and it just stays there, then says check your connection (which i know is working...)</div></div><hr />
