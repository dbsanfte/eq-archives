<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ferendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I would like to lead a raid on the Plane of Fear on Sunday the 23rd. In the event that it is cleared or camped already by 11am EST then as a backup we'll head to kael for armor/faction. <br />
<br />
All KoE members, and KoE friends are welcome to attend, level limit being 46+. If we do get into fear we'll be useing the standardized planar loot list. It is posted on the boards here for those not knowing what I'm talking about;) <br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me in the game if you see me before then:) <br />
<br />
Meeting places will be in the Feerot just outside fear portal if we can get fear, or just inside Kael on WL side of zone=)<br />
<br />
Sincerely Yours,<br />

PS: Due to the air raid being this weekend, this event may have to be pushed back a week or so, I won't be able to make it to air so might see if we can get enough people not going up there to still go to fear or kael, if air is taken though this raid will definately be on and hope to see everyone there!  I will put an update on this on wether or not air proceeds and if we can get enough people that are not already up in the sky=)<br />

Sorry folks, air was a great success so looks like this will have to wait till next weekend=)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khallim Khallash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll be there..  here's hoping for Fear!! :)<br />
<br />
Should be lvl 52 by then, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You guys are raiding air?  Cool, I wonder which island you will get to<br />
As far as I know, the crown of elemental mastery isn't no drop, so if you guys get to the eight island (you never know) and an extra crown drops and is about to rot, could you loot it for me ? That'd be really neat :)<br />
Hope that raid goes well<br />
<br />
And I should be here for the fear raid if it continues, but it all depends if I go to church or not.<br />

Lots of guilds use Sunday as a big raid day. I get out of Work at 6am CTS, I will get Nekky there and park him so maybe others will think it is taken.<br />
