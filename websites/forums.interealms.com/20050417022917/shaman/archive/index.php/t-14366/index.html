<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, after a week of dying, I've finally earned enough exp into 57 to keep it after a single death. <br />
<br />
Now, here's my problem. I want to hit level 61 as fast as I can. I have a Malo lined up for me in the guild bank, and I can nab Wonder Dog in the Bazaar for ~500pp. Unfortunately the game doesn't like when I level. It takes me forever for some inconceivable reason, and kills me repeatedly. I can't ever get PoP groups unless they want me to heal... Which I can't manage with Chloroblast.<br />
<br />
So, I'm looking for advice on where / what to hunt. Prime solo spots for me are Chardok and Katta (slow but easy exp), Jaggedpine (Even easier, much slower with no exp bonus, though), and everyone's favorite, Dulak. I also like the Bridge room in Torgiran, which gave 1% normal exp per kill at 56. Not so sure what it does at 57. I can also BARELY manage the goo camp in PoD. If the heavy-hitting guilds would clear out, Veksar would be good, too.<br />
<br />
Grouped... I only seem to get lame PoD or PoI groups that expect me to heal. Blah. Can't get a guild group, because i'm still too low for Teir 2, and I don't wanna be powerleveled, anyway. Very frustrating point for me. Any advice is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">gues ur very unlucky, at 55 WITH LFG ON i was getting tells to come join grps in pop, fairly often. I always refuse to be in a grp with out a main healer, so i guess that linked to your death rate!  We just cant heal enough pre 58.<br />
<br />
Now at 56 i get invites to be slower in tier 2  wich is nice, however DONT try this unless grp has a mage  enc or bard to debuff mobs- or ull get resists 50% of time, which mean ul die ALOT.<br />
<br />
Was duoing with a 61 necro in veksar last night, the sentrys are not too tuff and exp was reasonable; its slow on the gobbos, so dont bother!<br />
<br />
Was in a grp of 56 shaman, 61 necro  52 monk 56 rogue in seb crypt for 4hrs yesterday, made 6blues of exp.  Not the best but was a FUN camp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ditto in Veksar.<br />
<br />
In my mind, the &quot;best&quot; experience is the experience you get when you don't even think about it.;<br />
<br />
Some guildies and I crawled through Veksar for a couple hours a few nights ago and I had gotten a yellow and a bit before I had even noticed.  The exp/kill isn't amazing but it was just the fact that I was having so much fun I didn't even think to LOOK at my exp bar (except when I got to like 85% experience then it was a countdown to ding 55 hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've played my character for about 2 years and I'm level 56.  Which probably means I have no business responding to this post.  :p <br />
<br />
However, I did just recently stumble upon some XP which may or may not be a good spot for you either solo or duo.  In the North West corner of The Grey is a camp of Revenants.  They're undead and have the amount of HP you would expect from Luclin mobs.  However, the camp is always open (at least on Zeb) and the xp was decent at 56.  It's soloable, the mobs are melee only, the spawns are static, and you can avoid the wanderers fairly easily.  It never hurts to swing by the Ssra temple and see if the named golems are up either.   ;) <br />
<br />
I have to admit though, I'm amazed you aren't /role most of the time so that you won't be barraged with requests to slow mobs in the Planes.  I get at least one invite a night if I'm not /role.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and I've done healing in PoI and PoN.  Not fun.  Not fun at all.  If nothing else, a group at least needs a CH druid.  Maybe if they are busy healing they won't be charming even-con mobs just to have them turn on the group at the worst possible time.   :mad: <br />
<br />
Don't forget, you need some type of EB spell/item for The Grey.  No atmosphere and all that.</div></div><hr />
