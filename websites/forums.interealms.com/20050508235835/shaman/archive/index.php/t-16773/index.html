===============================<br />
<br />
Unparalleled New Trade Skill Quest Goes Live Online October 8th! <br />
<br />
Of course you know that every EQrpg product contains clues to exclusive <br />
new online quests. Yes, the quests have been a while in implementation, but <br />
the next one makes the delay worth the wait. A huge quest that rivals the POTC <br />
trade skill quest goes live on October 8th, 2003. In fact, the rewards for the quest <br />
are superior to the POTC earrings (EQo players know what we means), and one <br />
of the rewards can even be attained without the complexity of the <br />
trade skill portion of the quest. <br />
<br />
Remember the oldie but goodie, the Robe of the Oracle? Well, like the <br />
rest of Norrath's inhabitants, the Oracle thought it was high time for him <br />
to upgrade, so he's about to unveil his Grand Robe of the Oracle. Or for <br />
the clerics, druids, and shamans among you, he has a Grand Tunic of the <br />
Oracle to offer. The Oracle will want your Velious robe/armor in exchange <br />
but take his word for it, it's a trade you want to make. <br />
<br />
And the other item? How about a phylactery like the one that enabled <br />
Miragul's transformation into a lich? With EverQuest trade skills, <br />
anything is possible! <br />
<br />
There will be winners on every server, and there are fully seven ways to win, <br />
which will be announced at the Chicago Fan Faire this September 26-28. <br />
Watch the EQrpg.com forums for details on other ways to win. <br />

But now I can't seem to find any reference to it at all.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i believe it was on a patch message, and that would explain why you cant find it.  Does this mean velious zones are going to be crowded to the max now?</div></div><hr />

Is it new trade skills? Quest? Or a game show? I think sony has hit a all time new with &quot;We are going to do something... We just dont know what&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm... it just doesnt sound right... the wording (and misspellings) do not seem like something Sony would put out.  <br />
<br />
I call bull**** until I see it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is what i remember reading (it had to have been a news thing with the patcher):<br />
<br />
&quot;Further, he said, &quot;There are a lot of details in the books that you're not going to get anywhere else.&quot; Text clues within the Player's Handbook allow online players to unlock a new quest in the game. And, information taken from Sony's original design documents reveal information that has never been programmed into the game, such as whole new zones.&quot;<br />
<br />
this is in regards to the eq rpg and the carrot used to get us to buy it.  Full article at:<br />

A strange progression of mobs to kill but the intermediary/non-tradeskill reward sure looks nice:<br />
<br />
Grand Tunic of the Oracle Submitted by: Tiatiah Mariposa   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 0.9 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Slot: CHEST<br />
Focus Effect: Flowing Thought IV<br />
AC: +20 Sta: +18 Wis: +20 Fire Resist: +10 Disease Resist: +10 Cold Resist: +10 Magic Resist: +10 Poison Resist: +10 HP: +100 Mana: +125  <br />
Classes: Cleric Druid Shaman<br />
<br />
No LDoN slot on it apparently which is rather unusual but not impossible.<br />
<br />
I wonder what crazy stats can be on the final reward if this is true :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Almost done with the tradeskill portion, its pretty easy so far.  Seems like you can do the whole quest with under 200 skills, no where near as hard as aid grimel quest.  So the reward probly wont be that great. Just a matter of figuring out combines<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, the reward does kinda suck.  The FT is nice, the hp/mana are about par, but the AC sucks ass.  Great for a druid, but I dont know a single cleric/shaman that would sacrifice 30+AC for an extra 4 mana/tic.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion, they should have made the result a Augment that would work in chest slot only.  Add the same stats, and add another part to the quest in which the questor can make a chain or plate BP (unadorned bp's, 200 triv or so, no drop) to add the piece too.  As it is, I know of a few clerics and shaman that are capable of making this that wont even try it cause the AC sucks SOOO bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those who believe that AC is worthless, or those that choose to root-rot would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do you have to do all these trade skills, or can you just kill the mobs for your tunic? The guides don't explain it very well as to what you're supposed to do(at least not for me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you dont need tradeskills for the bp atm, no required lvl on the bp either. nice twinkage<br />
<br />
but since one of the items needed is no longer dropping.  you wont see your bp till next patch at the earliest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The BP/Robe and the Phylactery are UNRELATED REWARDS. No tradeskills needed for the BP/Robe. The BP/Robe is not a progressive reward, it is an end reward.</div></div><hr />
