<p><b> Quest Walkthrough: Collar of the Storm/Girdle of Reflection</b></p>

<p><b>ATTENTION: This is a work in progress.  If it looks unfinished that's because it is.  When this little note is gone then you'll know it's completed <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""></b><br />
<br />
<hr><br />
<br />
<b>This quest begins in Wakening Lands with Lieutenant Krofer.  You are informed of the quest after you have completed some other minor tasks.  Your faction needs to be amiably or higher with Storm Giants (Kromzek) and you don't really need to have Kromrif faction at all.  (It would make things just a tiny bit easier but not much)</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'I am prepared'<br />
<br />
Lieutenant Krofer says 'Very well. We've decided to attack the small Sifaye village northeast of here and I want you to coordinate the attack. I will send you into Kael Drakkel with a request for troop assistance. After the squad is assembled you will lead them to the staging point where you will oversee the battle. Here is the request. Take it to Drioc in the city and return here with the troops. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-KrofersRequisition.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Krofer's Requisition.<br />
<br />
<b>Now you go into Kael Drakkel and visit Staff Sergeant Drioc in the bank.  Hand him Krofer's Requisition.</b><br />
<br />
Staff Sergeant Drioc takes the note and begins reading. Seeing a certain passage, he squints and rereads, his brow furrowed. He glances over at you and says, 'Very well. I will assign you a squad lead by Corporal Hlash. They will rendezvous with you out in the field. Oh and take this back to Krofer.' <br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-SignedRequisition.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Signed Requisition.<br />
<br />
<b>Back into Wakening Lands you go.  Be prepared for the hand in, though.  When you hand in the Signed Requisition, 4 storm giants will spawn near the Kael zoneline.  Make sure people in the zone are aware that they will be spawning there because if they are KoS they will get severely hurt or killed very fast.  Also be aware that if you are KoS to frost giants and you aggro one near these 4 storm giants, the storm giants will attack you.</b><br />
<br />
Lieutenant Krofer takes the note and looks it over, then sighs and says, 'This will have to be enough. The squad should be here shortly. When they arrive you will march with them to the staging area near the village of those insect Sifaye. When you are satisfied with the formation, give the corporal the order to attack and observe the battle. After the village is destroyed return this report to me and we'll plan our next move. <br />
<br />
<b>At this point you receive the Mission Report but you cannot turn it in to Lieutenant Krofer, yet!  If you do you'll have to start over.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-MissionReport.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Report:attack on the Sifaye.<br />
<br />
Berzerker Voldak judges you amiably -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br />
Berzerker Dolvad judges you amiably -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br />
Corporal Hlash judges you amiably -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br />
Disciple Atharm judges you amiably -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br />
<br />
Lieutenant Krofer says 'They have arrived, mercenary. They know the way to the staging area, follow them there. When all is clear, give Hlash the order to [attack]. Remember to stay out of the battle and observe. The squad's mission is to destroy and inspire fear; yours is to collect information on how they fight and how we can crush them even easier in the future. Rallos Zek is watching this day, do not disappoint him. <br />
<br />
Lieutenant Krofer shouts 'The squad is on their way, mercenary! Do not lose them! <br />
<br />
<b>Now you march with the 4 giants out to a sifaye camp.  This is a long walk so make sure you have invis potions or your invisibility spell up.  There's lots of wandering KoS mobs in Wakening Lands.  The giants take their places in front of the camp eventually and Corporal Hlash will despawn and respawn.  Once he has respawned you target the Corporal and say 'attack'.  This will start the battle.</b><br />
<br />
Your Location is 1673.14, -272.65, -191.41<br />
<br />
Corporal Hlash says 'Hold here squad<br />
<br />
<b>About 5 seconds after he says the above he will despawn/respawn.  Make sure you have him targetted to see when this happens.  Once he has done so issue the 'attack' order.</b><br />
<br />
Corporal Hlash shouts 'Destroy them!! <br />
<br />
Suddenly , all around the Sifaye village, several beings phase into reality. Their eyes glow with the golden light of divinity, obviously sent from a higher plane of existence. The Kromzek assault squad is surely doomed. You decide to withdraw and report what you have found, perhaps the Lieutenant will understand. <br />
<br />
Berzerker Voldak says 'Lieutenant! Look! Where did they come from?! We're d..AARRGH!! <br />
<br />
Corporal Hlash says 'Grraaaggh! AMBUSH!! Die well! <br />
<br />
Corporal Hlash says 'Puny creature, feel the might of the Kromrif as I crush you into mortar for our walls! <br />
<br />
a sifaye thane says 'You are not welcome in Tunares sacred lands! <br />
<br />
<b>At this point the giants are ambushed by several level 60 phase panthers and other miscellaneous Plane of Growth mobs.  If you are at the location where the giants stopped then you should be out of aggro range.  When you give the order to attack, Lieutenant Krofer despawns/respawns way back by the Kael zoneline.  You need to run as fast as possible and hand in the Mission Report to Krofer.  If you don't do it in time he will despawn/respawn again and just eat the report.  Don't bother to watch the fight between the giants and creatures of Tunare.</b><br />
<br />
Lieutenant Krofer  says 'Failure! Incompetence! The whole squad anihilated! I knew this would happen if left in the hands of a worthless mercenary! Well, you can take this report back to Drioc then. Now get out of my sight, mercenary. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-ReportOfFailure.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Report of Failure.<br />
<br />
<b>Head back inside to the bank in Kael and hand Staff Sergeant Drioc the Report of Failure.</b><br />
<br />
Staff Sergeant Drioc reads over the report, his face begins to turn red with anger. Drioc shouts, 'How can this be?! I sent you a squad of some of our best trained men and you had them destroyed!! This was supposed to be a routine raid and you return in FAILURE!! I would crush you under my boot right now if I wasn't so angry but I think I'll send you to my finacier. YOU can explain what happened and why his investments have been lost. Now take your carcass out of here!' <br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-ReportOfFailure.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Report of Failure.<br />
<br />
<b>Now head to the building diagonally across from the bank.  In the back room of that building is Noble Helssen.  He is Drioc's fiancier.  Hand him the Report of Failure.</b><br />
<br />
Noble Helssen takes the report from you and places it in a pocket without even glancing at it. He says, 'Do not worry, Chromite . I know of the planar creatures who eliminated my troops. The fault is not yours but of that fool Drioc's. The Savage land is not just a simple forest as those idiots in the field believe. It is a cradle of life and the forces that drive it. Within that forest is a nexus, a gateway to another plane of existence, the Plane of Growth.' <br />
Your faction standing with Kromzek got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Kromrif got better.<br />
Your faction standing with KingTormax got better.<br />
Your faction standing with ClawsofVeeshan got worse.<br />
<br />
<b>You are given the following:</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-InscribedVeliumTablet.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Note from Noble Helssen.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-EnchantedVeliumMask.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Enchanted Velium Mask.<br />
<br />
You say, 'What nexus'<br />
<br />
Noble Helssen says 'Our soldiers fell victim to the denizens of that plane and unless we can find some way to stop this from happening, the land of Wakening will never be under our control. Many have suggested just destroying the Nexus but they are short-sighted fools. My vision is not only to control the resources that forest provides, but also to control the very force of Growth itself! You will help me to do this, mercenary. <br />
<br />
You say, 'How can I help you'<br />
<br />
Noble Helssen says 'The tablet I have given you is inscribed with runes of binding. I am owed a favor and it has come time to use it. There is a venerable sea turtle that lives along the warmer part of the coast, where the ice floes begin to break up. His name is Corudoth. Find him and speak with him. Remind him of his obligation to me and if he is not forthcoming in his answers, tell him he owes me. Then show him the tablet. He will tell you what to do. He will most likely be beneath the ocean.  The mask I gave you should help. <br />
<br />
<b>From here you head to the Iceclad Ocean and speak to Corudoth, the turtle.  He is under an iceberg so you are supposed to use the mask to keep talking with him.  The mask can be activated while worn or while in a main inventory slot.  Unfortunately the spell on the mask requires you to have fish scales to cast the spell!  Here is what happens if you don't have fish scales:</b><br />
<br />
You begin casting Enduring Breath.<br />
Your Enchanted Velium Mask begins to glow.<br />
You are missing some required spell components.<br />
You are missing Fish Scales.<br />
Your spell is interrupted.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Corudoth'<br />
<br />
Corudoth seems to completely ignore you. After close examination you begin to wonder if this creature is actually alive. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Noble Helssen sent me'<br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'Hmm? Who is this Elleson? Sounds..familiar. No, I do not know any Elisawn..go away please.. <br />
<br />
You say, 'You owe Helssen'<br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'What?! I owe him nothing! Nothing at all! I didn't ask him to.., err. What proof do you have? How do I know he sent you? Bah, leave me, Half Elf. <br />
<br />
<b>Hand Corudoth the Inscribed Velium Tablet.</b><br />
<br />
Corudoth curses and goes into a fit of frustration before finally giving in. The ancient sea turtle finally says, 'Fine. I don't know what Helssen wants with that but I know where you can find it. Years and years back I traveled with a group was called the Icy Mugs. We were a mercenary company out for fun and profit, and there was plenty of that. During our adventures we ran across a great many foes. <br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
<b>You receive the following:</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-LockOfDwarvenHair.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Item of Sentiment.<br />
<br />
You say, 'What foes'<br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'Yes. One of note was the vile and evil sorcerer Rosh. A better example of depravtity and anti-morality I cannot think of. He researched magics destined to end all life on this cold chunk of rock and snow. We made it our mission to destroy him. In the end we defeated him, but alas our friend and comrade was slain. Poor Abrams was left cursed forever to wander that spire of ultimate loathing, the Tower of Frozen Shadow. <br />
<br />
You say, 'who is abrams'<br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'Abrams was a brave warrior and a good friend. His great maul could always be counted on to strike true as he used his body to shield others from greivous wounds. He sacrificed himself to save us from the eternal suffering he now endures up in that dark tower. The book you now seek, is in his possesion. You must first destroy his tormented form to free him from his madness. Tell him you seek the Arcanum and then give him the lock of hair I just gave you. You also will need the key? <br />
<br />
You say, 'What key'<br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'We ambushed Rosh on an expedition into the cursed Tower.  When we faced him, Abrams ran forward and grabbed the Arcanum. He held it to his chest as lightning and flame rained down upon him. With Rosh busy trying to save his book it gave Petcas and I enough time to strike Rosh down. We went to Abrams and found our friend left a smoking pile of Coldain ruin. He underwent a strange transformation in which the Arcanum was lost. We decided Petcas should keep the key. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Who is Petcas'<br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'Petcas has retired from the life of an adventurer as I have. I would not tell you where he is as he is a good friend, but what I owe Helssen is stronger than comraderie or even friendship so I must comply; it is the word of Veeshan. Petcas now owns a small bar in the Coldain city of Thurgadin. To get the key you must fight your way into the city and kill Petcas. I wish you a most horrendous death, Half Elf. Now leave me to my sleep. <br />
<br />
<b>Now you head into the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  On the sixth floor is a mob named 'incoherent spirit'.  He is a dwarven ghost and is a Shadow Knight.  Sometimes upon his death the lucid spirit of Abrams will spawn.  It can be rather frustrating trying to spawn the lucid spirit of Abrams.  The incoherent spirit has a long spawntime and Abrams doesn't always spawn from it.  Be prepared for a long wait.  The spawntime of the incoherent spirit is approximately 55 minutes long.  Sometimes the incoherent spirit will be wielding Abram's Axe of the Stoic.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, lucid spirit of Abrams'<br />
<br />
lucid spirit of Abrams says 'Where am I? Oh god no, please let this be a simple nightmare. Please don't hold my withering soul here any longer!  Who are you? Why have you freed me? Pleasef tell me it is over! <br />
<br />
You say, 'I seek the Arcanum'<br />
<br />
lucid spirit of Abrams says 'I can never give up the Arcanum. It's bound to me, is a part of me now. It represents the sacrifice I made to me friends.  It be the only thing that brings me any sliver of happiness. Only if ye kin replace it with somethin' of sentiment to me will I hand over the book. <br />
<br />
<b>Hand in the Lock of Dwarven Hair you received from Corudoth and you will receive the following:</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-ArcanumOfRosh.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Magically locked Tome.<br />
<br />
<b>Now go into Thurgadin near the Icewell Keep zoneline.  There is a bar there and the owner of that bar is Petcas Coldbeard.  You need to kill him for the key to unlock the book.  Best thing to do is to pull him to the Icewell Keep zoneline.  When you attack Petcas, Karey and Adia both disappear.</b><br />
<br />
Petcas Coldbeard says 'Who the h..Karey! Adia! Get hid an grab the guards!' He then rushes the attackers, a fearsome gleam in his coldain eyes. <br />
<br />
Karey yelps and falls to the floor, escaping via a secret trapdoor, presumably. <br />
<br />
Adia Coldbeard yelps and falls to the floor, escaping via a secret trapdoor, presumably. <br />
<br />
You have slain Petcas Coldbeard!<br />
Your faction standing with Coldain got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Kromzek got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Kromrif got better.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-AncientRustedKey.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Rosh's key.<br />
<br />
<b>Now you head back into Kael Drakkel and visit Noble Helssen again.  Hand him the Arcanum of Rosh and the Ancient Rusted Key.</b><br />
<br />
Noble Helssen says 'I have much to do, Chromite . Do not waste my time unless you have the Arcanum AND the key to open it. <br />
Noble Helssen says 'Ahhh, you suprise me mercenary. You have found the book as well as the key to open it. I must begin my research as soon as possible. But first, your reward. With this voucher you can receive 1 of the 3 treasures I will offer you. If given to Kellek you will receive an item worthy of a hearty and rugged combatant. If given to Wenglawks you will aquire an item to be worn by only the most pious. And if given to me I will give you a sorcerous trinket of my own design. <br />
<br />
Your faction standing with Kromzek got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Kromrif got better.<br />
Your faction standing with KingTormax got better.<br />
Your faction standing with ClawsofVeeshan got worse.<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/quests/zones/wakening/ID-HelssensVoucher.jpg" width=320" height="130" border="1"><br />
Item Lore: Helssen's Voucher.<br />
<br />
<b>You receive Helssen's Voucher.  Now you take that voucher and turn it in to the appropriate NPC for the reward you want.  Kellek Felhammer is just outside and to the left of Helssen's door.  He is the NPC you turn the voucher in to for the Collar of the Storm.  Wenglawks Kkeak is in the room with Noble Helssen.  Turn in the voucher to him if you want the Girdle of Reflection.  If you want Helssen's Prismatic Trinket, turn the voucher in to Helssen himself.</b><br />
<br />
Kellek Felhammer says 'So you are the mercenary I have been hearing about! Not what I expected. Anyway, here is your reward. Carry it well. Also, this noble's seal will prove your loyalty to anyone who is skeptical. <br />
<br />
<b>Your reward is the Collar of the Storm:</b><br />

<p>A little note about faction on this quest:<br />
<br />
If you or your guild is deciding to go to Claws of Veeshan faction I recommend you do a bit of killing in Skyshrine to get to amiably with the storm giants really quick.  Once you are at amiably, do this quest and then switch to Claws of Veeshan.  It's much easier to do it that way than to come back from being a Claws of Veeshan Ally and enemy #1 of Kromzek, of course.  <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
