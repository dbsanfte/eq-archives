<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Two items that will pump up your CR and FR by 50pts are a froggy crown and stone of morid. Froggy crowns are very cheap but you really have to shop around for the stone of morid. Lots of peeps like to charge 2-5k+ but with patience I bought mine for 100pp :)<br />
<br />
Other resist items that are easy to get and add to all resists are a velium blue diamond bracelet, velium diamond wedding ring and the blue diamond electrum earrings.</div></div><hr />

Unless you have a bottomless pit of money, it is unrealistic to buy all the resist gear that you would like to have. You have to be selective. Either go for items that have very high resist on one or two particular resist, such as stone of morid, or shield of the green dragon, or go for items that have some resist on all resists, such as plyer crafted diamond or blue diamond jewellery.<br />
<br />
Blue diamonds and diamonds are quite common these days. My suggestion would be to buy some player made resist jewellery. A diamond mask and 2 blue diamond earrings would be a good start and fairly cheap. I wouldn't bother with blue diamond bracers - you should look towards getting bracelets of sense and / or fortitude which have good resists anyway. You may wish to get some resist rings too. <br />
<br />
For raids it is also well worth knocking up a few resist potions - since negative stats have been removed from potions, they are actually quite good and cheap to make, and they stick with normal cast resist buffs</div></div><hr />
