<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all !!!<br />
<br />
I have a few questions about trade skills (to take 1 skill first..Baking for instance)<br />
<br />
I went to Eq'traders and there stood something about Yield#?....<br />
What does that mean ?? is it the skill required ??<br />
<br />
What is the easiest and fastest to get the skill up etc. ?</div></div><hr />

Have no idea what yeild number means unless its the number of items produced from one recipe. The EASISEST way to get upto 135 in a matter of an hour or two is this. (both Cid and I can atest to it). <br />
<br />
Get yourself a spit, go into WC and buy 1 backpack full of fish, <br />
<br />
goto ec and there is a merchant just inside the zone line that sells batwings, buy a backpack full of batwings<br />
<br />
Sit<br />
<br />
Put one batwing and one fish and click combine. After doing this about 500 times you will be at 135</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The yield # does mean how many you will get out of each try. Like with the different eggs that can be foraged you can get anywhere between 1 and 7 or more clumps of dough from them.<br />
<br />
Lokes, I've found baking to be great fun. When you get your skill up you can make some interesting things. Note: White chocolate cookies and muffins seem to go over great with people.....Ask Kindo and Arsecn hehe<br />
<br />
Good luck oh and Fish rolls are good for monks. I find that they will take them without force and even try to pay you for them. They are light and they are a hearty meal so they last longer! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WOOT thanks a ton =) I will start my practicing now..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fish can be bought in Neriak, 2nd zone near the fountain. Let me know if you want some, ill buy you a bag or 2 full.</div></div><hr />
