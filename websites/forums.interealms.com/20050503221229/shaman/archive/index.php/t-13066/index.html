<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, yeah, I'm a masochist.  I figure I better get that out of the way first, cause some of you will probably ask.  That being said . . .<br />
<br />
I'm in the process of doing the &quot;Aid Grimmel&quot; tradeskill quest.  For those of you who don't know, it requires at a minimum 220+ in all skills, and 240 (240 = the max of 252 with a 5% mod) is a much better idea.  Reward is an fairly nice earring--25AC, 25 to all stats, 15 to all resists, 130hp, 150mana, flowing thought 3, and preservation of xegony (15% mana savings to all spells but CH).<br />
<br />
So, the questions:<br />
<br />
What area has the best drops on Acrylia?  Are acrylia shafts the best method to get fletching up to 240?<br />
<br />
I think fletching is the only one I have left that's gonna be bad.  I've got pottery to 200, fletching to 200, smithing to 240, jewelcraft to 240, brewing to 240, baking to 191, and tailoring to 156.<br />
<br />
Thanks, guys!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't sound like that good an earing to me, as you'd have to spend all that money to get those skillz up AND people would know to come to you for any trades they want done (a definite downer).<br />
<br />
What are you looking to drop in Acrylla?  I spent several hours in IA last night and saw some bricks, but that's it...   And I saw more Bricks from the area with the sliding gate in AC than I did in IA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think fletching is the only one I have left that's gonna be bad ... and tailoring to 156.<br />
<br />
I'd be a little worried about that tailoring one myself.  Unless you've got boatloads of cash to dump into it (300k+), it's going to take months of farming and combining to get enough stuff to get tailoring to 220+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tailoring = Beyond Insane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeha man, dont sweat fletching. I did it from 0 to 235  on my gnome in an afternoon and never left sh. Made about 10k in the process, couset his was before they nerfed sellback prices on darkwood compound bows. Even after the nerf, fletching still is a low cost trade to raise.<br />
<br />
Tailoring on the otherhand...<br />
<br />
From what I hear, the grimlings in hollowshade moor have no hp and now drop acrylia with more regularity. Of course, finding the hides is another matter. Since verant, in its infinite wisdom, limited skill progression via only a precious few means, the acrylia market is flooded. Going to be a lot of cash to dump in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fletching is easy.. tailoring is a PAIN. Trust me.. I am a 250 tailor and a 200 fletcher. 250 tailoring took me two YEARS, 200 fletching took me 2 DAYS. Tailoring is a bit easier to skill up in nowadays but not that much easier.<br />
<br />
As far as where acrylia drops.. try the Grimling dudes in the caves in Tenebrous mountains, the Tribal guys in Dawnshroud outside of the ME zone. If you search the tailoring forums at www.eqtraders.com you will see a lot of posts about where to get acrylia drops.<br />
<br />
I have to admit I have looked at this quest too, but at the moment I can't see myself spending the aa points needed to get all my skills over 200. Maybe if I ever get the flags for the tiers you also need I will look at it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fletching to 200 is easy. Fletching to 240 is either a pain (though not on the tailoring or smithing scale of things), or expensive.<br />
<br />
You *can* fletch to 250 on storebought items, but it gets very expensive. From 200 to 240, I'd say you would be looking at around 40kpp.<br />
<br />
If you get a gnomish tinker to make bow cams, you can offset much of the cost up to 235, but I believe it's nerfed now, you can't make a profit on any combine, so you will still lose money to get to 235. (I got to 235 on my ranger pre nerf, but without knowing about the tinkering trick).<br />
<br />
Fletching on acrylia arrows is much the same as any other tradeskill based on acrylia. You have to farm the acrylia, or buy it at ridiculous prices in the bazaar, and smith it into arrowshafts. You have to farm or buy the condensed substance and smith it into arrow heads. At that point, it's much the same as fletching any other arrows. This is the cheapest way to get to 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, as Kianor noted, fletching to 202 is easy--and cheap.  It's after 202 that you need a buttload of acrylia, or you have to use bows at like 300pp a combine.<br />
<br />
As for the tailoring, there is an easier recipe to get to 240, but most people seem to forgot about it.  I apologize in advance, but I'm not going to post it here yet until I get it finished cause with all the people that read this board, the supply of items will dry up.  Tailoring really won't be that bad.  Tedious, yes.  Bad, no.  I'll come back and post the name of the recipe after I finish in a week or two.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and finaljustice--I wasn't talking about Acrylia Caverns, I was talking about the best place to farm bricks/blocks/pieces of acrylia.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys!<br />

<br />
I hope you are not thinking about the robes. It looks very nice on paper, but once you break 200, you start getting way too many successes for it to be a valid path. Since success eats the expensive components, it gets ugly real fast. G'luck to you, though, I have an alt with all skills near 200. Of those, I can surely say that either Fletching or JC was the quickest, and neither was all that expensive (less than 5k each, after sell backs). Tailoring I started when my toon was level 4 and spent most of his 80 days played raising it to the 190's and dumped over 30k into it (got disgusted and stopped counting the money). heh.<br />

<br />
you got 2 ways .. acrylia or store bought bows <br />
<br />
depends how much cash you can you can afford to blow, farming acrylia and stockpileing shafts will take you alot longer, but will save ya about 50% on cash <br />
i did store bought bows till 215 .. then moved to acrylia.  best place to farm was the bazaar gathered about 20 bricks per day for a week or 2 ... 100pp per brick over here.<br />
i tryed one day to actually physically farm the crap, but after 2 hours in grimling forest and no bricks, i gave up<br />
<br />
<br />
tailoring isnt all that bad anymore, you get skill ups easy, friend said he got to 180ish with ribbons easy, after that its just hopper hides or velious furs<br />
myself i did the solstice robes till 215 .. then 700 othmir furs got me to 250 http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4787<br />
