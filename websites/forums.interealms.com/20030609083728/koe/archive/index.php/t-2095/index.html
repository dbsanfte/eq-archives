Grouping:**<br />
<br />
**This is a preliminary listing of the group prior to the actual event. Folks may be moved around to the benefit of our expedition's success. So - please read with the thought in mind that this is not a permanent  setup.  :)  I also do think we will have more folks showing up at the last minute - so for those in G3, hang in there. People always forget to post their interest, etc:<br />
<br />
**Also - for those that might not have read the message below - we will be doing this event for the next few weeks (see Calendar). We will be having this event every Wednesday night at the same time. The location can and will change, but we want to stay in the same place for a few times so we can get to know it and above all - HAVE FUN! Loot is secondary - although in some of the dungeons there are Epic related NPC, items, etc: that we will pay special attention to.<br />

Hi all!<br />
<br />
For those that are not going to the ToV event and are under 55+, do we have an event for you!  :D<br />
<br />
Where: City of Mist<br />
When: 7:30PM EST<br />
Requirements: Fun attitude and a bloodlust to take on those Black Reavers!<br />
<br />
Baracus, Traz, and I are gathering any and all forces to take on the City of Mist. <br />
<br />
Our goal is quite simple: Get as many Jade reavers as possible! <br />
<br />
This raid is open to any and all that wish to participate. Guild members as well as petitioners are welcome to join us.<br />
<br />
Aziz will be on a half hour before the raid to gather as many folks as needed to TP to EJ. If you need a ride, please make your way to the closest Wizard portal and I can swing by to pick you up. <br />
<br />
We are setting this up as a weekly event, so if for some reason you may be unable to attend this next one - check us out for the following week!</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, I'll have to sit this one out. Sorry about this, but I will be there for the next one.<br />
<br />
Get many reavers!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vetiria Mindmelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Put me as a definite maybe.  I'm not sure if I'm working that night or not.  If I'm not, I'll be there on time.  If I am working, I'm afraid I can't make it until about 10:30 cst, and you'll probably be done by then.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would love to join you guys if possible.    The Jade Reaver is one of the last few things that Amarin (56 dru) needs to complete his epic, so I'd love a shot at one.<br />
<br />
If you prefer, I can bring Blaydde, my 52 rogue, to open the CoM doors.  The Jade Reaver is tradeable, so Amarin need not be there to loot one, and having an extra rogue is always helpful.<br />
<br />
Let me know.<br />
<br />
Am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Amarin,<br />
<br />
At the moment, we may need Blaydde and his lockpicking talents. Since you need the reaver, but the raid needs a different char of yours, I would certainly consider you looting for Amarin.<br />
<br />
 - Baracus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks Bara.<br />
<br />
By the way,  we should get at least one other rog if we can.  That way, if someone needs to leave, or we have someone go LD or a death, we can have a back-up picker.  I can check on Zlater's availablity (54 rog) if you'd like.<br />
<br />
Am/Blaydde</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Aziz, I can bring bracs, though at 45 he's not a main healer. <br />
<br />
Amarin - Zlater is more than welcome to join, as is anyone else in LOA.<br />
<br />
 - Baracus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'll be there if you'll have me.  I know that I'm neither a member, nor a petitioner of KoE, but I'd still like to attend.<br />
<br />
A few questions, though, since I've not spent much time in CoM:<br />
<br />
Are the reavers giant class? ( can they be mezd, or should I charm)<br />
<br />
This isn't a problem, I self taught myself to charm solo on frost gaints during level 45.  I just want to know so I can stock up on Peridots.<br />
<br />
Is there a resist I should beef up, or are these manily melee mobs?<br />
<br />
That should be enough information.  Feel free to decline my presence on any basis.  It's fine.<br />

<br />
Glad to have you and any other UWS on board, just ask em to post here.<br />
<br />
As for the reavers, my experience has shown that it's more in the getting to them, than in the mezzing then. I think thought that they can be mezzed. Perhaps someone can verify this for me?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would be most interested in joining you all in CoM.  I am a new petitioner to the guild (as of an hour or so ago) and am looking forward to meeting all of you.<br />
