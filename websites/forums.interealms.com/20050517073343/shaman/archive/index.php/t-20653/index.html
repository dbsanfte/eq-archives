<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragingfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, lower the mana cost or cast time on Tnarg...Since its pretty much incredibly weak..<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly: When the percentage heals, shamans were about a k behind druids when it came to their heals...Druids can heal about 5k, so a 3500-4k heal upgrade to Tnargs thats readily available to most shamans and that would be a very low mana cost increase would seem to be to be useful..<br />
<br />
<br />
This is just form a monk's point of view that plays with a shaman reguarly, however.</div></div><hr />

Cheals bad.<br />

Quick heals good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3500-4000 Cheal that casts in 10 seconds would be less than the people who are mostly complaining right now heal for just using tnargs mending (assuming high beneficial haste and max healing AA's/focus), and this is neglecting critical heals...<br />
<br />
Second, the mana cost really isn't the issue with tnarg's mending, and if you get the cast time below 3 seconds you are actually hurting more than helping.</div></div><hr />
