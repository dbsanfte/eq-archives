I am not going to &quot;pick on you&quot; because of your grammer and punctuation errors, but I am going to try and give you some advice. TRY to use correct punctuation and grammer. Re-read your posts. Edit them after you re-read them so they make sense, and have some orginization. <br />
<br />
As far as the content of your thought here, I actually partly agree with you. Its pretty stupid that we never got the &quot;Improved Invisibility&quot; spell. Its self only, sheesh, they COULD give it to us. <br />
<br />
But Invis isnt one of those spells I keep up full time. A couple heals and a DOT or a Nuke is. I usually only have 1 slot dedicated to my pitiful DPS, except in AE situations or LDoN. But this is THE PROBLEM, Cow. We DON'T have any decent DPS. Clerics out-nuke us on Non-undead mobs, and THATS just not right. <br />
<br />
So all ball-busting, HoH corpse jokes aside, we STILL need a better heal and a better fast nuke/DOT. <br />
<br />
And we need Imp Invis, for Cow. Someone put it on &quot;The List&quot; please :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi.  :)<br />
<br />
When one reads a sentence, especially when one does not know the author in real life, one must read the given sentence as though the author were speaking, rather than as a line of text.<br />
<br />
That being said, try to read the cow's post aloud.  Notice how the lack of puncuation forces one to accelerate one's reading speed in order to finish the post without pausing for breath?  Now, read the first sentence in my post.  Notice how the comma's give one the chance to breathe, as well as slowing down the post and enabling the reader to pause?  Much easier, don't you think?<br />
<br />
As for our choosing to &quot;pick on a person&quot; rather than giving our opinion of the topic, said topic is not only hard to understand (due to the horrible way in which the post is written) it also is without merit.<br />
<br />
For most shaman in the game, an improved invis is very low on the list of upgrades shaman desire.  Owning a 65 Mage as well as a 64 Shaman, I must agree that the 10 minute duration invis my mage gets is nice.  In fact, every time I click invis on my shaman, I desire an improved invis.  I probably use invis twice a day.<br />
<br />
Now, every time I click on Kragg's Mending, I wish for a better heal, one near to, or on par with a druids.  I probably use Kragg's Mending 100+ times a day.<br />
<br />
As for comparing the need for invis to the need for a nuke, I use Spear of Torment often, and about 85% of the time it's resisted, even with Malosinia.  The need for a nuke that's not resisted often is high, in my opinion.  Often I am forced to take agro away from the group (T'is better for me to have agro than a INT caster or healer), especially when our tank goes down (ie: my desire for decent heal spell) and DoT's are unable to give me the agro I need.  I probably use Spear of Toment 50 times a day.<br />
<br />
Now, by breaking this down we see it like this.<br />
<br />
Desire for Invis: 2<br />
Desire for Heal: 100<br />
Desire for Nuke: 50<br />
<br />
Thus, we can see that I desire a better heal 50 times more than I desire a better invis, and I desire a better nuke 25 times more than I desire a better invis.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that most shaman run about the same percentage as I do.<br />
<br />
Also, and lastly, was your flawed grammar and lack of puncuation purposeful, or was it simply an inherint flaw?</div></div><hr />

Not counting the capitalization errors, (which is a minor thing and often forgotten about on forums) there are only 7 real spelling errors. <br />
<br />
The post is 178 words. That works out to be almost 4% of the post spelled incorrectly.<br />
<br />
If you add the capitalization errors, the post has 17 errors, or roughly 10% of the post is incorrect. <br />
<br />
10% of the post is wrong, with several glaring sentence structure errors to boot. Is that considered significant for an informal environment such as the Crucible? I would not want to turn in a paper this way for college, or apply for a job in this manner, but is this really significant for this audience? <br />
<br />
My response is a resounding yes. If one is not eloquent in his communication, the point is often lost, misinterpreted, or worse, rejected as outright lies. Proper speech or writing is a skill that must be practiced in all mediums or we risk the debasing of language. With that debasement, comes loss of intent, meaning, and understanding. Proper communication is a skill, which only improves through practice.<br />
<br />
Need more proof? Look at the derailment of the thread from poor communication. Had the author taken the time to carefully craft his post, we might be debating his point, rather than his intelligence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">There is a direct relationship between the quality of writing and the reader's perception of the author.  If you have a point you feel the need to make that will cause you to go to the trouble of writing it out, you want it to be considered by your audience.  If it can't be read, or if your post is so poorly done that it alienates the audience, there is no point in posting in the first place.<br />
<br />
There is a difference between simple grammatical errors caused by the vagaries of english and sloppy, poorly punctuated, poorly considered rambling.  Clearly expressed ideas survive on their merit - this thread only survived because of Litguv's gong.<br />
<br />
It is nice to see another idea of shaman's problems, and clearly Cow had something he wanted to express - but he failed, because no one could push through his writing, until Litguv got us to look at his note again.</div></div><hr />

Please also be sure you edit your posts for spelling errors, as Blazz has so kindly pointed out for us. If you're going to pick on someone else's writing, at least be sure your own is correct.<br />

<br />
I too did this after reading your post.  However, word misses wrong word choices (there, their, they're, to, too, two, corps, corpse, etc.).  Counting those, there are no less than 16 errors.  Further, there are at least (and this is a matter of opinion in some ways) 18 errors in grammar and punctuation.  Capitalization (probably the least impactful area of writing in terms of being understood by the reader) had at least 11 errors.  This makes for at least 45 errors, and these are just fixes to make the post understandable!<br />
<br />
10% of the post is incorrect???  I'd say 10% is CORRECT!  Heck, the whole post is just ONE sentence... one very long sentence....<br />
<br />
PS If I turned something like this in for a college english class, I would expect a big red X across the entire page with a big NO!! written on the top and an F next to the NO!!.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ill chime in and give you a hint.<br />
<br />
The gong i posted in reply to your post had nothing at all to do with your spelling and grammer, it was the content that inspired it.<br />
<br />
I dont mean to offend you, but the facts are this. People here spend a lot of time parsing, thinking, debating and trying to change SoE's mind on how the shaman is in need of help and is in a seriously scary spiral downward into a truly worthless class. We have all put aside our differences and decided to work together, which was no easy task and took months to do, so that we can have 1 basic voice in the main things we need to improve this class and more to the point save it and beyond that save ourselves from leaving EQ. Most of us love the shaman so much that if we cant play a shaman happily, we dont wanna play EQ, atleast thats how i am and im to the point where im withdrawing from the game and ATM have no intention of renewing my billing and also have not logged in to play in weeks.<br />
<br />
So when you come in here ranting with no logical reasons for your platform of debate, just &quot; i dont nuke so we shouldnt have better nukes&quot; then yea your going to get a bad response. Just cause you dont nuke or you lack the skills to utilize the other features of a shaman doesnt mean that others lack the skills and that we are invalid in requesting changes to those skills.<br />
<br />
As far as your spelling and grammer. Its horrible. Im sorry, im not one to pick on people for their spelling and grammar cause i make tons of mistakes, but your is truly horrible. This is a issue cause on the internet where the bulk of communication is based off text, your passion, your intelligence and your opinion all come through that text in a flow and if i have to stop to try to figure out what you meant cause you spelt something wrong, you distrupt the flow of my understanding of your post, which only hurts you. One or 2 times is tolerable, but when you do it as much as you have, then reading it is a effort and its all about triyng to just make it through the post and understand what the F you said, then taking it in and thoughtfuly considering it.<br />
<br />
I dont care if you dont speak english well, which i think you do cause your sentence structure is fine, you know the words, you just lack the proper spelling of them, there is spell checkers all over the place that you can utilize if your too lazy to correctly post without more then 1 or 2 mistakes. I can understand posting in passion and goofing a lil, but if you want to be taken seriously, if you want to have people understand you and follow the passion of your post, then give yourself and your post the respect it deserves and make sure its as perfect as it can be.<br />
<br />
<br />
End of line....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I am not the best speller. Anyone who spells something only one way lacks creativity.<br />
<br />
I am not the best at punctuation. Sometimes a dot is just a dot you know.<br />
<br />
I am not the best at grammer or those darn run on sentances.<br />
<br />
Heck about the only thing I am the best at is being me. <br />
<br />
But at the end of the day I feel my posts here convey a feeling of passion, of sometimes anger, of a joy at playing a game for the entertainment value alone. My posts are my only means of speaking to a subset of friend here where we all share the same intrest. PLaying EQ and making the game fun for ourselves. In lots of places our goals interlap. In lots of places our goals collide. And sadly in lots of places our goals are fighting a death match one on one and killing any chance for a comprimise. <br />
<br />
Many many times I have been typing away at some point. that as I was finishing up I delete through it. Because What I was saying wasnt what I was trying to say. (And a few times they get through and later make my head go all sideways. But I typed it and look like an ass.. So be it. Helps me learn in the future.)<br />
<br />
Most of the shaman here are professionals. Adults despite the running around bashing at things on little virtual cartoon charecters. And you would certainly not going into a respected place of meeting and act like a complete and utter bumkin, backwash hick that pisses where he wants because thats the way we did it back home. Even if you play an ogre. <br />
<br />
If you did you would certainly be thrown out. Rightfully so. <br />
<br />
If you want respect for your ideas, and for yourself make sure both earn it. Sadly joining a club requires some conformation of thought. Else you will not fit. Will not belong. But we have lots of room here, and while we might be a pissy bunch right now that seems to complain more than our fair share of time, we have tons of damn fine people. Treat them with a bit of respect and you will start earning some yourself. Even the ones we disagree with for the most part are respected by the more generous members of the community. So please remember that while a mistake or 7 isnt a big deal (Look at all the mistakes in my post alone) The tone of voice and the words you convey reflect upon you and in turn all of us here. <br />
<br />
Make sure they are worthy of both.<br />

If you are a foreigner, or born here but speak with a different native tongue, or are a Red-Neck or are DEAF and never learned to speak proper American English, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FEELINGS OR IDEAS THAT REAL HUMANS HAVE AND CANNOT MAKE ANY SENSE, PLEASE GET A CLUE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW is not the threat! Cowkiller is! Previous paying EQ subscribers who played shaman are now ending billing and devoting all their time to the Cowkiller quest on the Crucible!<br />
<br />
Attack the grammar! Parse Cowkiller's post in MSWord. Compare it in WordPerfect. Do it on PC ... do it on a Mac ... do it on a Linux!<br />
<br />
WAKE UP SOE!! You are losing players to the inadequacies found in other players!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">As far as your spelling and grammer. Its horrible. Im sorry, im not one to pick on people for their spelling and grammar cause i  make tons of mistakes, but your is truly horrible. This is a issue cause on the internet where the bulk of communication is based off text, your passion, your intelligence and your opinion all come through that text in a flow and if i have to stop to try to figure out what you meant cause you spelt something wrong, you distrupt  the flow of my understanding of your post, which only hurts you. One or 2  times is tolerable, but when you do it as much as you have, then reading it is a  effort and its  all about triyng  to just make it through the post and understand what the F you said, then  taking it in and thoughtfuly  considering it.<br />
<br />
... you just lack the proper spelling of them, there is  spell checkers all over the place that you can utilize if your  too lazy to correctly post without more then  1 or 2 mistakes. <br />
<br />
Comedy gold. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Haha, busted i guess ;)<br />
<br />
Though in my defense, those mistakes are hardly a disruption to the flow of the post.<br />
<br />
Its when you talk like ..<br />
<br />
<br />
I am vry made aboot this post. Hoe dare you sah i cant tipe and post whell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Cowkiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Ok i think i understand  this forum now.<br />
<br />
To Be SHAMAN  IS to be CRAZY <br />
<br />
Still think some of these shaman  that posted must have SLOWED  Them Selfs  to many times.<br />
<br />
<br />

PS Litgruv  your posts  are to intresting to read</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">In my opinion, the original post was creatively written to look as if it was a misspelled grammatically incorrect commentary.    Feedback was the goal and furthers the cause of the writer.<br />
<br />
 PS Litgruv your posts are to intresting to read<br />
<br />
The above is a nicely written double-entendre which supports my premise.   This begs the question … is Cowkiller a sockpuppet?</div></div><hr />

&quot;I am not going to &quot;pick on you&quot; because of your grammer and punctuation errors,&quot;<br />
--It's spelled &quot;grammar&quot;<br />
<br />
Posted by Diabalein:<br />
&quot;um its not that he types different, its damn near unreadable. it makes him look like hes either a moron or a 6 year old. copy his post and drop it into word and watch it have a seizure.&quot;<br />
--Complete lack of capital letters and punctuation. (not a single apostrophe)<br />
<br />
Posted by Meglo Maeneac:<br />
&quot;Notice how the lack of puncuation forces one to accelerate&quot;<br />
&quot;Also, and lastly, was your flawed grammar and lack of puncuation purposeful, or was it simply an inherint flaw?&quot;<br />
--Punctuation spelled incorrectly twice, so it wasn't just a typo. Inherent is also misspelled.<br />
<br />
Posted by Barm McLir:<br />
&quot;Because of the natual assumption made by readers when the author writes in a fashion that fails to distinguish him from an idiot?&quot;<br />
--Natural is an easy word to spell. (for most)<br />
<br />
To lazy to scrutinize any further, but until you all can manage a post without errors, maybe you shoulden't be so quick to judge.<br />
<br />
To hell with the grammar police. (Guess I'll see you there myself now)</div></div><hr />

Indeed.<br />
<br />
That was good for a laugh. Didn't you say folks living in glass houses shouldn't throw stones?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">There are levels of correctness with grammar and spelling.  There's literate, semi-literate, barely-literate, and illiterate, if you will.  Litgruv's post could fairly be called semi-literate; Cowkiller's was illiterate.<br />
<br />
Normally I don't criticize grammar and spelling except in the most egregious situations because of this exact problem - make one itty bitty typo and someone will crawl down your throat.  But Litgruv's errors, as he points out, really do not impact the flow of the post.  Cowkillers' errors make his post very difficult to read.  <br />
<br />
I don't even like to read the illiterate posts (posts by non-English speakers excepted).  When I do read them, I don't tend to take them seriously.  Pretty much I assume you're either an idiot or just plain shoddy if you can't take the time to WRITE half decently in a WRITTEN medium.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I religiously avoid reading any post in Troll-speak.  There's not too many of you left, thank God, probably because you all got tired of nobody reading your posts.  (Unfortunately, you will all think it  clever to respond to THIS post in trollspeak... sigh.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">whats funny is that 90% of the people who will post in this thread after weissblau's post will check their grammEr, and check it twice!<br />
<br />
and let me continue this thread by posting something that all the grammEr checkers can laugh at<br />
