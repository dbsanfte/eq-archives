<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Think he's solo'able?  Does he AE?  Any tactics / advice you can give would be appreciated.  From Allahs, it seems like flurry is his only ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For you?  Probably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's way in the back of a cave with small red aliens who all have a ton of hitpoints.  The callers see invis and the cave is pretty twisty.  They are not bad to slow and don't hit very hard but take a long time to kill.  Use bind sight to scout out each room.<br />
<br />
There are some wanderers and the repop time is kinda short.<br />
<br />
Radir/Ghost of Radir has annoying MR and slowing can be a nusiance.  Hits in the 300 range if I remember, flurries, and has a BOATLOAD of hitpoints.  You can proximately aggro pull him into the hall and skip killing the mobs in his room.  Cripple should reduce the number of flurries.  The spirit spawns in Radir's original spot - not from where you kill him. <br />
<br />
You're probably going to end up fighting that same roamer(s?) a couple times during the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Call me lucky, I went after Radiir once with a pretty weak 4 man group, ranger pulled him in and I didn't have one resist on him. Ranger tanked, druid healed, I sent in doggy and ran Pox and epic on him (think I was maybe 61 around the time), nuked occasionally. It was a pretty long fight, bugger had buttload of hitpoints, but was a real yawner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can duo radir/tawro with my shmy &amp; beast.. and my gear is no where near as uba as yours.. aka you got more HPS than my beast lol.<br />
<br />
Only tip I can give is, late night when no one else is in the zone.<br />
Insta click invis potions, black fur booties (in case of dispell disaster) and kill him at the zone line :D<br />
<br />
Also have any low level twinks of yours who want the 18delay 12dmg sowrds camped out at the zone line. You can make them oo and aww at your long sowrd of freedom in PC heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe, thanks for all the info.  I finally went there and got him last night.  It was alot easier than I had originally thought it would be.  <br />
<br />
The little red aliens (from Mars Attack movie) were quite easy to dispatch.  They have as much hp as a PoF mob, but hit like little girls.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Radir had a boatload of hps!  It was quite a long fight even with the amount of dps I had brought with me (rogue, ench charmed pet, druid, cleric).<br />
<br />
He dual weilded Mithril Edge Short Swords.  My bardy got one of those.  Other rotted.  I was hoping for the Shadowheart.  Maybe I'll head back there sometime.  It was sorta fun and a change from usual raiding.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for the suggestions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea his no drop toys for my alts are realy the only reason I kill the spirits anymore... well selling braclets dosn't hurt either.<br />
<br />
My beastlord used shadowheart and the martial weapon from radir from lvls 5-60 :).. (I killed him with shamy and a friend beastlord origionaly)<br />
<br />
I currently have an ogre warrior with a mith edged shortsowrd and long sowrd of freedon /big grin. With those and a haste item at lowbie levels was freaking awsome. He is probably going to replace my kitty one of these days... especialy if I need a more beefy tank.<br />
<br />
Oh and my rogue has those toys too heh.<br />
<br />
The only bad thing is when you got to tell other newbies its a no drop weapon off a lvl 60 mob....</div></div><hr />
