<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi all i am a troll shaman (lv 70) and i got (175 crystals) (0 ebon),<br />
<br />
i could buy some stuff from (DON)evil merchant,but i need ebon.<br />
is there a way to trade those crystals to get the ebons :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed you could do the trade with the merchants invis (don't know if intentional or bug).  So do your purchases in the good camp, since the shards are not yet tradeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had heard that they were supposed to be tradeable.  Though that may have been just a rumor.  Anyone know if this is something that we will be able to do in the future?  Kinda pointless to do missions on both sides if that is the case.  Well, other than the fact that they are really nice for aa experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is just temporary, because of an exploit. This is going to be fixed in the mid-march patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can buy from the good/bad camp merchants using invis as well. Same items in both camps afaik.<br />
<br />
Ooops sorry didn't see the reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BTW, Sissl the nec rep just posted that in the next patch when these are made tradeable we will no longer be able to buy from opposite side merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my problem is:<br />
<br />
<br />
1) the 1st  group task i did (i got a token) and i didn t know where to turn it,so someone in group told me to go to wayfarer camp and give to &quot;youri&quot;.. he didn t told me  there was 2 npc (one for evil,one for good).<br />
<br />
2) so,that s why (i think) i got crystal instead on ebons (i am evil).<br />
<br />
3) the token i got from tasks can only be traded to youra (npc).<br />
<br />
well from now i am trying to get good faction,by doing the solo tasks and turn in the token i got from tasks...(i got 202 crystals atm).<br />
<br />
i don't want to have to always have trade my crystals for ebons to players when i want to buy something  from DON  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">NPC will be put back into lavastorm that will excahnge ebon/light crystals for the other, supposedly in March. You get light if you do a good mission, ebon if you do an evil mission. Nothing else affects that.</div></div><hr />
