Any chance of adding the GoD AA's to the Crucible's AA guide?<br />
<br />
And in the meantime... anyone know of a good GoD AA reference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its not to be mean or anything but if you only have 84 AAs i could not requment you to start working the AAs yet, better the all the the pop AAs done, and LR5 and stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He wasnt asking opinions, he was asking if anyone knew of a good reference for GoD AA's.  <br />

Two is a big boy, and capable of choosing what he wants to spend his AA points on.  If he wants GoD AA's, he can get GoD AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was pretty sure twoflower was a girl :)<br />
and i still gave my opinion, because i feel the GoD aas is not worth it.</div></div><hr />

There's about a 0% chance any info on the crucible website will be updated now that I am no longer doing it.  I was the only one besides Sunmoon that had access to the webserver.  Sad heh, despite his promise of a new commitment to the boards when he decided to pick up our new advertiser, it seems like nothing has changed.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if you want to put together a nice thread I bet Gloriana would move it to the medicine cabinet for you. She's cool like that...</div></div><hr />
