<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
Im a bit of a rookie to alchemy yet but I have read allot about it from pieces here and there.  Anyway I wanted to know if it is possible to make a simple gate potion that will take a person to their bind location.  I know it is possible to make potions that take them to bone/frost/innothule but I wanted to know if we can make one that will take the person to their bind spot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this.<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jhendlasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Those potions are vendor sold only (look for a Vial of Swirling Smoke), and sell for around 1k each.  I'm not positive, but I'd heard rumours that we used to be able to make them back in Beta, but it was removed due to being 'overpowering.'</div></div><hr />
