<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a UBISOFT account and have tried to get LDON digitally. I am able to download it, get the stone, but I cant do any adventures.  :( <br />
<br />
So I guess I have to register ;), however it seems that UBISOFT customers have not got the option to do this. Is this correct, do I have to wait until some dogsled brings the expasnion to the land of eternal icerain I am living in ?<br />
<br />
Are we still living in the black ages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BluntDoctor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have the adventurer's stone, but you can't enter any of the dungeons?  I vaguely remember something like this when the expansion first came out, I could be wrong.  Make sure you have ldon checked on the eqpatcher options, maybe you haven't actually downloaded the zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This happened to me too - be sure to do a full filecheck/patch, so it can download the zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nope, this is not related to any patcher issue or missing file.<br />
it is simply that you cannot register online LDON as a UBISOFT customer. there is a warning on SOE site when you try that.<br />
so gratz for the d/l but go run to your closest shop and buy the box or order it via eqloft.com, install it and then you'll just have to use the serial to activate LDON.<br />
no other choice... but you will gain a bag :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you Kowalsky, now I only have to wait for the stagecoach to bring it here :)<br />
<br />
I wish companies would make things just simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ommar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never fear I am in the same boat, order online after the deadline thru the game and find out it takes 4 - 6 weeks for shipment.<br />
<br />
WELL!!!!!  I am still waiting for the box and they already charged my account......grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br />
<br />
It is a second pre-owned account so am somewhat skeered to chastize SOE to hurry the **ll up :)</div></div><hr />
