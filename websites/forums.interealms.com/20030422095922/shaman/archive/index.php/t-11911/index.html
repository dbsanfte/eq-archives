<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I looked at the 8th cudgel, and it's nice, but what are the benefits vs. epic?  I'm only up to the Dire Wolf part of epic, and didn't really look through the cudgel quest, but is it easier or something?  Why do so many do the quest?  Just to do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a big difference with the 8th cudgel and Spear of Fate. The cudgel can go in the range slot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm doing it for 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
1. To do it.<br />
2. To have an awesome 1hb<br />
3. To have an awesome range item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. It is still among the best range slot items you will ever see until you get to vex thal or the elemental planes (which in my case will probably be never).<br />
2. Actually, on my server, not too many shaman are doing it. I think I convinced maybe 3-6 shamans to start doing it.<br />
3. I refuse to pay 10k for the scroll of avatar, carnage will do for the buff beggers. I know several level 65 shaman who refuse to pay 10k for avatar also.<br />
4. I all ready have the epic.<br />
<br />
<br />
The faction requirements for a barb shaman (which I am) is very hard, so if you don't have serious determination, you won't get to cudgel 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hands down, the cudgel is the best range slot item I have found that is easy to attain (well, relatively...)<br />
<br />
It's kind of a mark on my server, too, amoung shaman. Especially non-iksar. Being an iksar, I'm already the object of much envy...but when I see a barbarian with one I think &quot;wow...he took the time to get the cudgel...nice!&quot;<br />
<br />
Even the 6th and 7th cudgels are pretty good range slot items.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, my 1hb skill is a whopping 87. I stopped using maces and clubs when I found out our epic is a piercer...maxed piercing long ago. This goes and stays in my range slot, only to be switched out with the grandmaster alchemy trophy when I'm doing alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, I totally missed the part about it being range equipable.  Many of you proclaimed it to be the best range item available, does that include comparison to the ceramic pottery items (the ones with improved healing 4, extended affliction 4, E`ci, etc)?</div></div><hr />

As you can see (this is copied straight from Allakhazam's hehe) same STA, more WIS (no AGI) better resists, slightly inferior HP and more Mana on the cudgel...but really it's your call. <br />

Apples and oranges as far as I am concerned. Do you nuke more than you buff? Then maybe the ceramic is better for you. And probably easier to get, if you have the cash to buy the supplies or buy it outright.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, these are the ones I was looking at:<br />

No, I'm not a nuker, and I prefer grouping over soloing.  That's why I ask.  At the levels it takes to obtain either of these items, or the cudgel, are stats going to matter as much as one of these three focus effects?  Taking into account that one doesn't already have one of these three?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I do not have access to, nor are the items being sold for the ceramic pieces from the elemental planes.  As far as the shield of valors goes, I wouldn't waste the parts that could be a ring.<br />
<br />
Add into that the fact i am poor and the cudgel is nice, especially for stats and a solo buff.  It gives you 50 hp in the range, I don't know of any other item that doess offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The effect is clickable from inventory, so even if you do upgrade (I'm eyeing a Wicked Bone Atlatl for the spell haste) it's still useful. The click just takes for-freakin-ever to cast...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personlly I stoped useing the Click has soon has I got over the &quot;New Toy&quot; phase. 15 second cast and like a 6 min duration. It gets annoying real quick when mele start bugging you for it while your trying to cast other things. It over wrights PE and SoB. Which combined are much better. The only time i do use it, is when I am PLing a char that is to low for PE. And we are indoors so no SoB.</div></div><hr />
