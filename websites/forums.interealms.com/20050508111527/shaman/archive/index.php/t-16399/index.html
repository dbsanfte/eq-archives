1.  Existing gear (especially elemental armor/equipment) should have more than just a single type 1 augmentation slot.  I hope you are intending to put more type 3 slots on existing gear, else all non-LDoN gear will be highly devalued.  <br />
<br />
2.  Having to spend a bunch of time in a single dungeon to get what you want is not fun.  I like to explore all of the dungeons you have given us, but I will not be able to buy my spells/augments because I like to experience all the content equally(?)  It just doesn't make sense.  If I've earned 1000 points across all dungeons, that should be just as good as 1000 points at a single dungeon.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to read this,<br />

I don't think everything should have a type 3 slot, but a lot of items should.  At the very least, raid level gear from Velious and onwards ought to.  Some gear ought to have multiple slots.  Just slapping 1 type 1 slot down on everything pre-Time is pure laziness.<br />
<br />
As far as the points go, having to spend them all in one place is really annoying too.  I don't mind having something special like a 'Lost Sword of Mayong Mistmoore' come only from Mistmoore... but something as basic as spells, stat augments, ft1, see invis, etc. should be general (imo).<br />
<br />
Also, if something is general, and you have enough general points, you should be able to see it (but currently you can't if you don't have enough points from that particular dungeon is my understanding... correct if I am wrong).  Hopefully this is just a bug.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
I like LDoN, but some of the implementation of the points system/augments just seems out of whack to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are 2 kinds of points... think of one as faction points and another as spendable points.<br />
<br />
They acrue at the exact same rate.<br />
<br />
Spendable points can be spent anywhere.<br />
<br />
Faction points are for the specific camp you adventured at.<br />
<br />
so... I earn 1000 points at rujarkan hills, and 500 at deepest guk:  I can spend all 1500 at either place, but the vendors in rujarkin like me more -so they will sell me 1000 point items wheras the vendors at guk will only sell me up to 500 point items.  I could buy 3 500 point items at either camp.<br />
<br />
The problem I see with this is that since we just discovered Bane is coming from rujarkan camps.. every 65 shaman will be doing rujarkin camps exclusively.  Its going to take 13 adventures in rujarkan to get this spell.. why would I want to go to another camp instead?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm a guk group? no thanks... but would you guys consider coming to rujarkan?  No... your cleric wants to do guk so they can get the points for their bulwark of vie spell... i see.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree on the slots thing...<br />
<br />
  As for the dungeons, they aren't always the same thing, so far I have had plenty of variety to keep me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL, I don't know about you guys but there is no way that the mobs are lasting long enough for bane to be a factor.  I buckled down and equiped my scaled avatar's gloves, trained scf aa's and have become a poison nuker, lol.  Pretty strange change but since you don't need to malos the mobs I just slow, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke.  With puppy its dps baby!<br />
<br />
Remember when I said increase shaman melee damage now a few days ago? I had no idea how gimpy the mobs would be in LDON.  Fun, fun, fun,  this expansion is great.  No more uber resistent mobs or boring camps - its non-stop action unless you have a gimp group. <br />
<br />
WOOT! Big thumbs up.  And no need to screw with shaman melee damage since things stick.  WOOT!<br />

PS: About the slot thing.  I tend to think Sony actually knows what they are doing.  I was disappointed at first finding all my existing &quot;good&quot; stuff only having a level one slot, but any other way would have been overpowered.  I don't think we know yet what level 1 charms there are yet (maybe some will be ok), but even if they are not its no biggie.  Just pick a slot you want to upgrade - buy a LDON item and spend all your points to upgrade the slots on that item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is for those insane quested items that I wish to have better slots the most, or at least an LDoN next step in the quest to add some slots.  It is expected that they become obsolete at some point, just didn't think it'd be so soon.<br />
<br />
  But yeah, I got a couple slots I can work on.<br />
<br />
  As for Bane, I see no real use for it IN LDoN, other than named fights and Raid encounters.  But outside of LDoN, it is a godsend.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't possiblely agree with you more! I feedback this everyday I'm on and so should the others that agree with it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's just Velious faction all over again.  Some of your friends want to kill giants, some of your friends want to kill dragons.  I dislike anything that puts friends/guildmates at cross purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's just Velious faction all over again.  Some of your friends want to kill giants, some of your friends want to kill dragons.  I dislike anything that puts friends/guildmates at cross purposes.<br />
<br />
Agree holeheartedly. This points seems designed  to cause problems. <br />
<br />

<br />
Isn't that odd? You can only earn it where it's not real useful. A 1200<br />
point DD spell I could see here, but not a DOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I disagree with the Velious faction comparison - in Velious, ,the factions *conflicted* with each other.<br />
<br />
Helping a friend get 100 faction hits meant you needed 200(more?) faction hits to get to the same point with the other guys.<br />
<br />
With LDoN, you can help your friend get his 1000 APs, then both head elsewhere to get your 1000APs.  then spend 2000APs each at the camp of your choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree SOME items need better slots.  Seems like a lot of work though, I can see why they went &quot;type 4, DO.  type 1, DO&quot; though.  The one /feedback I've put in is to please put a bank in at least one of the Wayfarer camps.  It's getting to be a pain to either run from the BB camp to the book, or use my Spiritstone and run to the book from there.<br />
<br />
Bane might be useful -- at the very least, more useful than BoS which never completes its duration.<br />
<br />
It's just Velious faction all over again. Some of your friends want to kill giants, some of your friends want to kill dragons. I dislike anything that puts friends/guildmates at cross purposes.<br />
<br />
I disagree.  We're not working at cross-purposes if I want to kill in Guk and you want to kill in Mistmoore -- doing one doesn't HURT the other, in fact, those points I'll earn by going with you to MM I can spend on something smaller in Guk, and I'll  want to get MM later anyway for whatever spell's stashed away there.<br />
<br />
In velious, if I go with you to hunt in Skyshrine, soon I've screwed my own faction there.  There's a big difference.</div></div><hr />
