<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When we farm sewer 3 we usually fight to the first room which is about enough mobs to trigger the extra spawns and named can pop in this first room the first corridor or a lot further in.<br />
My question is if no named pop is it better to get a new expedition or wait for repops, and the same question can apply if we do get one to pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My group usually kills around 20 mobs, and our ranger or rogue scouts to see if there is a named.  If not, we just get another exp.  Lately tho, we have been crawling through.  For some odd reason, we have seen better success doing the crawl than just slaughtering at zone in.  All in all, it depends if we are lazy or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my experience farming for sewer named for the BiC quest it is way faster to just get a new expedition if no named mobs pop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sewer 3 generally the best one to farm for spells in?  Only rune I've seen drop in my (limited) GoD experience was in 1.  Where's a good place to look for strats for 3 and 4?  Did a little poking around, didn't see much.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best write up on the sewers is here:<br />

<br />
As for runes, I got Balance of Nihil in Sewer 1 also.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Been sewer farming in pools and crematory,<br />
<br />
never found a named while soloing pools<br />
<br />
Most deaths were from becoming trapped on scenery, now I have levitate up permanently<br />
<br />
Came back witha couple of friends and did crematory.<br />
<br />
Alot better and have a few named spawns in about 15 efforts. 1 Yiktu rune dropped - roll won by a ranger for his highly important heal upgrade - bah<br />
<br />
I regen 2 aug dropped too - let SK have it, happy SK =)<br />
<br />
Also got a larva skin cape - decent stats and Extended range 4, off random trash (once in pools off a acid larva (SK won roll) once in crematory off a sludge lurker (I won it - hooray replaced my moss-covered cape))<br />
<br />
We intend to return. As we all need that Yiktu rune (and I believe Eril can drop too)<br />
<br />
Our basic strategy is to kill to the second room, then pull form the passgeway to the third room. Keeping an eye out for lag and pop. When there is a pop in the middle of the pool in the second room we presume (wrongly? not sure) that the named has popped or is not going to. I use stalking probes to search for named if our mage is not with us. Named is quite often in an alcove in room 3, in a bobble in the passageway to the west off room 3, or in the passageway between room 1 and 2 so far. If no named we get another expedition.<br />
<br />
I keep wondering if we killed a couple more mobs (up to 20) there would be another pop? can anyone confirm the trigger for the named pops?<br />
<br />
Anyway group make up is either <br />
me soloing pools - 65 shm 170AAs never raided but half decent gear considering (1 hr or more- 1 canni / mob)<br />
Shm + 65 SK 100AAs, also never raided but half decent gear (50 -60 mins)<br />
Shm + SK + Ranger 50 AAs (has Yiktu rune now) (45 mins)<br />
Shm + SK + Mage (500AAs) fully geared up (takes 30 mins for pop)<br />
Shm + SK + Mage + Pal (500AAs) fully geared (like a hot knife thru butter, 22 mins to pop)<br />
Shm + SK + Mage + Pal + Rng (a bit faster again)<br />
<br />
Notice absence of cleric :) When duoing its Malo, Slow, Q on SK, Dots and Heals<br />
In pools mobs hit for approx 480 max<br />
Crematory is about 650<br />
<br />
Avoid fighting in passageways where poss, try and find a safe spot in a room (although occasionally you will need to, to help penetrate)<br />
<br />
hoping to return tonight for 5 or 6 more attempts</div></div><hr />
