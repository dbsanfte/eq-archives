<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A while back I was reading a post on the safehouse boards.  Someone asked if they could do all of their epic stuff at lvl 49 or something.   Someone replied &quot;No soandso will just eat the pieces you turn in unless you are 51.  If you want your epic at lvl 1, be a shammy.&quot;  He also mentioned how even the tear from the planes could be mq'd.  Not that I plan on going out and trying to get an epic before 50, but that had me thinking -- imagine how fast you could level soloing with shammy epic at lvl 30ish ;)  Anyways, was this guy just talking out of his ass and didnt know what he was talking about or do you think if some twink really set out to get a epic at lvl 30, whether it be through mq'ing and using their main's guild &amp; resources, could actually obtain the SoF?  Or are there any showstoppers that require the you to be a certain level?   I'm gonna read the epic guide tomorrow when I'm not so tired and see for myself =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman epic is faction based, all you need is high enough faction and the tear from fear which can be MQ'd. Saying this Im fairly sure that the epic effect doesnt actually work till something like 51+ which makes for a nice status stick that wouldnt actually do anything. Not sure if you would even get the epic at pre 49 with the spirit wolf but im sure someone has tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drydon - Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The epic is completeable at level 1 (I did it at 35).  Doesn't help all that much because the click effect doesn't work until 51.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Due to being in a weak guild, i decided to try to avoid the hole part.<br />
<br />
Eventually i maxed my faction, and went and talked to the doggy in the pond&gt;<br />
<br />
Have u been a good doggy this year?<br />
<br />
-woof-<br />
<br />
Is santa gonna give u a bone?<br />
<br />
-woof- -woof-<br />
<br />
Do you have a present for me then?<br />
<br />
-woof?-<br />
<br />
What is lost?<br />
<br />
Doggy starts to miraculously talk&gt;<br />
<br />
He waffled on right up to the what of the breach part&gt;  and called me heyokah wobbla  BUT only gave me a big wag of the tail, and not a nice big Mr pointy (<br />
<br />
Yes in theory the epic can be done at lvl 15 (bind affinity for when u die alot) if u have a load of 50+ friends helping you.<br />
<br />
In practice thats a crazy idea however with a bit of help, you could go as far fas looting the tear by lvl 46.<br />
<br />
I think we all wished we had thos boots at lvl 20 !<br />
<br />
One big stumbling block is divination&gt; i recomend a divination of 130+ fro the underwater part, and maybe getting thro fp if ur evil.<br />
Ofcourse a lvl 50+ druid beside u could help condsiderably!<br />
<br />
Its cheating ofcourse!  And just realise that if some lvl 20 is wandering around with a mr pointy&gt; then verant will alter the faction thing and screw the rest of us shamans of 50+<br />
<br />
Having said that i regard lvl 40 as a decent lvl to attempt the epic as far as iksar tear&gt; if u have friends u can go into mm with.<br />
<br />
Depending on your server will dictate how hard the tear in fear is to get: i got lucky on this bit&gt;  but have been very unlucky with lord rak  3 attempts 2 wipeouts (   Due to bad tanking.<br />
<br />
the fun continues....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's impossible to get epic at level 1. As someone else have said, the faction quests also give experience so you WILL level whether you want to or not just by doing faction work.<br />
<br />
Secondly You cannot delevel to level 1. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, wait til your +50 :)<br />
<br />
I  gotta admit, I have been getting annoyed with some youngsters in my guild, characters in their 20's and 30's begging and demanding help on the Epic Quests (I'm in a rather large guild with a huge level spread, lv. 5-55).  The officers got together and put a stop to this.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I do not know how your guild will feel if they are asked to spend time and resources helping you get something not meant to be earned until you are +50, but I would NEVER ask this of my friends.  I save asking for favors for more reasonable requests. Patience young shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I am working on it now, and am at the High Scale Kirn part of the quest.  I am 48 at the moment.  I will proabably be done by 50, but that is because I am the 4-5 shammie in my guild to do the quest, and they have it down to a science.<br />
<br />
Most of my epic drops will come as a result of us being in the zones for differant reasons, say COM for reavers, Hole for other epic drops, and Fear because, well just because we want to go to Fear.<br />
<br />
Only the end fight will be one that is done just for me.  <br />
<br />
Also my guild awards epic drops by those farthest along in the quest and who are full members (in guild over a month), not by levels, so even though there are shamans who are older then me, they will not get the drop since they haven't spent the solo time doing the other parts of the quest.<br />
<br />
I think the system works pretty well.  I don't mind losing a drop to a person who will get their epic sooner for it, and people don't mind helping me because I go and help other classes on their quest.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I too would suggest getting to the MM stage for the boots soon, not later.  They have saved my life already when I am running away from a mob and SOW dropped, as it usually does.</div></div><hr />
