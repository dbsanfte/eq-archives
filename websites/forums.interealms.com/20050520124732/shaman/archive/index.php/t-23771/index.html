<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why, because it's $4.98 at Target on close-out.  And $4.98 is a decent price for a nice key chain.</div></div><hr />

You know, looking back, i think GoD is by far the worst expansion ever released for EQ. Its that expansion that we will all judge how badly each expansion sucks from here on out. For years we will go &quot; well its better then GoD&quot; or &quot; Its almost as bad as GoD&quot;.<br />
<br />
You know, like how on x-play aquaman is like the benchmark to measure all sucky games by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dang, where do you live?  Think all Target's are doing this?  I'm gonna have to find one to stop by, just so I don't feel cheated for paying $20 for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Takai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good deal.<br />
<br />
I didn't get mine quite as cheap; however, I did get two copies at Target for under $20.00. Which, I might add, is the only reason I have it to date.<br />
<br />
Though I have grown to enjoy the tribute system.</div></div><hr />

I judge all movies in comparison to Congo.  Congo = 0, so it only goes up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My local Target didn't have EQ in any form :(  Guess I'll just do without Gates!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, it will be $4.98 at ALL target stores..assuming the store near you has it in stock :)</div></div><hr />

Yea, i guess thats more the point. Its not good for my type of player. For a unguilded shaman that cant spend 2 hours LFG, meaning i work a lot and time is tight, it sucks for me.<br />
<br />
Its not that bad i guess, but still, kunark was better, SoL was better, PoP was better, Velious was better and it sounds like OoW is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chemosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">haha thanks bro the target near my house had exactly 2 copies. Perfect for me and my bot.   Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is this still going on?  If so, I may need to find another Target to look at!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, found one copy at the local store this morning<br />

<br />
How many many places in Kunark, SoL, Luclin, Velious can you just get a free port etc to, get some nice AA in easy to solo content? That instantly upgrade you 150 hps/mana give you as much ft / feurine(sp) as you want and all it takes is 1-2 hours of solo play in CT per 3 months to support? <br />
<br />
Go to barindu and see all the soloable content. I believe it's 4% AA solo easy kills. EASY =x Great expansion, where if you have sucky dots (ha) you can still kill like mad since mobs are so low hps.</div></div><hr />
