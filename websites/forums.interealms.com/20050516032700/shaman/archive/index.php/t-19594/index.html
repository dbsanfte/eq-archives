<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tonight my friend a 63 EQ/AM3 ranja and I decided to try to Duo the 8th shawl.  Thinking abit more I asked a 65 Pally who was lfg to help out.  Just over an hour later, blammo I got me a new shoulder item.  That was the most fun I've had in a little while in EQ.  That is all, just in a good mood.</div></div><hr />
