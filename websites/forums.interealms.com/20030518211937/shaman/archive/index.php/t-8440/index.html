<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tinaire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am level 51, and I cannot seem to find a good place for soloing.  From 48 to 51 I did really well in the Scarlet Desert, but that is getting really tapped out.  Any ideas would be appriciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CoM, temple courtyard (to the right of the main gate) would be good at your level. That area and Sea Furbies got me to 53 in short order. At 53 you can single pull the bowling allies and gazeebos further in.<br />
<br />
Of course there's always Karnors soloing the moat area, or Burning Woods giant fort. If you have PoP getting to these zones is a lot easier than it use to be.<br />
<br />
Other areas that come to mind are LGuk and SolB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye the CoM temple area is amazing XP and hardly anyone ever is there. There is potential for rare drops but I've had no luck with any of them. Another great thing about CoM is that you can setup and go afk and not worry about dying when you come back. Temple area near the water and the arena north/south are entirely safe spots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinaire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Woot...thanks all for the info, sounds like CoM is my new playground for awhile...lol...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I said this some where else but i cant remember where i posted it, There is another place in Echo that you can solo effectively that is rarly ever camped (unlike TM and the bugs) it is those stinkin Gnomes!! now i am an Iksar and i just love munchin on a Gnome every chance i get but this was just sick i did LVL 51 in about 8 hours here with my Necro and my Shaman both (though the Shammy is sitting at 1 Kill from 52 working on AA waiting for a friend to catch up) there are 4 guards that are easily single pulled here all of which will /con Dark blue, then there is Herold the Harold he will be a light blue and the Court Jester will /con dark blue. <br />
<br />
The thing to watch out for is the 2 Kings they really really are tough the best thing to do with them is to go out to the nexus and Get SoW up then go into Echo and clear the guards and stuff then Cast anything on one of the kings (both will come) and run your tail off to the Deep Zone. Zone out and invis up then go back in the Kings will sit there untill the server resets. Now you can easyly pull Polyana (Cleric Mob), Both the Royal Guards, and the Court Sage (Enc Mob) <br />
<br />
I was getting 1 full blue per cycle here at 51 and by the time you finish the front guards are starting to repop. i wound up dropping the sage outta the rotation because i hate being Mezzed but it is still very Nice<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">gotta agree on gnomes....I have taken to camping for the night in EC, whatever else I do I make sure to kill the four guards the last thing before I camp and the first thing before I start the next time.....only found them camped once in three weeks of play...the five minutes it takes me to kill those eight mobs gives me a good share of a blue bubble each day...</div></div><hr />
