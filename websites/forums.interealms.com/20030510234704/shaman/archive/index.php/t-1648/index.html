<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deener78</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
<br />
Would like to inform u guys that the shammy epic is offically broke.  How do i know this?  Because frankly a certain step IS NOT possible to complete at the moment.  This is my second time completing the shaman epic, and i have followed EVERY step flawlessly, never repeated a step etc.<br />
<br />
Here is what i have gathered.  You CAN complete the shaman epic right now up to the point where you turn in the 6 reports from COM to the spirit in EJ.  Here is where the problem comes in.....<br />
<br />
After the com reports you have to get books off LORD GHIOSKand turn them in to the spirit under the water.  I have followed every step up to this point to perfection, and upon turning in these ghiosk books nothing happened.   This is the part of the epic that is not possible right now.  I have NEVER repeated any steps prior to this ( for those of you who say my faction might be to high), and have never turned in any items using bear form or while invised =D.  Apparently i am not the only one having this problem.  I encourange you to gripe , moan , and complain as best you can so something will be done about it.  WE pay to play this game =D<br />
<br />
If you have turned ghiosk books in after these recent patches /petition a gm and request another copy of the 3 books.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dfarls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OK as of 5/12/02 it works, I did the turn in last night and was given the necessary instructions to carry on my quest.<br />
I am on the Morell thulle server so perhapse it is only your server that is broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On the Nameless I did all of the epic quest up to that point sunday 5-12-02 and turned in my books to the spirit under the water without trouble</div></div><hr />

......<br />
I have NEVER repeated any steps prior to this ( for those of you who say my faction might be to high),<br />
<br />
To be honest, if you did the SHM epic twice, did you do it with two chars? Or your one?<br />
If you did it with your one char, you have indeed gone parts prior that a second time, no way around that.<br />
<br />
Just an observation in your post. Might want to clerify that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why would you do all the early steps a second time? It's faction based, so there's really not any reason to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deener78</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lemme clarify, I have a shaman with epic, i have ANOTHER shammy who is in the middle of epic.  Thank u guys for the post on ghiosk books, 2 days ago i turned em and there was no repsponse from the spirit.......at the time my faction was kindly.   As of today i turned another set in and it worked....faction was still kindly. Go figure.<br />
<br />
Didnt mean to sp00k neone but as of 2 days ago i couldnt proceed with my epic past this point.  I have emailed our gm and maybe they have done something since then.  I understand why they have changed the faction issues, in the ol days u could just repeat easy steps of the epic ie woe and envy part and increase your faction to ally.  This allowed you to skip the part of our epic that is a pain in the arse...the hole and kirn.   From what i understand this &quot;repeat&quot;  method doesnt work with the new changes.  <br />
<br />
With the new kunark style agro now being implemented in the hole, i should have my epic in no time.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just FYI - I was in the Hole yesterday, and my Brell rogue could still sneak around without being attacked, so it looks like that was just a rumour.<br />
<br />
And we mezzed a load of golems too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've seen the &quot;I'm trying to epic, but nothing happened&quot; problem before...TWICE, on two different raids.   Somehow, and I'm not sure how, but somehow, the faction for the shaman in question got fooked up.  Both times another shaman was brought in to get a new set of books and the hand-in was done again.  Both times the trigger...well, it triggered, and the fight was on.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why this happened in the first place;  I read something somewhere that the pet might have something to do with it, but I haven't seen much talk of it.</div></div><hr />
