For once, I'm posting one, since it absolutely blew me away. <br />
<br />
This is a flash animation that someone did about everquest that is more than well done, and anyone that played EQ will understand why I am wanting to share this with people once they see it.<br />

It's kinda long, and loops. It's done when it says &quot;skip intro&quot; agian. For those on dial up, it's 25Mb, but if you can set it up to download and check it out after a long gaming session, I'd say it's one of the few worth sitting through that long a download for. (Yes I used to have dial up and know how long that'd take.)<br />
<br />
Please check it out and share it with everyone you know in Everquest.</div></div><hr />
