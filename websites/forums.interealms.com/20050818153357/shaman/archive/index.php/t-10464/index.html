<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been searching for Malo and Pox on BB for a long time now, and have never see either for sale since PoP came out. As near as I can tell this is because of two things:<br />
<br />
First is no one hunts and farms kunark the way they use to.<br />
<br />
Second is the Major guilds now bank all the major spells for their classes.<br />
<br />
I have never needed Malo more than hunting in Tier 2 and Tier 3 zones. I am fearfull I might have to wait the few months I need to get Can V and then move to level 65 and then spend the half year to try to get all of my level 65 spells. I think I have a better change a getting the level 65 spells than getting a spell 3 expansions old :p<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
-Snowspirit<br />
<br />
P.S. Just a small rant on Malo and it being a supper rare spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On MT I see basically all spells on sale quite frequently .. except new PoP spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You won't miss Pox that much anyway, especially as you keep going past 60. <br />
<br />
Lots of things that can be killed with a group or less, that can drop Malo though. Just have to keep chipping away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see Malo and Torpor for sale approx twice a month on AB....managed to grab mine luckily one of those couple of times too.<br />
<br />
Pox has been around the 35k range the last couple of weeks, and either the same person has been trying to sell it, or it's been dropping a bit more than usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">35k sounds more reasonable than the Minor Healing scroll for 1 Million I saw this morning ;p<br />
<br />
Seriously tho, Pox was on sale on BB about 3 weeks ago, price range in or around 40k.  I saw Malo once in the recent past, a couple months ago, but it was way out of my reach, at 75k.  Since then, I haven't seen them.  Avatar was in the Bazaar today, 2 of them in fact, 50 to 60k I think.<br />
<br />
I think I'm about to head back to Skyfire and camp the GW's there, the named and such.  A while back, a guild mate and I did them alot, and the spell drop was pretty decent.<br />
<br />
At 57, I'm just taking one level at a time, and buying the hard to find ones only after I gave up hunting them.  Hopefully Malo will fall into my hands around the 60th Ding.  With the Higher planes now being farmed alot by the higher end guilds, it leaves the areas on Kunark and Velious freer for the rest of us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On the tribunal they arent for sale either.  I saw pox for sale a couple of times in the last month but have yet to see malo for sale.  Malo is the one that I really need now that I am raiding ssra and soon VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Avatar and Pox are about the only kunark spells I still lack.<br />
<br />
Journy, why will I not miss pox?   I solo a high percentage of my time and pox looks like it will be a major tool.  I am very concearned about my ability to continue to solo when I get into the 60s.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Because it is easier to get the 64 dot then it is to get pox.  Hell it seems like it is easier to get Quiessesnce then it is to get torpor and that takes a rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Acanthurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Everytime you enter the bazaar auction for the spells you need.  Many people can have them in a guild bank or on another character and if they see your auction they'll send you a tell.  Thats how I got my copy of Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On Saryn Malo and Topor are rarely for sale.  They other one that is being hard for me to find is Tigirs Insects.  I've been farming SF GW's about twice a week with zero luck.<br />
<br />
BTW, can someone give the prices of both Tigirs and Voice of the Berserker?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I see Tigir's for around 4k all the time on SZ.  Saw Torpor for 50k.  Never seen malo.   I can't afford any of 'em.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not for sale?  Why wait for it to magically show up in bazaar?  If you are not already hitting mobs that can potentially drop these spells then get on it!! :)<br />
<br />
Sure the drop rate sucks and getting peeps to go to VP is about as likely as getting SOE to bring back Manastones, but there are things you can do to better your situation.  Grab a friend or two and kill Gwurms a few times a week or grab even more friends and drop Tal/Gore.  Sebilis is ugly but doable and you can come away with some decent consolation prize drops.<br />
<br />
I have seen Malo for sale only 3 times since the bazaar opened and the pricing has been between 80-113K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Snowspirit, send me a tell in game.  I think I have a spare I can access for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
only 75k.. thx foh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Snow, get a tank of any sort and do GW's in Skyfire.  Not that I had any raging success but I know you have torpor so you should be able to do it.  Rhyls and Gotien were a lot of help for all the annoying attempts I made.<br />
<br />
Talk to Tulk too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tulkor!!! :) Will be looking for you in game :)<br />
<br />
I have been stopping by sebis for jumpy and emp off and on every time I can get a group to go down, but no luck as yet on drops.<br />
<br />
Them GW hit hard, and without a partner, a mistake can be deadly.<br />

  I haven't seen Malo in a while, which is unusual for BB. It was always relatively common (and cheap) before PoP. There was a copy of Malos in the bazaar tonight, for 75k. <br />
<br />
Pox has been on sale recently, but for 30k or more. It's nice and all, but I couldn't see paying anything close to that. <br />
<br />
... speaking of spells, I have a copy of True Spirit I'd like to trade for Tnarg's, if anyone has an extra copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I say you won't miss it &quot;much&quot; for a few reasons. The biggest is:  if you think it's going to radically change your soloing life, you're going to be dissapointed. I remember shelling out way to much plat for it back in the day, and all excited in theory, but in practice, it just didn't effect me the way I thought it was going to.<br />
<br />
It's certainly a fun &quot;toy&quot;, but don't let it get you discouraged. It's not practical enough to let it ruin your fun. If you really want some big disease dot, get 64, as BoU is much easier to obtain. But by then, you will find it even more pointless, as PoP mobs tend to die way to fast, and you won't be experiencing in many other places at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ultor and pox stack, don't pass up the opportunity to get pox if you can. I still use it, not in xp groups, but on major raid bosses and when soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was 64 when I finally saw Torpor. <br />
<br />
I was about to camp GW's for the 1000th time with an SK friend. He was at the VP entrance and waiting for me, when on the way there I saw a wandering GWurrmy. I slow him, sank in a few dots and called my buddy out from VP zone to the northern wall to gimme a hand. He was killed in short order as he looted:<br />
<br />
/g Holy sh*t man...<br />
/g What? Shard? Check for a cleric who can use it. <br />
SK had looted --Spell: Torpor<br />
Shaman passes out. <br />
<br />
He handed it to me and I scribed. <br />
<br />
Point of story: Stick it out. It will happen, sooner or later. Malo/Torpor still drop so rarely that VI should be shot for it's irresponsible thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Remember not all things show up when you're looking through bazaar, doing general searches like &quot;shaman&quot; &amp; &quot;scroll&quot;<br />
<br />
type the name of what you're looking for and leave every thing else set to &quot;any&quot; ...and you're far more likely to find what you are looking for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The VERY first two search i do in the bazaar. are malo and pox.. then I look for the level 63 and 64 spells *nods*... <br />
<br />
But good advise :)<br />
