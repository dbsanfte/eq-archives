<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
<br />
I looked everywhere I knew of and couldn't find specific pet info anywhere. Maybe I missed it or somebody could direct me/tell me of what I seek?<br />
<br />
I know our pets aren't tanks, I use mine to add to my own damage, but still I have questions:<br />
<br />
I hear giving weapons to our pets improve damage ratio/types.<br />
*What level pet does this kick in?<br />
<br />
Mages have different pet types i.e. - Warrior, Rogue, Caster, etc.<br />
*Do our pets come in different forms? Like, is there a Warrior pet that comes with warrior like skills? Or a Rogue type that attacks better from behind?<br />
<br />
*Do our pet's get bash, double attack, parry, evade, dodge like skills?<br />
<br />
In general, just not sure what to expect now and in the future from the puppy. Any help would be way welcomed. Thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All our pets are the same type -- low hp warrior types that can double attack, kick and bash. No rogue or caster types. The first pets aren't so hot but a buffed 49 pet on a slowed mob can tank some pretty impressive stuff. The 49 pet with buffs has from what I've seen around 1500hp, no where near a mage or necro pet so it does require some attention. It can't tank multiple mobs so if you get adds it's best to aggro one and root park it out of the way.<br />
<br />
There are a couple different ways to use the pet. <br />
<br />
1. Slow+root+pet tank+you med. Damage output is not great so this takes a while. Best to throw on a dot or two. Reapply root if aggro.<br />
<br />
2. Slow+pet+you melee. Sick pet on mob and jump into the fight, get on the opposite side of your pet so the mob has its back to your pet. Good for getting your melee and defense skills up. <br />
<br />
3. Reverse fear kite. Turn pet taunt off and dot the mob heavily and run around while pet hits it from the rear. This is not very effecient and looks goofy :)<br />
<br />
I usually resort to method #1 with dots. Turgur a mob, sick pet, throw in an ebolt and root then med+canni is a very effecient way to kill stuff.<br />
<br />
My best pet tank story was in Hands/WL room in KC. I slowed a drolvarg warlord and root parked it on the side and let pet at it. I had to SH the pet a few times but after root broke and the rest of the group started fighting it my pet got summoned lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1.  Do a search on &quot;project alpha&quot;  it is rumored that giving your pet weapons helps but *shrugs* I wouldn't know about that now would I.  *winks*<br />
<br />
2.  As far as I know, through my current 49 pet, they are all warriors with the warrior attributes, kick, bash, double attack and see #1.<br />
<br />
In general, with the 34 and 39 pet you will have to do much of the tanking for your pet and treat him like a DoT.  With the 44 pet and especially the 49 pet you can slow and let them do some, if not all of the tanking depending on the MoB.  I reguarly just slow Giants/Wurms/Skeles/Apes/Sarnaks in BW, sic pet and JBB and let him tank the distance for 60 seconds or so.  With slow and Regrowth he rarely goes below half and generates health back at an enormous rate when not in combat.<br />
<br />
So in short, your early pets can't take much of a beating but later on you can count on them to do some of the tanking for ya.  <br />
<br />
Btw, you want to do most of the tanking to level 40 anyways, get that defense to 200...=P</div></div><hr />
