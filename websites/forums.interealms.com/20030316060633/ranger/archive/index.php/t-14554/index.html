<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nilus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys!<br />
<br />
First and foremost : Thanks for a lovley source of knowledgde!<br />
<br />
I was wondering if the raidexp has been fully covered somewhere?<br />
<br />
example : Full group and player joins in and we start a raid. How much exp will the group loose per kill (not counting in faster kills = more mobs) ?  Will all raidmembers get equally exp per kill or will the groupmembers of &quot;killing&quot; group get more per kill...  ?<br />
<br />
I have searched and maybee missed it.. but has anyone looked into this numbers?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/bonk Hello.  Welcome to the glade.<br />
<br />
And as for teh question it is a good one. Things have improved a little since teh patch but I would like to know the numbers as well.  My expierience before the patch was that adding a 7th person really reduced XP significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i've never seen any specific numbers, and really the only way to get them is with something like showEQ, but since the patch raid xp is way better, I did a 8 person group in PoV and there was no noticable slow down in xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aluuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Has anyone thought of using the RaidXP feature to powerlevel someone? Has anyone tried it? Seems to me would be a good way to do something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nilus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone seen this kinda numbercrunching on any other board perhaps...?  ( I know.. it sucks to go to other boards.. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">By numbers I meant X amount of XP (% AA or level) per hooour in a group of 6 verses Y amount of XP for a group of 7 or 8 in an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nilus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMHO Fufinski, thats all about the group composition.<br />
<br />
We do now that we lose exp when we go from full group to 7 people in a raid, and I think your question is about how much speed you add to the killing of the mobs when the 7th person joins in. <br />
Lets say its another bored enchanter... nothing much added there ;) but another badass ranger that keeps pulling and feeding mobs to the chanter to mess for the full group to kill? <br />
<br />
That would speed up the kills a lot i would think (no downtime in pulling and a badass ranger dps added between pulling)<br />
<br />
So what i would know is how much exp the full group loses per kill. Is it so much so it wont matter how much faster you kill it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arbok of Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How much exp will the group loose per kill <br />
<br />
It's lose not loose =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Perhaps the best way to test would be have a group of 6 XP in a camp for 1 hour and note how much XP was made.  Then add a Bot to the same group in a raid situation and have the Bot just sit there and do nothing for 1 hour.  The actual amount of XP earned during the hour should be approximately the same.  This however will now be divided between 7 using raid XP algorithms.  The group will obviously get les XP over the hour but should have earned approximately the same numeric amount of XP.  Will the new total be 6/7 of the old?  Or will it be significantly less, and how much less?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nilus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks a lot for the constructive input Arbok of Xegony!<br />
<br />
As you can see through my posts I do know how to spell lose, it was just sloppy typing and for that I apologize.<br />
<br />
Fufinski :  I think you are on the right track, but was amazes me is that someone hasnt done this numbercrunching yet...<br />
<br />
Nilus, Da bad speller</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lythe Featherblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another vital and very simple test would be holding a camp with a group of 6, then splitting it into 2 groups and holding same camp in raid mode.  This might give insight into whether simply being in raid mode adds a penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">join the raid, get 0.000000000001 exp per kill, anything else i'm missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kalvarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No it's better than that now.  We did a spur of the moment V the Shade raid in PoN last night.  On the way in to his plateau I made 5% real xp in level 57.  Not great, in a single group I'd have probably made 15% in that time at the goblins and mephits, but considering it was part of a 3 group raid it's just about right if you consider splitting the xp 18 ways instead of 6.<br />
<br />
The 70 person zug zug raids still net zero xp though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Locz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here is an example on how raid experience hurts the grind:<br />
<br />
Lets suppose you kill a MOB with 100 exp points.<br />
<br />
NORMAL GROUP EXP<br />
20 % grouping bonus<br />
group gets 100*1.20 = 120 exp<br />
exp/person = 120/6 = 20<br />
<br />
RAID EXP with a SEVEN PERSON GROUP<br />
*assume a 30% exp penalty*  (I don't know the real number)<br />
group gets 100 *(1-.30) = 70 exp<br />
exp/person = 70/7 = 10<br />
<br />
Normal / Raid exp per person = 20 / 10 = 2<br />
<br />
So normal exp is TWICE as good as raid exp (assuming a 30% penalty).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Locz, then penalty doesn't seem to be that great anymore. Maybe 10%, and it isn't clear if that is from the base exp or if you get the full group bonus first. It really isn't bad now, at least for small 2 group raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Locz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If the penalty is 10%, and following the logic of the prior example, then:<br />
<br />
raid exp/person = 90/7 = 13.9<br />
<br />
and then grouping is 20/13.9 *100% = 143% better.<br />
<br />
Still a lot.<br />
And I think a 30% penalty is closer to reality than 10%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mippo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The number I have heard floating around was a 40% experience penalty in a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haroun Zehra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Forget exp... the thing that really gets me is that if I'm in a raid, and I kill something solo, I can't loot it!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Pendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I had a possible new problem with raid experience. We had 3 full groups or 18 people doing the hedge maze quest in PoN. When it was over I had gained 9% of an AA (included some fighting by the raid besides the quest). However two other people in the raid said they had gained 12% of an AA. I am quite sure on the amount I gained and I could see one person having messed up how much they gained but not 2. Others on the raid either did not know what they started with or were not 100% AA. With the other two people one was 1 level below me and other was my same level. Neither of them were a hybrid.<br />
<br />
So my first thought is there is a possibility the hybrid experience is messed up with raid experience. I will try to get others to track exp on my next raid and see if I can confirm anything? Can other Glade people look for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Haroun, if a mod dies and the kill credit goes to a raid member, the raid loot rules apply, even if the person killed the mob solo (with no help from other raid members).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mippo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Racial experience bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Epiphany EQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Something VI has alluded to but not outright said is that the raid xp penalty varies depending on the number of persons in the raid.  They've said things like, &quot;once you hit 10 people, you are better off splitting into 2 groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway I'll chime in that raid xp is much better since the patch.  However I've been getting far far less xp while in raid than I am in group.  In fact, someone actually suggested that they deliberately set raid xp super low at first so people would complain and then they could turn it up to where they really wanted it in the first place.  Now even though raid xp is still low, everyone is happy with it because it's better than it was.  Think about it.  I bet you it's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Pendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Racial experience bonus would not account for differences in exp gained. I am a Half Elf Ranger. I believe the other two people were a Dark Elf Necro and Barbarian Shaman. Could be wrong about that but in any case I think the best experience bonus is from a Halfling Warrior and then it would only be a 10% bonus. The difference I saw was about 30%. I also think the old hybrid penalty was 30%. I know when Luclin first came out soloing hybrids were gaining AA too fast because they were incorrectly adjusting AA experience. My theory right now is with raid experience they are once again messing up the adjustments for hybrids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lythion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Pendan what was your level and what was the 2 other members level?<br />
<br />
If the 2 others had a higher level than you I suspect that the normal exp distribution rules still apply, and that they received more exp based on that. As the exp went into AA the uneven distribution became visible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Pendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">With the other two people one was 1 level below me and other was my same level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">did raid XP with 2 grps in POS, made 1% aa per giant, in 1 grp was 3% AA per giant. But the faster killing etc 2grps was probably worth it we could handle extra adds 0 downtime etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Did Kael arena last Friday with a 10 person raid. Got about a blue an hour in AAexp, actually a bit more. Given that zone, that's not much less than I would have expected for a single group, due to faster kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As far as i can tell now it seems XP is just shared between the people in raid, but you get no grp bonus. Seems most likely imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dravack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I generally play a dorf cleric as a bot on other puter.  I have noticed that in raids/duo/ or groups, he gains exp faster then my half-elf ranger.  They are both lvl61, ranger has 60aa and cleric has 9aa.  Can't think of a reason they SHOULD be gaining exp at different rates, but they do.  Hybrid exp nerf come back to haunt us????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Dravack, how much faster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Majestic42</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Pendan: maybe I'm missing it above, if so I apologize. But did you mention if each of the characters you were comparing were putting the same amount into AA? I.E. what was there regular / AA split?<br />
<br />
My GF was splitting hers 80 reg / 20 aa and myself 90 reg / 10aa n PoV, 8 person raid, and she got about 10-15% more AA than I did in the time we were there. Course, I got more in regular exp than she did. Overall, raid exp is DEFINITELY better, but we were killing so fast we were waiting a tad on respawn, which slowed us down some.<br />
<br />
Just didn't see if that was clarified :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>moldas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Another factor may be levels of the people on the raid.<br />
<br />
A level 61 is going to get more xp than a 65 in most cases...if you did any aaxp in 61 in PoN/PoD or whatever, go back at 65 and see how much less aaxp you get per kill on the same mob you were killing at 61.<br />
<br />
Assuming you even get any xp at all, as some of the mobs may have even greened out at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Pendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">did you mention if each of the characters you were comparing were putting the same amount into AA? <br />
<br />
I sort of mentioned it:<br />
Others on the raid either did not know what they started with or were not 100% AA <br />
<br />
The 3 of us were 100% AA. The first thing I checked when the others said they had gotten more percent gain was that I was truely at 100%.<br />
<br />
I have not been on a raid since my first post where more than a couple percent was gained and that was too small of an amount to make any meaningfull comparisons. There is a margin of error when comparing percent gained to another person because can't tell how far into the percent started at or ended.</div></div><hr />
