<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering if anyone can find a flaw in this idea? Which would in one swoop fix a number gripes across classes... I truly believe the panther issue has nothing to do with the spell itself as is, but rather it's a reflax to wizard complaints. Lets stop thinking every situation has to be solved with a nerf.<br />
<br />
Here is my proposal for the changes, based on the rational given that a wizards can't out DPS us when we cast it on OTHER players. <br />
 <br />
Add a new spell line for Enchanters which adds an increase chance to critical your spells (or add additional modifier to your nukes) that will be equivilant to how panther ups the dps of melees. (short duration buff)<br />
 <br />
With that you would no longer need to nerf the spell and make everyone unhappy, wizards would have nothing to complain about. Enchanters would feel useful agian on raids where there is nothing to mez and you would promote another layer of interdepence and promote a fun enviroment. Shaman have fun casting it, melee's have fun recieving it. Same would go for enchanters and nukers. Yes I know fun is a dangerous thing, but we are playing a game here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It would be a cool idea to add a panther like buff to casters that when they nuked a second nuke or effect would go off. It would be cool if a small mana tap had a chance to go off after a nuke landed. I'm sure that would shut up all casters. It couldn't be a fixed amount because people would shoot off a level one nuke to proc it, so maybe it would only work with 66+ nukes or something and give back 50 mana or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would much rather see a form of &quot;other classes up instead of one class down&quot; policy. I honestly think SOE has tried its hardest NOT to &quot;nerf&quot; as much, and do more &quot;nerf by ommission&quot; type of balance adjustments. This would be a great idea to do just that. If there is one class that just sucks for raid stackability even more than us, its Chanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like the idea, how about a buff similar to panther for casters that adds X (550 or example) damage to the base damage of DD nukes. <br />
<br />
You could also make it a % to prevent casting smaller faster nukes just for the buff benifit.  Increase a nukes base pre focus damage by (say 15%-20%)<br />
<br />
Wish they would have added this as part of the original panther buff, it may have saved us on the rebalancing issue.</div></div><hr />
