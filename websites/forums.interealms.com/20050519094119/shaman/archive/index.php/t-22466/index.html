<br />
It depends on how many times it resists being changed. If you're an enchanter you can just charm the next-door neighbor and make him change it for you. We were much better light bulb changers years ago when light bulbs lasted longer. Today all the light bulbs are high light output with a short life span, and our bulb changing skills have been marginalized.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">why would we change the lightbulb instead of casting acumen of dar khura? that would not only allow us to see better, it would improve our stamina regen and allow us to see invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We slow TIME ITSELF.<br />
<br />
You would never know the lightbulb needed to be changed in the firstplace.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried to change the bulb but got the message that I was only partially successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>whytewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can we just buff the lightbulb and refresh it to make it work better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">get it right, it isnt class balance it's Class Definition (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=shamanbalance)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even worse:  if we use our best bulb, we have to change it again every 7 - 12 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That depends.<br />
<br />
Does the lightbulb mitigate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">None.<br />
they would just whine why they have to do it and got no working lightbulb from the start instead of working for their light.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Every time we put a lightbulb in, those damned clerics throw a hammer at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Unfortunately, due to union rules, players are not allowed to change the lightbulb.  Players can only point out that it needs changing to the steward.  Luckily for the steward, there are plenty of other players that like the darkness and will repeatedly say the lightbulb is not burnt out at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DBullneck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">500 to make a &quot;One Voice&quot; effort to change a broken bulb, 3 to make the statement that the bulb isn't broken and stop delivery of a replacement bulb from SOE Bulb Co.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Only One<br />
<br />
But all the classes who didn't change the light bulb complain about the lack of balance in lightbulb changing ability.</div></div><hr />
