<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rydaark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I got my shiny new epic the other nice and was very happy with myself...tonight I went out and dotted myself by accident..guess I was tired or not paying attention. Wasn't in any danger of dying but still it's embarasing. I go to remove it and I can't lol. It's a curse, duh. So here I am with my own dot soaking me for 1200 HP  and I can't do a  darn thing about it.  I rarely camp mobs that dot me with curse but I'm thinking of a few bad situations I've got myself into by rooting  myself or doing  something equally stupid. I'm sure most of us can recall a time like that &lt;god I hope I'm not the only one&gt;.  Anyway  think I may go pay a visit to echo caverns soon...would be nice to have the cure  as well as the cause...would be really embarassing to die like that.  I'd never hear the end of it in guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is our epic DoT curable with the level 39 &quot;Remove Curse&quot; or will it require the higher level &quot;Remove Greater Curse&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think it's curable by remove curse at all - Curse of the Spirits is a curse in name only. Checking the info at lucy shows that it doesn't add any curse counters, so you will have to remove the effect with dispell magic.<br />
<br />
I can verify this myself, many times has some other caster in a group dispelled my epic DoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dispell magic is all you need for our epic.<br />
<br />
I still don't quite understand why you can cast RC till you are blue in the face on some curses, but not remove it while a single cast of RGC is sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Probably because Remove Greater Curse (54) (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2880&amp;source=Live) has 6 times the de-cursing power of Remove Curse (39) (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2946&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you can probably use radiant cure on it as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dotted myself today by accident and found out that there is no way to remove it beside cancel magic.  When Luclin first came out you could remove the effect with 2 remove curses or 1 greater remove curse.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the ninja nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, radiant cure will take care of epic DoT...  /sigh</div></div><hr />
