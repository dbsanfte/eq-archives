<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Sludge-Eating Fly in the Lair GoD Sewer trial can drop this augment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68505).  I killed about 8 of these things the other day and it dropped it three times, so seems relatively common.  I got this aug for my main AND one of my alts (many of my guild mates have spell haste from the range item you quest in hate or already had the aug.)<br />
<br />
Sorry if someone already mentioned this, but spell haste 4 is incredibly useful, so I figured even if someone had, it's worth doing so again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, I hope to get one of those some day...  We haven't had quite the luck you've had with that drop, but he's pretty easy with a group, so it's only a matter of time.  We seem to get the arms most often, followed by the mask.  Have gotten the aug on 2 out of about 20 kills.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We've got 2 drops in about 25 kills.  One on our first kill though was pretty nice.  If you farm him a bit, you'll rot dozens of 90 hp melee masks and 85 hp plate arms.  Supposedly there's a cloak on his drop table that is 100 hp, but we've never seen it.  Also only seen 1 spell (necro, rotted) in all those kills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How long were you there to get 25 named kills?  His spawn rate seems to be 1 in 10 trials.  Sometimes he spawns deep in the dungeon so we dont bother going after him.  Dont wanna plow take the time to plow with 3 ppl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">15 hours probably.  Been spread over 5-6 trips total, sometimes 1 person will sit and spawn a few for a while waiting on others to log on, other times we have 3-4 people running solo missions scouting, including 1 druid who tracks.  Anything in the first room or hallway we kill.<br />
<br />
Once we got lucky and 2 were up as wanderers that walk through the first hall.</div></div><hr />
