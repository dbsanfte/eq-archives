<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So Everquest live had this message about lost treasures dropping all this week.  Apparently nerfed drops were once again going to be dropping.  Has anyone seen any evidence of this anywhere?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure if they mean that, or if they are being cryptic about the chests in the LDON zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">According to the Safehouse thread they ARE talking about old toys.  I would personally like to see a Mask of the deciever or a manastone.  <br />
<br />
Would be cool to be able to gp /role and click th mask and aviod the buff babies in PoK, and a mana stone in LDoN would be a lot of fun.  Not that I run OOM in dungeons anyway, but it would still be fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like that they're doing this during the Fan Faire...  First one I've ever gone to, but I can't imagine I'll be playing much from there.  /rude  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">last on 7th we had some named dragons outside of Kael. dropped GEBs and 2 crap old school swords and the 6 charge lifetap earring with 6 wis and int. the name escapes me now though. nothing super special really.</div></div><hr />

Box of abu-kar was really nice, dropped rarely off HG's, spectres, even got one off a wan in l.guk, was 100% weight reduction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To the poster a few above, manastones don't work inside the dungeons in LDoN, only outside.  It help's when you're buffing your group though, thats about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My understanding is these drops won’t start until the 28th, which is this Sunday.  I wonder if they’ll drop in both adventure difficulties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wonder if they will go throughout October then, similar to the Holloween events from a few years back.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pretty sure they said it stops on the 28th, already had the results of one event linked to me (while I was offline :()</div></div><hr />

<br />
has I recall from back in the day the Box of Abu-kar had a chance to drop from any mob at all. Part of the reason I rember them giveing for nerfing it was so that &quot;Higher Lv's&quot; would not spend all day farming lowbi zones and mobs trying to get one. Wich is really ironic when you look at a lot of our present trade skills items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My brother (who also plays) asks me &quot;hey what's the name of a famous Kevin Spacey character in a movie?&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I tell him Kyser Soze because it's probably his most famous character.<br />
<br />
When I found out he got a free AA point for that answer, I was upset.   ;)</div></div><hr />
