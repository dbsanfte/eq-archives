<br />
Yes, but at least their software has been tested when it's released, and doesn't require multiple patches just for 'features' to work properly<br />
<br />
Blizzard's games also run very well for the graphics they have.  I'll be really suprised if the system req's for WoW are much higher than EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looks great, tastes good, more filling now will they have learned their lesson from the Diablos? It doesn't take many cheaters and hackers to ruin these lands for all.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't have faith in Blizzard right now. Diablo 2 was my first online rpg, which I played for 2 years cause it was all I had. It was was the most unbalanced rpg I have ever played. Once you got to a semi-high level everything was a mess. If you think EQ is bad you should play a game that has:<br />
hundreads of known bugs and exploits,<br />
thousands of cheaters (even on the &quot;secure&quot; servers),<br />
terrible class balance,<br />
worse graphics than EQ,<br />
awful lag,<br />
and about 5 patches a year.<br />
 <br />
I know there are seperate teams working on games at Blizzard but when I see that name I think of the Diablo debacle. <br />
<br />
PS. Sorry for the rant, but when I see people complain about EQ I think to myself that they wouldn't last 1 month in a game that is really broken. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, true, Blizzard often pushes the dates back, which is not so good, but look on the better side: what they release is usually VERY playable right away, is well done and is always a &quot;hit&quot; :) So personally I think that WoW will be something very cool. And I don't even mind the cartoonish look at all, I think it looks actually pretty cool. But then again, I do like Blizzard titles too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Colour me unimpressed.  Plenty of women with their... &quot;assets&quot; hanging out... where are the cute guys?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've never started a game that didn't have terrible lag, at least at the beginning, due to one of two things and usually both -- unoptimized code because they're trying to push stuff out the door in beta stage and only patch it if it makes money, and nothing remotely like the server capacity necessary to launch a game that sells strongly.  <br />
<br />
For all Blizzards vaunted testing and pushing back release dates, they were just as terrible as anyone -- maybe worse than anyone, with Diablo 2.  It was virtually unplayable when it hit the streets.  Blizzard said they were expecting to build up to the number of people that hit their servers in the first three days over a period of weeks.  Yet, they put on the biggest, most prolonged advertising campaign I've ever seen for any game, and had the experience of the first Diablo also to let them know that many people do NOT play the single player game to start with, and a great many do not even play it at ALL, ever.  A huge number will not even read the manual!  They just hop on the servers as soon as they install the game.<br />
<br />
How much worse will it be with a game that has a persistent world, like WOW?   I expect Blizzard will bite it hard, like everyone always does, with horrible server capacity and massive lag for those who do make it on the servers.  I expect a LOT of excuse making, and glossing over it all by all the gaming magazines that probably get half their revenue from advertising Blizzard products.<br />
<br />
That said -- I have been looking forward to WOW more than any other game since I first heard about it quite some time ago.  <br />
<br />
Blizzard has something extremely rare in gaming -- a sense of humor, and some personality.  I expect their world not to be so deadly dull as Verant's.  Verant has some cool monsters, but overall, the NPC's are very lifeless and dull.  There aren't really any &quot;funny&quot; pay-offs to quests, or generally even any very interesting ones besides a piece of loot or something.  I expect that when Blizzard gets over their initial fiasco when they release it on too few and too buggy servers, WOW will be a game with a LOT of personality and things designed to be genuinely fun.  The tedious, depressingly dull quests and key camps in EQ will probably have some parallel in WOW and any RPG for that matter, but I have little doubt that WOW will be just more fun all the way through.<br />
<br />
How deep will it be?  Blizzard has never gone for deep, and never achieved it.  It may seem TOO simple and repetitive to people used to thinking of byzantine quests, and EQ customers may wind up forgetting how much they hated a lot of the EQ butt rot camps and start mythologizing them instead as having more &quot;character&quot; and giving more of a sense of &quot;accomplishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I think Blizzard could give us a very entertaining but limited product.  One thing I'll note.  EQ has expansion after expansion now -- a crazy number of zones to be in and monsters to fight, etc.  WOW, if it's a small world, like EQ originally was, is going to wind up driving a lot of people nuts.  They're going to need to have content to burn, because that's what we're used to now, and because they will probably have five million people buy the game the first week.<br />
<br />
I wish them luck, and I wouldn't be surprised if I find myself buying WOW even if everybody says it sucks, just to see for myself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I really like the colorful, stylish look of WoW. Their models appear to use fewer polygons than then new EQ ones, which should make for good performance -- but they still look wonderful due to the detailed texturing.<br />
<br />
I hope they hide the details of game mechanics as much as possible.  Keep things mysterious.  A warrior friend of mine remarked that all he hated how you can see the damage and delay of every weapon in EQ.  The second something drops he can dismiss it without every wielding it.<br />
<br />
I'm definately going to play WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">WoW will be huge, and I bet very fun. Only thing I question too is depth. If it is too arcadish it will be a bummer. But anyone who knows anything about video gaming will be checking it out I think, Blizzard doesnt make many crap games.<br />

Graphics look astounding, about time somone made an enviornment with some flavor and colors. I don't play games for reality, I play to go to some far off mystical land!!(did I say that or just think it?)<br />

I like the cartoonish look of WoW and I know it will be a lot of fun playing it. Let's just hope they manage to make it cheat free and not like their other battle.net titles. Btw, WoW won't be played over battle.net, they will create a different network for it, which is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Hope it will be out in 3-4 years :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Njaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've been looking forward to WoW since I first saw screenshots of it.  And looking at their site on it, I found something that seems just .... too cool.<br />
<br />
How do you prevent camping and kill stealing in non-instanced areas?<br />
Competition over rare item drops and quest items is the primary cause of camping and kill stealing. In World of Warcraft, many rare item drops are not exclusive to any one creature. Several creatures will have a chance of dropping the same item. If the required item is a quest item, the player can join a group of other players on the same quest and seek the item together with them. Every player on the quest will receive a copy of the quest item from the monster or location where it was found.<br />
<br />
If that isn't a major selling point, what is?</div></div><hr />

I'm also concerned about how they handle PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">from the FAQ<br />
<br />
How do guilds work?<br />
Players can band together to form guilds, which are large social groups, in order to help each other progress in the game. Players get to choose an emblem and color combination unique to their guild, embroidered on special guild tabards that players can display proudly over their characters' armor. <br />
<br />
<br />
now that's nifty :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think I have had more fun playing Blizzard games than any other games.  I got hooked on the original warcraft and I've bought every game they've released since then.  Blizzard does have a knack for &quot;fun&quot; in their games, and I've never been dissapointed in this category.<br />
<br />
I'm confident that WoW will be the most enjoyable MMORPG out there content wise, level treadmill-wise, and long term replayablity wise.<br />
<br />
However, Blizzard does not have a good track record with networking games.  Diabloii was a disaster when it was realeased.  Great game - virtually unplayable on Bnet.   A monthly fee *should* eliminate all problems of this nature - that's why you pay the monthly fee.  However, only one company has produced a rock solid network on release day - Mythic with DAoC.  <br />
<br />
If Blizzard drops the ball with their network, WoW will probably fail.  Unfortunate, but true.  I guess I'm trying to say that screenies are great, they show promise, but I'll not get my panties in a bunch until 1)Blizzard finishes the product before 2010, and 2) the network proves it can handle the flood of people on release day.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion,<br />

*edit* started looking through the FAQ.  Nice stuff in there:<br />
<br />
How do mounts work in World of Warcraft?<br />
World of Warcraft offers a variety of mounts for the different races of Azeroth (the world on which the game takes place). For example, Humans generally ride horses, and Orcs tend to favor their trusted wolf mounts. Mounts are a great way to travel the world for mid-to-high-level characters. With extensive training, riding specialists will be able to use mounts not generally available to their particular race, but this ability will be rare. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dragon rider? :)<br />
<br />
Will there be a bank? How much will it hold?<br />
Yes, there will be a bank with ample storage space to hold multiple player items. This option will allow players to store as many items as they need without requiring them to create additional characters to store surplus items. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG, no need for &quot;Muley01&quot; or &quot;FreeportMule&quot; chars?  Would be nice if the bank was accessible to all your characters too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">OMG the fish are weilding yaks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Blizz is pretty much the only game publisher that can guarantee massive sales just with their name.  I would expect WoW to do well.  I was kind of bummed that they didn't set it in the D2 universe, but it seems much better marketing to set in in WC (WC appeals to a whole range of gamers not already in the fantasy RPG market).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game looks awesome, I'm sure it'll be a blast, but I have no realistic expectations of it being released before mid 2004, more likely 2005.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Breckan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You can't fairly compare WoW to Diablo 2. D2 isn't an MMORPG, it's an ORPG and is also single player. It's a point and click dungeon crawl game and if you're playing online it's a point and click dungeon-crawling-broken-pvp game. Im not complaining about it, I've spent many hours playing D2 but to compare it to WoW would be like comparing EQ the MMORPG to EQ the Pocket PC game..<br />
<br />
And Blizzard is creating a whole new server architecture for MMORPG use for WoW. The ability to do map hacks, item dupes and other hacks will be reduced dramitically. But getting rid of all hacks would be impossible, even EQ has had it's fair share of very serious and game changing hacks/exploits.<br />
<br />
Many things will get changed from now until WoW is released. I wouldn't guarentee anything they have said to be in final release, but it's great they have this ambition and dedication..that's what makes them Blizzard. Plus they have Tigole! YAY Tigole!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Looks good, I just hope Blizzard finally learns and not trip on the same branch for the 5th time and make a game that takes more than 3 weeks to hack.<br />
<br />
At least this time it should be easier with the new server architecture. <br />

As far as content, we'll just have to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tulson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think we can expect 3D Art Design to improve dramatically over the next few years.  Technology is advancing, techniques are improving, it is just a matter of time before near Movie Quality 3D will be available in real-time on our desktops.  If fact, Production 3D (Film/TV) and 3D Gaming are converging as an industry.  Tools are standardizing, skill sets are normalizing.  A renaissance in online, immersive, 3D worlds is beginning and the promise of truly interactive online environments is finally coming around.   But...<br />
<br />
The graphics card/pixel wars distracted game developers away from the true holy grail gaming:  AI.  AI in all games today is infantile and doesn't amount to more than a couple of if/then statement decision trees.  The day when you can have a conversation with an onscreen character and NOT know whether it is real or artificial will be the next great evolution in online gaming.  That is at least 10 years away and when it arrives it will herald a new era for more than just online games (e.i. Business transactions, social interactions, etc.)<br />
<br />
Oh, and since I am being prophetic here let throw out one more nugget...Did you know online gaming in the future will be free?  How, you ask?  It will be paid for through in-game advertising, of course. <br />
<br />
I bet we see that within the next three years from our good friends at Sony.  Like…for instance…when EQ2 launches and they stop maintaining EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, blizzard did not have the money to maintain a persistent world very well with diablo 2. You paide for the box and you were done. no financial obligation at all. So in a way, you get what you pay for there. <br />

With the subscriber base paying on a monthly basis, there will be alot more room to keep on maintenance programmers/ artists to get things running smoothly.<br />
<br />
That said, I will try it out. If it does not crash consistently, or lag to complete hell all the time, has a good chat system, gameplay for melee classes and others doesn't suck (ala Melee/hybrids/casters having to switch out all the time in DAoC and AC, decent spells, and a lagless but fair melee fighting system) I will switch.

<br />
blizzard has never made a RPG<br />
<br />
they have never made a MMPOG<br />
<br />
but they are the best gaming company in the world (along with iD)<br />
<br />
WoW is as sure a bet as is possible in MMPOG (along with SWG only because Ralph Koster is helming that)<br />
<br />
also check out:<br />
<br />
cityofheroes.com<br />
<br />
it's a super-hero RPG from a new developer (but with lots of individual experience in class/player balance and arcade/console games) and published by the largest online publisher in the world, NCsoft (which is about 3x as big as EQ, AO and DAOC combined)<br />
<br />
what's interesting about both games is that for the first time... and unlike EQ, these are completely from the ground up 2nd generation MMPOG... one in the tradition of RTS/warcraft games and the other directly being ported from a pen-and-paper sensbilities<br />
<br />
a lot of what makes EQ unique, as well as frustrating and broken is indebted to trying to adjust a engine designed for 50 MUD players for 2k+<br />

<br />
It looks awesome! I hope my computer can handle it. This is the only game I've seen so far besides *maybe* shadowbane that would make me even consider leaving EQ. Judging by the graphics though I'll need to upgrade my computer a LOT to not lag out while playing. That is if it's anything like EQ.<br />
<br />
*****EDIT*****<br />
<br />
How is death handled in the game?<br />
A character will remain where he or she died for a reasonable amount of time (to allow for possible resurrection) or until the player chooses to &quot;release&quot; the character. After the player releases the character or the designated amount of time has passed, the character will reappear at a bind point with all of his or her equipment safely intact. Although there might be some penalty attached, our goal is to make sure that a character's death is not overly frustrating for the player.  <br />
<br />
WOOT <br />
<br />
How does combat work? What makes it different from combat in other MMORPGs?<br />
In general, combat in World of Warcraft is faster paced than it is in other MMORPGs, without being a &quot;clickfest.&quot; When a character attacks a creature, he or she enters into combat mode. In combat mode, the character automatically and repeatedly attacks the target creature, but the player is responsible for timing the use of spells and special abilities to be maximally effective. Warriors and other melee classes will have a host of combat abilities that they can employ while fighting, whereas magic users will be able to cast a plethora of spells.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it's going to be somewhat like EQ is then? <br />
<br />
What races can you play in World of Warcraft?<br />
The game currently features Humans, Orcs, Tauren, and Dwarves. We have plans to include additional races. Please visit the Blizzard web site at www.blizzard.com for future announcements regarding additional races.<br />
<br />
I hope they plan to add more races. Only 4 seems kinda boring. :( <br />
<br />
How will you prevent camping and kill stealing?<br />
We limit camping and kill-stealing issues by &quot;instancing&quot; certain areas of the game. An instance is a section of dungeon or outdoor area that is private. No other players, unless they are part of your group, can enter your instance of the dungeon/outdoor area. There are also plenty of non-instanced common areas where players can meet and adventure together. <br />
<br />
How do you prevent camping and kill stealing in non-instanced areas?<br />
Competition over rare item drops and quest items is the primary cause of camping and kill stealing. In World of Warcraft, many rare item drops are not exclusive to any one creature. Several creatures will have a chance of dropping the same item. If the required item is a quest item, the player can join a group of other players on the same quest and seek the item together with them. Every player on the quest will receive a copy of the quest item from the monster or location where it was found. <br />

Very nice! :) <br />

Will there be ranged weapons? Can Dwarves use Guns?<br />
Yes. Different classes can use a variety of ranged weapons, such as bows, crossbows, and yes, even Dwarven muskets. <br />
<br />
DWARVEN MUSKETS!!!!!! :D <br />
<br />
This game looks like it's going to kick so much ass!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Renendor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">All I have to say is Blizzard is a company you can depend on... theyve made just incredible games.  You know a company has done well on a game before its shipped, when one of their games was declared 'Game of the Year' for TWO years straight by PCGamer(Im not talking about addons or expansions here), and games voted '#1 game of all time'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Pretty much every game released by blizzard had a great story and was well as bug free as a game can be out of the box.<br />
Never had to do emergency patches so that payign customers can play the game they paid for .<br />
<br />
Blizzard rocks and while they take their time releasing their games when they do release it most ppl asdmit they were worth the wait.<br />
<br />
They play their games and know what is wrogn with them and they hire ppl to play their games and tell them about balance issues. That is why no other gamign company will ever do as good as them or have a reputation as good as theirs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I wouldn't put much stock in what gaming magazines rate as &quot;game of the year.&quot;  ESPECIALLY regarding Blizzard, which advertises more and with bigger spreads than any other game company.  <br />
<br />
You'll find very little criticism of blizzard problems.  It took quite a few reviews before a single magazine came out and said D2 had problems, and even there, the extent of the criticism wasn't much.<br />
<br />
Lag and network problems especially seem to be little commented on by major gaming magazines unless the publisher is a small one or the game has already seen significant criticism in the press.  When lack of ability to save in game was far more common than it is lately, that was another favorite but very significant factor to accidentally forget to mention.<br />
<br />
The magazines are not in the business of alienating their own sponsors.  That's where they get their money, and where they have to go to keep their overhead paid -- not what you pay at the newstand whenever you're in the mood.</div></div><hr />

I just hope, in the small unlikely chance, the interface would be customizable somewhat like EQ is. That would be very cool. ;)<br />
<br />
Also, I hope my cpu can handle it without much lag. If it's like eq is now then I can handle it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Odull3: It is supposed to look cartoony.<br />
<br />
Why cause when things look TOO realistic it is no longer a game. In my opinion they tried to make eq2 TOO realistic. By making WOW look like something out of a dreambook it lets your imagination go to work. Brings the magic to your screen.<br />
Have u played RUNE? The graphics were similar and oh the game was soooooo good. :D<br />

 How is death handled in the game? <br />
A character will remain where he or she died for a reasonable amount of time (to allow for possible resurrection) or until the player chooses to &quot;release&quot; the character. After the player releases the character or the designated amount of time has passed, the character will reappear at a bind point with all of his or her equipment safely intact. Although there might be some penalty attached, our goal is to make sure that a character's death is not overly frustrating for the player.  <br />
<br />
Borrowed from DAoC. No penalty? Hmmm...<br />
<br />
: <br />
How does combat work? What makes it different from combat in other MMORPGs? <br />
In general, combat in World of Warcraft is faster paced than it is in other MMORPGs, without being a &quot;clickfest.&quot; When a character attacks a creature, he or she enters into combat mode. In combat mode, the character automatically and repeatedly attacks the target creature, but the player is responsible for timing the use of spells and special abilities to be maximally effective. Warriors and other melee classes will have a host of combat abilities that they can employ while fighting, whereas magic users will be able to cast a plethora of spells. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DAoC was supposed to be faster paced, but good luck as a caster throwing a spell once a MOB got on you.<br />
<br />
 <br />
What races can you play in World of Warcraft? <br />
The game currently features Humans, Orcs, Tauren, and Dwarves. We have plans to include additional races. Please visit the Blizzard web site at www.blizzard.com for future announcements regarding additional races. <br />
<br />
4 races. Not a lot of variety there. The Realm had only 4. Although I'm sure Blizzard will add more than Codemasters ever did.<br />
<br />
 <br />
How will you prevent camping and kill stealing? <br />
We limit camping and kill-stealing issues by &quot;instancing&quot; certain areas of the game. An instance is a section of dungeon or outdoor area that is private. No other players, unless they are part of your group, can enter your instance of the dungeon/outdoor area. There are also plenty of non-instanced common areas where players can meet and adventure together. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Realm was like this - when you entered a dungeon it was YOUR dungeon. Not sure how they plan to implement it outdoors. (If at all)<br />
<br />
How do you prevent camping and kill stealing in non-instanced areas? <br />
Competition over rare item drops and quest items is the primary cause of camping and kill stealing. In World of Warcraft, many rare item drops are not exclusive to any one creature. Several creatures will have a chance of dropping the same item. If the required item is a quest item, the player can join a group of other players on the same quest and seek the item together with them. Every player on the quest will receive a copy of the quest item from the monster or location where it was found. <br />
 <br />
<br />

Does anyone else see mudflation out the wazzoo on this one?  <br />
<br />
: <br />
Will there be ranged weapons? Can Dwarves use Guns? <br />
Yes. Different classes can use a variety of ranged weapons, such as bows, crossbows, and yes, even Dwarven muskets.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Nice start.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills?<br />
Quests?<br />
PvP?<br />
RvR?<br />
<br />
Might be worth a looksie because it IS Blizzard, but would have to be shet hot for me to give up 2 years invested in toons. (DAoC was NOT that shet hot)<br />
<br />
Really good looking game tho.</div></div><hr />
