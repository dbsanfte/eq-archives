<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dalaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The &quot;Congealed-Bile Based Ooze&quot; is supposed to drop from Virulent Arachnids in PoN,  however we killed these for 2 1/2 hours south of the graveyard in PoN and it didn't drop. Is this now a RARE drop?<br />

Quest Item:<br />

<br />
EDIT:<br />
Well I finally got the Congealed-Bile Based Ooze...and Im on to the next and last Item: a Tri-Coated Metal Casing. Does anyone know if this drops off anything besided the clockwork spider in POI?...<br />
<br />
BTW: Anyone interested in this quest, give me a yell its fairly easy and the eventual upgrade to the Talisman is worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got mine past the waterfall in a group killing a mix of spiders/trees/ravens and i think i got the only one that dropped in about 2 hrs of camping.  We probably killed about 20 spiders and only that one dropped.</div></div><hr />
