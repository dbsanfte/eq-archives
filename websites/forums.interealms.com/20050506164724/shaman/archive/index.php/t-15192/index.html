<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antmf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Post pop do you think shaman or less powerful or more powerful then we were prepop. For some reason I am guessing not as powerful because we can not tank/solo mobs in pop zones they hit to damn hard. :) Let me know what ya think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">we are of same power and i think thats the problem, we have been left behind while others get upgrades. I mean soloin dragons might have been a big deal at some point but good god, look what chanters and mages and necros can do. I have a mage friend that solos named in BoT ( lower) on a daily basis, i have a shaman friend that 2 boxes a chanter and does the same. Im sorry, but any one that says we are still to power for proper upgrades needs to have their head removed from their arse.<br />
<br />
On a side note though, im truly happy with my shaman, but things like steath nrfing our mana regen with buffs that last half as long as other classes ( virt/c3) and costing so much mana are something that do get under my skin. But i am not about to delete my shaman heh</div></div><hr />

All there is to say about this.<br />
The crusade against the &quot;overpowered&quot; shaman class worked and the &quot;underpowered&quot; Bards got a big boon with PoP.<br />
<br />
And I don't think LDoN will solve this, But Shamans in WoW will be cool so there is hope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh?<br />
<br />
I am far too lazy to look them up again, but it's more like 1/3 total utter crap (f.e. more buffs with shorter duration, just what we needed :rolleyes: ) , 1/3 ok spells and 1/3 really nice spells (like Q). <br />
<br />
So 'somehow OK, still need tuning' would be a more accurate description in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify that one a bit  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I'd love for our buffs to last longer, but it's not a huge problem. I think possibly, if anything, Virtue and KEI last too long - enabling people to get these buffs and not need a cleric/enchanter in their group. Okay, so no-one's going to group with a shaman just to get Focus, but it's a concern for enchanters in particular. I imagine that's why their post 60 mana regen buffs are better, but don't last as long. Cleric buffs cost a component, so I expect that's why the duration of Virtue is the same as Aego.<br />
<br />
Our post-60 buffs are still an improvement, and not that much shorter duration.<br />
<br />
Just to compare:<br />
<br />
Clerics: Aegolism lasts 2 hours 30 minutes. Virtue lasts 2 hours 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Enchanters: KEI lasts 2 hours 30 minutes. Tranquility (and VoQ) lasts 1 hour 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Shamans: Focus of Spirit lasts 1 hour 40 minutes. Focus of Soul lasts 1 hour 20 minutes. Endurance of the Boar actually lasts longer than Riotous Health.<br />
<br />
One thing I would agree on with buff duration - I would prefer Talisman of the Tribunal lasted the 2 hours 30 minutes that Talisman of Epuration does. The druid's upgrade Protection of Seasons lasts 2h30m, same as Circle of Seasons. However, I don't cast this often enough to really be that bothered by it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Post-60 spell lineup is pretty good IMO.  Sure, we could do without Strength/Talisman of the Diaku, but at least it stacks with Focus of Soul.<br />
<br />
Cann V is an awesome AA, but is it as awesome as enchanter DC?  Clerics get a 100% mana-free rez as an AA, we get Rabid Bear.  Hmm.  Our AA could use some tuning, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think we're ok, rather balanced for what we do and all.  Charming is sickly overpowered in sheer CONCEPT in PoP, but they couldn't leave it out just because of that . . . and that's all there is to that.  <br />
<br />
I would dearly like a bigger heal tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You know something so simple for me that would bring us a big boost in power would be to have a &quot;hasten canibalization&quot; AA. 6 points to cut the CanV AA casting time in half. This would make up for the stealth nerf and would bring our level back up to where we can keep buffs up,slow,debuff and nuke/DoT.<br />
<br />
Granted i dont have a issue with mana regen now, cause i can manage it. But more mana to stack on more nukes and DoTs and i would be very happy. Or theyc an just fix the bloody durations on some of our b00fs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You know something so simple for me that would bring us a big boost in power would be to have a &quot;hasten canibalization&quot; AA. 6 points to cut the CanV AA casting time in half. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as I posted in another thread, our AA's mostly suck and are incredibly uncreative. I would have loved for Cannibalization to have 3 levels 2000, 2500, 3000 or something to that effect. But, I will say our 61-65 spells aren't nearly as bad as our 51-60 were...remember those lvl 58 and 59 uber charisma buffs anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Divine Intervention means I get asked for Charisma all the time... one tank in my guild was actually upset when I told him there wasn't a 60+ CHA Buff.<br />
<br />
I know I'm still the only person who wants it, But I'd still be pleased with improved melee skills.   I actually find groups appreciative of the fact that I /pet attack and Melee constantly while we're XPing.   Sitting beside the cleric gets boring damn fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hey, don't knock our uber charisma buffs! I keep charisma up all the time, it helps slows land.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I wouldn't say our AAs suck, they mostly improve our character in appropriate and logical ways, much the same as most classes AA. Few classes have anything as game changing as Archery Mastery for a ranger.<br />
<br />
Our 61-65 spells are decent, and mostly follow on the progression logically (since the changes, at least), and Diaku is a nice addition if the melee aren't maxed in dex or str. Having dots without the DD damage is (I'm told) a nice change too.<br />
<br />
Above posters are comparing our buffs to aego/virtue and KEI. This is not a PoP thing (this thread is about post-PoP release) - it's been the case ever since the addition of Focus of Spirit in Velious. And it is not a &quot;stealth nerf&quot;, we were not nerfed. Focus lasts longer than Kraggs - we were improved. Enchanters and clerics were simply improved more than we were. There is a difference. Druids also have similar spell durations to us.<br />
<br />
If I get 1 candy and my friend gets 2, I still have more than I had before. Yet I'm sure some people would say, &quot;OMG, he got 2, how come I only get 1? I've been nerfed.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Would I like an over-powered ability like CoD/TD charm?  Hell yeah.  Do I feel like I've been &quot;nerfed&quot; because I do NOT have one?  No.<br />
<br />
Buff duration is fine.  Think about it:<br />
<br />
- most of us have SCR3/M and EE items.  Our buffs last for an hour, 2 hours... sometimes more.  How long do they NEED to last?<br />
<br />
- Our slow is still the best in the game.  Period.<br />
<br />
- We have Quiescence.  This is probably one of the most godly spells in the game.<br />
<br />
- We have the best unresistable debuffs in the game.<br />
<br />
- I can tank Tier3 MOBs.  I can Pull.  I can Crowd Control.  I can do 100+ DPS without breaking a sweat (much more if you melee, dog, and dot in combination).<br />
<br />
- I get groups faster than damn near any other class - exception being clerics and chanters I would say.<br />
<br />
What more do we need?  How about less sucky Ornate armor?  Now THERE is an argument that I would love to see posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Few classes have anything as game changing as Archery Mastery for a ranger. <br />
Hmmm, lets see. Bards got fading memories, and Dble attack AA. Thats pretty potent stuff just for starters. Shaman got....emmm..spirit call<br />
<br />
Our buffs are sub-par. They are all logical upgrades but have shorter durations. That in itself is a nerf. Q is nice, but is barely an upgrade, it should heal more. Our dots are scaled appropriately enough.<br />
<br />
Masters of slow? Hardly, we have been further dilluted by mitigation and Bst slow.<br />
<br />
Malos is nice, but hardly the best, again just a moderate upgrade.<br />
<br />
Overall our entire PoP upgrades have been ho-hum, unimaginative, and essentially lessened our overall power compared to other classes and their upgrades.<br />
Our AA's are mediocre as is our spell upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say what he means is that the dps of PoP mobs is up by 300% to 400% whilst our ability to mitigate dps (well mine at least) has gone up by far less.  I don't think quiessence does a lot more damage repair than torpor did.</div></div><hr />

I would also like to get rabid aa if Verant pumped it up a bit again, so shaman stacking on raids would be addressed.  Also, I would like to see a DOT aa like the burning affliction focus.  Oh, and perhaps change the focus on our ornate gloves to burning affliction.<br />

<br />
I don't believe that a mage can solo a bot mini, if an enchanter still can, (doubt it, the mob will start summoning the enchanter once the pet is dead (it WILL die).. and possibly before it dies..<br />
<br />
the reason shaman spells cost so much is because if they didn't what would you do? think about it.. chain tnargs and stay about 90m at all time? something ridicilous like that.. you are just spoiled, our mana regen is INSANE! no other class can even compare to us.. compare to a druid, they cast a spell for half the mana and lasts twice as long.. (lets say).. that means our mana regen must be 4x better than theirs.. now some of the best geared druids get what? 15+mc3+5 (that back item) + 3 (some other item with buff icon).. = 26 mana regen/tic from ft.. we can do the same add to that 51? from canni v, some more from canni iv.. <br />
<br />
the best part of being a shaman is when you have 5m left, you drop a heal on yourself and canni it all back up to fm before the cleric goes from 10m to 20m..</div></div><hr />

dunno what level you are BUT Quiescence is a godsend, malos is decent, f07!? compare it to khuras! group haste!? it's amazing! (it's not 60 but no more complaining about haste being hard to cast etc).. <br />
<br />
Blood of Saryn? talk about tier 4 soloing along with BoU.. our pet? amazing.. what are you comparing to people?</div></div><hr />

People don't state all the facts, why do you want to just sound smart? yeah rabid bear sucks lasts 12 min? and refresh is 1 hour.. blah who cares the cleric gets a 100% rez with refresh of 72 HOURS!! they spend aa on an ability which MIGHT work (di).. <br />

We get 5 spells at 61, 3 are good IMO. Spear of Torment and single AGI I never use.<br />
<br />
7 spells at 62, I use all except the root and the AC buff.<br />
<br />
7 more spells at 63, all pretty good except single diaku I think.<br />
<br />
6 spells at 64, good spells.<br />
<br />
5 spells at 65, very good.<br />
<br />
All in all 30 new spells, and only 5 are more or less crap. About 10 are ok and 15 really nice spells. I think we got a good deal in PoP.<br />

<br />
Where did I say I couldn't tank in PoP?  Where did I say I didn't have decent gear?  Where did I say I didn't have ID5/LR5?  The argument here is that our ability to mitigate/regen dps has not kept pace with mob DPS.  I don't tank as well in PoP as I could before (on exp mobs before PoP I could tank with barely a scratch).<br />
<br />
DPS is up 400% would mean that slow has an even greater effect.<br />
<br />
If an unslowed mob in PoP does 400% more DPS than an unslowed mob pre-PoP then: a slowed mob in PoP does 400% more DPS than a slowed mob pre-PoP.  And now we have mitigation too.  So I don't see what you are arguing here: perhaps you'd clarify what you meant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">From an elemental guild point of view (aka my 2 cents):<br />
<br />
Plane of Fire: You invis, walk up to Field of Loots (c)(tm), puller pull a crapload of named mobs, Kill em. Loot, bon soir! Fennin event is a simple solo pulls or with 1 add and kill. Add slow mitigation to the mix and if you have more than 2 shamans on fire raids , they are going to be doing subpar DPS or get bored. <br />
<br />
Plane of Earth: One might think with a crapload of earth ring events shamans should be needed badly here. Well ... no, all mobs are mezzable, without Malos. Oh and they mitigate slows well too. In a few events where tank mezzing is needed having 2+ shamans MIGHT be better, again, far from needed. Rathe event is probably in same boat.<br />
<br />
Plane of Water: Mostly single pulls, boss mobs, standard Plane of Fire Lite (c)(tm). More than one shaman on a raid is bored out of his mind. Coirnav event is AE, so again, shamans are no use.<br />
<br />
Plane of Air: same problem as Earth, some events have a crapload of mobs, problem is, most are mezzable easy. Xegony event is the one that can benefit for having more than 2 shamans.<br />
<br />
While slow got heavy mitigation and mez didn't, it's way more efficient just to mez mobs than to tank mez them like back in VT. Again, this is detrimental to shamans. Not to mention everyone and his mother has a bot shaman with MGB running around so buffing is a non issue too. Then we have beastlords and chanters who can slow very very very very well, especially with mitigation, again, negative impact for shamans.<br />
<br />
Then comes our DPS ... wait we don't have much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">7 spells at 62, I use all except the root and the AC buff.<br />
(Shrug) I use the AC buff when I don't get Virtue, more AC doesn't hurt.  And the 62 root is actually really good -- the only issue is that there are few instances when you'd prefer to load it over the 64 root, which is also an ethereal reward, so its lifespan is effectively 2 levels.  It's quite a good spell though.</div></div><hr />

I don't tank as well in PoP as I could before (on exp mobs before PoP I could tank with barely a scratch).<br />
<br />
I don't mean to just pick at one sentence, you said the argument is you don't tank as well as you could before, when mobs barely scratched you. So what you want is for pop mobs to barely scratch you? <br />

<br />
Plane of Fire: You invis, walk up to Field of Loots (c)(tm), puller pull a crapload of named mobs, Kill em. Loot, bon soir! Fennin event is a simple solo pulls or with 1 add and kill. Add slow mitigation to the mix and if you have more than 2 shamans on fire raids , they are going to be doing subpar DPS or get bored. <br />
<br />
Plane of Earth: One might think with a crapload of earth ring events shamans should be needed badly here. Well ... no, all mobs are mezzable, without Malos. Oh and they mitigate slows well too. In a few events where tank mezzing is needed having 2+ shamans MIGHT be better, again, far from needed. Rathe event is probably in same boat.<br />
<br />
Plane of Water: Mostly single pulls, boss mobs, standard Plane of Fire Lite (c)(tm). More than one shaman on a raid is bored out of his mind. Coirnav event is AE, so again, shamans are no use.<br />
<br />
Plane of Air: same problem as Earth, some events have a crapload of mobs, problem is, most are mezzable easy. Xegony event is the one that can benefit for having more than 2 shamans.<br />
<br />
While slow got heavy mitigation and mez didn't, it's way more efficient just to mez mobs than to tank mez them like back in VT. Again, this is detrimental to shamans. Not to mention everyone and his mother has a bot shaman with MGB running around so buffing is a non issue too. Then we have beastlords and chanters who can slow very very very very well, especially with mitigation, again, negative impact for shamans.<br />
<br />
Then comes our DPS ... wait we don't have much.<br />
<br />
You make it sound too easy, and you don't account for the times when 2 or 3 mobs come and wipe your guild.. PLEASE! I see the guild who is poTime flagged get wiped on earth raids etc on pulls not bosses.. it's not as easy as you make it sound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The problem is that our spells are designed either by mana or duration, to effectively cancel this out. If we didn't have cannibalize, you'd be OOM all the time from your extensive lineup of grossly inefficient spells.<br />
<br />
How many of us boast about how we buff, slow, are main healer, and chain nuke and end are 80m after each pull? I have ft1 worth of gear and I can do that. life would definetly suck w/o canni.. would anyone give up canni in any form to get double duration and appropriate spell cost on most of our spells?<br />
<br />
Lost of people don't consider scm to be important because the reply is often I'm overloaded with mana I don't need more..</div></div><hr />

<br />
we get ovq, bard song, clickies.. all we usually miss is the self 8mana/tic.. what you should look at IMO is after a wipe, who is fm first? that's the person who has the best mana regen, and it's always the shaman.. (canni v + mod rod woohoo).. <br />
<br />
Also I was not in the game 2 expansions ago (I'm assuming pre pop).. if the case is that our mana regen was more than compared to now, it just means that shaman were truly too powerful. I only have 280 wis and that thing fills up fast!</div></div><hr />

- Yes, every guild, including ours wipes because of lack of shamans! Yes, that's it! /sarcasm off.<br />
<br />
Guilds wipe because:<br />
- MT doesn't position mob properly and the &quot;slight&quot; 3k AE every 20 seconds hits the clerics. Oh yah, it has a 400 mana / tick tap too.<br />
- Bad pulls.<br />
- Bad pulls. <br />
- Adds not controlled (read: mezzed).<br />
- Idiots breaking mez.<br />
- Bad pulls.<br />
- Random factor in encounters: Fear, procs on MT, Flurry, bad random number generator, when mob minimum hits for 1000 and quads, a little bit of lag means MT is dead.<br />
- People AFK.<br />
- Bad pulls.<br />
- People not paying attention.<br />
<br />
But yeah, the most important reason why guilds wipe is because there aren't enough shamans.</div></div><hr />

That's my biggest complaint.  All the group buffs seem to have random durations assigned to them as the designer thought fit.  They all should be more uniform (preferably the 2.5 hours of HoV).  Even with SCRM + 8th shawl (170% duration), Fo7 still lasts 15 minutes shorter than a cleric casting HoV with no extension.  Then Bot9 and our old focus just randomly have an extra 20 minutes on them, /boggle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny, during these minis, at any one time I do upwords of maybe 20 - 30k of dmg on a mob.  That's really without doting, unless I disease them.  During these events I tend to keep FA on as many rogue/rangers as I can.  I also perform the function of a healer alot... healing who needs it when I can.  <br />
<br />
 Plane of Earth: One might think with a crapload of earth ring events shamans should be needed badly here. Well ... no, all mobs are mezzable, without Malos. Oh and they mitigate slows well too. In a few events where tank mezzing is needed having 2+ shamans MIGHT be better, again, far from needed. Rathe event is probably in same boat. <br />
<br />
I don't know if your guild tends to not bring in 10 mobs at once, but especially in situations like the Peregan ring, we tend to just pull everything off of the top.  So, this makes upwards of 15 mobs coming at us at once.  Sure, we know that we can handle it.. and no one usually dies.. however 1 shaman is not going to be able to cover this.  You can cast AE slow if you want, but I tend to just turgur them all.  This takes time but it's a lot easier with more shamans there.  Every mob has their dosage of malos, slow, cripple... then I will make sure that everyone is healed and the melees are FAd.  When I get a chance, I start to DD them.  While you may not think that our dmg is great, any little bit of extra dmg in the end will save however much time at the end of the day to do something else.  And during the Rathe event... I don't know about you.. but we tend to find that we are short if we don't have at least 6 shaman/beastlords there.  We are needed for curse removal, slowing, sinia, cripple.. hell damn near everything.  Each TM needs a shaman there to help keep the tank up and the cleric from getting summoned.  If we don't have a shaman at each one, than it's guaranteed that a beastlord will be performing the same duties as the shaman did.  Also like to keep a shaman in the mezzed area with the chanters just in case that one gets out of hand.  You will be the second one to die.. but it will give the rest of the chanters that extra second to get the loose mob mezzed [/quote] <br />

 Plane of Water: Mostly single pulls, boss mobs, standard Plane of Fire Lite (c)(tm). More than one shaman on a raid is bored out of his mind. Coirnav event is AE, so again, shamans are no use.  <br />
<br />
Even if you only pull one mob at a time, there are alot of mobs around, and by the time that I'm finished malosing one mob... another one is incoming.  This requires more than one shaman... especially if you catch one incoming while the rest of the raid is busy attackign something else.  It is hard as hell to cast in there with something beating on you.  I don't know what you do against Coirnav event, but I tend to pull.  This to me is one of the funnest things that I get to do on a raid and I look forward to it every time.  [/quote]<br />

<br />
Mezzable easy yes, however these mobs hit too hard for them not to be slowed within the first 10 secs that they get to camp and before someoen is able to mezz them.  Tell me how hard the spiders hit for when they are beating on you.  Prob one of the only mobs that i know in the elementals that I just can't say i've survived an attack from.  Once agroed to you.. they don't let go.  [/quote]<br />

<br />
Then comes our DPS ... wait we don't have much.<br />
<br />
There is not a single moment on any raid that I'm at full mana.... and I have a 5500 mana pool.. unless of course we are sitting waiting for a few late arrivals to show up.  I say that if you are a shaman on a raid and you are bored... then you aren't doing what you could to ensure the success of the raid.  Any extra damage that you provide.. or any little extra buff that you stick on someone helps out that person in the long run.  Whether it be cha (clerics like this), FA (awesome for Rangers/Rogues), Agi (some tanks still ask me to cast it), Bi'hil (melees like it), Focus (everyone needs it) sta (most people are maxed out but there are a few like me who are really close, but not quite there) I don't wait for someone to ask me for FA... I look out for the nearest person that looks like they need it and cast it.  Our versatility is what makes us a very fun class to play.  I know that I would never go play another class now that I've fully experienced my shaman.  <br />
<br />
BTW.. I have the second talisman and I soloed every piece short of Tactics to get it.  Only reason that I didn't solo the Tactics piece is cause it dropped once when I was there with some friends killing a named.  Oh, and I don't root/rot short of Fire either.  It is possible to tank some PoP mobs in teh face, it isn't something that is always ideal.... although it is fun to sit there in BoT and have a tank with less hps than you insist on letting them tank two mobs at the same time just cause they are the tank and you are the helpless shaman /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">- We have Quiescence.  This is probably one of the most godly spells in the game.<br />
<br />
Following this line of thought, Celestial Elixir would actually be the most godly spell.  Q is decent enough however.<br />
<br />
- I can tank Tier3 MOBs.  I can Pull.  I can Crowd Control.  I can do 100+ DPS without breaking a sweat (much more if you melee, dog, and dot in combination).<br />
<br />
nod.  Though if I'm dotting, I'm usually not trying to melee at that point.<br />
<br />
What more do we need?  How about less sucky Ornate armor?  Now THERE is an argument that I would love to see posted.<br />
<br />
How about better ornate bracer stats?  :p   Granted ft2 is nice to some people, but the hp/mana is pretty sucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Post-60 spell lineup is pretty good IMO.  Sure, we could do without Strength/Talisman of the Diaku, but at least it stacks with Focus of Soul.<br />
<br />
Cann V is an awesome AA, but is it as awesome as enchanter DC?  Clerics get a 100% mana-free rez as an AA, we get Rabid Bear.  Hmm.  Our AA could use some tuning, IMO.<br />
<br />
Look at Necro AA than you know what AA needs Tuning ;)<br />
Not the PoP AA, the regular AA already is plain crap. The Class AAs are just bull****.<br />
Since Necros and Shammy are DoT casters they should get an AA that makes DoTs last longer or do more damage.<br />

I don't want that, I guess it's 2 opinions on what kinds of mobs I want to fight..<br />
<br />
Oh please read the thread topic - are we relatively more powerful or less powerful post PoP.  I'm saying we are less powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Owwiefixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The way I see it...<br />
<br />
Shaman took one step forward with POP... lots of other classes took five or six steps forward and a lot of people are a wee bit jealous of those other classes stepping up to the plate and enjoying what we have been enjoying up until now.<br />
<br />
I can still solo with complete zone choice in POP zones, all the way up to the elemental planes.  Exp is good and yes, fighting toe to toe in PoP is quite doable and enjoyable.  The other classes still cant do this and their whole universe hinges around what's fearable, charmable, doesn't summon or what not... we just walk up and kill it, end of discussion.   Yah, you need the AA's and gear for this, but so do they.  It's no different from your summon/torpor hit list of days of old, just everything scaled up.<br />
<br />
As far as slow mitigation goes- read what the developers said about this.  They wanted a target mob DPS unslowed and slowed.  They found themselves in a dillema since with full slow/no slow would lead to mobs adjusted to hit considerably harder than the do now unslowed in order to hit that target slowed dps.  This means a resist is game over for the shaman.   I'd much rather have mitigated slow and more sane regular DPS rather than overall dps being higher but fully slowable.. or worse yet more mobs that are just simply immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Well, I'm one who is pretty happy about shaman status at 65.  I would say that casting shrink with confirm box on raid would be nice. I would also like to see a group heal over time (like a group Q) that you could mgb which would lessen the stacking issues of shaman on raids. I would also like to get rabid aa if Verant pumped it up a bit again, so shaman stacking on raids would be addressed.  Also, I would like to see a DOT aa like the burning affliction focus.  Oh, and perhaps change the focus on our ornate gloves to burning affliction.<br />
<br />
Those changes would be nice and I don't think overpowering.<br />

I agree with you lots bro, my point is if you get bad pulls, which according to you is the biggest factor in wipes, (like 3 mobs inc).. and if you have 6 shaman instead of 2, you won't wipe. When the mob is not mezzable, or resists mez (and eats the chanter etc) if you had the 6 shaman instead of 2, no wipe.. that is how I see it anyway..</div></div><hr />
