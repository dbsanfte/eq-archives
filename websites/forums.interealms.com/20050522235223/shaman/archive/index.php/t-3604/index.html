<br />
Just wanted to know how reliable SCR/SCRM(50%) effects torpor.  In some basic number crunching i did, torpor will now be a 24sec x 1.5 = 36sec &quot;buff&quot;.  Thats an extra 12 secs or 2 ticks, so that means (theoritically) 600hps extra, right?  (1200hps/4tick = 300hps/tick)<br />
<br />
So then say with a 8th shawl(15%) and SCR/SCRM(50%), that'll push torpor up to a 24sec x 1.65 = 39.6sec or an extra 15.6 sec of the &quot;effect&quot;, which in turn = 2.6 ticks.  Meaning it'll maybe kick in for a 3rd additional tick?<br />
<br />
I wont go into extended enhancement 3 items and their effect. /snicker<br />
<br />
Anywho, can someone verify that torpor lasts that extra 2 ticks everytime, key work &quot;everytime&quot;.  And maybe if the 8th shawl can sometimes get u an extra tick of healing, basically if they stack.<br />
<br />
Havent seen any treads on this specifically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe duration is capped at 50% so the shawl won't add any more. I haven't looked closely at Torpor duration tons but I believe it heals at least 1800 every time for me now. Sometimes I get that extra tick still then it will do 2100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have SCR maxed (12 points lvl3 yadda yadda) and 8th shawl <br />
<br />
i get about what lithebane gets <br />
1800 &amp; .. once in a blue moon 2100<br />
<br />
if theres a cap at 50% buff duration well im already at 45% .. 8 points for 5% could suck<br />
<br />
im hopeing it should all stack .. and if, god forbid, there is a next shawl would have addidtion + buff duration aswell <br />
<br />
the wild donkey spoke to me one night in a dream &quot;10shawl FT5 50%+ buff duration all/all uber/uber&quot;   and then i woke up and stuff</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
I've found the opposite, rarely do I miss the extra tick that all over time spells get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pretty sure 8th shawl does not work on torpor cause it only works on spells with a duration over X amount of time.  And from what i have heard SCRM does stack wiht 8th shawl *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">8th Shawl never glows with Torpor sadly. Also, almost 100% sure 50% faster cast time on buffs is the cap. That being so, the class AA skill to increase buff time from 30% to 50% only really effects torpor, since Focus items/8th shawl gives ya the 15% increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Works every time?  Ugh, I'm drooling all oveer myself now heh.  Though, gonna really suck when Verant decides this is overpowering...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">shawl doesnt &quot;glow&quot; when i cast group buffs either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Manaburn is overpowering.  2100 heal over time with a snare and slow is not.  I would think that this is safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That all depends how they feel about torpor healing more HPs then can 5 takes off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slimetooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">woh,<br />
<br />
I'm not 60 yet but.... am I to understand that because Torpor heals more health than Can5 a 60 shaman with Torpor and Can5 skill can essentially go from zero mana to full mana in only a few casts and no medding!?<br />
<br />
Just to clarify how long does it take to go from zero mana to FM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have ~3400 mana, unbuffed but fully clothed.  I have 2200 hit points, unbuffed but fully clothed.<br />
<br />
Each Canni 5 adds 1066 (or so, let's not quibble) mana at a cost of 1924 hit points.<br />
<br />
Worst case, assuming I can sit on my horse or sit on my ass, I can go from 0 mana and low health (like, after a res) to full mana and full health in 3 Canni 5 hits, if I cast nothing but Torpor and Canni 4 (to get the first Torpor hit).  That means I can get to full mana and full health in just about 7 minutes:<br />
Canni 4 to Torpor mana<br />
Torpor twice (need full HP to take Canni 5)<br />
Canni 5 (~1 minute after res)<br />
Regrowth<br />
Torpor<br />
sit/med<br />
Canni 5 (~4 minutes after res)<br />
Torpor<br />
sit/med<br />
Canni 5 (~7 minutes after res)<br />
Torpor<br />
<br />
<br />
In reality, I never work on getting full hp/mana.  I work on getting rebuffed as soon as possible.  Taking a Canni 5 hit with only 2200 total hit points is like begging for a smack-down from nearby mobs.  I can have my entire group melee capable by the time the cleric has 40 mana, including stamina, focus, primal essence, acumen, regrowth, and spirit of billy.  If we have a god-rodder available, by using a ton of torporing, I can enable my whole group to be combat ready scary-fast.<br />
