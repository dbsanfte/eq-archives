<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Entium and I were yapping in the KOErecruit channel today about this and that, and I mentioned how uncrowded everything was these days and that i might have to get off my duff and try to kill the dang Ancient CLops in OOT or NRO and get my Jboots.<br />
<br />
About 30 or 45 minutes later, Entium pipes in on the recruit channel with &quot;OMG, the AC is UP&quot;<br />
<br />
After that we hooked up and took out the Shadow Man for the rapier and hit the bank for 3250 gold pieces then headed back to Rathe Mtn where I had been hunting Hill Giants for some much needed cash.  Hasten had been up earlier and when we got there after several laps, we found that he was GONE.<br />
<br />
After we were on the way to getting back together to call it quits for the day, someone in OOC says that Hasten has re-appeared.  We hook back up, and beat feet all over the place looking for him.  A handy bard who had been acting as banker for the zone (swapping our gold for his plat) joined us to help track the little gnome down.<br />
<br />
Long story short, Entium totally hooked me up with my long awaited J-Boots today, and I wanted to say THANKS!!!  once again.<br />
