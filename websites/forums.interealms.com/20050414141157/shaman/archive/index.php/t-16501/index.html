<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to buy a new video card, but have limited funds available.  I had been looking at Geforce 3ti 500 with 64 MB of RAM.  This was a dream card about 18 months back.  I am now thinking of a Geforce4 MX440 with 128 MB RAM.  Both cards are in the $55-$70 dollar range, anyone give me any advice on one of these cards or another I haven't looked into?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.  Oh I should add that Other than EQ which I play very rarely anymore, most of the games I am interested in aren't very video intensive.  Mostly turn based strategy or Sports Sim stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always recommend Ti's over MX's. Despite how it may look up front, I'd wager the Ti will outperform the MX when faced with the rather high needs of software like EQ. <br />
<br />
You may want to look at the Ti 4400, it's got to be around that cost these days. Check out www.newegg.com and do a search, they have some decent prices on PC gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">go to www.pricewatch.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">go to www.pricewatch.com<br />
<br />
hehe Been there and done that actually.  That was where I got my price info.  ;)<br />
<br />
Edit -- for spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Lor though, always get a Ti over a MX especially if its a mx4 which really is a mx2 with some tweaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The MXs are basically the around the same memory bandwith and raw speed as your geforce 3 with a dumbed down geforce 4 chip on it.  It is an alright card but it wouldnt be much of an upgrade to your current card.  There is no on card anti-aliasing or anisotropic filtering i think as well.  I have a ti 4600 and it is a monster that still plays the modern games at high settings.  <br />
<br />
I am a nVidia fan from long back but one of my first cards was an ATI and from the benchmarks I have seen thier new cards are very well done and outperform the nVidia cards.<br />
<br />
And I recommend Newegg it is the best online tech store.  You can also check out www.tomshardware.com for the latest benchmarks.  I would recommend saving up to buy one of the new nVidia or ATI cards though for a real upgrade (if you are a serious gamer).  The benchmarks show ATI card runs faster than the nVidia but nVidia is better supported.  These new cards will run the next gen games (Halflife 2, Doom III) smoothly and beautifully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tom's hardware breaks video cards down very nicely.  They break the cards down into categories, so you can see what category you fit in and then look at the video cards in that category.  (for example...latest nvidia and ati cards fall into the &quot;enthusiast&quot; category if I recall correctly).  No game actually makes use of all the memory in those cards yet and they are pretty expensive so unless you just have to have the best, avoid them and go into the cheaper cards and in 1 year or so, those enthusiast cards will drop down to where you can afford em.   In some cases, you can buy a 128MB video card that will outperform your 256MB video card because the 256MB video card is using slower memory.<br />
<br />
More to the point of your question though....<br />
<br />
Everything I've heard about MX cards tells me never to buy them ;-)</div></div><hr />
