<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have seen some oow attunable gear with amazing stats of VT almost EP quality drops for sale in bazaar yesterday. <br />
<br />
I personally don't like the idea too much every noob_#45 can buy a bunch of plat on mysupersales &amp; gear his toon to almost EP quality without moving an inch now.<br />
<br />
What do you pleople think about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't care, that's why the stuff was made to be tradeable. What's wrong with people buying good gear? Most wont otherwise even have a shot at it, because some people literally sit on the spawn spot of the mobs which drop these items, farming them all day long.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that newbie wont get any effect out of it anyway, since most of the items what I've seen lately have been marked as &quot;Lvl 66 recommended&quot; or higher. What's the point of buying such item at lvl 1, when its stats would be worse then some basic tailored items have at that level. Or you consider people to be 'newbies' just because they have no access to VT or EP's on their own?<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned, it's a good thing, hopefully there will be more such loot and even higher end items like this available on Bazaar. From where someone gets their PP, doesn't bother me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I personally like it.  Most of the Attuneable items aren't that huge of items.  Yes, they are VT quality... so what?  Thats a 3 year old expansion.  As for EP quality, EP is going to be a joke to get into within a month as people start reaching 70.  Now they have more than just EP's as options for gear, they can go to OoW as well.<br />
<br />
I personally hate no drop gear.  Nothing sucks more than to have an item drop that someone really wanted and they aren't on (like my TA !), but since its no drop you can't loot it for them to give to them later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love the attunable feature. I could give a rats buttocks what other people have or can get (unless its made mega-simple to get super good gear, a'la Diablo 2), but attunable offers a ton of possibilities. Good income, good way to gear up those alt-boxxed clerics every guild seems to &quot;require&quot; to advance past the EPs, good way to pass items to new recruits without having them make some risk-death run to a deep dungeon, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the idea and like the above posters said..its hardly over powering gear when mobs you are fighting hit like freight trains..Might actually make a pick up group fun when you cant get a guild group with people having gear that is some what designed for the content they are trying to exp in...anyone ever get a pick up group with a war in Kod Taz that didnt have agro weapons and HP's in this ****ter..makes for slow go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">love it.. but i wish there were some way to keep it only in the guild, instead of selling it to anyone.. but theres really no sure way of doing that, so its ok with me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anyone who is concerned with what pixelated pointers to a database others have in an on-line game has bigger issues to deal with than attunable gear being sold in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh, I think its sorta funny that people that worked their collective asses off for EP flags can now look at people run invis to WoS and other zones and loot Droppable items that are similar to what they have access too.<br />
Weird bit of irony there that lazy people (IE ME) can have access to stuff with just /lfg now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I find it positively insulting that people are able to hit the bazaar and buy armor thats much better than the Banded armor I personally smithed, or the Bloodforge Hammer that I spent so much time questing for.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/hugs Cush<br />
That stupid dwarf always attacked me, too.  Bloodforge was amazing.<br />
<br />
Every expansion makes the incredibly difficult timesinks of the previous expansion (or two) pointless.  It's the EQ way.  But Faern had the best point.  For me, if I ever were to play my main again, it'd just make it easy for her to blow the bank to catch up and jump into the new expansion.  So woo hoo!</div></div><hr />

I personally don't like the idea too much every noob_#45 can buy a bunch of plat on mysupersales &amp; gear his toon to almost EP quality without moving an inch now.<br />
<br />
What do you pleople think about it?<br />
<br />
The questions that you really need to thing about are:<br />
<br />
1) How does this really affect you?<br />
2) How do you know that everybody that buys from the bazaar is a &quot;noob&quot; in your eyes<br />
3) When you group with someone and they have an attunable piece of equipment, how do you know they didn't get it themselves?<br />
<br />
Personally I think droppable gear is great as it helps everyone enjoy the game instead of keeping things away from some. We're here to have fun after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oogga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Going to add my opinion, and play devils advocate for a sec.<br />
<br />
Personally, I LOVE this idea - it stimulates the economy of a server to have high end droppable gear, and once attuned, its not going anywhere, so doesn't unbalance things.  The attuneable items aren't that much different from ornate armor.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, SOE should now go back and get rid of no drop entirely, replace it with attuneable aside from quest drops and some quest item rewards (Shawls, Rings, Epics, etc).<br />
<br />
Time for a change.  If Time tier one-equivalent gear can be traded, why not ToV or VT gear?<br />
<br />
I've not got a Time-flagged character myself, but I do know people who are; they'll send me tells from Time raids and link me gear that's rotting because no-one will loot - gear of a quality otherwise I would NEVER see due to family time commitments, and other aspects of real life.  <br />
<br />
As to it remaining in the guild, that is a decision made by players, but at least they HAVE that decision, rather than letting a bunch of items rot that no-one else will loot because they have better.  <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp<br />

<br />
What do you pleople think about it?<br />
<br />
I suspect that this is self regulating.  How much fun is it to play if nothing is a challenge, and you have no goals?  To some extent Ihave this problem with my twinks, so I don't play 'em much.<br />
<br />
If they can't play their class, they will not get groups for long.  If they can, it just means they will be better in my group.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, buying plat does not pass my personal smell test, but I am reluctant to tell others how to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like the idea personally, kinda wish the'd put it in sooner.<br />
<br />
I agree. I actually got an attuneable earring this morning in a group that, save the lack of FT1, was more than double the stats of the Solstice earring. Earring of Oppression (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70224)<br />
<br />
The best part was, we could wait until the group breakup to decide who got it and take care of everything in one shot instead of pausing in between. The only improvement I can see is to make the LDoN dropped augments be attuneable so that your looter can grab it as you go through and you can divy it all up once you're done, saving time.<br />
<br />
The attuneable flag is something that should have been in from the get-go (though I can see reasons why it was not) and could easily use some retroactive fitting, but at any case, it's a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think its a great idea. I've always hated having to basically stop whatever the group is doing if a piece of no drop armor is up for grabs. And if a friend can't make it and a piece of armor that would be an upgrade won't go to waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's always nice seeing upgrades go to someone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So instead of going out and killing bob, sewer knight for his sword of slime... you have to go pay 100k for it.<br />
<br />
I'm all for stuff not rotting.... but good loot spots will be even more permacamped if it's good sellable stuff.</div></div><hr />

As a recent Time shaman, an older KT shaman, I personaly dont think its a bad thing to have decent gear be dropable.  First, the OoW attunable stuff that I have seen from WoS isnt much better than LDoN hard stuff AND its definatly not as good as EPs or KT at all, most are -40-50HPS below EP stuff, with little to no effects....woohoo (sarcasticaly) :p<br />
<br />
Its good decent gear for people who are more casual, dont have time or means to get EP, Time or KT flagged.  Means pick up groups might not suck so hard because the tank can't take a hit and the cleric has no mana.  I dont see any problem with gearing up the general population who has the time to camp or the PP to spend.  The day 140HP+ gear is droppable...then i'll bitch.</div></div><hr />

There is some 130 hp/mana attunable stuff dropping, but the mobs that drop it are VERY challanging, even for a BIG Time+ geared group. They seem 2=groupable though, but I suspect that guilds will farm this stuff for new recruits and alts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The gear is great. No doubt about it, and its effecttively the 'ornate' standard for OoW, ie tradeable, but once equipped its no drop. Thats all fine....<br />
<br />
But the repercussions of the amazing stats is that what LITTLE point there was in our buffs, for those classes that were no at max stats already, is quickly lost when a few people get 1 or 2 of these items.<br />
<br />
So what? Well, since we can't really heal, and there are so many slowers, now our need to buff stats is going too.<br />
<br />
To put it into context, at lvl 55 my monk would kill for shammie stats buffing. At 65 (mostly high bazaar gear), I only care about focus and sta. If I buy one or 2 of these items, and grab an ldon aug or 2 (ldon is great source for permanent stats), then I'm only gonna care about the hp off focus. <br />
<br />
I said someplace I think that combat effects etc need to be put into 60+ spells, and 65+ spells should have better effects combined with 'lower' stat buffs.<br />
<br />
Is nooone except me upset about this? ldon aug, oow gear, GoD tribute. It all affects one of our roles, and we need to hang onto them...<br />
<br />
thoughts? *or am i mad*</div></div><hr />

<br />
thoughts? *or am i mad*<br />
There are dozens of threads debating this topic aleady, so lets keep this one on-track if we can please. I will say one, quick thing. Shaman have been bumped up a notch in OoW. Fights are longer. Our combination HoT + blast heal is enough to main-heal MOST XP groups in the middle, XP volume areas like WoS. The new buffs are desirable. I am quite happy with OoW. <br />
<br />
Gear was alraedy mudflated. Almost anyone lvl 65 could get darn close to max stats with 20-40K pp. LDoN drops alone, both normal and hard, mixed with a couple pieces of ornate, are enough. I dont see this attunable quality as a factor in Shaman balance whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No offense Blazz, but i posted to the subject heading...didn't read through all the threads this time.<br />

Fights may be longer in OoW, but I didn't buy it cos I am still waiting for some shammie and monk changes before I buy anything else from SoE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the looks of it?  Yes, for the augments.<br />
EQ Traders - Omens of War Tradeskilled Augments (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g261&amp;menustr=040010000000)<br />
<br />
Next, choose the mark you want to add to your stone and combine it in a medicine bag or mortar and pestle with your cut stone, acid, resin, and a dihedral burin purchased from vendors. Now your cut stone has a spiffy additional &quot;minor&quot; effect!<br />
<br />
For example, if you used a Mark of Virility when you etched the stone, it will have the effect Burning Affliction 3. Adding a white gold inlay will make this Burning Affliction 4 (and remove the &quot;minor&quot; from the name). If you instead add a black gold inlay, it will become Burning Affliction 5 (and replace &quot;minor&quot; with &quot;pure&quot; in the name).</div></div><hr />

First, I apologize to you Ash. I re-read my comments and they were abrasively written. It wasnt my intention, just sorta came out that way. I was trying to say that gear-mudflation as it relates to shaman balance was already a topic thats been debated to death. Thats all. But after looking it back over, you did indeed make your comments based on the threads topic, so please accept my apologies. <br />
<br />
Secondly, I am going to give you a small piece of advice. Buy OoW. You wont be disappointed. Gates is sickeningly sucky in comparison, I swear OoW makes Gates look like some High School Computer Science Fair project, and it didnt &quot;win&quot; either. OoW is very slick, very solid, and very well thought out. Shaman have MUCH more playability in this expansion, even more than PoP IMHO. <br />
<br />
I cannot really comment on the monk situation, but Shaman were DEFINITELY improved in OoW. Actually, it wasnt Shaman improvements, so much, it was CONTENT improvement. If you dont wish to buy Gates because Shaman suck there, I will understand completely, but to skip OoW until some &quot;change&quot; occurs doesnt make much sense, especially when one of the bigest &quot;nerfs&quot; that happened to Shaman dindt really happen TO shaman, it was changes to the content that ended up &quot;nerfing&quot; us. In OoW, there is a return to the type of content we can perform respecably in and contribute in a much more meaningful manner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you pleople think about it?<br />
<br />
I think it's great.  In fact, I hate the &quot;no-drop&quot; concept in general and I would like to see everything droppable (but my friends aren't on FV so moving there isn't an option  ;) .)<br />
<br />
As to someone elses comments about encouraging camping...camping will happen no matter what.  By having a larger number of things worth camping, the odds of everything being camped when you play is reduced.  So...I'm all for SoE adding more and more good droppable items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It will also keep the price up high in the bazaar and the item harder to buy, because there will not be any of the items coming back up for sale.  Once someone buys and equips the item, its gone from the market forever.  Even when the person upgrades, it will go in his bank.  <br />
<br />
So a year from now you won't see a flood of OoW items on the market, cause people got upgrades down the line.  I LOVE the idea personally.  Better then all no drop crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As for camping named spots, from what I have seen so far the majority of &quot;named&quot; spots are a lot more fluid ... meaning, it is not just mob X is the PH for named X. Or if they are, their roaming patterns are such you would have to have folks camping a number of locations to lock in the named roaming area.<br />
<br />
Sure, trackers have a benefit in this, but we can't fault SOE for attempting to make it harder to camp certain spots and dominate camps.<br />
<br />
As for attuneable, I am in the camp with: &quot;if you are sweating the pixel makeup of others in relation to your own&quot; attuneable gear isn't the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Want to comment / defend that one guy even tho I love th attunable idea so I can make more pp :)<br />
<br />
Lets say 2 months from now, while most guilds are barely beating some encounters, people in the high end are getting their epic 2.0s, making new ground in the keyed zone, getting 400hps bps.. then SOE gives EVERY level 60-&gt;70 person loot that trumps all this. 500hps bps.. ya would ruin the game, all that hard work and now that guy over there has the same exact stuff as me? It's not the penis size it's also part of the competition factor.<br />
<br />
I talked to someone, and their guild is now 30 mains strong that play regularly, beat aow recently, working their way into xtc / keying up for emp.. Lets say they beat emp and all the stuff that drops rots.. that would be take away the fun factor. Clear VT to get stuff no one wants? Too much mudflation does hurt is all. And that's what the guy was trying to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think the addition of attuneable items was a very good step.<br />
<br />
IMO, they should back-upgrade most &quot;nodrop&quot; gear and make it &quot;attuneable&quot; instead.<br />
<br />
The only gear that should be truly nodrop is gear earned from zones with flagging/keying conditions.  You should not have access to gear from a zone if you are not able to enter that zone.<br />
<br />
Or, perhaps they change it and put in a &quot;condition attuneable&quot; aspect of this gear, so no one who is not keyed/flagged for a zone can equip it, but it IS tradeable.  Thus, they can buy it all they want, but they can't USE it unless they're flagged for the zone from which it came.<br />
<br />
IMO, this is a much more sensible solution to the nodrop situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I agree except the other condition you put in there about flags.. then a level 60 w/o bot key could not wear ornates.. i believe the biggest market for them is from level 55s.. =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I will admit that the new attunable gear is nice, but although it will allow someone to live longer (HP/Resists), it wont make them any more powerful?<br />
<br />
What do I mean?<br />
<br />
First off focus effects are rare on these items.  With casters especially, its the focus effects that determine there power.  Additionally, the focus effects I have seen are effect IV level.  So there are items w/ rec levels of 66 yet effect caps of 65 on them.  Finally, I saw a link to a 125HP ring or Earring.  Thats nice for stats, but a tank wouldnt necessarly want it due to the lack of AC (had a AC of 9).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">To be honest, I like the attunable attribute. But then I'm from one of these weird family guilds who play EQ for fun (hmmm, EQ and fun in the same sentence - who'd a thunk it?). For us its a great boon. We tend to group together a lot and have a keep it in the guild policy, meaning stuff gets passed down where possible. Up until the mid 50s that was fine. Then quested armour put a large damper on it.<br />
<br />
Now there's attunable stuff. Still can't be passed down as such, but at least it can be passed on to other folks in the guild. Its good for us.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, yeah there's loads of this stuff around at the minute, but what will happen when the usual post release nerf bat starts smashing drop rates, stats, procs, etc... etc...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Hmm this is good in it sucks up platinum within the system, though not sure how it will affect the 24-7 Yantis traders.</div></div><hr />

This is a way of bridging that gap ., but in no way does the casual player infringe on Time players as usually not even in the same zone :P<br />
<br />
<br />
As regards original posters statement that any noob can buy PP from supersales to get items , fair enough , but some of us have been playing casual for 5 years and have amassed a grand amount of PP to spend on what we like .. these attunable items from OoW are a god send to us who cant raid and cant deal with crappy expansions like LDoN .<br />
<br />
OoW has breathed new life into the game for me , the zones look great and have a feel of the old eq in them ,which had been lost since Velious .<br />
<br />
I rejoice<br />

<br />
There are newbs out there that will be level 70, they are just botted.  I consider these PL'ed toons to be newbs.  You know the type, they leech on flag mobs or raids and have NO clue about how to play their class.  I've preferred a level 60 toon before to a level 65 toon that was just PL'ed to be a buff/rez/clarity bot due to the actual skill of playing a class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Attunable gear? I like the idea of it. I was at a point in eq were my gear was about maxed out, without spending countless hours in ldon or spending 50-100k for 30HPs here and there. Although I am sure, at first at least that there will be a high price to be paid for these items. Now if they would only make solo instances I just might come back. ;)<br />
That being said, it is really too bad SOE sat on it's toosh instead of spending more time debugging. So many problems in the game know is a direct result of that. Tradeskill botting to gain massive amounts of pp? I really don't think it would be that hard to set up alarms after some one is selling the same 2pp piece item 100 times in 10 minutes. There would have been a much lesser need for nodrop items if everyone and there brother could buy massive amounts of PP online cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Best idea SOE has had in a long time. <br />
<br />
The gear progression of non-raid players needed this change, hell the game needed this change, in order to keep up with mobs being balanced against what raiders are wearing. Progression keeps alot of people playing but when you are faced with the timesink'o'death (aka ldon) and the &quot;raid or **** off&quot; mentality of certain previous expansions you are gonna start losing players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I really love the idea of single person things too.  Too bad SoE fubar'ed that for the &gt;lvl 60 crowd.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">i think it works god both ways...for those that do play just a few hours a week its good to get a grp and get the drops...nice items makes for a happy player, but on the other hand wont see all the stuff the higher planes and harder zones have to offer (i.e. just something different not better) on the other hand im sure someone who spent countless hours in raids to get good gear see someone close (real close) to gear equal to theirs that only plays a little a week...but then again maybe they are fianlly leaning towards the casual player since EQ2 is coming out and most of those peeps will leave for that anyway, or they know that maybe the peeps that spent all that time raiding are now prolly bout sick of the game or left entirely already so working the other side of the things now =-0 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Or, perhaps they change it and put in a &quot;condition attuneable&quot; aspect of this gear, so no one who is not keyed/flagged for a zone can equip it, but it IS tradeable.<br />
I like this idea as well.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to SOE going through the zones and adding attunable to a good portion of the NO DROP gear out there.... if that will ever happen.   ;) <br />
<br />
Soon most of the expensive items will be way down to a reasonable price as the market becomes flooded with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Lets say 2 months from now, while most guilds are barely beating some encounters, people in the high end are getting their epic 2.0s, making new ground in the keyed zone, getting 400hps bps.. then SOE gives EVERY level 60-&gt;70 person loot that trumps all this. 500hps bps.. ya would ruin the game, all that hard work and now that guy over there has the same exact stuff as me? It's not the penis size it's also part of the competition factor.<br />
<br />
I talked to someone, and their guild is now 30 mains strong that play regularly, beat aow recently, working their way into xtc / keying up for emp.. Lets say they beat emp and all the stuff that drops rots.. that would be take away the fun factor. Clear VT to get stuff no one wants? Too much mudflation does hurt is all. And that's what the guy was trying to say.<br />
<br />
I think people don't actually realise how far from &quot;uber&quot; stuff like ornate and even VT gear has become.<br />
<br />
Its like how, when Ornate came out, guilds who were working their way through  KD arena gearing and Halls of Testing gearing were suddenly left looking at all the &quot;noobs&quot; buying ornate armor<br />
<br />
When LDoNs came out, people complained how htey had to raid to get their gear and suddenly any Joe Schmo could get armor nearly as good as theirs.<br />
<br />
VT gear just isn't very good any more. Go to EQvaluator and look at the lists of armor for shaman. VT probably gear wouldn't make the top 15 in any slot before OoW came out. <br />
<br />
I have no problem with attuneable items.<br />
<br />
I just wish that there was some way of handing in old no-drop items for some sort of reward - kinda like the old PoH / PoFear armor - I have so much Velious armor in the bank that I cant bring myself to destroy because it just seems wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The thing with LDoN was that you had to WORK to get the reward.  Now people go /afk in a zone that they have no business being in to get a drop or buying said drops in the bazaar for 200k.  I even heard there was a guy on my server that was 2-3 grouping (many, many, bots, he's talented, but stilll an asshat) to get drops.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />
