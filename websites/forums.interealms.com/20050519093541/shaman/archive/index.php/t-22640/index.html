<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No hard numbers here, just a weird situation that I thought was pretty neat. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok - In Riwwi Arena there are 'gladiator' mobs (non-named) that will wander out, aggro on a helpless slave (a Yunjo) and proceed to beat their ass silly.  The gladiator mobs are lvl 64+, the slaves are lvl 40.<br />
<br />
If you sit and watch, the gladiator will stomp a mudhole in the slave and he (the gladiator) will end up a bit over 80%.  But if you slow the gladiator, the Yunjo wins.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was camping the middle of the arena when an Anuek Glyphcaller pops and wanders out.  I was fighting another mob so I ignored him, he started beating up a slave.  I decided I would let the slave get him down to 30-40% and I could get some easy xp.<br />
<br />
I toss a slow (no other spells) on the Anuek so the Yunjo will last longer, and go back to dotting my mob.  By the time I finish killing my mob the Anuek is down to 30% health but the Yunjo is still around 90%.  The slave eventually killed the gladiator, no problems. <br />
<br />
I was interested by this and was able to repeat it several times, each time a slowed lvl 64 mob was trashed by a lvl 40 mob.  The slowed gladiator simply couldn't keep up with the innate regen of the slave.<br />
<br />
I know there is some funky coding with mobs and regen, so I wonder if I just malosina'd the gladiator would the outcome be different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sounds hilarious.. but um.. what exactly would sini do? unless the slave casts spells i cant see how it would help the slave win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Slow landed for full effect ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">@tikoko: if mobs (pop mobs, but i am sure god mobs, too) have an empty aggrolist they have an insane hp-regen.<br />
<br />
so when you cast malos/sinia on a mob, you are on his aggrolist -&gt; the mob's hp-regen is &quot;normal&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I understand correctly then . . .<br />
<br />
It wasn't the act of casting Slow that caused the greatly inferior mob to ream the big guy, but the fact that the inferior mob was still able to use his non-aggro regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This might be a interesting way to test out the cripple line futher?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First see if any old spell has a similar effect. Resist debuff is a great way to isolate that it's the mere fact of having _any_ debuf on, versus a spell that we expect to impact combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Slow landed for full effect ?<br />
<br />
I am wondering if you cast torgor's or plague of insects or any other slow that is a lower percentage slow, if the gladiator would win but be very low in hp's at the end, and, therefore easily killed after they had dispatched the slave.<br />
<br />
Have to try that out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you do know that glyphcallers have weak melee and low HPS and low AC, they are casters a slowed mob on the yunjo such as ... a mastruq mob, will mow down several yunjo befor the glyphcaller even gets done with one.<br />
<br />
slow is not that powerful, its all on who you cast on and how much its mitigated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slow landed for full effect ?<br />
<br />
Should be in that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Man that's weird.<br />
<br />
Riwwi is deeper than Qinimi . . . and yet I get mitigation on some of the mobs right at the Natimbi/Qinimi zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a) Slow landed for full.  The big problem was trying to figure out how to dispell it so I could kill the punk for xp. :)<br />
<br />
b) I was able to repeat this on several mobs, including a marstuq and a kyv heartpiercer.  End result was the same.  None of them could kill a single Yunjo that was 25 levels lower than they are.<br />
<br />
c) as several people mentioned, malosinia is very little aggro but should 'remove' the mobs 'crazy-regen'.  <br />
<br />
d) not sure what would happen if I debuffed the slave as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm sure if you debuffed the slave as well he'd get his ascots handed to him.  Basically you'd be putting them back on equal footing where the other mobs have already proved superior.</div></div><hr />

um ... you do know kyv's headshot ... right ?</div></div><hr />
