<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am level 64  and i am almost half way through lvl 64.  I have been online for almost a half of a week and it's been hell to find a freaking group.  I have been hanging around PoP  like PoV, BoT and similar zones.  I never have been invited once.  Has the population seriously dropped or is it me?  I need 3 locations that will give me the BEST chance to get a group soon.  I want to level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assuming you have Malo try WoS - everyone says it's the new BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do have Malo, thanks for the tip...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>keltor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are you in a guild?<br />
<br />
If not, I would highly suggest getting in a guild with people right around your level.  It doesn't suddenly mean you will always have a group.... but it sure makes it easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am in a guild... there is a slight issue though, the guild I am in has people but most of them are not online most of the time.... you know, RL and all.  There are people who are taking a break from EQ, there are people that are just realy busy.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, If I were to just join another guild I won't be able to go to all the guild raids due to family needing me as much as they do..  That is why I am not in a serious raiding guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not as good as WOS exp. by any means, but I see tons of grouping action in your level range in Noble's Causeway every night while farming runes for friends.  If you find a group killing the harder dragorns as opposed to the murks, I think you'll find exp isn't terrible.  Even on full regular experience at 69, I regularly make 1% every 2-3 mobs.</div></div><hr />
