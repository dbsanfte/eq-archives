<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some have said if you 2 box,  this UP zone rocks, however i have heard others say it sucks.<br />
<br />
UP Exp and opinions. (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=126) <br />
<br />
2. XP absolutely Rocket in this zone. If you're in a slowmoving group, advice them to get their stuff together and stock up on Damage dealers. Duo'ing in this zone is also priceless. XP galore and 700 PP in change for a full day of grinding.  <br />
<br />
With my 55 Monk and 55 Shammy, remembering FD's among other things,  is it possible to 2 box this zone.  I dont plan on Shammy pulling, and my monk will have to have Virtue before going there, but still,  could it work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">UP is horrid XP compared to PoP or LoY zones IMO.  I like hanging out in there, but when I get in grind mode, off to real XP I go.  PoV is still the best 55-60 XP in the game.<br />
<br />
Spraggon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ooooook,  I think its safe to say that is Dang nearly impossible to 2 box a 55 monk and a 55 shammy to 2 box in PoV.  Seeing that zone tends to destroy even groups of lvl 65's while tanking.   Maybe even UP was a bit too much for a lvl55   2box.   I just wanted to get some opinions before i tried.   Thx alot for info on EXP in UP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoV in groups =)<br />
<br />
Anywho, Nadox or Dulak is ripe for the picking with your duo.  UP mobs hit harder, have more HPs, and give less XP.  Even w/o the ZEM, LoY mobs go down alot faster than UP mobs and they drop cash.<br />
<br />
I box with a Ranger right now, so aggro kiting is a nice option for me in PoV.  I usually try to avoid it due to the &quot;KC effect&quot;, but it is a great way to grind some fast XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I might wait if I were you bud.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, the monsters in UP hit *very* hard.  While this isn't a problem if you get slow off, you're still going to be healing *alot.*  I might recommend waiting till 58 when we get a new heal, otherwise you're probably going to have a lot of downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoJ would be fine for you there is a &quot;secret&quot; tunnel system there that I used to solo in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went out to UP once. The run across ME was enough to put me off the idea of heading out there with less than a full group.<br />
<br />
The experience was so-so. Could have gotten better else where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any group of 65 that gets creamed in UP needs a remedial course in how not to suck in EQ.<br />
<br />
That being said, like most all of luclin, UP isn't worth the time.  If you wanted the drops, hunt there by all means for the fine free pre-ornate plate armor (radulkan and... moktor is it?  the boots are great).  No other reason to be in UP.  Definitely a bad place for exp.  It's not even a good place to powerlevel (unless, of course, you're getting your twink cleric a full set of free plate armor *grin*).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">UP is a revolting zone.  I hate it with an irrational  passion.   Druids get a full set of armor that drops from the only mob in the zone that doesn't summon (ie they can solo for it).<br />
<br />
Elysian Leggings:<br />
AC: +16 Sta: +15 Wis: +7 Int: +10 Cold Resist: +10 HP: +50 <br />

Compare that with the Shaman armor that drops in the zone:  <br />
Shojen Greaves :<br />

It's a punch in the nuts, thats what it is. <br />
<br />
I was dragged there occasionally to help a druid friend camp his gear, and I hated every minute of it.  Getting served a crap sandwich is one thing...having your nosed rubbed in it is something else.</div></div><hr />

I know my Druid nearly has the full set.   Its a sweet set also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Elyssian armor was a GREAT idea.  It got all those stinking quadding druids out of the rest of Luclin for a while.  Of course, once they got their sets, they were back to picking up quads and training them on top of me &quot;I need space to kite!&quot; and screaming obscenities at me when I rooted them &quot;When something hits me, I root it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some days, I miss making druids freak out and dissolve into fits of squealing, frothing rage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agreed, seems druid armor is the only thing decent there . The mobs in UP have too much hp compared to the xp they give.</div></div><hr />
