<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to get an idea of what you think of the group spell changes as a whole for this game. <br />
<br />
Personally I hate dealing with level 12's begging me for aego/7th, but I love being able to take a break from raiding and get a character to 20 or so in a few hours when I'm bored. I also like to help out lower level friends once in a while that I've passed up now but still talk to.<br />
<br />
Whats everyone think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This seems to be a prevelant problem with polls....   You have one negative and three positive responses here.  It tends to make it look like people are against the change, because the vote's split between the positive responses.</div></div><hr />
