<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So the raiding group I'm part of took down MM last night. Durring the MM kill I was assigned to heal the ramp tank. The ramp tank was a 65 warrior. He did the actual pull and brought MM to the corner where the main tank took over. The ramp tank took bursts of damage as expected and me and a druid handled the heals just fine. Then, for whatever reason he stopped taking damage. So I'm sitting there waiting to spam my next heal for a few seconds and realized he must no longer be the ramp tank (as the message about going on a rampage continued to blow by steadily). I asked in channel who was on ramp and got no response. In this case I targeted the main tank and tossed spams through the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
So my questions are... Why did the 65 warrior suddenly lose his status as ramp tank? How do I find the ramp tank once it's been switched?<br />
<br />
Any help is as always appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ormak D'Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back when I was raiding fulltime I used to have a key that was just /assist<br />
<br />
When I lost whoever I was supposed to heal I would /assist on the mob and it would show right away who had aggro.   You can hit the button a few times and it will cycle between the mob and everyone that is being hit.  Really handy for backup healing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blakcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HoTT is a great Leader AA for keeping track of who is receiving the smack down by mob. I usually grab leader in group during raid if noone else has it so that I always have it up. And then i also have a /assist hotkey for raids like Ormak.<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 1 (may not be needed, just depends on lag)<br />
/cast 1 (Fast heal)<br />
/pause 4 ( varies on what heal you are using)<br />
/attack off (or /assist to get retargeted on mob if you havn't got mob cached in your Tab key)<br />
<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat as needed throughout the fight. HoTT is your friend, although HoTTT would be alot better. Of course 3 target windows could get really confusing really fast. Hope this helps a little. GL on your future raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
The most likely reason in my opinion that the Warrior lost Rampage (aside from death) from the way you describe events is he went out of rampage range.  Less likely but theoretically possible is someone was memwiping MM, though that would probably wipe the raid due to hate list shifts.<br />
<br />
Most of the following should be common knowledge, but I'm posting it here anyway as I constantly STILL run into folks with misconceptions about Rampage. :rolleyes: <br />
Here are the FACTS about Rampage.<br />
<br />
1. Rampage only hits ONE person. You will see a lot of folks claiming a Rampaging mob can attack more than one player at a time. They are dead wrong. All rampage that exists today in Luclin and all previous expansions attacks only ONE player, period. This is the second most common misconception about rampage.<br />
<br />
2. Rampage IS a proc. Rampage procs off of the normal attacks made by the mob you are fighting. If that mob isn't hitting anyone, you won't see any rampage messages. Also, because Rampage is a proc, DEX debuffs and other spells that decrease proc rate can indeed lower the rampage rate. Slows also reduce rampage rate because they reduce the rate of the normal attacks that proc rampage in the first place.<br />
<br />
3. Rampage NEVER hits the person who is currenlty being attacked by the mob. Your main tank will never be taking rampage damage while he has aggro on the rampaging mob.<br />
<br />
4. Rampage is a SINGLE attack cycle. The person who is being hit by rampage will be hit by one of the mob's normal attacks. This attack can be blocked, dodged, parried, and riposted normally.<br />
<br />
5. Rampage DOES have a range, and that range IS different from the mob's normal melee range. This range differs from mob to mob. Some mobs can hit you with their rampage attacks literally no matter where you are in the zone; they have unlimited rampage range. Other mobs have rampage range that is barely larger than their normal attack range. Rampage range usually is larger than melee range.<br />
<br />
6. Rampage does NOT follow line of sight rules. For normal attacks, if the mob can't see you, it can't hit you. Rampage works differently, and it will hit you even if you are hiding behind objects. If you are in range, you will be hit.<br />
<br />
7. Rampage DOES NOT key off the main hate list. This is the most common misconception about how Rampage works. Any mob that can rampage has TWO hate lists, not one. The mob itself keys off of the main hate list just as every other mob in the game always has. The second hate list is for Rampage, and it works VERY differently from the normal hate list. Understanding how this second hate list works is the key to managing rampaging mobs.<br />
<br />
Here are the rules for how the rampage hate list works. These rules determine where the rampage damage goes.<br />
<br />
1. The order of the rampage list is based upon the order in which players gain aggro. As soon as you attack the mob, heal someone who is being attacked by the mob, or do anything else that causes the mob to aggro, you will be placed in the next spot on the rampage list.<br />
<br />
2. NOTHING will get you off of the Rampage list except for Memwipe. Period. Feign death MAY get you off the rampage list IF you are lucky enough to score a memwipe when you feign, and we all know that's a crapshoot at best. Even death does NOT ALWAYS remove you from the rampage list; many rampaging mobs will start beating on someone who died to rampage the instant they are resurrected. Rumblecrush is notorious for this particular behaviour, so plan your battle rezzing with care and make sure you rez the dead outside rampage range.<br />
<br />
3. Nothing you do will move you up or down the rampage list. Taunt, evade, jolt, and other methods of controlling aggro such as chain snaring, stunning, hate giving and hate taking spells, as well as all weapons with hate generating procs all have NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER on your position in the rampage list. Chain healing and chain nuking also have absolutely no effect on positions in the rampage list, although they will get you to the top of the main hate list fairly fast.<br />
<br />
The list forms in the order the mob aggros people, and it stays in that form, never changing EXCEPT to remove those who have scored memwipes with Feign Death. You CAN clear the list by repeatedly casting memblur and memwipe on the mob you are fighting, BUT remember that this will also clear the main hate list and that can cause all kinds of problems.<br />
<br />
Things to remember about Rampage...<br />
<br />
Remember, rampage DOES have a range. If you are taking rampage damange and move out of a mob's rampage range, it will start attacking the next person on the rampage list until you move back in range, then it will start beating on you again.<br />
<br />
The rampage list is SET IN STONE. This means if you know the order the mob aggroed people, you know exactly the order the rampage attacks will follow. This means you can control it.<br />
<br />
If you have Feign Death, and use it, you will NOT take any rampage damage while feigned. When you stand, you will immediately start taking rampage damage again UNLESS you scored a memwipe with Feign Death, in which case you are now at the very bottom of the rampage list. This is, of course, subject to the usual feign death bug... if the mob doesn't buy the feign for whatever reason, you will continue to take rampage damage while Feigned.<br />
<br />
Monks usually pull Rampage tank duty, especially if they have Combat Agility 3. The reason for this is that they will get hit by precious few of the rampage attacks due to their unmatched combat avoidance.<br />
<br />
Watch out for bards. If they are using AE songs, they tend to get accidentally noticed by the mob very easily when his song strikes a player on the mob's hate list. When you are setting up rampage tank order, it's best to stop all bard songs.<br />
<br />
The usual strategy against Rampage...<br />
<br />
First, everyone needs to make a hotkey to the effect of &quot;TAKING RAMPAGE DAMAGE NOW&quot; and spam it the instant they start taking rampage damage. Healers need to be ON THE BALL and tracking that message so they can keep whoever it is alive. As long as the person taking rampage damage is alive, in rampage range, and doesn't Feign Death, you have locked rampage attacks down to that single person.<br />
<br />
When you engage a rampaging mob, have your main tank get aggro first. Immediately send in all of your Monks and have them attack ONCE only to make sure they get the mob's attention. Note, you MUST make sure your monks attack BEFORE the first heal lands on the tank, or else that healer is going to be the first to take rampage damage and die very quickly. With rooted mobs this is trivially easy to do... just have your main tank hit the mob with an arrow, and then each monk follows suit in exactly the order you want them to take rampage.<br />
<br />
Once that is done, engage normally. The monks will spam their enrage hotkeys as they take rampage damage. As long as you have healers keeping up with it, you've got it locked down.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
(This is a repost of a guide posted here: pub147.ezboard.com/fmonkl...1047.topic )<br />
If the Warrior who made the pull to set himself as Rampage tank was hotboxing someone, maybe he just moved himself to wherever the MA was supposed to tank MM &amp; then kept Autoattack on but didn't pay attention.  Over the course of the fight if the raid was pushing MM along a wall edge he would probably end up out of Rampage range, at which point it would shift to whoever was next on the list until the puller moved back within Rampage range.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I already assist heal and I have seen HoTT work and it does well but this doesn't really help me. If I target MM and /assist I get MM's target: the main tank. I won't ever get the ramp tank. What i'd like to know is if there is a way of finding the ramp tank. Frekkels, your post is very informative, thank you. The part about the hotkey for &quot;I'm taking rampage damage&quot; is extremely useful. I'm wondering though if alot of the information there is a bit dated. I found a related post on the paladin boards and they describe a number of different types of rampage:<br />
<br />
Newbie question (rampage) /blush (http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=20095.topic) <br />
<br />
Again, understanding these are all fine and dandy but how the heck do I find this guy out of a 70+ person raid? He may not be paying as close attention and on a guy like MM who's proccing a 2k rampage peeps can go down quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is no way to just &quot;find&quot; the Ramp tank.<br />
<br />
A properly organized raid will be able to tell you who the Ramp tank is because they will have &quot;played the game&quot; and know who is at the top of the Ramp list.<br />
<br />
The alternative is for the top Ramp target (if he lives) to tell the Raid that he is the Ramp target du jour.  Then he can be focused on by Ramp healers.<br />
<br />
The third alternative is to simply go ask the mob.  Being the honorable guy he is, I'm sure MM will be happy to tell you who is going down next.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If rampage is not hitting the expected tank, ehe only way to know who to heal is to wait that the rampaged toon says that he is getting hit.<br />
<br />
Fro mith Marr, don't worry if you don't have to heal any rampage damage, mith marr spams with rampage messages but does not rampage, his rampage is in reality a flurry so concentrate on spam healing the main tank. the same thing is true with most mob in plane of earth.<br />
<br />
for finding someone in a 70 peeps raid, try &quot;/tar somedude&quot; command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks guys. This thread has helped. I'll make a note for guild raids on ramping targets that everyone should have a &quot;OH CRAP I'M RAMP&quot; Hotkey. Not sure how that will work for the raid group I particpate in, but I'll figure it out. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I thought MMs Rampage was fake...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, I haven't done him personally, but I've seen several posts on the warrior boards that say that MM's rampage is really a flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yea, in PoP a lot of the mobs that rampage are really flurring and vice versa.  From what i remember of LMM he doesn't actually rampage, the warrior who was supposed to take rampage was actually probably taking agro from the MT for a round or so, and that was the damage you were seeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes MM does not rampage. BUT if you have ToT and target mm, (don't switch) if he did rampage, you would see a split second of his target changing to the rampage tank.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, from what I know of rampage that first long post was mostly correct, except rampage goes to the first 4 people that went on the rampage hate list, and whoever has most among them gets it. <br />
<br />
so if the first 5 people to get on the list are warrior x4 cleric x1, the cleric has a chance if he outaggroes the other 3 warriros to get a round of rampage. After one of those 4 die, the next highest on hate list or the 6th person to aggro him (don't think anyone knows) gets to be in that top 4 list and will probably die to ramp...<br />
<br />
Nothing is faster than people calling rampage because usually you don't have the luxury of the person taking 1 round of ramage, then switching to mob, waiting for another round of rampage to see who it was, then healing.. 2nd round almost always takes em out..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rampage can act strangely. Besides from the Flurry/Rampage message bugs, I have definitely seen people loose rampage when still in range.<br />
<br />
I _think_ the theory is that mobs have a limited aggro list and you can drop from it after some time if its a large enough raid. The best thing you can do is tell the rampage tank to make sure they do engage the mob to stay on the aggro list, if they still loose rampage without going out of rampage range, then all you can do is wait for someone else to announce they are on ramp.<br />
<br />
One other thing that can happen and is confusing: a cleric or debuffer can get on rampage at the start, but then move out of range at which point the designated ramp tank gets rampage. Then if the cleric/debuffer moves back in range the ramp tank will loose rampage again for no obvious reason.<br />
<br />
My general advice:<br />
If the RT looses rampage, just stick on him for a few rampage rounds as there's a good chance the next person on ramp will die and rampage will switch back. If they're still not taking damage, try to /target cleric01 and go through all clerics as they are often rampage victims and its important to try to keep em alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, in this case it's not that the tank lost Rampage, I believe through either &quot;accidental&quot; placement of MM, or because your Raid Leader wanted to put MM in the particular spot that he bypassed Rampage.<br />
<br />
There is a positioning of MM that causes him to still Rampage but not hit anyone. It sounds like this was the case with you because you don't mention having to follow the ToTT window to find who actually was getting hit.<br />
<br />
So, if this raid was brought to you by the word Pillar I believe that will be your answer.<br />
<br />
Feel free to PM me if I appear to be making no sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 1 (may not be needed, just depends on lag)<br />
/cast 1 (Fast heal)<br />
/pause 4 ( varies on what heal you are using)<br />
/attack off (or /assist to get retargeted on mob if you havn't got mob cached in your Tab key)<br />
<br />
I'm assuming your last line says /attack off because your auto attack is coming on when you /assist. It doesn't have to be that way!  There's a little known command (that is loved by chanters lemme tells you) called /assist off.<br />
<br />
/assist off makes it so your auto attack doesn't come on when you do any kind of /assist.<br />
<br />
