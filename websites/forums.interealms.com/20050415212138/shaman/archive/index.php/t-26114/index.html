<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hk2001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gave a guildie a tainted Heartstone today, and we decided to sit in the bazaar and train her lingual skills. <br />
<br />
Using the same macro i always do, I began to spam her with crap.<br />
<br />
and nothing happened..  I was speaking Common.  I swapped between all the languages, and always my marco button came out as common.<br />
<br />
however whenever i typed a /g message, it was in the language selected. <br />
2 or 3 guildies came, with the same result.. <br />
<br />
<br />
What gives?  did they swing the big ol' nerfbat, or am i doing something wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually that sounds like a fix that I read about, not a nerf.   People who were working on languages would forget they were doing so and the hotkeys they NEEDED to make raid calls were getting garbled, so they made a command for hotkeys to select a language (could be remembering wrong however).<br />
<br />
  Check the /command or /help and see if there is a /language or anything like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
Do you have more than one chat window?  Thats the most common error made.  Setting the language in one window and typing in another doenst use the selected language;it uses common.  Set the language in he Main Window, and type there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, more than one chat window causes this bug....just set all windows to the language you're using, and you shouldn't have too much of a problem...unless you really forget to change them back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I trained several languages up last week (since the last patch) and the hot key method works just fine.<br />
<br />
I use 4 text windows but have all my comunication channels sent to one window.  I use the 'always chat here' option on that window so the hot key will always send group messages there so I only needed to change the language in that window to get it to work.<br />
<br />
Still trying to figure out the last language to get my Tainted Heartstone to full power.  I have 26 languages at 100 and it's still +9/+72.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You mean you have 25? I think everyone's looking for #26</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tearr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Theives Cant, not found on the Guild Masters. Just need to find a friendly Rog.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have that one already :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a language called &quot;an unknown tongue&quot;  that's probably the one you are missing.<br />
<br />
I don't know where it came from but a guildmate taught it to me.  Said he learned it from someone he grouped with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">h4x0r!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unknown language got taken off of my language list after one of the last patches. It ain't there for me any more. It never affected the charm regadless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have the heartstone on a Wizard alt that has EVERY language in EQ at 200, and it's still +9/+72, including Thieves Cant.<br />
<br />
If someone can figure out which one it is we're all missing, I think a bunch of people would be overjoyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">lol, you have languages at 200! You really are in the lead on this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Folks on Allas been trying to figure it out since the thing first dropped. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sylorish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In response to the original poster, looks like they did nerf language training.  Specifically if you had at least 1 pt in a language you used to be able to train that language to max by just being grouped and talking to group in that language.  Now you can't train by talking to yourself, another person has to also talk in that language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">....its always been like that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Always been like that..... Forever. You can teach to one point above your skill. Example if you have a skill of 1 you can teach someone else to a skill of 2, and then they teach you to three, etc...<br />
<br />
/boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Used to you had to zone between skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Greflin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you zone, and then zone back. You can talk to self for skill. Atleast it worked not long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the way it work, has always worked, and probably always will is:<br />
<br />
group up with someone, 2 box if you want;<br />
set your original chat window (or all of them) to the desired language to train;<br />
start mashing the spam buttom.<br />
<br />
you will get skill ups iff the person your training is within 5 below or 1 above you in skills...or of the the othe person is much higher than you and spamming you<br />
<br />
so if both of you have lvl 1 in elder erudian, both set languages to it, then spam away, you'll both get skill ups at about the same rate.<br />
<br />
i wasnt trained on theives cant at all before being spammed, it didnt even show up on my skills window until i logged on the next day, but you can still get traiing in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sylorish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Always been like that..... Forever. You can teach to one point above your skill. Example if you have a skill of 1 you can teach someone else to a skill of 2, and then they teach you to three, etc...<br />

<br />
Not true, previously, I trained myself in every language by getting 1 pt from guild master or another player, then talking to myself while grouped with my 2 box, who doesn't know any languages and wasn't speaking.<br />
This was working in October/November, but it appears to have been nerfed sometime around January as now the other person needs<br />
to be speaking also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>darhews</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was working languages the other night, noticed that in pok and the bazz they did not go up one bit, but once I moved to a zone where you can target and kill npc's I was able to train again. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
