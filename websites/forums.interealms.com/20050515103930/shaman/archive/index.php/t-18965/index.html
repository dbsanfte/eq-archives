<br />
The slow is still useless...12 second recast is way too long.  This is even more true since we only have 8 spell slots, and i know mine are always filled with everything i need.  I don't have a free slot to devote to this spell.  Also, the 7 tick duration is a bit harsh with all the other limitations of the spell.  If it was unresistable, i could MAYBE see it being useful for a constant stream of single pulls, but if there was a chance you had to slow more than one MOB, you would need another slow up (or Time's Antithesis..and we all have one of those in our hands or bags....).<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess if they give us a canni6 that is upgrade to canni4 and an aa, I would have that free spell slot for the new, worthless slow.  Maybe this is the plan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hrm, a Quiescence upgrade eh?  OK..I can deal with that, looks like a promsing thing, but I'd rather haveother things first.. Ahh well...got to givem credit for a decent upgrade..I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The slow is still lacking...<br />
12 second recast with only a 7 tick duration is not acceptable to take up a spell gem.<br />
Still just easier to Malos every mob.. more mana but less casting time, it will last much longer than 7 ticks and be of more benefit to the group debuffwise than a low duration low percent slow with a crap resist mod.<br />
Sorry SoE I hope you read this as anything less than Tugur with a faster cast time and a resist adjust is not acceptable unless your adding more spell gems. Either that or it needs to be unresistable.<br />
<br />
Ok the Ancient wording on that is starting to worry me a bit...<br />
2 65 spells that do so close to the same thing has got me wondering about the name.<br />
Plus its not much of an upgrade really for losing a potentially better spell.<br />
Make it GROUP and they may have something there worth getting.<br />
With exp mobs hitting 500-1k an extra 60 per tick helps some but is hardly much at all even fully extended its just not enough.<br />
We are way overdue for a group heal of some sort or a much better direct fast heal.</div></div><hr />

I agree on both counts, though I feel the canni still needs an increase to ~400 range.  Canni takes too much damn time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whoever is bringing forth our ideas to the Dev team is doing a fantastic job atm(Whoever you are my hats off to you).<br />
<br />
The new Canni - is exactly what I asked for and if it goes live, I will be very happy <br />
The Slow - It looks like they upped the percentage because people thought 55% wasn't good enough. They need to figure out what they want to do with the spell:<br />
<br />
1) If you want this to be the new Turgur's, you need to up the percentage to 75% and keep the -30 or the people who are lobbying for a &quot;new&quot; full time Slow, won't be happy(rightly so since Turgur's is a 4 year old spell and their argument is that the new Slow should be better or equal in every aspect: cast time/resist adjust/duration/recast timepercentage). However, I wouldn't like it to be my main Slow honestly.<br />
<br />
2) If you want this to be a situational Slow, thus lower percentage, you need to make the Slow dramatically better in the remaining criteria. <br />
<br />
So if you want this to be a situational Slow(i.e. charm breaks, highly MR mobs, CC tool for when you catch aggro), you need to lower the cast time to 1 second and give it a -75+ resist check. <br />
In exchange the Slow can be more expensive mana wise, last only 7 ticks and have a longer recast time/lower effectiveness(I'd gladly take the 55% back for these adjustments).<br />
I'd highly prefer option 2)<br />
<br />
Ancient Quiescence - 360/tick is NOT enough. I am glad to see you are working on a Q upgrade, but 360/tick doesn't cut it. You'd see happy Shamans all over EQ, if you made the current version a groupspell and add a single version on par with http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3475&amp;source=Test (i.e. 500/tick) for 300-325 mana. The cleric would still keep their edge with their ancient version of 550/tick(even though Shamans were the first priest with a Heal over Time and are certainly the ones making more use of HoTs)<br />
<br />
These changes would certainly be a huge step towards balancing the Shaman class. I'd go so far to say, if the changes I listed went in 1:1, the Shaman class would be very close to be back in line with the vision so many of us had when we started the game. <br />
The DoT problem Shamans have(due to the missing resist adjust on all our DoTs and the unproportional aggro all DoTs generate) doesn't allow us to honestly identify ourselves with the &quot;witch doctor&quot;, who used to have remarkable offensive power,if he wanted, anymore. <br />
<br />
An aspect for which I and many others chose to play a Shaman a long time ago.<br />
<br />
All in all, kudos to Sony, the test people feedbacking and whoever else is responsible for the very nice changes. Let's go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Being able to hit AAs during recast makes this WIKID uber.<br />
<br />
Hell, you can hit Canni4, AA Canni, Canni4, AA Canni over and over. You'll shame pre-nerf Mage Pet Canni regen rates...<br />
<br />
And you figured that out, how?<br />
<br />
Let's assume this new Canni has no refresh time. So, providing you do nothing else than smashing this key, you'd be able to regen 98 mana every 3 seconds. That's 196 mana every tick at the expense of 356 HPs(178x2). <br />
Even if you now added ~35 mana regen from Canni V and forgot about the fact, that you'd have to heal up, you'd look at a max regen rate of 230 mana per tick. This isn't as high as you could get with Pre-nerf pet Canni, let alone the fact, that the spells we cast, are actually balanced with this in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think that slow is thought to be an opening slow for High MR mobs.<br />
e.g.:<br />
mob INC!<br />
cast malo(s)<br />
cast 60% slow -30 resist<br />
cast tugur till it lands<br />
<br />
also it is a nice &quot;emergency&quot; slow. I use to have 2 slows memmed. If one gets resisted, the other is up sooner so i start to recast sooner. After mob is slowed with the emergency slow, you can recast tugur if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Up the duration of the slow to 10 ticks or so, and it may be useful for single pulls I guess.  The fact is, letting slow fade off mobs is the Debil, so this would still need to be followed up with Turgurs in it's present incarnation.<br />
<br />
Heading in the right direction though, more likely I'll buy GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As far as the paladins heal for 950ish for 440 mana, they can have it, I dont really care to be honest; upgrade Q as it stands now, give us a new blast whatever; if paladins want to be main healers in groups with crap like that, or they really feel like they dont have a role in exp groups anymore then that very vocal minority needs some help :-/<br />
The vast majority of my friends list are paladins and all the ones that I have talked with about this, including several RL friends that play, and they all say they are fine on healing.<br />
But as it goes in RL, the squeaky wheel gets the grease....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hail,<br />
<br />
AA cannniVI (Chaotic Pain) looks very good.  Would be great if the ratio was kept the same but the numbers doubled (356 hp loss for 194 mana), but I can live with it as Lucy is showing it right now as repeatable AA Canni.<br />
<br />
The Ancient Chaos Breath upped to 500 would be perfect.  360 isn't enough in my opinion, and Clerics will have 550 w/ their new Ancient HoT, so I don't see why it would be so wrong for us to have a decent HoT again.  A group form of Chaos Breath for 360 would be fine though.<br />
<br />
The Slow spell Balance of the Nihil for 7 ticks duration with 12 second recast time is still overly flawed.  THIS NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED!<br />
<br />
Either REDUCE the recast delay, or drastically increase the negative resist mod and give it a decent duration.<br />
<br />
60% slow w/ -30 mod on it w/ a 3 second recast delay would be usable for LDoN, even at only 7 ticks duration.  This won't replace Turgur's for boss mobs in my opinion, because Turgur's will NOT be able to overwrite Balance of the Nihil, a level 65 spell.  No way is a raid force going to want to let a mob that is 60% slowed go back to being UNSLOWED a mere 42 seconds later until Turgur's lands again.  We need to either be able to recast this at will, or change it into something really usable...<br />
<br />
If you want to keep the long recast delay of 12 seconds (an eternity on an unslowed mob), then up the Resist Adjust to -60 and make it a 75% slow w/ a standard 6.5 minute duration.  This would replace Turgur's for boss mob slows, but not be a replacement in many exp groups or in Adventures for 'normal' mob slowing because of the recast delay.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Call it Turgursini for all I care. All it does is save time :)<br />
<br />
Why would you want such a spell is my question though.<br />
<br />
A 7 tick Slow with a 1 second cast time, -75 MR resist adjust for 300 Mana and a 12 second recast delay(even if they chanegd it back to 55%), would greatly improve the Shaman and bring them back on top for the Slowing slot a lot more so than slapping a -30 mod on Turgur's and be done with it.<br />
<br />
Please, consider that Sony is currently reading these boards and think about your argumentation. If people want a -30 Turgur's, they will give us a -30 Turgur's, let's opt for a &quot;different&quot; more situational Slow that allows us to be more versatile in the one area we excel in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The new slow improve in the good way but it's still not enough.<br />
<br />
     On the other hand , new Quiescence is disapointing. Now mob double for 1k ,so either make it heal more like 500 , or better change it to a group quiescence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen. This gets my vote for this month's &quot;Did I read that or post that?&quot; award. Pretty much word for word.<br />
<br />
As for the new slow, I can see what they're doing. Hell, I'm almost close to accepting it. 12 second recast probably is a little high, but not much for what they're wanting. As long as they flag it so that Turgs can overwrite it, it's actually not a bad spell to get a mob under control quickly while you're patch healing/malosing/Turging/whatevering - it buys you 42 seconds to get everything sorted and then land a Turgs if it's a big fight. Hell I'd probably use it in LDoN straight off the bat if they dropped the recast by 25% or so.<br />
<br />
All it does is save time <br />
<br />
But I thought it slowed time?  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
If people want a -30 Turgur's, they will give us a -30 Turgur's<br />
<br />
Um, they haven't given us what we've been asking for for a lonnng time... But I see and agree with your point. :)  That said, it takes more than one opinion to have an objective discussion. If one person posts GREY and ten people post WHITE, it has to be seen as productive in showing what the majority of people want. My opinion? I'll be joining the Giac More Variety Club - I like having options. :)</div></div><hr />

New slow is still horrible. Ditch the retarded 12 second recast. 7 tick duration? Come on SOE, throw us a fricking bone.<br />
<br />
Instead of upgrading Quiescence, how about upgrading Tnarg's Mending? I mean paladins with their new spell have become better spot healers than us. And for healing the group they ... ah never mind, their group heal got upgraded too!<br />
<br />
How about giving us a group Quiescence now that paladins are guaranteed better raid healers than us?<br />

Nope, you understood correctly.  Call that a 4am post on my part. :p <br />
<br />
I still want either a higher resist (like -60) adjustment OR a reduction in the recast delay to 3 seconds.  Either will make it a 'go-to' spell over Turgur's.  <br />
<br />
I personally wouldn't mind a 'Turgursini' w/ a -60 mod resist mod on it.  Saves us casting Malos just for slow.  We'll still have to cast Malos to debuff certain mobs anyway or to land our damage spells when soloing.<br />

the slow is imporved but lest face it unless its a 75% with less resist less cast time (and more mana to make up for this) its goona be very situational like desease slow.<br />
<br />
new canni aa? not sure, but as an aa cant go too wrong depends how implemented.<br />
<br />
but atleast they have imporved the sepll and there is hope!<br />
<br />
other things nice to see?<br />
<br />
some shaman only attack/new mellee skills helper  buff and debuff on mobs makes thenm more susceptable?  or a combined attack with other seppsl to combine and take 1 less buff spot like add agail to diaku? make 1 mega buff with everything in it? hp stats acumen etc? well can hope?<br />
<br />
a new pet spell or an aa that increase current pet, ie get the aa summon pet pet now 1 pet higher on pet scale? or much improved attack and stats and can duel wield without haveing to give it weapons??<br />
<br />
an aa that means spirit call is much improved pets as above need above aa to do this? if got a spell then just this aa.<br />
<br />
hopefully something to make rabid bear better? <br />
<br />
crit afflicition obviusly good, <br />
<br />
and not sure about rest need to think more:)<br />
<br />
these just ideas feel free to disagree , agree or sugeest new ones:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The new canni aa solves my two major 'wants' in one blow: upgrade to canni IV and an extra (freed) spell slot.  I am very pleased: I'll preorder GoDs tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Looking at Balance of the Nihil, I have one major problem (as do we all) - the duration.  -30 on the resist isn't enough to put up with a 43 second duration.  Now what if it had a stun component to it?  Honestly, what is a stun, but a short duration, 100% slow?  From a quick glance at Lucy, seems they come in 5, 8 or 10 sec durations.  Either way, I think this would need at least a 3 minute duration (on the slow, not the stun ;)), or we'd be getting complete aggro from chaincasting this.  Although a true AE (not like Tigir's) would be nice, as well - I could see it with that low of a duration.<br />
<br />
As for Ancient Chaos Breath, a 60x4(+) upgrade from  Quiescence isn't very worthwile, in my opinion.  Which so far, is the only difference, other than costing 20 more mana.  Make it group usable, make it around 500hp per tick, or something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Canni AA would be most excellent. Two birds with one stone. Just don't hose up the refresh time on it.<br />
<br />
Giac pretty much nailed the new slow. It's too compromising to be useful in pretty much every situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Not 100% sure its an aa, just because it says class none. I will be pleased if it is, we gain a spell slot this way if so and can afford the space to have 2 slows up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Noticed the fizzle rate on new canni has now been lowered to the SAME as Canni III. Again I ask, is this really an upgrade? It does have the advantage of being able to free up a spell gem though.<br />
<br />
As for the slow, sometimes I do load Turgurs and Togors at the same time for a chance at getting off another slow quickly in case of a resist.  Usually by the time Togors lands, Turgurs is back up. I might try to use this in place of Torgors for these situations when I need to get add slowed quickly. The 12 sec recast still hurts. At 6 secs, it could fill the roll nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Things I like to see.. <br />

3) We need a new poison &quot;DD&quot; with thats on par with cleric &quot;DD&quot; nukes. 695 doesn't hack it..  Let the wizards, druids, and rangers have the ICE DD upgrades.. <br />

4) CANN Hotkey AA is a step in the right direction. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">If it's an AA, they don't fizzle so that's not really an issue.  It's definately an upgrade and I notice that they upped the mana returned to 98 which makes the hp/mana both at 20% more than canni4 matching the lich upgrade for necros.  nice change there all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Stuff I'd like, my 2 cents:<br />
<br />
1. A slight upgrade to our quick direct heal, not much but a bit more fast direct healing power.<br />
<br />
2. The single Q can be left alone but also a group (v2 - MGB'able) version added for more mana cost.<br />
<br />
3. An AA version of CannIV would be nice. Even if it is the same HP to Mana if we could use by itself or along with the CannIV spell assuming the refresh would allow you to quickly alternate between the two.<br />
<br />
Cast CannIV Spell<br />
Cast CannVI AA<br />
Cast Cann IV Spell<br />
Cast Cann VI AA<br />
<br />
4. I honestly don't care much about a new nuke or DoT, I'm of the opinion that a Shaman's DPS comes from adding dps to melee classes. So rather than nuke, if I can increase the DPS of the melee classes in my group by ~15-20%, then that's &quot;my&quot; DPS. So, I'd like to see a group version of FA, or some other pure attack buff that stacks well.<br />
<br />
5. I think we need a HP upgrade to Fo7, not much but a bit more HP would be nice.<br />
<br />
6. I like a faster casting slow. I think it needs a larger resist adjustment than -30, and the recast should be less. Up the resist to -45 giving it a &quot;built-in&quot; adjustment the same a the level 60 Malo. Maybe like this:<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil<br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
2:  Decrease Attack Speed by 60% <br />
3:  Increase Disease Counter by 24 <br />
<br />
Mana: 225<br />
Skill: Alteration <br />
Casting Time: 1.5 <br />
Recast Time: 6 <br />
Resist Adjust -45   <br />
  <br />
Classes: SHM/65 <br />
Duration: 10 ticks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The recast on the new slow needs to drop, the duration extended to at least two minutes, and slow percentage upped to at least 65%.  Don't care if mana cost is increased further, as long as this happens.  There is no reason why we should have a mediocre slow considering that this will upgrade a lvl 51 spell.<br />
<br />
My dots still create a ton of agro where they shouldn't.  Why should 2k damage spread out over 2 minutes generate more agro than a 4k damage nuke?  Especially when my dots cost more and resist more often.<br />
<br />
Q needs a beefier upgrade - 60 more hp/tick is not sufficient.<br />
<br />
The new aa canni ratio is good, but the amount of hp lost and mana gained needs to be increased slightly for it to be truly useful.  The spell canni 4 needs to upgrade, not move itself to my keybank from my spell bank.  The focus should not be on freeing up a spell slot, but on making it so that shaman do not spend the majority of their time casting canni over and over again.  But making it an aa is A+<br />
<br />
Shaman need an improved spot heal - even with focus and aa, saying &quot;a 1300 hp tnarg's does not cut it&quot; is a vast understatement today.<br />
<br />
Shaman still do not stack on raids.<br />
<br />
Rather than giving our pet a dot proc (which will no doubt get every shaman killed and make every enchanter I know miffed), upgrade the pet to lvl 60 so that the majority of its hits do not miss.  That's a real pet upgrade.<br />
<br />
Fix them in that order and I'll be happy.  The changes at least are heading in the right direction, something shaman haven't seen for quite a few expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The one big advantage of the canni AA would be that it is independent of the regular recast delay. Normal recast on a lot of spells is 2.25 sec, so you can hit the AA and only loose about a second in regular cast time.<br />
I think us getting the beastlord resist adjusted slow is nonsense for the situations it would be used for, mainly casting it on really tough mobs as soon as they're incoming.  We die fast enough in a lot of raid situations anyway since no tanks can get instant aggro, this would just make us die faster  with no real gain for the raid.<br />
And it's no use in experience groups due to the long recast, usually you only get in time constrains in experience groups if you pull multiples, not because the mob can two round your tank.  If they realy want to make this one worth the money make it 60% but 2 sec cast with 2 sec recast.</div></div><hr />

They'll probably pull it because, as pointed out, you would be able to mix the spell canni and AA canni to get really sick mana regen. I can't see a way to balance this without making it a spell or linking the refresh timers somehow, and I don't think the latter will happen.</div></div><hr />

     On the other hand , new Quiescence is disapointing. Now mob double for 1k ,so either make it heal more like 500 , or better change it to a group quiescence.<br />
<br />
The more I think about group Q the less I really want it. In your normal exp group we all have Canni4, Q/Torpor, Tnargs, and 1-3 slows up at all times. I would rather have the upgraded single target Q than a group Q for the simple reason of having to permanently tie down a spell gem for it. The only times I can think of its use would be on tough pulls in exp groups/ldon, and on raids with aoe damage. However if I was a raiding shaman in EP level stuff, then, a MGB'able group Q would be an awesome skill.<br />

If they were to make it an aa you could rotated the aa and Cann4 every 3 seconds never having to wait on a refresh of either.  This would net you the total mana from cann4 and &quot;Cann6&quot; in the matter of 1 tic without waiting for anything... That comes out to be 180 mana per tic.  Now matter how you look at it this is rather powerful (then again mana stones still &quot;exist&quot; even with the ease of getting to and from old world zones without putting much of a pause in whatever you were doing).</div></div><hr />

Turgurs (lvl 51) can overwrite Forlorn Deeds (lvl 57) and Sha's Revenge (lvl 65) without any problems.  Why cant Turgurs overwrite Balance of Nihil?<br />
It's not the lvl of the spell, its the one with a higher effect that will overwrite.<br />

I will have this spell perma mem'd.  I will even use it on raid plows.  If Turgur's resist, I will cast BoNihil afterwards and leave it at that.  It will also be used for raid bosses as an initial slow and another shaman can follow up immediately with Turgurs.  Nice part of this spell is it's short cast time.  1.5 sec vs 3.0.

Do I really have to explain why *Active* mana regen doesn't hold it's own nowadays when comparing to *Passive* mana regen? An AA Canni would still require to stand still and cast it(2.5 second cast time), which is a huge drawback, but it would make us cast our only source of mana regen between other spells without losing precious time. <br />
<br />
*Active* mana regen is outdated. The *passive* mana regen has become too good. A long time ago, the drawbacks of *active* mana regen were acceptable, because of the incredible effectivness, nowadays there's 2 factors that made *active* mana regen a non-viable option:<br />
<br />
1) The game is faster. Encounters don't last 15+ minutes and having to cast Canni(i.e. adding 6 seconds to every damn thing you do), is a huge drawback in effectivness. Imagine adding 6 seconds to every Wizard nuke to have the same efficiency they have now<br />
<br />
2) The gap between *active* and *passive* mana regen. Every Caster went from a whole 1 mana per tick to 4 mana per tick through Mental Clarity alone. The passive Mana Regen buffs, like Bard Song, Clarity and self buffs have improved. <br />
New ones like PoT9 and Spiritual Dominion have been added. And on top of all that there's FT and mana regen buffs that stack with it AND horses. <br />
While the best caster was regening less than 30 mana full raid buffed during Velious, the Shaman had a max potential regen of 100+<br />
<br />
Today there's casters with 100+ *passive* mana regen, while a Shaman that does nothing else but *actively* regening mana doesn't even hit the 200 mana mark. Don't you see a problem with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Some AA spells have have refresh times. Your spell gems are not greyed out but if you cast a spell too fast you get the red text telling you &quot;Spell recovery time not met&quot;.

<br />
The idea of group Q sounds nice, but atm I dont feel like giving up a spell slot for it.  Let the other priests worry about the mgb heals.<br />
<br />
Im really intereset to see how much more dps these new pet abilities will yeild.  At first i didnt like them, but thinking it over its more dps and no agro.  Also hoping they effect our spirit call pets as well.  Maybe something so i dont have to keep lugging around all these rusty daggers.</div></div><hr />

Excuse me? The best lich during Velious wasn't giving 50 mana per tick. It was more like 30ish, making this a 100% upgrade. Because that's where Canni IV is from, Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I still really don't see the point in the new slow. It's recast time and duration mean I can't use it as my primary slow in really any situation and IMO the resist mod isn't worth enough to keep it memed in anything but very specific situations. I'd like to see either one of 2 things with the slow. Either a larger resist mod so that it will land on that isn't magic immune or a turgur's or less recast and longer delay. I happily use the slow as my primary slow in things like LDoN normal missions if I could use it as my primary slow. <br />
<br />
IF the new cann is an aa that wouldn't be bad at all. As just an upgrade to cann 4 it would be pretty weak. Needs serious increase in hps and mana if it's gonna be a spell.<br />
<br />
As for the q upgrade either give us a group HoT even 300 a tick would be fine or give us an upgrade to tnargs. Q is already a very efficient heal just slow what we need is either a group HoT or an upgraded direct heal.<br />
<br />
And please if your gonna give us any form of damage don't do a disease dot. They are the most useless thing around. Personally I'd like to see a 1kish poison nuke with a short cast time or another bane like curse style dot. Plague of Daluda as it is will probably never be used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Hey look on the bright side.  With no class on the new canni, maybe they are putting it on an item so that everyone else can use canni now too!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  As for using an AA canni, then normal canni back and forth... that isn't really overpowered or even that good of a use of spell gems if they make the reuse timer on the AA version low enough you can cast it twice in a row :)<br />
<br />
<br />
  I must throw my hat in with everyone else though.  It's time that they started making the majority of ALL classes staple spells into AA (Slow, MaloXXX, Tash, Mez, etc.).  Lately mana regen isn't the limiting factor for a caster, it is spell gem availability, strategy and gameplay from person to person would be dramatically different if you weren't able to say with 90% certainty what 6 of the 8 spell slots are for a person knowing only class and level.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Oh yeah, and as for a group heal over time... I wouldn't mind one if given to me so that I could help out in that manner, but you all do realize if we got one that our MGB would be saved for healing and we'd have to Fo7 the whole raid group by group again?   If you don't remember, that is PAINFULLY SLOW.</div></div><hr />

I may be wrong as well but I think this just refers to it being castable on others outside your group; its not a group spell simply because it doesnt have Target Type: Group in it and doesnt have an AOE range.<br />

As far as the new canni, if it does in fact come in the form of an ability like an AA, then I highly doubt it'll remain as is.  It'd be WAY more of an upgrade than anyone is getting and overpowering IMO, being able to cast can4 and click can6 within a tick is crazy mana regen.<br />

Probably the same agro as you get casting Q on anyone, next to none.  Heal over time spells have very little agro associated, because they don't do anything instantly, and I don't believe mobs get agro each tick.<br />
<br />
And there is no chance that canni spell is an aa with no recast timer.  It's a spell I'd be sure, just doesn't make sense as an AA skill (except in the distant dreams of shaman everywhere).  I like the new Q (but I don't like the Ancient if they're going off on that nonsense like the previous ones), 60 hp for 4 ticks isn't much, but many people are getting 6-7 (or 8) ticks on Q, so that's anywhere from 360 - 480 hp upgrade.  Pretty much just adding on an extra tick and a half.  500 would be nice, but it would be incredibly powerful I think.</div></div><hr />

It was the only thing that actually made me think SOE was moving us up from red-headed-step child to brown-haired-foster-kid.  As for the slow, if the refresh timer doesn't drop, or the duration doesn't expand (either will do) then they might as well have given me a true south spell, and I would use it just as often (i.e. never).<br />
<br />
If they make the Canni spell an AA, then I swear I'm happy.  All this other junk I can work around, at least I would have gotten ONE good thing from an expansion instead of our usual boat-load-O-worthlessness.<br />
<br />
The upgrade to Q makes sense (if the Canni is an AA).  They want to start upgrading our class slowly, and not give us a whole slew of new things at once, so as to not suddenly find out that all these things adds to overballance.  I don't think It'll happen, but i understand the fear of it.  As such, the Q upgrade is enough to not scoff at, but really nothing to change balance in any way.<br />
<br />
I am really scared about the new AA that summons the pet which regens endurance.  REALLY scared...  The AA costs in the new expansion seem outlandishly insane, and I am VERY concearned that this is going to become a pretty much required AA (i.e. everyone nags you to cast, and if you don't have it, you don't get as many groups).<br />
<br />
If it is, and it's something on the scale of 50AA points (which sadly, looks normal for a 5 tier AA in the new GoD expansion) then my life is really going to suck.</div></div><hr />

I sure as heck don't nor do I wish to waste a spell gem on having it memmed.<br />
<br />
Turgur with a faster cast/recast time and neg resist mod is much better option.<br />
Considering this spell would be 14 levels higher than Turgur it doesnt seem unreasonable to ask for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to slow... I agree with the rest, either make it a fulltime upgrade to turgur's, or make it a great situational slow.  Middleground = back of spellbook.<br />
<br />
In addition to those changes...<br />
a) let dogdog dual wield without handing them weapons... why are shamans the only pet class that has to carry rusty weapons?<br />
<br />
b) dots that don't provide an inordinate amount of aggro!   And more short duration dots :)  I love Bane.<br />
<br />
c) a poison DD for 1000dmg with 6.0 sec casting time. spear of letshamansdosomedmg.  *nods*  Wishful thinking...</div></div><hr />
