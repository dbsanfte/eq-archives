<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yeah I know this is the shaman boards, however, still a valid question.  I'm tempted to try something new and play a fighter, however, I'm wondering if being able to rez is still a big advantage?  As long as I can solo and not go lfg for long periods I'd be happy with any class.  Please, I need some input from folks in game now.  What have you experienced so far?  Thanks in advance, will be joining you soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bufr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My experience has been any class can solo. MOBs are marked 'solo' or 'group'. A MOB marked 'solo' means it is designed for the solo adventurer. No MOB will assist unless you aggro them by proximity. MOBs marked 'group' are designed for a group of players, though you can still solo them if you are high enough level. Group MOB come in two flavors singles and groups. When you target a 'group' MOB all other MOBs in that group are highlighted. There is no way to separate that group all MOBs highlighted will aggro as one. A single 'group' MOB will always come solo.<br />
<br />
Rezzing is important but it does not save EXP, at least yet. On death you will have an option to revive and can select your revival point. If you do not select revive any priest can revive you in place.<br />
<br />
The Pros of the Shaman are strong buffing power and our Runes. The Shaman get a spell Spectral Ward which negate's damage for 24 seconds. I believe there is a total damage that can be absorbed however at 17th my Ward has absorbed several hundred points of damage and remained up. In fact when I solo my health bar nevers moves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having played each of the four archetypes up to level 10 (at which point things change pretty significantly) I can say that only my priest was an efficient, effective soloer - or even duoer.  Playing without a priest is honestly just painful.<br />
<br />
I thought all the base classes were fun in their own way, but priests right now are far far more powerful than the others, and doing anything without a priest reduces you to killing whatever you can find solo (which tends to involve 1/3 to 1/5 the amount of exp you can get for killing the same number of critters in a group, instead of one at a time).  Huge huge exp bonus for killing grouped stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love the wards we get as shamans..  but one thing you should watch out for in a group...  for example I mostly leave the mob targeted so I can see who they are attacking..  When you cast a heal spell it targets who ever the mob is attacking..  But if you cast a ward spell it goes on the mob something to watch out for....<br />
<br />
Dasha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bufr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dasha when I cast Ward on a MOB it hits the player that MOB has targeted. Now I am only sure of this since as soon as my Ward would hit the person taking damage would stop lossing health.<br />
<br />
I have noticed bugs in the message spam. For instance if you target a player and cast Contagion the message seems to indicate the spell hit the player but the MOB has the spell effect on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ahhh thanks Bufr that is what i was going off of...  the message said it hit the mob must be that bug 8)...  thanks alot.<br />
<br />
Ok now everyone tonight when you play submit a bug for this so we can get it fixed...   8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I too have found priests in general to be extremely valuable and powerful, each in their own way.  Surprisingly, it seems that the three flavors of priests are actually *gasp* balanced.  They each have their own way of doing things, and so far each seems very capable of fulfilling their role.  A group with two priests, especially two different classes of priest, is capable of some VERY impressive things.<br />
<br />
The fighter archtype is exactly what you expect.  They can absorb a load of damage, and seem to be a bit better than their EQLive counterparts at dishing it out.<br />
<br />
The scout archtype varies widely at the Class level, though each seems able to fulfill the role of DPS and each one brings some unique utility.  These utilities, and indeed the classes, seem to more closely mirror their EQLive parents than some of the other classes.<br />
<br />
I have no experience outside of playing with a couple magicians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey Sudedor 2 priests in same group is insane...  I meet 3 people and we group almost everyday..  We have Shaman (me) Cleric, Bard, Predator...  Me and the Cleric's spells compliment each other like no other..  We can take down groups of oranges with little to no problems...    our group wards keep the party at full health while the bards mana song works its magic and the predator just nailing the DPS....  give us a tank and we non stop pull orange groups....<br />
<br />
Oh and woot dinged lvl 16 adv and 8 crafter..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I generally group up with the cleric that is around my level in the guild and the 2 of us + some dps and a tank are deadly.... very deadly<br />
<br />
Lolanon level 18 shaman of Blackburrow<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh yeah, any class can solo. Preists are low dps for soloing once you get to level 17 or so. Generally soloing I am killing lower con blue, light blue or green mobs. Personally I think for soloing the melee classes probably do it best though as a preist class i can almost guarentee you will never have a problem getting a group. I log in and hit lfg and have a group almost instantly.</div></div><hr />
