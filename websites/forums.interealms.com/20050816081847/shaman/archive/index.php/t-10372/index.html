<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried tonight to explain to our Bsts in the guild that they now are the most pampered class in all of EQ .. i mean come on ... all of the spells minus 2 are vendor bought now! (excluding PoP spells)  i see it coming ...  Forseen for the Future of shaman population everywhere....!!!!   I  Razco Forte of the Ayonae Ro Server predict that SHAMAN spells will be the same .... only two spells will not be vendor bought .. and those spells shall be .... malo and torpor /sigh. <br />

And you didn't think it would cause an argument being introduced in that manner? /boggle<br />
<br />
Class envy. It's a bitch. Get over it. Move on and play your character or go start a Beastlord so you won't feel so left out (your opinion).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nah ... dont think i will ever give up my shaman, it just boggles me on the decisions VI makes.<br />
<br />
I dont expect VI to throw the Shaman class a bone, they never have and never will.  well if ya want to include the CH heal? nope didnt think so, mobs hit way to hard in PoP for that to be of any use, Granted Tnargs on the other hand is good for saving casters.<br />
<br />
by the way, i love getting a rise outta /GU when i start ranting ... you should see the guildleader cringe when i start in on druids.  Mostly for fun, but i wanted the Bsts side of it tonight ... and i received more than i expected. <br />
<br />
Its not class envy, its just upset at VI for another dumb move. Hopefully they will look at the priest class again and make the right moves.</div></div><hr />

Ya might wanna curb that behavior. If the new guild management tool has the functionality I believe it will, you might log on one day to find yourself guildless.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I booted trouble makers out of my guild without a second thought. I'm sure I'm not the only one that doesn't want rabble rousers stirring up trouble and causing discontent in the guild over nothing.<br />
<br />
But hey...your call, your future, your reputation, your consequences. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">VI ceased existing 4 years ago; Sony bought them out before EQ was even released.  That is why the game is good, and yet the people behind it are complete and utter idiots.</div></div><hr />

/agree Valgoth<br />
<br />
It ain't pretty, but I think one of the strengths of my guild is that we don't tolerate members who irritate other guild members for no good reason.<br />
<br />
Hard to build a team when you've got somebody pitting one class against another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, maybe you were grouping with the level 52 shadowknight that bitched about not being able to tank in PoP, but kraggs is sufficient if your tank has been beyond halls of testing.<br />
<br />
Have you ever saw a beastlord solo something beyond tier 1 in PoP? Probably not. Why can shamans solo tier 4 then? Who's the pampered class? Quit complaining that another class is starting to get some respect, and maybe you'll get some too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have you ever saw a beastlord solo something beyond tier 1 in PoP?  <br />
yes.<br />
<br />
but seriously, good for bst. Be happy for em instead.. What doesnt kill you strengthens you (or something like that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I see one non-uber beastlord I know solo in PoV frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grats to  beastlords I say. Those spells were really rare and hard for them to get - even if they had large amounts of plat. Makes my life easier if the beastlord I group with has those spells, so it helps me too. Really, I can't see people saying &quot;hey we've got a beastlord, don't need a shaman&quot;. So why worry?<br />
<br />
Torpor and malo, whilst hard to get, are achievable without being in an uber guild. I see them on the market a few times a month, and if you are a level 60 shaman then you can, if you choose to, take a break from levelling and make some pretty reasonable cash. Sure, they need to be made more common. Its crazy that level 64 or even 65 spells are more common and less expensive. But that's no reason to not fix the problems for beastlords.<br />
<br />
There's a beasty in my guild who's been looking for those spells for two months. I regularly check the bazaar for them, and keep a general eye out. Not seen them once. I fully support this change.</div></div><hr />

I love this guy. <br />

Val , i only rant once in a great while, but its usually non-raiding times and on leisure activities. I do not disrupt guildchat, just like to get a rise once in awhile, and trust me, i get enough of it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">and to be brutally honest there was a good portion of the beastlord community who did not want this change implemented.  This was not a fix for a problem it was a freebie.  The fix would of been to make the drops more available, ala Spirit of Flame and Snow (coincidently we had 1 flame and 2 snows drop off cursed last night).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have no problem with any other class and how they achieve thier spells.<br />
<br />
My only issue is with VI and thier constant denial that Topor/Malo drop at the same rate as all the other lvl60 spells with other classes.  And that relates to Kunark mostly.  If all of those spells truley did then why do all 60 druids have thier spells?  Or almost all of the other classes have thier lvl60 Kunark spells.<br />
<br />
Mind Boggeling.<br />
<br />
But  BLs, doesnt effect me, so I have no opinion on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There were actually only a few who didnt want them vendor sold, and primarily those who were in uber guilds beating down the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
These spells were out of the realm of all but the most hardcore. Uber Guilds arent doing the mobs who dropped em, and most guilds cant. Its not torpor, where anyone who can get 100k can get it in a few weeks time of consistant auctioning. They were spells that for all intents and purposes didnt exist.<br />
<br />
With pop, the other hybrid spells form those drop tables were moved to pok. Beastlord's werent for some reason. They corrected an oversite.<br />
<br />
Some beastlords didnt want them vendor sold, but rather dropped from things like dragons (i'd rather keep those slots open for more malo/torpor heh) or through a quest. Verant chose to do what they did with the other hybrids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You so ripped off my post,<br />
<br />
And mine had a better story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's not just malo and torpor, wizards have a few that are insanely rare, and clerics have a couple as well (the unspoken word?).  Necros too.  <br />
<br />
It's my impression that their spells aren't as core or critical as malo and torpor are to shaman though.<br />
<br />
We've killed 15+ Kunark dragons, many overkings, jumpys, guardian wurms, emporers, etc, and until we shelled out 40k for Malo, I was the only shaman in our guild with malo and torpor.  Still am with torpor.  And I got those about 2 years ago.  <br />
<br />
I'm one of the guys who works to get stuff for others, and those have been hard - not just ours, but I'm more aware of those obviously.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, good for beastlords, but I do still think something isn't right with the Kunark drop tables.</div></div><hr />
