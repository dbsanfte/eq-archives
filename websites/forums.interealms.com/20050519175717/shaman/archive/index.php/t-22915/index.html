<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, i was wandering, if i should keep lvling up my shaman (i remade him, and havent gotten a chance to lvl him so still lvl 1) or make an enc. I like the idea of soloing (i havent tried yet with Ex) and i like being wanted in groups, contributing, and buffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That is not a question we can answer for you really.<br />
<br />
Effectivity is not everything. Everquest is a game, and games are for lesiure. Ask yourself this: Am i enjoying my shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quit now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Play a wizard they rock.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(Smiles) <br />
<br />
Okay real awnser. If you have to ask a bunch of folks that have spent umpteen billion minutes playing the class if it is worth it or not it probably isnt for you.<br />
<br />
Shaman can do everything. But not as well as anyone else. Especially a bard. <br />
<br />
We are generalists in a specialist world. And the world doesnt much like us because we enable a force to move things they shouldnt.<br />

And it was worth it for me.  The combonation of ability and utility in the shaman class before the game became a twitchy arcade mockery of what it once was is unmatched. But those days are long gone my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my shaman was only 13, but i LOVED it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you love it then keep playing. Till you don't love it anymore. The journy should be the reward. Not the destination.<br />
<br />
(Sigh) Just wish I could quit. But of course I don't play like I used to. And havn't logged on in 4 days. So maybe I am taking my own advice.<br />
<br />
I don't see a need to just up and quit I guess I enjoy the game a couple times a week. Maybe more if doing something fun.<br />
<br />
Shaman is fun. And this is coming from a Person who has played a thief to 60 (Luclin era) An Anchanter to 65 and 131 aa On hot box status and occasional main box. And a shadowknight to 65 and 111 AA Pure hot box status.  And Snoww to 65 and 415 AA and My main for close to 3 years.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wow uve been busy Snoww, what do u like more between an enchanter and shaman? i know its stupid to ask, but just asking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman by far. <br />
<br />
Enchanters are too powerful in thier chosen niche. <br />
<br />
Single boxing them was boring to me. Sure there are variables involved Like when is charm going to break, Or is th warrior really stupid enough to hit the mezzed one. But when Pacify got fixed and the age of the single pull took over Pana got shelved fast. I started a Shadowknight to fit into the new need of my guild for a high playtime tank. And got him up in pretty record time. (For a non uber) Then of course When gates came out I was so burnt out I pretty much took 3 months off, and have not come back full time. <br />
<br />
Enchanters are pretty much only fun when **** hits the fan. And the game has progressed beyond adventure and into learn everything as fast as possible and farm it mode. That makes enchanters boring to me. <br />
<br />
I have more fun doing a hard fight witht he shaman and switching roles to tank CC healer damage and Puller with Snoww that I ever had as a thief or enchanter. Despite thier specilist focus. I guess I like being a jack of all trades and master of none. I would have rolled up a druid at some point and tried it but I just couldnt stand hugging trees, and I have seen way too many get it off me druids to ever be one. <br />
<br />
Not to mention In teh face is the best feeling and I almost hate SoE for taking it away from the shaman class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol, ill probly try both to 25, but im 95% sure im going with shaman, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sniff*<br />
<br />
I feel your pain.  Nothing felt better than tanking a turgur'd mob IN TEH FACE in the Kunark age when things went awry.  &quot;In Teh Face&quot; was a phrase I saw in probably one out of every two posts on the Crucible.<br />
<br />
Oh how the mighty have fallen =O<br />
<br />
Like I said before, Exes, it really doesn't matter what you play as long as you stick with it.  You will not get a true feel for a class until you are post 60.  My advice to you is to check the CLASS Message boards (not the official ones, but the ones on the respective sites, as in Steel Warrior or Graffe's Wizard Compendium) on each one to get a feel for how said class functions in late metagame.  Reading a class description in the manual is like asking a blind man for directions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, being a hard working higher level Shaman is less what you do than how you do it.  I say hard working because to get full potential out of Shaman you have to work hard.<br />
<br />
Malos, slow, spot heal, nuke,canny canny, FA, canny, Q, swap out spells, buff, buff, heal, canny canny canny, slow, malos, slow, buff, etc. canny canny, canny5, Q, canny, canny, canny, root.......<br />
<br />
you get the picture.  Its a different sort of playstyle than most other classes if you want to take the class to it's potential. <br />
<br />
But the rewards are significant, making correct strategic decisions that will greatly enhance your group in many different fighting environments and group configurations (not that they will notice, lol).  It's more fun than hitting F1 and watching TV (not that I'm accusing tanks of that - well maybe a little).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you want to get stroked play a chanter, cleric or bard.  Everyone thinks they are the &quot;full hot order&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Exes, since you asked ... IMO:<br />
<br />
You are still pretty new to the game. Whichever class you decide to play, take it slow. Learn the class. That is the biggest fault I see in newer players now - the presumption that 65 is where they have to be and they have to be there yesterday.<br />
<br />
You will see the comment &quot;it is the journey, not the destination&quot; used a lot around here. There is great truth in that. There are so many places you can go and experience first hand at the appropriate level that will simply rock-your-socks with fun and excitement. Each level those places become fewer and fewer.<br />
<br />
As for which class, the truth is you have to make that decision. My suggestion, however, would be shaman. Take your time and learn what shaman can do and when is the best time/place for them to do this-or-that. You won't use all your tools all the time. Figuring out when to use based on the situation at hand is part of the fun.<br />
<br />
Reason I suggest shaman is their greater room for error. Shaman can make mistakes and still recover to live and succeed through an encounter. You will learn a lot from those mistakes. On the otherhand, the margin for error with enchanters is much smaller. While both classes have the tools to recover, the shaman being able to take more damage while getting things back under control is the key. While the details are hard to explain, enchanters are a finesse class and take tons of patience to play to higher levels.<br />
<br />
That is fancy talk - enchanters die a lot. As you level up there will be more deaths from those tanks trying to &quot;help&quot; by attempting to aggro a mob you are mezzing, casters popping off an AE just as you lock down the last add, someones pet getting a proc off just as mez lands ... on and on.<br />
<br />
So I suggest shaman. Not to avoid the pitfalls of an enchanter, but rather to get an experience handle on the game first. You can always make an enchanter later.<br />
<br />
The last reason for shaman over enchanter - shaman can solo or group with equal ease. Early on enchanters are very tough to solo.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thanks, im going with shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Enchanters are far better than shaman. If you decide you want to raid, 1 shaman is enough to do everything.. and even w/o, there are other classes who can do most of their roles. (mage for malosinia, others for slowing).. however w/o a chanter some encounters are not possible unless you have a bunch of bards.. everyone can live w/o fos, but w/o voq it's really hard to raid...<br />
<br />
Also, the power to charm is just incredible. enchanters can do things with their pets shaman can only dream of.. (read try tipt)..</div></div><hr />
