<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grezaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Figured I would share this story from my younger days in the Prexus server.<br />
I went to Crushbone for the first time and was quickly introduced to stupidity. Aparently a couple shadowknights seemed to think the healing classes were just xp sponges and had no real use in Crushbone. They were camped in the throne room of the castle.<br />
I went inside to famailiarize myself with the castle when I saw one of these SKs gettin hit pretty hard. I cast a heal on him and watched as he finished of the Oracle. He then turned to me and instead of saying thank you for the heal, accused me of wanting to KS him. He also threw an OOC out that to watch out for me that I try to steal camps as well as kills. I explained what it was I was doing and he basically said I was lying and repeated the OOC. So anyway needless to say that no one answered my LFG for awhile and had to put up with a few unwarranted comments from others not involved in this incident. After a few minutes I got a tell from this SK.. hey Im sorry can u heal me please. I did not respond.. then got another tell &quot; thanks alot A-hole I died&quot; hmmm ok you died I replied ... so what. His partner managed to get him a rez and another OOC rang out.. &quot;Grezaer is an a-hole DO NOT TRUST HIM&quot;<br />
Sorry this had gone far enough. I cast lev and sow and made my way to top of nearby hill.. with lev up I was able to get to top of castle, as I was sitting there trying to decide if I should leave I agrod one of Dvinn's guards... PERFECT..ITS PAYBACK TIME. I knew I had agro from DVinn and his guards and I started running along the top of the castle. I ran in circles over the throne room. It wasnt long until the SKs now had agro from DVinn... 2 dead sks.<br />
A little while later they were back... round 2.. same results. I was loving it. After round 3 I felt they had enough and quietly left the zone.<br />
I know it wasnt proper conduct for a shaman but I felt it was a justifiable action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL, i would have said it was bad shammy conduct if that SK wasnt such an arse.  I hope they learned their lesson.</div></div><hr />
