<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>daarkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so this is actually my first spell caster at all, I have only played a warrior.  I dont know anything about spells or which skills to develop at all.  Also i cannot find a shaman guild in my starting city (im a troll).  I know this is kinda a broad topic but any help in getting me going would be appreciated.  Any tips in spells i want or whatever.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your pet is not a tank.. you are... remember that =P.... use DD's until 34ish... and get kei.. it makes it go alot faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like every class in the game, you&#8217;re a tank during your first few levels.  Go out and smash things with your weapons.  Since you don&#8217;t have to loot your body until level 10, this works out fairly well.  Also use this time to get to know your spells.  It&#8217;s a great time for experimentation.  <br />
<br />
Shaman go through several stages in their careers.  Your first big breakthrough will be when you get cannibalize.  This will allow you go regain your manna quicker by fueling it with your life essence.  Do a search of this board for cannibalize or canni dancing.  I&#8217;m sure there its also described in the FAQ.  <br />
<br />
Your next threshold will be 34 when you get your first pet.  Your spirit puppy is not a strong pet.  So allowing it to tank will kill it fairly quickly.  But he does a great job of biting the mob&#8217;s butt while you take most of the damage.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the shaman class is not a simple one.  Rangers go for AC and hit point gear because they are tanks.  Druids go for wisdom and manna gear because they are casters.  But shaman can be both, so it&#8217;s a bit more complicated.  If you plan to solo, you&#8217;ll need to get good AC gear and once you start using cannibalize you&#8217;ll need all the hit points you can get, so hit point items are needed as well.  But of course you need a decent manna pool for spell casting, so you may need some wisdom/manna items as well.  <br />
<br />
I&#8217;ll tell you how I played my character when I soloed in my early days as an example of how a shaman can be played.  I would find a zone where there were dark blue mobs that I could single pull and find a safe spot without any mobs to pull to.  After buffing myself up I&#8217;d find a single mob and pull it with my slow spell.  I&#8217;d run back to my safe spot and when the mob started getting close I&#8217;d root it.  While it was rooted I&#8217;d cast one or both of my DOTs on it (Damage Over Time spells).  If the mob was still rooted I&#8217;d sit down to med.  If a DOT wore off before root I&#8217;d reapply it.  When root broke I&#8217;d melee the mob, reapplying my fastest DOT if needed.  With the mob slowed and having hasted myself, the fight would be manageable.  When the mob dropped I&#8217;d heal myself if needed and med or cast cannibalize as needed.  When I got my pet at 34 I&#8217;d summon and buff my pet in my safe spot and have him guard it.  When I returned with a mob I&#8217;d position myself so my spirit puppy was in the back of the mob so his attacks wouldn&#8217;t be dodged. Between the two of us the mobs dropped rather quickly.  <br />
<br />
Something else to remember for when you get your puppy.  Your pet can duel wield from day one.  Just give him two weapons, rusty daggers will do just fine, and he&#8217;ll have more attacks then if you don&#8217;t give him weapons.  If you want to see it for yourself, give him one two different types of weapons, like a dagger and a mace.  If you watch the damage messages you&#8217;ll see that he&#8217;s both piercing and bashing.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />
