<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silverpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got epic tonight.  Handed the scale to the spirit, got my epic.  However , he wouldnt finish the conversation.  Said I must prove myself.  I received the epic anyway, but wondering if anyone has seen this part broken.  I did it exactly like posted, with  no variation.  Nothing skipped.  Freaked me out at first, until I looked in my bag.  Oh well, very happy to have it.  But wondering if anyone has seen him not finish the ending epic conversation.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the walkthru.<br />

<br />
Yeah, there have been other reports of that same problem here lately, so it's not just you.  Leave it to Sony to break something that's been working fine for years. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmmm...i don't recall the spirit dude ever saying anything when i did the final turn in. if i remember correctly i was almost upset when i didn't see the spear on my cursor, untill i looked in my sack and saw it. i did that turn in about, hmmm, 2 years ago i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Silverpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once Rak'Ashiir is dead, loot the &quot;Iksar Scale&quot;. Head to the Spirit Sentinel under the pond in the Emerald Jungle (at location +3685, -640). <br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented his mistake? But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he was the one who initiated its construction. But is its initiation the key? How could we have been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands but that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction. It was the people who chose to follow.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What is lost?' <br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless individuals. Not the single shroud we believed existed. Torsis is now truly cursed for all eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of this. Your sacrifice and spiritual devotion in this matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at the bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis and entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward you with our greatest treasure, the [Spear of Fate].' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What is the Spear of Fate?' <br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah. One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all forms of dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of negative spiritual energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into existence one of these [black holes].' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What of these Black Holes? <br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new black hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire existence. The mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything within its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But one [powerful shaman] stepped forward and struck against Miragul's mantle.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What powerful shaman?' <br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What of the cosmos?' <br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought into existence. This force was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition of will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close to it. In one act of devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a [breach] across the planes.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What of the breach?' <br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in the process. All that was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it. When you strike with it, you must have the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he defeated Miragul's mantle. Thank you, Heyokah. <br />
<br />
You recieve the Spear of Fate: <br />

Never said anything.  Just gave me the spear and got all &quot;never seen ya kid, dont botha me, im work'n here&quot; on me.<br />
<br />
Still, thought I was gonna die when he became indifferent.  Thank goodness I had my backpack open and saw the spear.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A friend of mine couldn't get any text out of the spirit last week when he finished his epic.  He tried over and over and got nothing after turning in his scale, and even petitioned to a GM that it got eaten.  Three hours later, he found his epic in a bag lol.</div></div><hr />
