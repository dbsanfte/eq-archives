<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried to go for my first trial group, guildie cleric invited me, and I got there, asked for some mage summoned focus items form a nearby Cleric, got KEI and waited... and waited.. and waited... <br />
<br />
Cleric disbanded and I asked if he still doing trials with us, he said he was getting rest of group... I wait... and wait... and wait... (I'm extremely impatient ;) )<br />
<br />
Cleric comes back with a Chanter, Wiz, and a bunch of Melee...<br />
<br />
He says he wants me to buff them... I realized that I was pimped out of buffs, by a guildie...  I gate out after buffing with Focus, STA, and AGI, log out with sour taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
Been trying for trials lately, and all I get are people asking me to buff them... what did you guys do?<br />
<br />
And how do you respond to buff beggars?  (Just as a little poll)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Um... If he had been there to be in a trial group with him I would have left without buffs.  I don't mind going and buffing a group if a friend is in it, but thats just really lame what he did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being a sucker is what's keeping you unflagged.<br />
<br />
People are often jerks, guildies no different.  Why would they invite you into the group if they can get buffs for free?  I think you were a fool -- a very nice, very loyal one, true -- for buffing them.  Especially after he shafted you by replacing you.  <br />
<br />
That guy had a ton of nerve.  I would let him know it.  I think you've been warned the kind of behavior you can expect out of him in the future.  If he can take advantage of you, he probably will.  I hope the other people in the group weren't also your guildies, because if they were, you're going to take a lot of abuse in that guild. <br />
<br />
Generally, people who hang around to buff should get firm commitments at worst, and be in the first group to go in if possible, since people often &quot;suddenly have to log off for an emergency&quot; when they've gotten what they want out of you.  So if they said they'd come back and tag you after they passed, it's wiser to count on it NOT happening than happening.  Usually it won't happen.  <br />
<br />
You want to know the most ruthless and practical thing to do?  Put an /AFK tag over your head and don't buff anyone who is not first buffing your group with any missing buffs.  Reasons?  <br />
<br />
First and foremost is that once people have your buffs, they don't need you, and there's precious little charity to go around in the game.  If your first group falls apart, you will have nowhere else to go because you'll have buffed everyone else in the waiting area already.  Who needs you know?  Almost anyone would be better DPS than you.  What's the point of inviting you?<br />
<br />
Second reason is that your buffs actually DO have value.  That's why people want them.  What that value means to you when your buffs are on other groups than your own is that that group has an increased chance of succeeding in the trials.  If they go before you and lose, you wait 10 minutes before the next group can go in.  Not bad!  But, if they succeed, thanks in part to your buffs...now you have to wait 30 minutes for the trials to reset so you can get another shot.  Way to go, buffs!  Thanks for TRIPLING the time I have to wait!  How about if you've buffed three groups?  Well, if they all pass, you've now turned a quick business into an extra full hour of waiting for your shot.  Meanwhile, people will likely come in to form more groups and you'll buff them too, right?  Great -- now let's say your group fails.  You go to the back of the line behind the guys you just buffed.  They win!  Grats you on the extra 20 minutes wait your buffs might have had a very real hand in making possible.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a cold, kinda jerky way of looking at things, eh?  <br />
<br />
Never said it wasn't.  In fact, I always buff everybody.  I do a lot of things not in my best self-interest. <br />
<br />
But...just be aware that it's not always in your best interest.<br />
<br />
And frankly, if you're feeling kinda like you're being taken advantage of by friends, guildies, strangers, whatever...why help them do whatever it is that bugs you or makes you feel mad or left out?  Remember the saying, &quot;familiarity breeds contempt&quot;?  As long as they can get all you have to offer without giving you anything in return, a lot of people will think you're the best thing that ever happened to them, and love to take advantage of you whenever you give the the opportunity.  Maybe you might even enjoy that type of thing; some do.  But they'll appreciate your help and buffs a lot more when they don't have them than when they can just get them for free and then kick our a** out the door with a snicker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm too much of a push-over lol... gullible too, 'case ya didn't notice.<br />
<br />
It's something at least, a lesson I can apply to life (only 16 atm), I crack under pressure, yet I thank people even when they refuse to go out of their way for me.  Something I hope I can break soon =p...<br />
<br />
I'm off to go bribe a Trials group with my DS potions now....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Used as a buff wh... from a guildie? :mad: <br />
<br />
Just be more careful with this cleric  in the future. If it happens again, seriously i would bring it to some officers attention (that is, if cleric isn't open for some habit changes).<br />
<br />
Good luck with your trials - and  be very patient, you will need it ;)</div></div><hr />

Trials 40...Tannus 0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The other night I was in poJ at the graveyard hanging out helping a friend and a few nakid ppl show up.  Big ogre asks me, hey are doing trials?  I told him 'no free buffs sorry' and didn't hear a word from him after.  <br />
<br />
So far the only thing anyone wants from me in poJ is buffs, and I refuse to give them freely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sshiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL, my guild must be unique.  I've been flagged for a couple months and they won't even THINK of doing trials without me in the group that goes in even though I tell them repeatedly that its stupid for me to take up a spot that any other class could fill and contribute more.  I have wasted more damn time on the trials since i passed them then I ever did trying to get flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Until you are flagged never ever ever buff anyone besides your group.  After you are flagged go buff all you want unless another shaman is trying to get through.<br />
<br />
Your buffs are part of what you bring to a group and if they want your buffs then they want you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My buffs are part of what I add to a group. If you'd like my buffs, please group me for a trial run. :D <br />
<br />
............<br />
I can see zero point in buffing a group you're not in, increasing their chances for sucess, which means you get to wait for the trial to reset.<br />
<br />
To help get through the trials, make Damage Shield potions. They do add an extra edge.<br />
When my group won, we had a chanter in the group with project illusion, so we all went in as fire elementals, with Shammie DS, with Chanter DS.<br />
(Just remember to click off the illusion before leaving the trial staging area, the guards outside don't like elementals)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a guildy came to me with an issue like this, and I find out this was the case after speaking with everyone involved, then one out of two things will happen depending on how things went with the offender. 1) Public apology posted on the guild boards, also serves as a warning to everyone else in guild. 2) /guildremove<br />
<br />
As far as buffs go, trade your buffs for enchanter/cleric buffs if your group is lacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This post is a very important illustration of the effects of repeated lackluster expansions on the power of a shaman.  If we had kept pace with other classes, it would not be an issue.  Yes, shaman buffs can help other classes, but in the case of these trials, shamans do not bring enough DPS to the group to be desireable.<br />
<br />
This is as true of the most uber shamans as it is of the rest of us.  When I was getting flagged, Chukzombi's magister group was ahead of us.  It had two shamans in it (pretty sure Mukas was one, can't remember if the other was Chuk or Warren).  Both shamans were decked out with the latest VT gear, both had ancient scourge, etc.  Their group failed at least twice while I was there, maybe even more.<br />
<br />
When I got flagged, the only thing I did was heal and sick my dog on mobs (didn't have the 61 pet then).   My nukes were a waste, slow was barely effective.  We had a wizard and druid nuking, an SK tank, a rogue, and an enchanter for mezzing.  As it was, I was barely able to keep the tank alive with Kragg (didn't have Tnarg), and was unable to save the enchanter.<br />
<br />
I've done a few trials since then to try and help others get through, but found that the best thing I could do to help was buff then get the heck out of the way.  It is gratifying to see a group that almost wins without your buffs be able to win with them, but disturbing that you can't do any more than that to help.<br />
<br />
The fact that the only thing people want from shamans in the PoJ trials is buffs is symptomatic the loss in relative power in the class.  I seriously doubt that LoY will rectify this.  Perhaps the promise of additional priest class balancing by SOE will help out here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It depends on what trials you are doing.<br />
<br />
For exe? Anything but dps is redundant if you get right down to it. However, I've done that trial at least 10 times with various low dps group makeups.<br />
<br />
Picking out one trial where DPS is 95% of all that matters and say shamans are weak in general is misguided at best.<br />
<br />
Try some of the other trials and you'd come up with a whole list of useless classes.</div></div><hr />

Excellent, I was hoping to find some gems of information about trials like this, and I thank anyone who replied regardless, all were helpful.<br />

Going to solo in PoD now... and release my frustrated teen age angst wrath on some Goos and Rats...</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I do think shaman is one of the two weakest classes for doing exe, the other weak one being SK. Shaman is certainly the weakest of the 3 healers for doing exe. Shaman are marathon runners and exe is designed for sprinters. <br />
<br />
  Not that I'm particularly bothered by the fact that my friends aren't asking me (61st lvl) to help em get flagged. Doing exe isn't something I consider fun (mainly because of all the waiting). I'll run over and buff them, maybe camp out there and play an alt in case they wipe and need to be rebuffed. <br />
<br />
I will buff other groups if asked while I'm there. If the other group is weak enough that my buffs are the difference between them winning and loosing then congrats, I'm glad they made it and escaped a time sink.  I'm not even sure that I buy the arguement about having to wait longer. Yes it's an extra 20 minute wait one time, but then again those people won't be getting back in line and trying again. <br />

In that situation, I'd just turn on my LFG flag and go solo somewhere else in PoJ. At least you'd be doing something other than just sitting around and you'd escape the buff beggar.</div></div><hr />

Funny all the things you pick up on shamanhood while mindlessly surfing the boards in your Computer class... (in my case, anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This is why you need faithful friends.  Even if shaman aren't that useful in the executioner trial, it just shows what a low class of human being would do that kind of a thing to you.  I would have to seriously reconsider an affiliation with people like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shammies aren't useless in a specific type of trial group at least.  I was in a group with two magicians, an enchanter, a warrior, a cleric, and myself.  Since there was only one tank I could use torpor to maximum advantage, healing everyone except the tank efficiently with torpor.<br />
<br />
I kept my mana up easily with canni and modrods, and I was able to contribute effectively with spear of torment and my dogdog who was armed with weapons.  It was definitely poor dps compared to the magician damage.  But I also kept the cleric and the casters alive.  I never had to cure slow in my successful trial but that would've been key as well.  I used my DDs when I was full mana, or when the tank called to nuke hard (in case the prisoner was close to dying)-- there was once or twice when it was close and my quick nuke was important in keeping the trial going.<br />
<br />
I slowed the executioner.  That was important in itself.  I don't remember but I might've crippled him too.  I broke out the Spirit Call brigade.  I assisted the cleric with heals, and he went oom, and I continued to heal the tank so that he could last a lot longer.<br />
<br />
Eventually the executioner enraged and I let the tank die just because I ran out of mana and couldn't keep up.<br />
<br />
But the chanter got off the killing nuke and the tank was rezd at the end. hehe.<br />
<br />
This was done at level 61 with kragg's mending and torpor.  I'd imagine it would be even easier with tnarg's at 62.<br />
<br />
Add to that our useful buffage, I would hardly say a shammy was useless.<br />
<br />
I was lucky I guess, it was only my second real attempt (four attempts altogether, two I really tried).<br />
<br />
I would kick a guildy's ass if he did that to me (unless he was apologetic about it-- then I'd just be pissed but I wouldn't kick his ass).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They REALLY must've unnerfed Alchemy... went from 42 Skill to 51 with ONE STACK each of DS potion crap... and made about 12.<br />
<br />
I have new hope for the trials, and guild is getting more involved... (The cleric that used me for buffs was relatively new, and I have a strong bond with some of my guildies, and on good terms with almost all others)</div></div><hr />
