<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As of 1 or 2 patches ago, I began to notice that slow now only affects casters melee attacks, and no longer affects their spell casting.<br />
<br />
It seems to behave just like slowing PCs now.  If you and your wizard friend dueled, and you cast slow on him/her... big deal... they can still sit there and chain nuke you.  If they pulled out their staff and tried to smack you... they would be slowed... but spells are unaffected.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong, and just never noticed before... but in the past, whenever you slowed a NPC caster... it would slow down their spell casting rate as well.<br />
<br />
For arguments sake...<br />
<br />
Lets say NPC_Wizard attacks you every 1 second.   Every 1 second the wizard can either cast, or melee.  It might look something like this:<br />
<br />
1s = nuke<br />
2s = nuke<br />
3s = root<br />
4s = melee<br />
5s = melee<br />
6s = nuke<br />
7s = melee<br />
8s = snare<br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
Random... melee or spell every 1 second.<br />
<br />
Now lets say... after you slow the wizard, they attack every 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
1s = nuke<br />
5s = melee<br />
10s = nuke<br />
15s = root<br />
20s = melee<br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
Now it appears... that slow only affects the melee speed... and not the spell casting speed.<br />
<br />
1s = nuke<br />
2s = nuke<br />
3s = nuke<br />
4s = nuke<br />
5s = melee<br />
6s = nuke<br />
7s = nuke<br />
8s = nuke<br />
9s = nuke<br />
10s = melee<br />
<br />
(note: I realize that they can't cast a spell every 1s because of cast times and such, times used are only for example purposes)<br />
<br />
This of course makes NPC casters much much more of a problem than they were before this.<br />
<br />
Can anyone else confirm this?  At first I thought I was imagining it... and forgot to slow or something... but now others seem to be seeing the same thing.<br />
<br />
Did this just go in with the last patch? Or the one before?  I could have sworn that slow always affected casters.   Maybe it didn't, and I'm just not realizing it (which is kinda sad if true, but oh well).<br />
<br />
I guess in theory this is the way it should be... this is how it works on PCs.   Still not a nice thing to slip in un-announced.</div></div><hr />

It's always been this way, slow has never affected casting speed, only melee speed.<br />
<br />
Maybe the AI of the mobs has changed so that they chain cast spells faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, Slow always only affected Attack speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe it's the LDON AI then... I don't know.   I'm suprised I haven't noticed this before... I played an enchanter alot as a primary slower, and now the shaman.   <br />
<br />
Maybe it is the AI... but in LDON I notice it a ton... especially on those druid type casters.<br />
<br />
Come to think about it, it was after LDON opened that I started to notice this.  Then again, maybe it was just a few mobs that happened to randomly chain cast more than others.<br />
<br />
Oh well, at any rate... not a &quot;fix&quot; or nerf, always been that way.  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A slowed mob will have a slowed down melee, so since melee is slower, the time between casts can be slowed down.<br />

I understand what you're saying Xev, but this isn't what I'm observing now.   Especially in the LDON missions, Tak druids for sure, when you slow them, they will chain cast spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So.. should I take it that slowing those caster mobs will actually increase their dps, since they will no longer bother to melee?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't know... maybe this isn't as bad as I think it is... otherwise I feel more people would have probably brought this up already.<br />
<br />
I suppose... potentially so... if a mob can't melee as much, it could chain cast more.<br />
<br />
But on the flip side... if you keep your MR/FR/CR up... you'll resist most spells at least partially... most magic stuff doesn't hit me now as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Slows have never affected casting times.  I think what you are seeing is just a side result of the improved caster AI that went in several patches ago.  Mobs are much better about stripping your buffs, malo/tashing, using lures, etc.<br />
<br />
Nowadays I'd rather face a straight up warrior mob than a wizard type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I love caster mobs when I have my pet and couple meele's with me.  Pretty much once engaged they spend 1/2 thier time trying to get a spell off and doing zero damage.  I've learned a handy trick though here reading about casters and pulling though.  If you hit a caster with a DOT instead of pulling with slow they tend (70%ish) to charge at you instead of opening up with a spell cast on you.  If you quickly block thier line of sight to you they will run all the way to you instead of casting.  Once meele engage thier casting ablity will be interuppted most times due to meele push.</div></div><hr />
