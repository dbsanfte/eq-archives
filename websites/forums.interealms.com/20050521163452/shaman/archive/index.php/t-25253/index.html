Backflagging *<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
As you know, when a guild gains or loses members, they often find themselves dedicating a large amount of time re-playing content that they have long since completed in order to gain access to zones for newer members.  During our Community Summit this last summer, and in many subsequent discussions, we have heard the recurring desire to find a way to ease the frustrations associated with this backflagging.<br />
<br />
While the issue is not as simple as removing flags altogether (we feel flags are necessary for the zones they are currently attached to), we have looked into ways that we can reduce the frustrations of backflagging and feel that we have arrived at a fair and equitable solution, which is detailed below.<br />
<br />
- A new implementation of the 85/15 rule has been introduced into Planes of Power zones including the Plane of Time.  This should resolve the outstanding problems that occur from time to time with the current 85/15 implementation.<br />
<br />
- The new 85/15 has also been introduced for the locked zones in Gates of Discord.<br />
<br />
- An alternate means of flagging guild mates for locked content in Planes of Power and Gates of Discord has been implemented that will allow you to flag raid members for the zone you are in by completing raid content within that zone.  <br />
<br />
The implementation varies slightly from zone to zone to fit the story and nature of the zone, but in general will involve killing a raid target within that zone, looting an item, and completing a single group quest to change that item into a zone flag.  This only applies to zones that don't already have a single group task or system to gain access.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AA Changes<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
- Reduced the cost of many Gates AAs.  Players will receive a refund equal to the difference on AAs that now have a lower cost. *<br />
<br />
- Changed the monk AA Crippling Strike to an activated ability that does an eagle strike attack as well as a snare.  <br />
<br />
- Changed the monk AA Stunning Kick to an activated ability that does a round kick attack as well as a stun.<br />
<br />
- Changed the monk AA Eye Gouge to an activated ability that does a tiger claw attack as well as reduces the targets offensive ability.  <br />
<br />
- Due to major changes in how these work, AA points for Crippling Strike, Stunning Kick, and Eye Gouge have been refunded. <br />
<br />
- Reduced the reuse time of the Ranger AAs Frost Arrow and Flame Arrow to 3 minutes. *<br />
<br />
- Hobble of Spirits will now stack with the Beastlord's proc buffs. *<br />
<br />
- Fixed problem with the Beastlord AA Bestial Alignment where if you had maxed buffs this AA would not reset if it did not take. <br />
<br />
- Duration enhancement focuses and AAs should now increase the duration of pet buffs.<br />
<br />
- If your stored AA's go above 30, they will no longer be set to 30 when you zone. However, you should still not be able to gain more than 30 unless you get a refund, get the AA from a GM, or get an AA from a script. *<br />
<br />
- Fixed an issue with Half Elf Paladins of Tunare and the Origin AA. *<br />
<br />
- If your character was created before EQ started storing starting location data, when you log into the game you will now be prompted to choose your home city from a list of valid starting locations for your character.  You will only need to do this once and once this has been set, it cannot be changed.  This will correct the problems with the Origin AA not returning some characters to their expected home city.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone and NPC Changes<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
- Hot Spots have been moved (level ranges are approximate): *<br />
 Shadeweaver’s Thicket 1-30<br />
 Kurn’s Tower 10-25<br />
 Unrest 15-30<br />
 Crystal Caverns 25-35<br />
 Solusek’s Eye 25-45<br />
 Katta Castellum 30-60<br />
 Lower Guk 35-55<br />
 Nagafen’s Lair 40-55<br />
 Umbral Plains 50-60<br />
<br />
- Respawn time for the bosses in Tacvi has been increased from 3 to 5 days.<br />
<br />
- Some Tacvi loot has been upgraded.  Bosses now drop more items per kill and some all new items have been added to the zone. *<br />
<br />
- An alternate entrance into Tacvi has been added in Txevu that will allow guilds to bypass the Zun’Muram after they have defeated him at least once.  Guilds that have previously defeated the Zun’Muram will need to do so at least once more before they can use the new entrance. *<br />
<br />
- Gilipus of Ak`Anon has joined the Beta Neutral Faction.  You will now be able to complete his quest without having to raise Gem Choppers Faction. <br />
<br />
- The 3 Tormentors in the Jelvan event now share hatelist when idle or aggro.  Anyone that is on one Tormentor's hatelist, but not on the other 2 Tormentor's hatelist will be added.  This should make it difficult (if not impossible) to avoid AOEs.<br />
<br />
- Modified the Warden Hanvar event, all guards should appear in their appointed places.<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug in Anguish that could make Warden Hanvar unkillable.<br />
<br />
- Clicking on the door to Anguish while having the Seal: Mastery of All on your person will now prompt red text indicating your flag has been granted.<br />
<br />
- The respawn of Globes of Discordant Energy are now tracked on the event timer for Anguish.  The method for obtaining the Globes has not changed.<br />
<br />
- The pile of stones that was used as a secondary zone between Dranik and Bloodfields has been removed.  There is now an actual zoneline there.<br />
<br />
- Plane of Justice - previously, you could not click the red teleports to leave the Seventh Hammer's room unless the Seventh Hammer was dead (or not up).  This has been changed so you can leave the room as long as it is not aggro.  If you click on a portal while he is aggro, you should get a message and remain in the room. <br />
<br />
- Grennet Stormhand in North Qeynos is no longer a task master since he is part of a quest.  His task master job has been taken over by Jorren Boxmover.<br />
<br />
-  Increased the maximum duration for all Labyrinth Trials from 1 hour to 2 hours.  When an event is successfully completed, the instance will shut down in 30 minutes.  If it is failed, the instance will shut down in 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
- Changed the reclusive Girplan event in Bloodfields so that each NPC in the sequence stays up for 15 minutes instead of 3 minutes before depopping.<br />
<br />
- Elemental NPCs are once again Charmable in Bastion of Thunder.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

- Arly Golyeck in Paludal caverns will now accept bribes from half-elves, or those that are in half-elven illusion while also wearing a Burnoose of the Halfbreed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tradeskill Changes<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
- The Tradeskill window will now allow up to 500 favorites (up from 100). *<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- Fixed a few grammatical issues with the &quot;Forge of Icewell Arms&quot; book.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Item, Spell, Discipline and Skill Changes<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
- Auto range attack implemented, no longer will it be necessary to range attack manually - /autofire is a toggle command that will fire your ranged weapon until you run out of ammunition, turn on autoattack to switch to melee combat, or use the /autofire command again. *<br />
<br />
- /melody ability implemented for bards - To use /melody, type /melody &lt;song#&gt; &lt;song#&gt; &lt;song#&gt; &lt;etc&gt;. The numbers are the same numbers you would use for the /cast command. The melody will repeat the songs in the specified order until a note is missed due to an interruption. *<br />
<br />
- Modified Mirrored Mask, so it is no longer no rent and poof on death, however the click effect only works inside Anguish.<br />

<br />
- Fixed a bug with the Frenzy of Conquest benefit.<br />
<br />

<br />
- Changed the Mark of Justice to take the player's group instead of just the player when attempting to engage The 7th Hammer. *<br />
<br />
- Cryston, Staff of the Riftnow has the focus of Quickening of the Ikaav.<br />
<br />

<br />
- Bards will stop playing songs when feign death effects hit them (some NPC encounters do this). <br />
<br />
- Players are no longer able to have Form of the Great Bear and a mount on at the same time.<br />
<br />
- Holyforge will now increase your chance to slay undead, and if you have the Slay Undead AA you will have an even greater chance of a slay with Holyforge. *<br />
<br />
- The spell Nature's Blight was not increasing the damage as stated and should be working as intended now. *<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug with haste items and haste augments. Their effects were stacking when they shouldn't have.  It will now only take the greatest haste effect from the item including augments.<br />
<br />
- When combining the aegis of chaotic worship with the soul temper and a flask of water, you will receive the temper and the aegis of chaotic worship back if you don't have the correct flags instead of just the aegis back.<br />
<br />
- The Monk's feign death success rate has been improved.  It was previously capped at 95% at 100 skill and now it ramps up the success rate for higher skill levels. *<br />
<br />
- Fixed several inconsistencies with pets affected by focus items.<br />
<br />
- Increased the mana regen gained by Elemental Simulacrum.<br />
<br />
- Touch of the Devourer was changed to allow partial damage when it is resisted.  This is an increase in the overall damage of the spell.<br />
<br />
- New items are available on the PvP point merchants. *<br />
<br />

 Hastening of the Ikaav <br />
 Quickening of the Ikaav<br />
 Alacrity of the Ikaav<br />
<br />
-  Increased the potency of Pure Spirit. <br />
<br />
- Nature's Balance should now only remove beneficial spells from the target.<br />
<br />
- Removed the scaling focus mods from the following spells:<br />
 Force of Ikkibi<br />
 Order of Trushar<br />
 Sylvan Anger<br />
 Taelosian Geomancy<br />
 Burning Night<br />
 Anger of Taelosia<br />
 Sylvan Kindle<br />
 Clear Fire<br />
<br />
- The the class-specific quest chest armors from Omens of War now have a .8 second cast time.<br />
<br />
- The pre-nerf LDoN armor sets can now be sold back to the merchants, like other LDoN items.  They are the versions with two type 2 slots and one type 3 slot (instead of one each of types 1, 2, and 3).  These items are those with the following in the item name:<br />
 Royal Attendant * of Sand<br />
 Incorporeal * of the Specter<br />
 Mucus-Drenched *<br />
 Immortal's Bloodied *<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
- Multiple procs on a pet are now working properly. *<br />
<br />
- A resource leak in the graphics engine was corrected and we have seen a measurable improvement in client stability as a result.<br />
<br />
- The sky system now influences the ambient lighting.<br />
<br />
- Animated traps such as the ones in soldunga/b are now detected by the collision system and will cause a small amount of damage.<br />
<br />
- You can once again target things on the other side of a water surface and other passable surfaces.<br />
<br />
- Added code to check and validate specialization skills. If the values are not legal, the player will be informed why they are not legal and they are reset.<br />
<br />
- Added popup confirmation dialog when you attempt to give an augmented item to an NPC. *<br />
<br />
- Added optional parameters to /book command -- /book open, /book close. *<br />
<br />
- Fixed bug where a player who had more than 2 million plat in his inventory was unable to purchase anything from a vendor or trader.<br />
<br />
- /yell messages are no longer displayed if the yelling player is in your ignore list. *<br />
<br />
- Some models that were scaled dramatically could cause the collision system to fail, resulting in warps to ceiling and other strange side effects. For example the vases in dranikcatacombsa at 1000,-1011, 0 would always cause players to be pinned to the ceiling due to this bug.<br />
<br />
- Players standing on the lip of an edge should now slide down off them more smoothly. <br />
<br />
- There have been some optimizations to the collision system. You should see improved performance in zones with very large stationary objects (potimea, bloodfields, etc).<br />
<br />
- Fixed a number of small bugs in the zoom camera behavior.  These fixes include removing the possibility of having the first mousewheel click causing the camera to bounce back into first person, a bug that could cause the camera to get stuck “one click” out of first person, as well as smoothing out the camera motion a bit.<br />
<br />
- Scrolling to third person and tabbing to another window should no longer cause the screen to bounce back and forth.<br />
<br />
- Summoning mounts in certain places should no longer cause players to fall through geometry. <br />
<br />
- Getting out of water should be much easier to do. *<br />
<br />
- Mounts are no longer dismissed when zoning. *<br />
<br />
- Spell scribe timers (putting a new spell into the spell book) now take only 1 second.<br />
<br />
- Players should no longer experience 20k falls when standing on cliff edges while suffering from low frame rate. <br />
<br />
- The bounding radius for small races was too tall, preventing them from accessing some areas. For example, gnomes couldn't enter the small huts in Steamfont. This was a global problem that is now fixed; that is just one example.<br />
<br />
- Weather effects are now working properly when the Wake of Karana spell is used. Additionally, sounds related to starting &amp; stopping of various weather types due to zoning and Wake of Karana should be working correctly.<br />
<br />
- /who commands now display both class title and base class name for players over level 50, e.g. &quot;Bedazzler (Enchanter)&quot; *<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused a lot of writing to the dbg.txt file during a raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone Revamps - Mistmoore (Legends)<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
In Mistmoore's Catacombs, the servants of the Trueborn, a sect of vampires with Mayong Mistmoore's blood flowing through their veins, grew tired of their masters throwing them into the fray against the Norrathian intruders.  They came to desire more power for themselves.  <br />
<br />
It was not long before the first words of dissension crept through the catacombs on the will of whispers.  The Trueborn servants congregated in dark, musty halls away from the eyes of their masters and over time their numbers grew along with their ambitions.  Their time had come and soon they would rise up to claim their rightful place in Mistmoore Castle, gaining accolades from Lord Mayong Mistmoore himself for their brilliance and bravery -- or so they supposed.<br />
<br />
Over several months, the Trueborn traitors recruited an army to their cause. On a black night as the moon was swallowed by a thick veil over Faydwer, they struck, killing their masters and leading their army toward Mistmoore Castle.  They slaughtered all in their path and many masters of the Scions sect, the Trueborn's rival blood-children of Mayong, were destroyed that night.<br />
<br />
The fierce wave of the lesser Trueborn rushed into the cellars of Mistmoore Castle without detection.  Unbeknownst to all but the servants, Norrath's adventurers had uncovered winding caves beneath the surface that bypassed the castle’s defenses. In a matter of hours, the castle was overrun and the servants of the Trueborn declared themselves the true Children of Mistmoore.<br />
<br />
Since taking control of the castle, many Children have busied themselves repairing the damage from the battle while others continue to seek the magical ore that was uncovered in the catacombs.  <br />
<br />
They all prepare, waiting for the day their master returns to grant them glory.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone Revamps - Splitpaw (Legends)<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Farsoth Mal, son of the Ishva Mal, leader of the Verishe Mal tribe, sat by his father’s side watching him rule his minions in Splitpaw Lair.  His father may have conquered this lair some years ago, but Farsoth believed they should rule far more than just one underground kingdom.  He grew to despise his father for his lack of ambition and many hours were spent in bitter arguments between the two.  The Ishva Mal grew tired and angry at the ceaseless challenges to his authority, gaining as much contempt for his son as his son had for him.<br />
<br />
During a particularly heated argument of growls and grisly barks, the Ishva Mal reminded his willful son that his power was absolute and that he shared his throne with no one.  With one quick motion, the Ishva Mal brandished his spear and sliced off his son's paw, determined that he would finally win the respect he deserved from his son. But the Ishva Mal's cruel methods would prove to be his downfall.<br />
<br />
The Ishva Mal grew to be a greater tyrant each day, so much so that the Verishe Mal mages and warriors secretly formed the Council of Nine to challenge his rule.  Farsoth saw the plans the Verishe Mal had in store for his father, but did nothing to stop them and instead chose to use them to his advantage.<br />
<br />
Farsoth learned much from the council's mages and became obsessed with the summoning arts they practiced.  His fascination eventually led to a plan that would secure the throne . . . for him.  <br />
<br />
Through all he'd learned from the Verishe Mal mages, he believed he could summon a powerful entity from the Plane of Fire itself.  Farsoth thought with such power at his side, nothing could stop him from ruling the Splitpaw Lair and any lands he desired.  <br />
<br />
He prepared for weeks, researching and gathering the reagents he required and finally he set to work to summon a terrible beast to bring an end to his father's rule.  <br />
<br />
Farsoth was distracted by his own anger, forgetting vital components as he wove the spell and the unthinkable happened.  Flames shot out of the portal that Farsoth opened and, at the same time, rocks rained down upon the inhabitants of the lair.  Then, the portal shifted its focus and water flooded into the corridors, extinguishing the flames and washing away the rocks. The portal shimmered once more and waves of all types of elementals poured into Splitpaw.<br />
<br />
Farsoth certainly attained part of his goal.  His father was killed, but so to were most of the gnolls he wished to lead to greatness.<br />
<br />
Now he is a prisoner to the swarms of enraged elementals that have made Splitpaw Lair their new home.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
glad /book open and /book close are added !   laf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And my take on it:<br />
<br />
An alternate means of flagging guild mates for locked content in Planes of Power and Gates of Discord has been implemented that will allow you to flag raid members for the zone you are in by completing raid content within that zone.<br />
Nice. I still think there needs to be a easible single group quest to enter all content you do not strictly need a raid for but this is a good change.<br />
<br />
Reduced the cost of many Gates AAs.  Players will receive a refund equal to the difference on AAs that now have a lower cost.<br />
Late but nice (and needed).<br />
<br />
If your stored AA's go above 30, they will no longer be set to 30 when you zone. However, you should still not be able to gain more than 30 unless you get a refund, get the AA from a GM, or get an AA from a script.<br />
This was overdue. Hopefully they will work on not losing items on your mouse pointer when you zone next.<br />
<br />
Hot Spots have been moved (level ranges are approximate): *<br />
 Shadeweaver’s Thicket 1-30<br />
 Kurn’s Tower 10-25<br />
 Unrest 15-30<br />
 Crystal Caverns 25-35<br />
 Solusek’s Eye 25-45<br />
 Katta Castellum 30-60<br />
 Lower Guk 35-55<br />
 Nagafen’s Lair 40-55<br />
 Umbral Plains 50-60<br />
In order:<br />
Never leveled there.<br />
Like it needed to give more exp.<br />
Classic.<br />
Thumbs up. Love that zone.<br />
More Lava deaths, yay.<br />
More falling deaths, yay.<br />
Killing frogs is good.<br />
Killing giants is bad - they worship Rallos too.<br />
Nothing can help that zone as far as exping goes.<br />
<br />
I like the general hot spot idea but I think it needs to change more often and be in the in-game-MOTD. Does anyone know how much extra exp hot spots give?<br />
<br />
An alternate entrance into Tacvi has been added in Txevu that will allow guilds to bypass the Zun’Muram after they have defeated him at least once.  Guilds that have previously defeated the Zun’Muram will need to do so at least once more before they can use the new entrance.<br />
Good Change.<br />
<br />
Modified the Warden Hanvar event, all guards should appear in their appointed places.<br />
Fixed a bug in Anguish that could make Warden Hanvar unkillable.<br />
VERY good.<br />
<br />
Added a &quot;Fully Charged Gnomish Vanishing Device&quot; to the game.<br />
This gives improved invis, right? If so the cheering from clerics and paladins might cause servers to be unstable for quite a while.<br />
<br />
Auto range attack implemented, no longer will it be necessary to range attack manually - /autofire is a toggle command that will fire your ranged weapon until you run out of ammunition, turn on autoattack to switch to melee combat, or use the /autofire command again.<br />
Especially when combined with this.<br />
<br />
/melody ability implemented for bards - To use /melody, type /melody &lt;song#&gt; &lt;song#&gt; &lt;song#&gt; &lt;etc&gt;. The numbers are the same numbers you would use for the /cast command. The melody will repeat the songs in the specified order until a note is missed due to an interruption.<br />
And this.<br />
<br />
No-rent containers no longer poof on login if they contain items. They instead change into an unenchanted container with the same number of slots, and a chat message notifies the player.<br />
Cute change that.<br />
<br />
Holyforge will now increase your chance to slay undead, and if you have the Slay Undead AA you will have an even greater chance of a slay with Holyforge.<br />
This only took about 12 years. Better late then never I guess.<br />
<br />
Increased the focus % of the following effects: <br />
 Hastening of the Ikaav <br />
 Quickening of the Ikaav<br />
 Alacrity of the Ikaav<br />
Nice, good, great, fantastic. Love more spell haste.<br />
<br />
Increased the potency of Pure Spirit. <br />
 :) <br />
<br />
A resource leak in the graphics engine was corrected and we have seen a measurable improvement in client stability as a result.<br />
If this is the bug that caused me to to have less frames per second after each zoning I will join above cheering.<br />
<br />
Animated traps such as the ones in soldunga/b are now detected by the collision system and will cause a small amount of damage.<br />
About time too!<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that caused a lot of writing to the dbg.txt file during a raid.<br />
Yes! I hated that one, glad it is gone.<br />
<br />
Overall I like the patch a lot, some very nice fixes in there.</div></div><hr />

Just in case I missed something, I hit Babblefish.  I had it translate Rytan's message from English to German, then from German to Italian and finally from Italian to English.

Rytan said no such thing, he addressed one issue that there was a question about and gave an answer to stop people from having to speculate if dual wield went in.<br />
<br />
Belive me, more than most people i'd be looking forward to dual wielding making it live for our pets.  I'm the one who brought it up at the new orleans fan faire even.<br />

But I think any shaman between about lvl 55 and lvl 70 with most of their OoW spells and about 200 AAs is really struggling.<br />

I also would like to see a dual wielding pet.  The best solution would be to allow us to summon weapons.  I do not expect that to happen.  I expect we will get an innately dual-wielding pet that will cause too much agro so we will either have to be real late in slowing in groups, do less damage than now, or not use pet.</div></div><hr />

anyway, perhaps you should have just admited you put words in the guys mouth and let it be. merely made clear what he said not true. you gave your opinion of what he ment by what he said, which is a huge differance from clerifying what he said.  the main differance being, he didn't mean what you said he ment when he said it or he would said it.

If you fail to see the problems with changing code, then the shortcoming is yours.<br />
<br />
I, too am a coder. We have many excuses for bad/poorly managed code<br />
<br />
It is all entirely dependent on how the shaman pet is coded in.<br />
is it well defined single segment in the code?<br />
is it object oriented?<br />
Does it use the standard internal API?<br />
<br />
god, so many different questions.<br />
<br />
And with all the pressure to get code out the door, cleaning the code into a proper legible manner is not always so easy.<br />

If changing our pet is so complicated, how about put it into same code as the normal pet code?<br />

I know it may sounds too much to ask for as they never agree we are the true pet class but thats what I hope for a long time when those pet item/aa came out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Rytan,<br />
<br />
I really would like an explination on how this is true?<br />
The pet dual wield change ended up being a bit more complicated then I originally anticipated so it didn't make it in this patch. We do still plan on doing so in the near future.<br />
<br />
Ok, I can see that working on stuff that wasn't promised and for classes that aren't shaman can make it difficult to find the time to what WAS promised.  Comeon Rytan, do better than that.  At least admit it that you were putting it off until you got /sing and /autobow working right.  I am just a bit disappointed in you this time (and I'm not really one to bash on you).<br />
<br />
Even if the duel wield was somehow difficult, you could have at least put half of what was promised at the fan faire.  The pet HP increase is a VERY easy thing to have implemented.  Hell, you could have done that part 5 minutes before the patch was scheduled.  Why did you even hold the fan faire if you're not going to implement the ideas that you fish for and promise to do?<br />
<br />
Communication is not a one way street of us /bish about what's wrong with our characters.  I totally realize not everything is possible nor desired by SoE to be implemented.  Other classes have received a 'class definition'.  Shamans had one back when another company owned EQ.  Despite our efforts to find out WHAT it is, you STILL have not provided us with one, and as shown with your total lack of concern with what you promised during the fan faire, you still don't know what you want the class to do either.<br />
<br />
Can we please, somehow, find out?  It's not much to ask, honestly.  And if you are going to put 'canned' answers out there like that, why did you post?  I'm not asking for the game to become unbalanced for shaman, but a 2.0-2.5k hit point pet is less than a speed bump, hell there are probably over 50 mobs out there that can kill it with ONE normal hit (even not counting a proc).  Where is that balanced?</div></div><hr />

I think Rytan is damned if he does, and damned if he doesn't by some of you on here. I am amazed (yes, frankly amazed) that he posts here at all. If I was his manager I would try and keep him away from the posters on here due to the level of rudeness that is often displayed using his name.<br />
<br />
So, he came here and said that it was harder to implement than he first thought and it would happen at a later date. From that you assume full knowledge of his intelligence, abilities, workload, etc, and are able to deduce that he sucks at his job and should be shot.<br />
<br />
Because I chose to disagree with your clearly obnoxious post you then continue in your Sherlock Holmes type fashion and profess hope that I have a fast food type job. Amazing.<br />
<br />
Many years of software development has taught me one thing at least...... the uninformed laypeople are the only people who really think things occur in a simplistic fashion. Often those that bemoan the amount of work it &quot;should&quot; take to perform a task have no clue whatsoever about the true underlying actions that need to be performed.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you stop assuming that Rytan is awful at his job and take a year or ten to get some hardcore software development under your belt, build a few applications slightly more difficult than &quot;Hello world/mom/dad/dog&quot; and suffer the pangs and angst that angry customers seem to throw out the second something happens they don't like, you will feel differently.<br />
<br />
I have walked a few hundred miles in Rytans shoes and feel empathy towards him. I assume (something I shouldn't) that SoE who pay him to come in and work for them see value in his work and that is why they continue to employ him. Why should we collectively here at the crucible feel comfortable slating him personally and professionally based on what we perceive as his only job when it might just be the tip of the iceberg.<br />

So because you feel his pain as a programmer..you think that he is doing a good job.  If you think it would be a good idea for his manager to not let him know that he isn't doing a very good job...then you probably aren't a manager either.  <br />
<br />
Recap for the slow. <br />
<br />
Over a month ago, he says it will be in the next patch.<br />
Patch comes, no changes.<br />
He pops in and says it was too hard, will be sometime in the future.<br />
<br />
You think job done because being a programmer is hard...<br />
<br />
Oh, if this was the first time he has been useless to the Shaman class, then it would be different.  He has shown is lack of ability multiple times.</div></div><hr />

I'll answer this one and then maybe we can let it drop?<br />
<br />
I didn't say he's doing a great job. I said I can empathise with the trials and tribulations a programmer has to go through on huge development efforts because I have that background. I said it would be silly to assume that we know everything.<br />

The Hit point numbers I mentioned at Fan Faire were off the top of my head, and ended up being wrong (which is one of the major reasons I avoid mentioning specific values when I don't have them in front of me).  The actual max HP for Farrel's Companion should be 2900 HP, which is the same as the level 68 SK pet, Son of Decay.  The SK pet originally got a larger then average upgrade with Invoke Death at 64, by virtue of it being a shared necro spell.  That particular pet picked up a larger increase then normal as it was the first 50+ pet, and that increase carried over when the SKs picked it up at 64.<br />
Therefor, I've also upped the HP on True Spirit to match the HP on the Invoke Death pet at 2600 (it was previously ~2100).<br />

That is what Rytan has been saying from the beginning. Heck you even said so yourself.<br />
<br />
From Rytan's first post on this thread:<br />
The pet dual wield change ended up being a bit more complicated then I originally anticipated so it didn't make it in this patch.  We do still plan on doing so in the near future.<br />
<br />
From your first post on this thread:<br />
The 'harder than expected' excuse is getting old.<br />
<br />
Why you even bother to complain about a delay in fixing a minor annoyance to shamans when there are so much more important issues to adress is beyond me.  I mean it is not like it is hard to have valid anti-Rytan complaints as a shaman, yet you feel the need to insult anyone who thinks that we can indeed live one more patch with rusty daggers, especially when we actually get a fair reason for the delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">The ~500 damage the pet does on most mobs during their short lifetime in groups isn't worth the mana to cast it anyway.  I think I used my lower level pets more often, because I'd sploit pull named through walls and stuff.<br />
<br />
Then again, from a company that blatantly carbon copies EVERYTHING, I can't see how it's hard to copy a pet that dual wields. I mean I can give you the algorithm Rytan uses for new spells:<br />
<br />
1. Iterate over each class<br />
  a. Iterate over each spell/ability for the last 5 levels<br />
     I. Iterate over each spell stat<br />
      if spell == ancient spell<br />
       stat &lt;- stat * 1.2<br />
      else<br />
       stat &lt;- stat * 1.1<br />
      <br />
<br />
Then pick and choose which ones you want.  When the level cap is raised, put disappointing level limitations on effects and spells.<br />
<br />
Face it, it just wasn't a priority for them to fix the pet.  I probably would have made the same decision in their place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Guys you don't know what is involved in the change.  Developers have deadlines to make, and just as importantly testing time (internal) to make those deadlines.  <br />
<br />
Rytan made a guestmate as to how hard it would be and then later on found out his guestimate was wrong.  Releasing things untested is about the worse error you can do, so rather than do this change - 5 mins before the patch goes live - it is held over.  <br />
<br />
As a developer myself I despise making last minute changes, releasing things untested, doing things without a chance to look at the concequences.  In a product as complex as EQ what seems to be a trivial change to us, may have significant concequences in many other areas.  <br />
<br />
What about when NPC's use the same spell, increasing the power of the pet makes the NPC's who use it tougher.  That changes the complexion of any encounter that involves this spell (OK, in this case I don't know of shaman NPC's who summon our pets)<br />
It may be a formula that calculates the Pets hp and damage is dependent on a class value (i.e. shaman are 0.8, chanters are 0.9, etc) as well as the leve of the spell, and a modifier per spell.  it may be that the pets atk, hp, damage and ac are all linked to an underlying value and changing that changes all of them.  <br />
Heck, the Ukun pets summoned by Maastruq/Ikaav might be affected by this change.  <br />
<br />
When a developer says that is's not as simple or as easy as he first though that's what he means.  Cut the man some slack.</div></div><hr />

Is it minor though?  I mean what else are they looking at for our class?  This was something they were finally going to fix and now...it goes back into the someday pile.  Maybe a minor inconvenience..but still a really stupid one.  The fact that a level 70 Shaman is still having to use rusty daggers to get his pet to dual wield is just beyond me.  Also, the fact that the numbers he said originally have been cut doesn't surprise me either.  I guess it is just frustration.  If I thought that instead of working on this they were going to work on some more important issue..I wouldn't mind at all.  However, can you really tell me that they are looking at more important issues for our class right now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rytan doesn't HAVE to come post here and keep us informed of the status of our issue. I always appreciate when any of the developers post here, but why would they want to when this is the response? This direct dialogue with an SOE developer is so valuable, I don't understand why so many people would try to sabotage it.<br />
<br />
I was at the Fan Faire when Rytan talked about making pets dual wield, there was no expectation of when the change would be implemented. In this thread, he doesn't say it's a back burner item of no importance, he says he's still working on it! <br />
<br />
Stop with the unjustified, rude comments and insulting, false  &quot;translations&quot; or I'm locking this thread.<br />
<br />
Hey Rytan, thanks for the info, I do appreciate it when you take the time to keep us informed.

Huh? Where did I say or imply that? Mind you, I would rate about half of this patch as more important then me lugging around a couple of daggers or hassling a mage. Such as:<br />
<br />
An alternate means of flagging guild mates for locked content in Planes of Power and Gates of Discord has been implemented that will allow you to flag raid members for the zone you are in by completing raid content within that zone.<br />
Reduced the cost of many Gates AAs. Players will receive a refund equal to the difference on AAs that now have a lower cost.<br />
A resource leak in the graphics engine was corrected and we have seen a measurable improvement in client stability as a result.<br />
Increased the potency of Pure Spirit.<br />
<br />
<br />
And tell me, how come you feel that dual weild issue is a major one? Annoying, sure, but major?<br />
<br />
We still have ridicously crappy nukes, we still have no damage spells with resist adjustments, our stat buff replacements still aren't all that hot, sub-70 shaman still have no rez, slow mitigation is more present then ever and we still decline in usefulness the more intense content gets.<br />

Just off the top of my head this is what I would call some of our major issues and in my opinion they make &quot;shaman need to carry a couple rusty daggers&quot; sound pretty minor indeed.</div></div><hr />

Just ignore these trolls Murtak. They think ANYTHING that affects THEIR chosen class is &quot;MAJOR&quot; and everything else in game is &quot;minor&quot;. You know, WHO CARES if the new 85% stuff isnt quite right, or the PG trials are broken, or some classes more important spells arent working properly, all that matters is THEIR issue gets fixed, PERIOD, and if it doesnt, SOE sucks. <br />

How does another class having a better pet, another class having a similar pet or another class having a worse pet make ours good, better or worse? What is so bad about Shadowknights that they may never get a pet as good as ours?<br />
<br />
If our pet doesnt hit anything complain about that. If our damage output is too low and the pet would be the perfect balancing factor try to get that changed. But why do you complain about another secondary pet gettting a pet similar to ours?<br />
<br />
Are Shadowknights overpowered because of their pet? Do shaman not get groups because of Shadowknight pets? If the answer to both is &quot;no&quot; there is no reason to complain about the relative differences (or lack thereof) of pets.<br />
<br />
We were never advertised as a primary pet class, hence it is only important as far as overall class balance is concerned (well, as long as the actual spell itself remains useful at all).<br />
<br />
Hmmm . . . I am still having trouble to express what I mean. How about this: Complain about the pet if you think it is too weak but don't complain about our pet needing to be stronger then the Shadowknight pet just &quot;because&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Something else? Did you see the SIZE and SCOPE of this most recent patch? You gota be kidding me man. <br />
<br />
I am not saying that Shaman SHOULDNT be higher on the priority list, but as others have pointed out, the fact that our pet is a few 100 hps low and doesnt dual wield is a pretty low-priority thing, at least to me. I will just do what I have always done, buy a couple Mage toys or Rustys and be on my way. All the new pet change is going to do for me is save me a bit of time looking for weapons, thats IT. Its a pure convienience change. Sorry if its more important to you. I think maybe you need to look toward yourself to figure out why that is, and not blame SOE, or take it out on the people of this message board. If this issue is &quot;make or break&quot; to you, then I submit you have been looking for an excuse to leave EQ for months, and blame SOE while doing it, and BAMM here it is.</div></div><hr />

You truely are grasping for straws.  I asked what HIS title was.  Is it the SHAMAN spell guy?  If it is, then I think it is completely reasonable to come through with something he said he would do.  As for the level of inconvenience, sure it isn't as big as if I couldn't keep up as main healer or that DoT agro is still messed up and that our nukes are quite weak. However, do you see them working on these areas either?  This isn't a make or break issue, but with the track record of SOE toward the Shaman class, it is a trend.  <br />
<br />
1.  We complain.<br />
2.  They say they will do something about it.<br />
3.  Delay<br />
4.  End product is marginal improvement in an attempt to pacify some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I would rather see just about anything done to the class to improve us than worry about the pet.  The pet is almost useless to me.  I do not exp much, and if I do, I use him, but it's not like I consider him much useful.  The ability to duel wield without weapons will be nice, but it won't be gamechanging for me in any way, nor will I prob notice the difference once.  While raiding there are very few fights that I even use him, and if I do, it's only cause I like to add his 3k total dmg to my spirit pets 7k dmg and my say 40k dmg to give me a little bit extra overall dmg.  Barely even noticeable and barely any fights he would be able to survive in.</div></div><hr />

The recent patch might have looked big to YOU but most of it are minor adjustments. 10% of whats listed probably took 95% of the time. What I mean is that 2 zone revamps take an awful lot of time to make compared to changing a few percentages here and there. But if you think its ok to focus on making changes to a couple of zones for 1 (!) server instead of taking time (&lt;30 mins) to implement year-old requests from shamans to fix shaman pets viability then I guess your right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Torrast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">On a completely side note, since I don't see it mentioned yet, the revamp of Mistmoore and Splitpaw seems to have cut off many quests from their quest components, such as the Black Dire in MM for shaman (no more SoW boots?).  Other quests for mages, paladins, etc are also affected, and many affect the epic 1.0 quests.  I've done a lot of searching through Lfay and SK since the revamp (I had a GM confirm that the quest pieces formerly in Splitpaw and MM would be in those 2 zones, and I'm on Stormhammer) and have yet to see any of the old quest mobs up, or any new mobs for that matter, which may have replaced their old counterparts.  In addition, quest givers who hint to the locations of the now-missing npc's have not had their text updated (Priestess Jahnda, for example, still sends us to Splitpaw for Brother Hayle).  I have done several /bug reports, and hopefully this will be fixed before the zone revamps go to all other servers.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I just read a note that they may have been included in the little patch a day or so ago, I'll go check it out.<br />

Nope, mobs aren't up</div></div><hr />

I'm just guessing, but it's probably something like Lead Game Designer. Rytan is in charge of all class spells, not just shaman.<br />

Actually, I think the main purpose of this patch was the new 85% rules into the EPs, Time, and Gates raids. I have the feeling anything else they fixed was on a list, and &quot;Shaman Pet&quot; wasnt real high on that list, and dindt get done. As it is, they are still having trouble with the 85% things now. <br />
<br />
But I will say it again, if the pet-dual wield thing was a make-or-break issue for anyone, they need to step back and take a good look at themselves. I am disappointed it didnt get fixed, I am also disapointed Channeling didnt get fixed, but I understand the meaning of the word priority. Its certainly not ruining my day to have things &quot;the same as they were&quot;. Pet is usable. Channeling is usable. They SHOULD be focusing on the stuff thats TRULY broken, and the stuff that makes like for EVERYONE a bit easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm sure the Shaman pet thing wasn't really high on the list.  That is the problem.  As for things that are broken, our pet IS broken.  I can't think of anything else in the game that can't dual wield without weapons but CAN dual wield with them.  Are there any other pets that don't dual wield?  That to me shows that our pet IS BROKEN in its current state.  Just because there is a work-around doesn't mean it isn't broken.  I can also work around the DoT agro by just not casting DoTs too..but that doesn't really mean it isn't broken now does it?  <br />
<br />
Also, as Glori thankfully pointed out, Rytan is the SPELL GUY.  Do you think he was working on the 85% thing?  Oh wait, he was taking the last month to work on that wonderful purespirit spell.  I know it was worth the wait for me.</div></div><hr />

I consider this a good sign.  If all m970456 has nothing better to complain about other than dog-dog not dual-wielding then SOE must have been doing something good....<br />
<br />
That aside, I see the shamans in a much better position now than pre-OoW.  The new AA's were a strong improvement- HoT AA, Defensive AA's, Calling to Corpse AA, more healing AA's.  There is also the new clicky HoT from Epic 1.5, the new modifiers to our buffs, and a &quot;use&quot; for alchemy now.  We were given a lot of loving with OoW (it was well-needed), and overall it has brought a stronger sense of optimism in the game for me.<br />
<br />
P.S. purchaseable augments are sweet- it makes moving around gear slot focuses so much easier now.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually more worried about DoT agro, Healing and burst damage.  However, I have given up hope of those areas ever being fixed.  I guess I just got my hopes up about this dern dog-dog thing since they said they would actually fix something that has been a long-term pain.  Then to have them come off with the flippant 'more difficult than we thought' excuse just burned me up.  <br />
<br />
Maybe my expectations of customer service have been set too high by shopping at Wal-Mart :)  These guys sure can't live up to that standard of CS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">You people need to let the pet thing die already, seriously. Of all the things, why the pet? FFS, the pet is such a small part of what we can do.<br />
<br />
We used to have contests in time, everyone would make a pet at the start of P4, you could get it whatever buffs and gear you wanted. Winner was the one whose pet lived the longest. I think the farthest I ever got was Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
This expansion is seriously the best expansion for us in a long time. A lot of people don't think so because everything mitigates slow, but guess what? Slow was the beast that was holding us back for too long. The new curse, the new rain, new HoT all rule. Heal could be a little better for comfort, but it's sufficient.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of you guys forgot what it was like pre omens. I remember trying to heal in KT, mashing Canni4 as often as I could, and desperately spam healing trying to keep a tank alive even with a HoT on him. I'd constantly hit canni5 praying for it to refresh sooner. It was miserable crap. The very nature of our class makes us extremely busy, we're always casting sutff. The new canni EASILY gives us double our old mana regen it's that good simply due to the bigger bites, less clicking. Now you can get your mana AND do **** with it. I couldn't be happier. Cannibalize is a valid class balance issue again. <br />
<br />
In any camp where my heals are sufficient to keep the tank alive with any reasonable margain of comfort, I actually heal better than a cleric, slow excluded, simply because of the mana regen. In layman's terms, I use a ton of mana but I end up using less % per fight.  Obviously, this won't cost clerics any groups simply because people like the safety net of res and divine abr, plus conviction and spell haste.<br />
<br />
So what if you don't have to heal, or are just the spot healer? Assuming you don't have a monk or rogue trying to tank, you should be able to stack both curse of sisslak and bane after slowing something, and have them actually wear off before the mob dies (assuming you're at least in MPG). If your tank isn't braindead or swinging around unauged tae ew longswords, you shouldn't be too bad agro wise. If you still can't use curses, use the new rain. Poison works very well in riftseekers in both the fire and ice sides. I wouldn't bother with blood unless you have a SK tanking, the agro on that spell is whacked. Good thing the curses are both great!<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently I consider only the following 3 things issues that need attention. Anything else would just be a convenience or minor boost/tune really.<br />
<br />
1) Fix DoT vs DD agro parity. Blood of Yoppa is like a darkblade proc when it lands, plus blasphemous blade of the exiled proc every tick. that's some retarded agro. The curses aren't too bad, but they still have some initial agro. Killing the snap agro and making SCS3 work would be so so good.<br />
<br />
2) Fix itemization and Poison/Disease focus. Seriously, go back through Luclin/PoP and add some stuff that focuses these spells. These spell lines need some love. Sprinkle a couple into omens as well. You can get Gelid/Pyrilen whatever fairly easily, but the only thing with poison focus (that I've seen outside of MPG trials) is the nec only necklace or lightning blackened chain boots. Otherwise, most of us are stuck fighting whoever for quarm spools and uqua pants.<br />
<br />
3) Fix Spiritual Channeling. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this ability. When it works, It's hands down the most powerful thing in our arsenal. But when it doesn't work, it's just... Blergh. Nothing like having 8000 hp and 2500 mana and having Talisman of Wunshi use the mana instead. There's never been a safeguard for our spells, so remove the HP check from SC, hell, let us kill ourselves with it. Remove the mana check so that we can cast without actually having the mana for the spell. This AA should be an all out &quot;own yourself to lay some serious smack down&quot; ability and the fail-safes totally ruin that. I want to be able to shout, &quot;Spiritual Channeling up, It's on now, bitch!&quot; and get that killshot while exploding myself in the process.<br />
<br />
I'd worry about those 3 first, then maybe we can bother with a spell that's not even worth the outside chance it has to /shield me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I agree completely with Grizlor's 3 points but with a couple comments:<br />
<br />
1. The DoT vs. DD agro parity is by far the most important.  Especially poison DoTs.  <br />
<br />
2.  Focusing poison DoTs (other than mana reducton) without fixing the agro problem is just asking for a trip to bind.  :-)  I have the VT dot bracer and DoT crit AAs so I mostly use nukes/rains now.  SCS3 and epic 1.5 do not help noticeably.<br />
<br />
3.  Agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">I am too tired to quote, but I am referring to what Grizlor said about Omens being awesome for Shamans.<br />
<br />
Omens was good for Shamans(good as in better than GoD), but do not make the mistake to think it is because of what we were given. <br />
Go back to KT/Qvic at level 70 with your Omens spells and AAs and see if what we got was that great. It won't be as trivial as it should be for 5 more levels and 100s of AAs.<br />
Fact is, Omens is not as hard as GoD was, this is what helped Shamans be more effective(the more trivial content gets, the more shines the Shaman) and the fact that Slow is less effective in Omens than anywhere else, does really not matter at all in this. They didn't increase Shaman heals or HoTs unproportionally or something to make up for the loss. If Slow has been holding us back, it still is, nothing has been changed in relative power between the healing classes, but the content is catering more to Shamans than GoD ever was, because of the reduced damage output of mobs.<br />
<br />
Get me right, I am content currently, even though the latest changes, bugs or not, have diminished my fun and my abilities again. <br />
<br />
The problem many people don't see at this point is that if you adjust content in an attempt to balance certain classes, like it was done with Omens, you will break them again as soon as you change the design. You basically live from one expansion to the next hoping that they do not break you again.<br />
Classes need to be balanced against each other, not against the content. I have said this many times, and I will always be saying that.</div></div><hr />

Above quote was a negative bump for this:<br />

No, that's why I hope Rytan will change the True Spirit pet as well in the process. All our post-50 pets should be dual wielding.</div></div><hr />

There are magic/fire/cold dd focii but nothing for poison/disease throughout planes/gates, and in omens they are very rare. If you want a focus that works on yoppa's spear of venom, your only choice is ____ of solusek. There's no Anger/Fury/Wrath of Saryrn. They added Fury of Bertoxx for SKs for thier time BP so they can get a focus for thier spears, but that's it.</div></div><hr />

IIRC Paladin 1.5 has some wacky click which gives them 120% heals for the duration (or something like that). According to devs at Fan Faire, that is unintentional. The paladin epic should follow the 20% bonuses the other epics get - will it be fixed, who knows?</div></div><hr />

Why does everyone claim to be the expert on how long it will take Sony to make a change and get it ready for patch? I always hear people complaining on patch day how Sony can do nothing but screw up what every they try to patch and they have to make several patchs to fix a single patch. So what is it? If it's always as easy and quick to do patch as you think would they have so many problems? Heck this is a game over 6 years old after all. If you take a game that this old and had as many patches and chages to it as EQ has the code wont look very nice at all. I think if you where to take an hoest look at all the variables that Sony has to deal with when patching the game you would sing a differnt song. Come on I dont like the fact that some of the changes we hope for as a shaman class havent gone in and they seem to be dragging there feet about it. However if they where to put them in and it screwed stuff up wouldnt you be bitching just as much that they always rush to get stuff out before its properly tested? Think about it with the way you are judging them you are putting them in a lose-lose situation in such they will always be getting complaints that they screwed up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We used to have contests in time, everyone would make a pet at the start of P4, you could get it whatever buffs and gear you wanted. Winner was the one whose pet lived the longest. I think the farthest I ever got was Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
This expansion is seriously the best expansion for us in a long time. A lot of people don't think so because everything mitigates slow, but guess what? Slow was the beast that was holding us back for too long. The new curse, the new rain, new HoT all rule. Heal could be a little better for comfort, but it's sufficient.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of you guys forgot what it was like pre omens. I remember trying to heal in KT, mashing Canni4 as often as I could, and desperately spam healing trying to keep a tank alive even with a HoT on him. I'd constantly hit canni5 praying for it to refresh sooner. It was miserable crap. The very nature of our class makes us extremely busy, we're always casting sutff. The new canni EASILY gives us double our old mana regen it's that good simply due to the bigger bites, less clicking. Now you can get your mana AND do **** with it. I couldn't be happier. Cannibalize is a valid class balance issue again. <br />
<br />
In any camp where my heals are sufficient to keep the tank alive with any reasonable margain of comfort, I actually heal better than a cleric, slow excluded, simply because of the mana regen. In layman's terms, I use a ton of mana but I end up using less % per fight.  Obviously, this won't cost clerics any groups simply because people like the safety net of res and divine abr, plus conviction and spell haste.<br />
<br />
So what if you don't have to heal, or are just the spot healer? Assuming you don't have a monk or rogue trying to tank, you should be able to stack both curse of sisslak and bane after slowing something, and have them actually wear off before the mob dies (assuming you're at least in MPG). If your tank isn't braindead or swinging around unauged tae ew longswords, you shouldn't be too bad agro wise. If you still can't use curses, use the new rain. Poison works very well in riftseekers in both the fire and ice sides. I wouldn't bother with blood unless you have a SK tanking, the agro on that spell is whacked. Good thing the curses are both great!<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently I consider only the following 3 things issues that need attention. Anything else would just be a convenience or minor boost/tune really.<br />
<br />
1) Fix DoT vs DD agro parity. Blood of Yoppa is like a darkblade proc when it lands, plus blasphemous blade of the exiled proc every tick. that's some retarded agro. The curses aren't too bad, but they still have some initial agro. Killing the snap agro and making SCS3 work would be so so good.<br />
<br />
2) Fix itemization and Poison/Disease focus. Seriously, go back through Luclin/PoP and add some stuff that focuses these spells. These spell lines need some love. Sprinkle a couple into omens as well. You can get Gelid/Pyrilen whatever fairly easily, but the only thing with poison focus (that I've seen outside of MPG trials) is the nec only necklace or lightning blackened chain boots. Otherwise, most of us are stuck fighting whoever for quarm spools and uqua pants.<br />
<br />
3) Fix Spiritual Channeling. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this ability. When it works, It's hands down the most powerful thing in our arsenal. But when it doesn't work, it's just... Blergh. Nothing like having 8000 hp and 2500 mana and having Talisman of Wunshi use the mana instead. There's never been a safeguard for our spells, so remove the HP check from SC, hell, let us kill ourselves with it. Remove the mana check so that we can cast without actually having the mana for the spell. This AA should be an all out &quot;own yourself to lay some serious smack down&quot; ability and the fail-safes totally ruin that. I want to be able to shout, &quot;Spiritual Channeling up, It's on now, bitch!&quot; and get that killshot while exploding myself in the process.<br />
<br />
I'd worry about those 3 first, then maybe we can bother with a spell that's not even worth the outside chance it has to /shield me.<br />
<br />
<br />
i somehow missed this post the first time i ran through this page...may have been a phone call or something while i was reading....anyway, i love this post lol!!! agree with you actually meaning posion/disease dd foci instead, but overall wildly agree with this post.  (adding some sort of get out of jail card as an issue wouldn't hurt to bad imo.  was playing around with my brother's druid and my god their runeish/DA spell rocks imo...)<br />
<br />
kind of off topic, but has anyone parced out the oow shaman pet with full gear/raid buffs on raid mobs?  i ran into a few parces from one of the top guilds on my server and one of the shaman had her pet up...it was putting out some supriseing DPS... wondered what kind of numbers you all were seeing (i haven't been raiding much as of late so i don't have any parces of my actual pet =/)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agee 100% with you in that its the best expansion for a long while.But I think its purely because the mobs mitigate slow and have ****load of HP.This to me is what makes a Shaman viable not the new line of spells.<br />
The new curse is wonderful (dont know as havent got it yet) but would it be so wonderful on mobs that die in 30 secs ?.<br />
Slow probably still holds us back.Are any of the new spells bigger improvements than normal with new expansions ?.I know the heal isnt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe the pet is nothing to you but to some of us it is more important than focus's etc.<br />
I dont care if pet is 1 rounded in Time etc thats not where im going to be hunting with it.<br />

On the flip side of that, though, I will agree with Spiritblood that they need to make more of a priority out of fixing CURRENT in game issues, rather than shining up and re-packaging older content. For myself, here is how I would like to see the &quot;EQ Programming Dollar&quot; spent:<br />
<br />
60% = development of new content<br />
30% = fixing current and semi-current (PoP+) in-game issues (bugs, balance, spells, etc on NEWER CONTENT)<br />
7% = re-vamping older content<br />
3% = fixing bugs older than PoP<br />
<br />
Its my personal belief that a LOT of the re-vamps and bug fixes of older content is wasted. Sure, a few people check it out, once in a while, and maybe someone makes a twink that does a &quot;fixed&quot; quest from days of old, but overall, who goes to Droga or Nurga? Who is still hangin out in VP? Who actually cares about bugged quests from Velious or Luclin? People are going to gravitate toward the current stuff, and to be honest, a HUGE reason for that is that SOE guides and pushes everyone that way. PoP made every single other XP area in the game useless. OoW has made PoP gear and XP look like Runnyeye. Such is the nature of the beast. The current world of EQ is HUGE, but its also 80% &quot;been there, done that&quot;. Personally, I probably wouldnt spend more than 10 online hours in old-world zones that have been re-vamped, and I would be right back to the new stuff. <br />
<br />
Yes, Spiritblood, I actually agreed with you one time. Believe it or not, I actually agree with a LOT of the issues that the people I argue the most with have. My disagreement with you on this pet dual-wield thing is a matter of &quot;degree&quot;, you see it as a 7-8 (out of 10), I see it as a 2-3. However, we can BOTH agree that re-vamps on old zones is code-time that could be better spent.</div></div><hr />

Gotta be. I think the MAX MAX heal we can hit with ALL the best focus, AA, and the best luck on the RNG is around 5500, with Yoppas (more with the ancient, of course). What happens, I think, it that the Paladin Epic effect kicks in at the END of all that calculations, and effectively adds 120% to the final result.

Why are focuses not important to you?  I found that with OoW, I am able to finally upgrade some pieces of my gear that previously I couldn't due to limited resources for certain focuses (Imp Healing IV :X).  Raiders and no-raiders alike were running into issues with focuses pre-OoW, and it looks like the issue was fixed at least for the non-raiders.  You can, through the new augmentations, gain access to focuses that were rare/non-existant and equip them on a specific piece of gear and even move them around once you are ready to upgrade said piece of gear.<br />
<br />
Now, I do find our pet a little more useful now, but that is mostly due to the ability to A. zone w/ pet and B. invis w/ pet.  When GoD came out, I pretty much stopped using my pet- it wasn't worth the mana casting it and keeping it healed.  Once I get the new pet, I will check out the dps and compare it to the amount of mana I have to use to keep it alive.  If its weak in this area then I won't use it- regardless of changes or lack thereof.   I see the pet fixes as an issue, but not as high in priority as some of the posts here.  It seems more like a cosmetic malfunction rather than a distinct class disruption.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't not bashing him (in fact, I would personally hate to have his job and the crap that goes with it).  I just just frustrated with him having said he fix something and did not.<br />
<br />
About the 5 minutes before the patch thing, I was referring to the pet HP thing.  This is not something that really needs to be play tested, really.  Pet HP up, pet lives longer, pet still dies in Time in 0.00002 seconds.  This would never at any time cause an unbalancing of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
The other point of my post is 'canned' answers.  I am pretty fed up with getting answers that a magic 8 ball could produce.  This is not a bash, but, hopefully, is showing the lack of communication to the Shaman class is bad.  I honestly don't know if he really understands why communication to us (esp. with the new games comming out) is important.  A 'currently being evaluated' for almost a year is pretty damn pathetic.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I agree with healing/dot/dps issues that are out there.  But, I also see that SoE does NOT know what the hell a shaman is sposed to be.  A warrior/paladin/shadowknight/cleric/wizard are really damn easy to see what they are sposed to do, the remaining classes need a lot more definition than 'tank'/'heal'/'nuke'.<br />
<br />
The pet hp issue (and the dual wield issue) have been around for years.  The higher levels have just increased the issue more.  The difference in hit points at lower spell levels isn't huge, but it is there.  By the time you get the top pet spell, the isuue is significant.<br />
<br />
The 'retraction' (I guess that's what to call it) of the pet hp that Rytan promised is pretty damn frustrating.  I can understand the need for more precise numbers than what is available at the Fan Faire.  I really do.  But, to come back later and say that the pet should have 200-300 more hp is just frigging wrong.  Is that even a single hit, NO IT ISN'T.  I can understand not being the same as a PET class.  But the difference between a non-focued pet of a pet class and us is pathetic.<br />

From The Magician's Tower Forum, all pets at level 39 have the ability to dual wield (they can dual wield with weapons at level 20).<br />
<br />
Overall, looking at that information from just one PET class, it's pretty damn pathetic to compare our pet to it.<br />
<br />
Farrel's Companion Level 67<br />
HP                                     2450<br />
Max Hit Unbuffed                  68<br />
Max Hit Buffed                     70<br />
Max Bash/Kick                      26<br />
Max Hits                              Triple<br />
<br />
/sigh.  I can understand fluff being at a lesser level than magician pets, but damn, we're not even half an unfocused pet, AND we have to give our pets weapons to make them dual wield.  Go ahead and /flame on about it, but someone needed to show where we really are on pets.  I'm not asking to be a magician.  But to allow fluffy to last more than ONE hit from a lot of mobs isn't asking much.  Some people don't use pets.  That's fine.  A lot of us do use them, especially when we are in experience groups (those of us that still have AA's left to earn).  And the extra dps from fluffy (granted not much) helps a tiny, unnoticable bit in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Grand total, shaman level 67 pet needs to be fixed.  This is what was presented to Rytan at the fan faire (from my understanding, I was not there).  The dual wield issue has been around for years and is still in a 'currently being evaluated' status.  Both issues were said to be corrected in the next patch.  That didn't happen, but Rytan promises it in the 'future'.  When is our pet really going to be analyzed?<br />
<br />
That is my point, and the communciation is still crap and needs to be improved.  Thanks for reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">How does another class having a better pet, another class having a similar pet or another class having a worse pet make ours good, better or worse? What is so bad about Shadowknights that they may never get a pet as good as ours?<br />
<br />
If our pet doesnt hit anything complain about that. If our damage output is too low and the pet would be the perfect balancing factor try to get that changed. But why do you complain about another secondary pet gettting a pet similar to ours?<br />
<br />
Are Shadowknights overpowered because of their pet? Do shaman not get groups because of Shadowknight pets? If the answer to both is &quot;no&quot; there is no reason to complain about the relative differences (or lack thereof) of pets.<br />
<br />
We were never advertised as a primary pet class, hence it is only important as far as overall class balance is concerned (well, as long as the actual spell itself remains useful at all).<br />
<br />
Hmmm . . . I am still having trouble to express what I mean. How about this: Complain about the pet if you think it is too weak but don't complain about our pet needing to be stronger then the Shadowknight pet just &quot;because&quot;.<br />
<br />

i belive yu also misunderstood my comment, its not about shadoknights pets.. its more about how pathetic it is... theirs is a green con while ours is a dark blue con...  i would of liked to have dogdog with 4200 HPs means he would last longer... would be able to tank etc...  im more fed up with the crap were being fed, and as hitatomi said<br />
<br />
This is not something that really needs to be play tested, really. Pet HP up, pet lives longer, pet still dies in Time in 0.00002 seconds. This would never at any time cause an unbalancing of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
The other point of my post is 'canned' answers. I am pretty fed up with getting answers that a magic 8 ball could produce. This is not a bash, but, hopefully, is showing the lack of communication to the Shaman class is bad. I honestly don't know if he really understands why communication to us (esp. with the new games comming out) is important. A 'currently being evaluated' for almost a year is pretty damn pathetic.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I agree with healing/dot/dps issues that are out there. But, I also see that SoE does NOT know what the hell a shaman is sposed to be. A warrior/paladin/shadowknight/cleric/wizard are really damn easy to see what they are sposed to do, the remaining classes need a lot more definition than 'tank'/'heal'/'nuke'.<br />
<br />
The pet hp issue (and the dual wield issue) have been around for years. The higher levels have just increased the issue more. The difference in hit points at lower spell levels isn't huge, but it is there. By the time you get the top pet spell, the isuue is significant.<br />
<br />
The 'retraction' (I guess that's what to call it) of the pet hp that Rytan promised is pretty damn frustrating. I can understand the need for more precise numbers than what is available at the Fan Faire. I really do. But, to come back later and say that the pet should have 200-300 more hp is just frigging wrong. Is that even a single hit, NO IT ISN'T. I can understand not being the same as a PET class. But the difference between a non-focued pet of a pet class and us is pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">The actual max HP for Farrel's Companion should be 2900 HP, which is the same as the level 68 SK pet, Son of Decay.  The SK pet originally got a larger then average upgrade with Invoke Death at 64, by virtue of it being a shared necro spell.  That particular pet picked up a larger increase then normal as it was the first 50+ pet, and that increase carried over when the SKs picked it up at 64.<br />
Therefor, I've also upped the HP on True Spirit to match the HP on the Invoke Death pet at 2600 (it was previously ~2100).<br />

It would be nice if True Spirit &amp; up matched the DPS of the Shadowknight/necro pet too.</div></div><hr />
