<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried logging on to EQ and the patcher message comes up with a connection failed.  I thought to try the Sony website and I get the nice page cannot be displayed...<br />
<br />
Someone finally did it...they took VI out..  Hopefully Betty Ford opens up a wing devoted to the EQ crowd.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, is it just me or are others having this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same problem here!  Just when I thought I had a night to devote to some grinding!  Grr!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same problem here. No patching, no website. Thanks for posting info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, and I was screwing around with my computer thinking it had broken.  Least its not just me.<br />
<br />
Odd thing is, my other computer can log in just fine without any trouble, but I can't on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just checked out of the clinic...it's working again.<br />
<br />
Back to the grind =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm out too, stuck in CoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After the big interface/bazaar patch, I was unable to connect to EQ at work. Apparently they changed the IP address of the patch server, which prevented me from playing due to our firewall. I asked our nice sysadmin to let me connect to the new address and I was able to connect no problem.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that's your problem, but something to look into.</div></div><hr />
