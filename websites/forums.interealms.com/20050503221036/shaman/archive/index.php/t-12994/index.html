<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was having a discussion this evening with another fine shaman and part of the conversation drifted to the topic of &quot;How much is enough wisdom.&quot;<br />
<br />
I know that too much wisdom and you're a druid (heh... learned this after my last post &quot;A fun accomplishment I wanted to share.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the question is: How much wisdom is enough at level 65 to be an effective group team member and a good soloer?<br />
<br />
I do plan on having a second set of equipment and the AA ablilites to have a 355 wisdom for crafting. But, how much is good for everyday leveling?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Aztkius</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HP's are mana, WIS is just aggrigate pool amount.  IE, I need enough mana in the pool to MGB Fo7, but no more.  Around 220-240 is enough to get you where you need to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The concept of Hit Points being so very important to the shaman was new to me, but I've really latched onto the concept.  Now that it has been pointed out I am striving to modify my equipment to meet my new Hit Point needs with Wisdom as only a secondary item stat.<br />
<br />
I think I might narrow down my question a bit by asking: How much wisdom is enough to reduce resists to an acceptable level at 65th level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wis has nothing to do with resists, either the mob's or yours...   Totally seperate (carry resist gear at all times)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anything above 150 is good for your level..<br />
so that means you can switch out alot of wis for hp/ac<br />
<br />
at 65 i dunno, cause I'm not there yet<br />
<br />
at 59, my wis is 200, and I don't pick my gear for wis (though i still need to get rid of some of the crap items i've had since 30... ie range slot thing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is no set number. Realistically the answer is enough that you don't run out of mana all the time.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm at 280 wisdom but thats basically because my gear is just at a high enough level that high wisdom is a given. (would actually be 295ish unbuffed if i spent the aa's)<br />
<br />
How much hps or resists or what ever is worth giving up for wisdom or what ever really varries for alot of reasons.<br />
<br />
For someone like me I wouldn't give up anything to gain more wisdom right now since i'm already a fair bit past the cap. For someone who has only 120 wisdom that would be a different story.<br />
<br />
Some things to keep in mind. Wisdom past 200 is half the mana if wisdom before 200. It seems to drop again at 255 wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">By &quot;resists&quot; I meant mobs resisting the spells I cast at them.<br />

<br />
Resists are figured by (and Im sure someone can come up with real numbers, but here's some made up ones for the concept of it...) ...<br />
<br />
Resist check of the spell.  All spells have a resist modifier (plus 20, negative 100, negative 300, etc).   The more positive this number is, the less likely it is to be resisted.<br />
<br />
Mobs Resistance.  Mobs, like players, have resist stats (fire, cold, magic, poison, disease).  Now, Im fairly certain most mobs are far above most players, but they also have resist stats.<br />
<br />
So, when you cast a spell, it checks the modifier on the spell, against the mobs resist to that type of spell (ice based, fire based, etc), and if over a certain amount, the spell lands.  If below this amount, its a resist.<br />
<br />
So, I hope I didnt confuse you too much, but the main point is, your stats have nothing to do with spells being resisted by monsters.  It has everything to do with the modifier on the spell, and the mobs resist stats.<br />

Hope this helps,<br />

Well close but a spell with a negative 100 resist modifier is harder to resist not easier. The number is bests as i can tell literally added to your, or the mobs resist value. Thus a negative 100 resist modifier means a player or mob with 200 resists acts like they have 100 and the spell is easier to land. Mobs do definitely have resists set of thier own thats why our spells in the malXXX line make spells easier to land since it decreases thier resists.<br />
<br />
And any testing I've ever seen has shown that it just a random roll and that your stats don't effect your chance of landing the spell.<br />
<br />
One of the biggested things effecting resist tho seems to be your lvl vs the mobs level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aztkius,<br />
<br />
Lets just say, if you have to choose between two <br />
pieces of gear, one with 10ac, 10hps and 10wis and the other piece is 20ac 20hps and 5wis, you outta be taking the 2nd item :)<br />
<br />
So the orginal question is: 'how much is enough or too much wisdom'.  The fact is, as you collect AC/HP gear you WILL be getting wis tacked on as a bonus anyway.  I'll repeat what I've said before (and what others have said):<br />
<br />
HP + canni = mana<br />
AC protects your HPs so you can make mana.<br />
Wis = mana pool, but if you can't protect that wis because you have crappy AC/HP your going to die like a self-snared quad-kiting druid. (hehe, I imagine all druids that snare themselves on accident while quad-kiting die anyway).<br />
<br />
A lot of us read your orignal post, and yes you are geared like a druid :) The first time a PoP mob stomps on you like a T-Rex, you'll wonder why shaman covet 1k+AC and tons of hps ;)<br />
<br />
But you have hope! You seem interested in learning the class, stick with it! :.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Excellent information.  I thank each of you for your input.<br />
<br />
My understanding of this issue is:<br />
<br />
1) Wisdom only affects the amount of mana in your mana pool and how quickly you learn certain skills.  A Shaman should seek out equipment primarily for Hit Points and secondarily for Wisdom.  This is to facilitate a larger virtual mana pool thorough the use of the Cannibalization line of spells.<br />
<br />
2) A mob resists spells cast upon it by factors that involve the difference in level between the mob and the caster, by the natural resistance the mob possesses, and by the spell resistance modifier of the spell being cast upon the mob.  Furthermore, Wisdom has no part in the equation involving a mob’s resistance of a spell cast upon it.<br />
<br />
3) The amount of Wisdom needed by a level 65 Shaman for hunting is somewhere greater than 150 with 200 to 240 as a good target range.  Though, it is probably not necessary to worry about Wisdom, the majority of one’s equipment should have Wisdom modifiers as a secondary benefit.  However, Hit Points should definitely be maintained as the top priority when choosing equipment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That is a good summary, Aztkius.<br />
<br />
Regarding how much wisdom you should have at level 65, I would say that the answer is &quot;as much as you can without sacrificing hp/ac&quot;.  I personally have the view that balance is more important than extremes.  Ideally, you would like all of your statistics to be very high.  Since you obviously DO need to choose, though, I would lean toward, HP, AC, MANA, WIS, followed by all other statistics.  It is important to keep in mind that there are diminishing returns as your wisdom goes up.  The difference between 265 wisdom and 285 wisdom is not all that significant.  This is why at very high levels a piece of gear with +MANA is more desirable by far than a piece of gear with +WIS. <br />
<br />
My unbuffed wisdom is 247 at level 65.  This is a comfortable amount for me -- not extremely high, but not extremely low.  I have a large enough mana pool to do what I want to do (at no point in the lat six months have I managed to run out of mana even when casting hard), but I definitely try to focus my gear on hp/ac as much as I can.  I've made some compromises for focus effects (wicked bone atlatl stays equiped until I decide to do quick buff 3, for example, but will be replaced with something that doesn't suck stat-wise at that point).<br />
<br />
As other posters have said, though, you will accumulate WIS as your gear changes.  Without seeking wisdom increases, my wisdom has gone up dramatically in the last 6 months (it used to hover around 190 when I was level 60ish).<br />
<br />
You can click my magelo link in my sig below to look at my gear if you like.  I'm no paragon of shaman-hood, but I'm happy.  :)<br />

<br />
High level hp gear always come with wisdom / int. If you plan on beeing in a raiding guild, just ignore wisdom for your gear choice. Make your gear choice based of HP first, then focus/effect. Usually, Wisdom will follow very fast. I got my wis at 305+ and I never made a choice based on wisdom. It's the same for AC.<br />
<br />
For the size of the mana pool, it just depends of where you hunting at 65. I rarely bother getting a KEI when I go solo (I m too lazy to beg a chanter) and in some zone, 5k+ mana with 305 wisdom is sometimes barely enough.</div></div><hr />

I've not run out of mana in a long time (aside from mass fo7, but it comes back quick).  You get the most gains from wis up to 200, after that it's lowered to 255, and after that I'm not 100% sure, but I believe it's next to worthless.<br />
<br />
I'd say as long as you're not going oom often (that's really the deciding factor, different playstyles may cause different needs of wis), stick with HP/Ac over wis, and take what comes.</div></div><hr />

Sleeves, gloves, and one bracer are ones I can remember.  <br />
<br />
Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves (6 sta, 25 hp) for Hurricane Chain Sleeves (30 hp, 40 mana, 5 wis).<br />
Coldain Skin Gloves (9 sta, 20 hp, 20 mana, 6 wis) for Stormrider Gauntlets (30 hp, 30 hp, 5 wis...and the 7 mr/fr/cr was a factor too).<br />
Bracelet of Fortitude (15 sta, 6 all saves) for Scale Mesh Vambraces (30 hp, 30 mana, 5 wis, 10 mr/fr).<br />
<br />
Totals:  30 sta (90 hp), 0 hp, 0 mana, 0 wis traded for 0 sta, 45 hp, 80 mana, 9 wis.<br />
<br />
30 sta would theoretically provide more HP.  Unbuffed.  With buffs, I'd be at 211 sta, and I would buff to 291....I don't have planar power, and don't plan on getting it for a while, so 11 (33 hp) of that sta would be a complete waste.<br />
<br />
I didn't factor in my ND3, 'cause I'm lazy.   :p <br />

This works well for how I play.  I mostly do guild groups, so I rarely get agro (unless I'm overnuking on purpose to piss off the tank or something), but if the **** does hit the fan, I know my melee will be able to root or offtank CC, I just need to have enough mana to cover malo/slow/heal/root, w/out having to rely on canni, because there's not always time to canni down (or canni5 even) and waste more time healing myself when I could be doing something else.  This rarely happens though.  Last time was in HoH when our bard went LD and we had to wait for him to get back and since the zone was still somewhat new to us, one of the warriors was looking around, and agroed 2 mobs the monk was splitting..then we got a repop add...then another.   :D Finally finished with me at like 5 mana after 2 midfight canni5s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">For those of us that arent in uber guilds, equipment selection will be a much bigger challenge in the game and the rule of 'in the end game if it has hp it will have wis/int (and every other stat under the sun)' doesnt always apply to everyone.  <br />
<br />
I have had to sacrafice a lot of ac for hp.  I have recently also figured out that eventually I will need more mana for Focus of the Seventh with MGB (dont have either yet) so I need to work out how Im going to up my mana pool, likely again having to sacrafice hp/ac for wis/mana.<br />
<br />
At 64, in a 'family' type guild/atmosphere, I am still wearing 4 pieces of armor that only give me hp/ac, but slowly working on replacing them.  One thing is for sure, the good equipment available now is becoming more readily available and cheaper as more expansions are released and things filter down.<br />
<br />
I dont think a wisdom anywhere from 160 to 200 up to 60 is bad, just get what you need to perform your daily functions.  The general rule I would use is that if you run oom or close to oom a lot, then work on adding mana/wis, if you never get below half then maybe you have too much and could stand to replace some with hp, whatever you do, it may not be the same as shaman B and you may have to reevaluate things as you get higher level.<br />

The rule should actually say &quot;requires twice the mana, if available, or ALL of your mana if twice the mana is not available&quot;.  The point is that having twice the mana pool is not a requirement (or so my cleric friends tell me -- I myself do not have MGB, or really especially want it unless I happen to get Fo7th).</div></div><hr />

I would simply not be concearned about wisdom untill some other gear goals where achieved.<br />

After that I might start to try and expand my mana pool with +mana and +wis items.<br />
<br />
In a way, just asking how much wisdom at 65 is enough indicates a lack of understanding of shaman basics.  A far better question is how much HP or AC do I need at 65.<br />
<br />
I am not in the camp that thinks you should get you HP to 7k or more.  The size of you HP pool is a safty margin just like the size of you mana pool.  If you have enough HP to be safe the vast majority of the time then more HP at the expense of other usefull characteristics is a waste.  HP is not a religion for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So the question is: How much wisdom is enough at level 65 to be ....  a good soloer?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Aztkius<br />
<br />
Ok, it has become an article of faith among shamans to sacrifice hp for wisdom so that you can solo mobs &quot;IN TEH FACE&quot; (ITF).  This is certainly true from 34 when you get your first pet on up through level 60.  <br />
<br />
This has changed with PoP.  First, melee damage by a shaman drops to effectively zero by the time one moves past 60.  Second, PoP mobs past Tier 1 hit too hard to fight ITF, even if slowed.  Third, PoP mobs require high DPS to fight.  Finally, the ONLY way a shaman can achieve a high level of DPS is to root a mob and stack DoT's.<br />
<br />
What this means is that to solo in PoP, you have to have lots of mana, the more the better, and as rapid mana regen as possible.  You want to avoid being hit by a mob as much as possible.  So to be an effective soloer at 65 you should dump all your hp gear and stoke up on FT, Mana, and wis gear.<br />
<br />
Yep, that's right.  The best shamans at 65 look like a cross between a dr00d and a necromancer (Chukzhombi doesn't even equip a weapon folks).  Except at 65 shamans don't have the tools of either class to effectively solo high level mobs.  No snare.  No harmony.  DoT's better than a druids but poorer than a necro's.<br />
<br />
I got my first taste of ubah shaman soloing the other day in HoH.  I had to ghetto split mobs at the zone in (pull two to graveyard, root one and zone), then just and root/rotted.  I was getting 5 to 6% AA per kill, but a kill took about 10 mins using Blood of Saryrn, Breath of Ultor, Epic, Bone of Bertoxxulous, Bane of Nife, and Pox of Bertoxxxuous.  It took another 5 mins to recover mana (didn't have clarity).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have to disagree.<br />
<br />
HPs at 65 are still king.  Not because they allow you to take a beating, but because they can be converted to mana, and then regenerated quickly.  No amount of FT, +mana, or +wis will give you the mana of canni4 + canni5 + torpor/Q.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to the original question:<br />

Post 60, dont worry about your wisdom.  Good gear will have wisdom on it, as well as HPs, mana, AC, resists, and other stats/effects.  I cant give you a number to shoot for, but the rule-of-thumb is that unless you are running out of mana, you have enough.  Its all about refilling your mana pool faster than you use it.<br />
<br />
I am a raiding shaman, in a raid guild.  One of our requirements is that casters/priests have a 255+ in their primary stat (wis/int) with buffs.  Voice of Quellious adds 28, Tranquility adds 26, KEI adds 25... so we are asking for an unbuffed stat of 225-230.  For a shaman this is more than enough.  I have a 300ish wisdom, but would be fine with a 200 -my gear just gives more wisdom than I truly need.<br />
<br />
In an average hunting group, I use less than half my mana pool.  I am able to chain cast, while cannibalizing and torporing myself to keep my mana high.  The only time I use the full amount is when re-buffing a raid on the move and immediately slowing the next set of incoming mobs(mgb between pulls without the need for a med break keeps things moving) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">While I do agree that mana and such is more important at 65 than it was earlier, I think &quot;dump all your hp gear for mana and FT&quot; is a bit extreme.  You really do need a balance between the two.  Too much of either and to little of the other and you gimp yourself.<br />
<br />
Anyways, it is impossible to tell you how much wis is &quot;enough&quot;.  If you are getting killed when mobs aggro you, but still have plenty of mana, then you have too much wis.  Drop some for HP.  If you tank better than the warrior in your group but one dot takes 1/4 of your mana, you don't have enough wis.  When you are playing, try to be self-analytical.  Say &quot;ok.... what problems am I having and what is causing them&quot; and then adjust your gear/playstyle accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">MGB Correction:<br />
<br />
It uses up to twice to normal mana cost, if fo7 takes you 30% mana to cast, you can MGB it with 30% mana and it'll just empty you out.<br />
<br />
using the same example of 30% for f07, if you're at FM it'll use 60%, but it only takes up to twice the mana, it only requires the regular amount</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Wisdom does affect fizzle rate . . . up to a point.  That point kicks in just over 150 wisdom, which is where that number came from originally.  I remember the old days of wis vs. AC discussions, then HP vs. AC, then HP vs. Mana vs. wis discussions.  Believe me we've hashed it all out more than once!  And the reason we came to the &quot;Crucible Prescribed Minimum Wisdom Level&quot; of 150 was because that is the point where wisdom stops affecting fizzle rate.  <br />
<br />
Obviously more mana is good, but more hps keep you alive.  So having more mana will allow you to more quickly kill larger targets, but having more hps will allow you to survive situations where not everything works perfectly.  Which is to say . . . most of the time you need to survive more than you need to cast spells.  You die much less when your hps shoot up.  I like tanking a named mob once in a while.  It's fun and I have the HPs high enuf (raid buffed) to equal a pre-PoP non-uber warrior.  I've over 6khps that is to say.  There are other shamans on the board like Chukzombie who have over 7khps raid buffed.  And many in between.  And my wis ain't too shabby, somewhere around 245 or so unbuffed.  Great gear comes late game tho, so don't compare yourself to people wearing it.  It is a whole other game to equip your shaman in great gear.  It takes lots and lots and lots of raiding to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have to disagree.<br />
<br />
HPs at 65 are still king.  Not because they allow you to take a beating, but because they can be converted to mana, and then regenerated quickly.  No amount of FT, +mana, or +wis will give you the mana of canni4 + canni5 + torpor/Q.<br />
<br />
<br />
My point is this. At 65 soloing in upper tier PoP zones, you are more likely to be limited by mana than hp.  You will have ample hp to max out your mana regen rate using canniX + Q with half way decent hp on your equipment.  So the best strategy is to add as much additional mana and mana regen to the canniX/Q cycle as you can.  Also, any mana free DoTs and roots you can acquire will be a plus, because they reduce mana costs.</div></div><hr />

Of course..KEI and Valor makes you a formidable foe.  Add to this a horse and your epic and you're a VERY scary thing.<br />

Sometimes i wish I could take all my gear and buffs back to 2001 and be mega-uber!</div></div><hr />

Yes and no. When your soloing higher end mobs that can quad for 500+ that hps buff you want gets alot larger. If you cann v and end up and 1k hps you could easily get killed if your root breaks and they get a lucky round. Having 4K+ hps buffed or more makes it alot safer and more reasonable to use cann v/cann4 and q while actually killing the mob. Then again if your soloing anything past PoV/PoS you probably really don't have to worry about it either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, elemental legs have Effect: Pox of Bertoxxulous (Casting time: 4) on them.  Mathi (shaman on my server got her pair the other day and linked me them.  Totally the best legs I've ever, ever, ever seen.  Ornate are the ones with the 3.0 second Greater Immobilization.  <br />
I'll stick with my ring for now :)<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, I've never really strove to have a lot of mana gear, but I have well over 4k mana now and that seems to be absolutely plenty for solo work.  It might also help that I wear an Affliction Efficiency IV item that reduces mana cost on all DoTs by 1/3, have SCM3 which adds 10% mana savings, and have some FT.  I never really run outta mana before the mob is dead if it's only one mob.  Two and I might have to canni a little on the side, but it's really no big deal.  I have NEVER had to zone because I ran out of mana.  I HAVE OFTEN had to zone because I ran out of hps!  <br />
Sorry Gard, I think yer barkin up the wrong tree bud.  If the mob don't summon, we got all the time in the freakin world to kill it.  If the mob DOES summon, then the higher your hps are, the more likely you are to win, regardless of mana pool.  I think the hardest summoning mob I've tried in a while was a sand giant warrior in BoT.  Them things really do smack for a lot, and if you don't be killing them fast enough they be killing you faster.  Puppy was a must I found for reasonable soloing there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hitpoints are king but soooo dang many of you give mistaken reasons as to why.<br />
<br />
Hitpoints are a prospective mana pool(compared to wisdom being your actual mana pool). Strictly for mana purposes, hitpoints are probably less important than wisdom/mana(canni conversion rate would have to be better than 1hp/1mana to change that). Hitpoint regeneration is the key for mana, not max hitpoints. <br />
<br />
Hitpoints ARE king, but that is because of the beating buffer they provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Veranon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It's pretty simple, larger is always better.<br />
<br />
Mana can be substituted for hp (heals, HoTs)<br />
Hp can be substituted for mana (Cannibalization, Cann-spells)<br />
<br />
The larger the combined pool is, the more hp and mana you have to play with.<br />
I find that when grouping, I quickly try to drop to ~80% mana, which is where a cannibalization pops it up to almost full, which means that when cleric dies, or you get a multipull and need to help nuking them down you have a larger &quot;emergency&quot; pool to drain from.<br />
<br />
A plus for the hp-pool is that it's easier and faster to convert to hp from mana than the other way around, the manaregen is pretty slow (I currently only have FT15, MC3 and Kodiac's Heightened Focus, +Cann), which leaves my manaregen at a rate where I easily can outregen with hp faster than I can convert it back into mana.<br />
<br />
When you're out of hp, you're dead, when you're out of mana you're either going to die, or (unless you have the ornate pants, etc) are more or less useless til you get some...<br />
<br />
With Quiescence (/Torpor) we have a great ratio on mana-&gt;hp transfer, the problem lies in getting hp-&gt;mana, which is insanely much slower.<br />
The more I play the more important the manapool seems to get cause the whole problem is with manaregen.<br />
The bigger manapool you have, the more you can stack away in it for later... As long as it's never completely full it's all good, the larger pool, the larger margins you have to play around with not to &quot;waste&quot; resources.<br />
<br />
Then there's always the view from a raiding standpoint.<br />
Endurancebattles, like Xegony/Fennin/etc where you need to sustain much mana for a long time.<br />
You will never be able to keep up how much you spend with your regen in those battles, so, the bigger manapool you have, the longer you &quot;last&quot; until you have to throw in the towel. This is definately worse for clerics than for us, but noticeable on those fights for us as well, the blue bar shrinks constantly, and one cann every 3 min isn't really enough, and you don' thave time to cast the spells. This might not be the kind of situation you are looking for though.<br />
<br />
Get it balanced, if you die, you have too little hp, if you run oom too much and barely ever die, then you can probably increase your manapool a bit (or buy SCM, which if one of the most underrated skills we have, imo)<br />
<br />
Anyways, this is probably way too much rambling...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You are going to want to make sure that you have enough Hps so you can Cann V in the middle of a fight and your hps don't drop so low that you get low health agro. <br />
<br />
Its really all about balance, enough wisdom so you don't go oom all the time, enough ac so you don't get smacked around too hard and good hit points so you can cann efficiently and not die too quickly when you get agro.<br />
<br />
I am wearing a few &quot;balancing&quot; items. They don't have the best hps but they make up in large amount what I may be lacking overall. For example I wear a high AC/WIS helm with no hps because I am lacking in AC overall and it gives me a nice wis/mana boost as well. I will probably continue to wear it until I can raise my ac on my other gear without sacrificing hps, or find a helm with better hp stats that also has enough AC to keep me balanced.</div></div><hr />
