<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It is with sad regards that I am submitting my resignation to Keepers of the Elements. I am not leaving on bad terms nor out of anger, I just feel it is time to move on. I want to thank you all for the great time I have had, I have made a lot of friends in my time here with you and hope to retain them after I leave. If people look down on me for leaving I will accept that as well. After the past 2 weeks of spending a lot of time grouping with some EQ friends of 2 years, I have decided to try a new aspect of the game. I have started a guild… at their request I have submitted it on my account and was appointed as leader. So far we have a force of about 15 people level 50+. I foresee great things for this bunch and hope to not disappoint them. I have learned much from Rizz and the rest of you and hope to use this knowledge to help us prosper into a strong guild. I would also like to offer my assistance to any of you that may ever need it. We will have a strong late night group, if ever you are short on troops feel free to send me a tell and I will lend my sword and as many others as I can gather. <br />
<br />
I bid you all farewell and good luck.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't like hearing about people leaving KOTE, but if you feel strong about this good luck.  There is no single task in the game more frustrating and difficult than leading a guild properly.  It is also more rewarding then anything else when it all goes right.  Here are some words of Advice for you:<br />
<br />
1)  Be Patient-  It will take time for you to build a solid core of people you can use to raid.  Make sure they understand this too.  In the meantime, make sure you group together constantly so you form the core of a guild that knows how to play together.<br />
<br />
2) No Matter what you do, someone is going to get pissed off-  Maybe this is more true for me (hehe), but fact is every call you make is going to disappoint someone.  Don't let it bother you, just try to be fair and constant in what you decide.<br />
<br />
3) Think Long Term-  Don't grow too fast or reach beyond your limits too often.  Keep the guild growing steadily and things will happen on their own.  The guild will also be more stable.  Guilds that double in size overnight are doomed to failure.<br />
<br />
4) Make sure YOU are having fun-  This is the hardest one and the most important.  IF you are not having fun, your mood will permeate the guild and bring everyone down.  MAke sure no matter what you are doing, you are enjoying yourself.  If the Boss is happy, then the guildies are happy.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />
