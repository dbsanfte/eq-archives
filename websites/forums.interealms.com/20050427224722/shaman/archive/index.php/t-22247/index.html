<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seremont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, reading these threads has got me worried that I may have crap gear for my level. I am learning TONS from this site and want to make sure I'm working with the best stuff I can get.<br />
<br />
My magelo is below, and my next few items I'm saving for are a Solstice earring and a leezard, assuming you can still canni on a mount?<br />
<br />
I have some gear in storage for when I hit 51, but with limited cash I'm looking for upgrade potential, including suggestions and advice on my two wish list items. I know we canni to get mana, but mana regen items mean we don't need as much regen, or so it seems.  Expert thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your great advice!<br />
