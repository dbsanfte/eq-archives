<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Surus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently attended a raid on both of these mobs and my spells were utterly useless against Vox and Naggy - but I had great success slowing the giants before them.<br />
<br />
I was trying to malos and turgur on these dragons and when spell did not get interrupted, it was resisted every time.  And I was in melee range.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking my debuffs are not usable against these ladies and my role should be to heal those in my party.<br />
<br />
Is there any other information about a shaman's role in Vox/Naggy raids?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Surus 52 shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A good Naggy/Vox raid should not last long enough for slow to matter.<br />
<br />
Pallies and Clerics chain stunning the dragons will work better than trying to slow.<br />
<br />
Back when I was doing those two I just healed.  I did always try to malo/slow at least one jic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They cant be slowed, nuke them or throw around heals, worse case get a 2hb and help beat them down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless they have been changed recently, they can be slowed. <br />
<br />
Problem is, they are level 55, you are level 52, and they have high resistance to magic spells.  At the level you fight them, you don't really have access to things like malo/oos so its hard to deal with magic resists.  I suggest trying to slow once or twice, and if it works then you are a hero, but more than likely it wont.  <br />
<br />
Its kinda gimp, but you can give a bard a stick that procs tash, and it will stick with enchanter tash, and this would make it much easier to slow them if you wanted to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buff and heal.</div></div><hr />
