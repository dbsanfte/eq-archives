<br />
Spent most of Saturday camping the shroom king in Seb, in about 6 hrs we got 4 kings, 2 Robes and 2 Staffs.  I got a staff and wondering if I really need to continue to camp for the tunic? <br />
<br />
The 15 point regen from the staff is nice, and the fact it snares me isnt a real concern. <br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The staff does not stack with our regrowth spell (or higher versions).  also you have to click it to get it on, and the snare rather sucks.<br />
<br />
The tunic, on the other hand, is always on, stacks with all our regen spells, and has no negatives.<br />
<br />
I'd keep going for the tunic, it's well worth it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Free clickys are always good.  I use staff to get rolling after a res in and sometimes while exping.  The only real downside to it is that you can't click it from inventory and don't really want to keep it in primary because of the stats you sacrifice.</div></div><hr />

In outdoor zones if you get good at it (just takes practice) you can fire off staff while the mob is inc, kill the mob with benefits of free regen, then re-apply SoW boots immediately after. It gets to the point where you don't even have to think about it.<br />
That being said, Fungi Tunic is still even better. The regen stacking with everything and being always on is just fantastic.<br />
So to answer your question: Don't give up on the tunic, but don't get rid of the staff :)</div></div><hr />

I would keep the staff, but compared to the tunic, the staff is nothing.</div></div><hr />
