<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The scource code for win2k and NT4 operating systems has been leaked finaly tot he internet. This also includes winXP users since winXP is basicly win2k with cosmetic upgrades.<br />
<br />
With this leak i want to warn you all to be on the look out for worms/viruses/trojans etc. Something like this is a hackers dream. Even worse this isnt a hackers dream in the sense that a true hacker is going to be happy for, but something like this is really a dream come true for the lower level hacker that pretty much sits at home and looks for trouble to make kind. I know you can pitcure the type and i know i know the type.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to bring this to light that from now on you might wanna really keep a eye on the update.microsoft.com site to see what is going to be released for fixes. There are already 8 serious flaws to the OS that will let people waltz right in and do what they want fairly easy. These flaws that exist are not difficult to utilize for malicious intent, meaning it doesnt take a 20 year coding veteran to do this. On a plus side microsoft has address atleast one of the 8 issues with a recent patch. On the downside it took them 7 months to do it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just keep a eye out like normal for strange e-mail attachments. If you do have a e-mail with a attachment from a friend, try to verify that he did send it cause these worms/viruses will send from their computer and contact lists and you would never know thw wiser unless you asked.<br />
<br />
No the sky isnt falling, but I urge everyone here to take somewhat hightened precautions over the next few months while the preverbial shizit hits the fan on this. Just be careful and spread awareness to people you know if you so the tides can be stemed some what.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like i said, off topic yes, but i felt it was very important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks Lit,<br />
I apprecaite you taking the time to warn us!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This seems vaguely familiar, but I can't figure out why...<br />
<br />
All kidding aside, thanks for posting this.  Open source for windows is definately not a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kayleigh88</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ya i read about it on yahoo<br />
http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=562&amp;e=15&amp;u=/ap/microsoft_source_code<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand why it hasn't happened sooner, because there are so many (organizations) out there that have access to the source code,&quot; said Marc Maiffret of eEye Digital Security Inc. of Aliso Viejo, Calif.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">.Doing a quick calculation, we can expect the other 7 flaws being adressed till end of March 2008 ...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Np, helping anyone realize that this is if nothing else, something to keep a eye on, helps everyone on the net. Im actualy tempted to give linux a try again now that Everquest works in it ;)<br />
<br />
Im just glad it was taken seriously and not met with  &quot;omg this isnt teh shaman news, delet0rz it  /bad rep /bad rep. <br />
<br />
Seriously though. Glad to help. Off to work now :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">when EQ moves to DX9, it's likely that winex will not work for EQ.<br />
<br />
BTW, this doesn't have to be an entirely bad thing.  Alot of good could come from this, if not directly from MS and it's supporters.  People have been whining for MS to open their code up for years.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you are fairly computer literate and really want to try Linux again and want to learn about it (as opposed to just using it) I suggest Gentoo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yea i heard about Gentoo, i been mostly a mandrake/redhat fan for years. I used to run Mandrake as my main OS, but guess what make me stop?<br />
<br />
Everquest lol<br />
<br />
Thats right folks, total lack of dependancy on MS for anything and it was all brought down cause i was sick of dual booting just for Everquest, which i played heavily at the time.<br />
<br />
Ill look into that, but you also bring up a very good point. It might be worth waiting to see how the dx9 thing works out. No point in switching for 2 weeks then having to blow out the MBR and start over in windows =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I completely agree that anyone with a MS operating system should visit the MS update page on a weekly basis:<br />
<br />
http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp<br />
<br />
Litgruv's post made it sound like the entire source code had been leaked. That's still under investigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I completely agree that anyone with a MS operating system should visit the MS update page on a weekly basis:<br />
<br />

<br />
Litgruv's post made it sound like the entire source code had been leaked. That's still under investigation.<br />
<br />
The 203MB file expands to just under 660MB. The entire source code is believed to be about 40GB, meaning that the file circulating would be only a fraction of the full code base--if it is authentic.<br />
Ruiu (security consultant and the organizer of the CanSecWest security conference), who has seen the file, believes it to be authentic. &quot;It looks real,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't build Windows, however. It's just a bunch of chunks of the operating system.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's definitely not a good thing if black hats have the source code,&quot; said Oliver Friedrichs, senior manager with antivirus company Symantec's security response center. If the source code has been released, &quot;the underground can look at the code without legitimate security researchers being able to find vulnerabilities first.&quot;<br />
But Microsoft downplayed any security issue.<br />
&quot;If a small section of Windows source code were to be available, it would be a matter of intellectual property rights rather than security,&quot; Microsoft said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Im not trying to scare people and make it a big deal. When this story was first released it was in the light that the whole source was actualy released, infact MS made a statment saying it was true. However Glori is correct, its still being looked into. <br />
<br />
Anyway just trying to pass information that i feel can help. Any relivant info i find ill keep posting here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fallonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But from a security viewpoint, the most secure operating system will be an open source OS.  Keeping a system secret means that security experts cannot look for security holes, truly hammer the code, etc.  There is a reason why encyrption algorithms are public.<br />
<br />
Although in the short term, getting access to the source code of a poorly written OS could cause problems (i.e., Windoze).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I believe the full Win2K source code has been out in the wild for a few years.   If so then nothing really has changed from status quo, aye?<br />
<br />
On the topic of an open source OS, I would be inclined to agree that the most secure OS will be an open source one.  Open source != Linux, of course, but in principle an open source OS at least has the potential to be properly secure - be it Linux, a BSD unix variant, or something thoroughly unforeseen :)<br />
<br />
Of course, there are other factors to be considered.   For one, just because an OS is open source doesn't make it a secure OS.   Also, the same principle that applies to, say, a cryptographic algorithm doesn't necessarily apply to an operating system;  the security of a crypto algorithm comes from withstanding years, even decades of concerted efforts to find weaknesses in it by the brightest minds in the academia and in the military.  Applying the same principle to an OS would mean that in order for it to be secure we'd be using stale, ten-year-old technology.<br />
<br />
Sure, it'd be secure but you could forget about MPEG-4 movies and MP3 players..<br />
<br />
How 'bout an open source OS that's also being commercially developed in the sense that a corporation throws as much manpower into it as Microsoft does in addition to the peer-review...?</div></div><hr />
