<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SO I've signed up for my first Fear raid.  I'm not really holding any hope of getting a Tear on my first trip.  My expectations for this raid are purely educational.  Here's a link to my Magelo:<br />
<br />

<br />
Is there anything that I need that I dont have?  Is resist gear a necessity?  More HP gear?  I have an iksar regen bp that I can pull from another char if needed.<br />
<br />
I plan on obeying the first law of raiding:  do what I'm told!  :D <br />
Is there anything else that I need to be aware of?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pull the ikky bp, you'll like the regen. The extra AC and 50 hp on the barbed won't really help alot if you get wailed on by an unslowed mob, or alot of them. If you get wailed on by a slowed mob, you'll live regardless of the ac/hp missing from the barbed. <br />
<br />
If you are 53, you probably won't be the main slower, that prolly being the case, don't initially slow jack unless there are multiples. If you ARE the main slower, then wait until you hear the sound of the poor bastard that has Tash duty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Normal armor dropping mobs in Fear were originally done with the level 50 cap in place, your gear looks good at a glance. You should do fine.<br />
<br />
Resist gear is really only needed for Terror I think (cold resist) and maybe Draco (disease?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Now would be a VERY good time to invest in a horse.  Don't worry about speed or looks - just get the horse.  Aggro in the planes is legend and you can get a train just by looking in a direction.<br />
<br />
Depending on how break-in is done - if you get aggro while headed to the SS (pay close attention) STOP and DIE.  Yes you heard me correctly.  Let me put it a different way -  DON'T TRAIN THE SAFE SPOT!  Now I realize this sounds like I'm exagerating the danger but I'm not.  As a matter of fact I'm not being frank enough.  OTOH if someone does train the SS then after the 3 or 4 hour CR they will have an idea of what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
A level 60+ group can break Fear by themselves.  The problems always come with people not listening.  <br />
<br />
Anyway - Get a horse,  Get your Ikky BP.  Resist gear would be nice but second to the horse.  When you get teleported away from the group (scarlings i belive) STOP!  /Loc. Look around and Wait 30 seconds.  If your not being attacked and nobody is headed your way then and only then head back to the Group.  Remember your job. And that is?  STOP and DIE before you train the SS.  Slowing/healing/CC/dps all come second to NOT TRAINING THE SS!  Know who to consent.  bind near the portal (there is a rock just left of the entrance tunnle that is safe from roamers.)<br />
<br />
You will get adds, it can be alot of fun, aggro is HUGE and CR's are a royal bitch.  You will have fun :D <br />
<br />
Buy a horse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Been to Fear many times so I'll just list some observations and suggestions.<br />
<br />
1. Terror Tentacles are not you friend.  The have a large range debuff.  If these guys are pulled to the camp you can quickly debuff the whole raid.<br />
<br />
2. For AE MoBs I would wear all the MR gear you have.  I like to get my resists as high as possible.<br />
<br />
3. Do not sit down unless you are told you can.<br />
<br />
4. Maloxx is your friend.  There will probably be lots of adds so you will need to help the chanters as much as you can.  Maloing adds will make it easier for them to do thier thing and easier for you to root.<br />
<br />
5. Do not wander.  The fastest way to wipe a raid is wondering around and agroing a bunch of MoBs. <br />
<br />
You didnt say anything about who is going with you.  If it is a group that has been to Fear a bunch you should be ok.<br />
<br />
Even the easy Golem is nasty.  The best is when someone agroes Fright or Terror and he does an accros the zone DT.</div></div><hr />
