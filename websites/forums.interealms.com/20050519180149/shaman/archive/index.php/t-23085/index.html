I've checked here and a bit at Graffe's, and didn't see it.  Does anyone know the actual % increase or % chance to get a crit nuke with FoM1-3 and FoMM1-3?  Thanks.<br />

Fury of Magic<br />
(FoM)  Level 1: 3<br />
Level 2: 6<br />
Level 3: 9  3  Increases the chance of landing a critical hit with a direct damage spell. The amount it increases your chance to land a critical nuke is unknown. This spell works on regular nukes, such as Velium Strike and Spear of Torment as well as our rains, Tears of Saryrn and Torrent of Poison. Critical nukes at this level will double the base damage of the hit and then add any increase from damage enhancing focus effects on top.<br />
<br />
Requires: Level 3 of Spell Casting Fury (Archetype Ability). Level 61 for training rank 1, level 63 for rank 2 and level 65 for rank 3. <br />
<br />
 What Rombus over at Graffe's  (http://www.graffe.com/)  thinks about Fury of Magic Mastery...<br />
<br />
&quot;Once all critical abilities are trained, the Wizard has an 18-19% chance at delivering a blast worth double it's normal value (provided it is not partially or fully resisted). A very worthwhile AA.&quot;<br />
Obviously less worthwhile for us since our nukes are lousy in comparison to a Wizard's, but I have FoMM &amp; enjoy critting for over 2k with Velium Strike and 1350x2 fairly regularly withTears of Saryrn.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know about how much it is, i was wondering if anyone knew the actual percent chance for those 6 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No one knows the exact percent, but I think its around 16% maxed for non-wizards.  I can say, though, that I noticed a significant increase as I trained the PoP crit AA's, but not so much with the GoD ones.  I'll turn on my logs for a few days and see what it says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I seem to crit quite a bit with only FoM 1 trained.  Yeah I'm running out of things to spend points on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lots of crits with FoMM3 here, that's about as technical as I get. Just remember to get crit aff3 as well and go at it like a crazed tank-mage ;)</div></div><hr />
