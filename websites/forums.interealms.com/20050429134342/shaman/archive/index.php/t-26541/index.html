<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just bought a Compaq GX5050, since my old desktop wouldn't run anything worth a damn anymore and my laptop isn't upgradeable. It's got an AMD Ath 3800 2.4+ processor, 512ram, and an Nvidia GeForce FX 5700 card. Figure it'd run WoW nicely, right?<br />
<br />
Wrong. After about 2 minutes in game the screen itself freezes, and sound begins to loop, though you can't tell it's looping unless you listen closely. The mouse still moves and everything, with the WoW in-game cursor, but you can't select anything since the screen is frozen.<br />
<br />
Updated to the most recent card driver, scoured google, etc.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea what to do?</div></div><hr />

I play on Skullcrusher and some days its not worth logging on. If you think your machine needs more Powah! try another 512ram.</div></div><hr />

Found a solution, if anyone's having a problem feel free to PM me for a detailed guide to fix it. Apparently Nvidia screwed up their latest drivers, or Blizzard screwed up their most recent patch. It's beyond me how Blizzard can stick Nvidia logos all over their stuff and then not immediately fix a problem that 1000s of users with Nvidia (and rarely ATI) cards are having. Some people have lost months of playtime due to issues with errors, freezes, and lockups.<br />
