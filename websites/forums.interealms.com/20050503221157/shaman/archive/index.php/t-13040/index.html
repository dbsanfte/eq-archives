Bankrupt<br />
<br />
I Used the owoomp(sp?)  in Timorous.  He wasnt kos, but the ones around him are.  I just pulled them away and killed em.<br />
I didnt Have too much trouble with the yun shaman, couple hours without a tracker and i found one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having just done this quest recently here's a few tips. Now understand that this is from a Barb's point of view. <br />
<br />
1. Just do the turn in you don't have to talk to anyone at all.<br />
2. There are several post's about the Yun Shammie that you get the powder off of. Be careful though they are nasty, I used a 41 Shammie and 41 Ranger to do this part and he about killed both of us. Get some help for this one they cast real fast. Generally if you look at a map of TT you see where there is a wall around Seb in the SE corner. Right at that wall over in the SE corner, on the TT side of the wall is the best places to find them. I went there and was buffing when one flew by. 2 min later here comes another. NP.<br />
3. Get the crushed stuff in TD on Golra island. It's a ground spawn, again look back some of these posts about this quest to find exact loc.<br />
4. KC - talk about a PITA. KC in not as populated on my server as it used to be. Warlord was never up but the Beserker was. At 41 I got taken down by trains at least 2x before I learned when to zone. Trains here will flat mow you over at this lvl. I have a friend who has a 62 Shammie and he got me the bones and we MQ'ed this quest &lt;shrug&gt;.<br />
You need to be at least 45 to handle KC and thats at the gate and CY's. Not in further in the Hand room where he is supposed to spawn. Beserker is PH'er.<br />
<br />
Obtw it's worth it.  ;) My friend said just wait til 54 to get Canni 3. Man I was SO tired of Canni dancing and pressing that button continuously. The ratio IS better, and besides I splurged and bought a leezurd. Mana regen is ALOT better now. I read alot of posts here debating this subject and I have to say it's definetly worth it. Just get some help makes it alot easier.  :D</div></div><hr />
