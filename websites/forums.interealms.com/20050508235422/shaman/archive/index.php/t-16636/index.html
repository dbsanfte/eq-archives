<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kullann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried to find a thread through search with studies and data that proves what Dexterity does but havent been able to find one yet and so I turn to you guys.<br />
<br />
I believe what dex does but number of my guildies are misguided and wont belive what I say.. they think Dex affects how hard and often you hit and the guy who spread the misinformation is like a donkey. So I need some data to prove he is wrong because guildies listen to him 'cause he is old face in guild while I am new and I cant provide data in chat window :(. <br />
<br />
I would love to get some peice of data.. thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not sure where they got the idea that dex affected how hard you hit, I never heard that before.<br />
Here are a couple of things that I'm sure of-<br />
Dex can be used as the guiding attribute for determining how often you get skill ups doing the Fletching tradeskill. (you can also use wis or int if they are higher for you)<br />
Dex affects how quickly you gain skill ups in combat skills ie, 1hs, 2hs, etc.<br />
Dex affects the frequency at which your weapon proc goes off. Higher dex means more procs.<br />
A couple things I've heard but have never seen proved-<br />
Dex affects your ability to hit high AC targets<br />
Dex affects your damage mitigation ie, higher dex means you will get hit less. ( agility affects AC so I think people are getting these mixed up)<br />
I suspect the last 2 are untrue and have never given them credance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
instead of you disproving him...have him prove it~<br />
<br />
the ONLY thing that makes you hit for more damage (hit &quot;harder&quot;) is a higher atk...DEX does absolutely nothing to raise attack<br />
<br />
i'll go out on a limb and say the only thing that determines how often you hit is also your atk (compared to mob ac) and what class you are--i.e. priest is going to miss a hell of a lot more.  Its possible dex could help this..dunno if its ever been parsed out, but even if for some reason it did the % increase would be SO SMALL it wouldnt be justifieable (maybe 0.001% increase...).<br />
<br />
In any case..just because someone plays a game for a long time doesnt mean they are unequivocably right about game mechanics..maybe deguild if these people are that moronic..i know i would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">-If your dex is higher than your int and wis, then it's the stat used in determining if you get a skillup in fletching.<br />
-Higher dex increases the frequency of procs on your weapons.<br />
-Higher dex increases the rate at which you learn weapon skill, and I think it secondary attacks like flying kick, kick, bash, etc.<br />
-Higher dex increases the rate at which you critical attack.<br />
<br />
As far as I remember, that's the entire list of things that dex does as found out from tests done in the past, as well as this is everything that dex has been told to affect as per Sony.  (I think it's in POP expansion rulebook that it now correctly says what the various stats actually do).<br />
<br />
The only thing that dex might also do is affect the crit rate of DD spells, but I've never seen anyone do any parses to see if say, 100 dex made you crit a lot more than 280 dex, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The reason priests do not hit as hard is not because of their class Ruatonim, it is because of skill level. If you are capped at 175 you are not going to hit nearly as well as someone at 250, due to the difference in attack..you are on the right track but class has no direct link with how often you hit.</div></div><hr />

We're posting this for clarification, and because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a year.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here you go:<br />
<br />
DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often<br />
weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills;<br />
how hard you hit with bows<br />
<br />
STR: determines how much you can carry; influences<br />
maximum and average damage; influences how quickly<br />
you learn many offensive skills<br />
<br />
STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long<br />
you can hold your breath<br />
<br />
INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most<br />
skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all<br />
mages, as well as shadow knights<br />
<br />
WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes<br />
have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can<br />
learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT.<br />
<br />
CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC<br />
merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects<br />
the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells<br />
(charms in particular)<br />
<br />
AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive<br />
skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much<br />
damage you take when you are hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kullann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Woot thank you Steelbear. Thats exactly what I needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another reason we dont hit hard is damage tables, there are different ones for mellee and non mellee classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, I don't think there's a seperate table.  I think it's just a function of ATK (weapon skill, strength, extra +atk rating) and damage bonus.<br />
<br />
We don't have as good of weapon skills, we don't generally load up on +atk, we don't get a damage bonus.  Our str is just as good.  That's really enough to do it right there.<br />
<br />
Unless someone knows differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As I recall, they made it so that when you start a new character the tips window will display for each stat what it's game function is.   So the quickest and best way to prove to them what dex does is send them to the char creation screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dex also determines how hard Surikans hit for (All Range items...not just Bow.)<br />
<br />
Dex also effects the &quot;Finishing Blow Melee AA&quot; as that works off of Crits as well (use a range item you crit like crazy with them which makes the Finishing blow thing go off).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am not sure about weather there are damage tables or not ... I DO know however that shamans get the same ATK ceiling as SK's and Pali's.  I am courious myslef so to help settle Icebain and Rorgg's debate, I will parce damage against my friends 65 SK when we have even str, ATK, and a Peircing weapon.  I'll keep ya posted ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That won't quite do it -- the SK gets a damage bonus, we don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's exactly what I wanted to post, Caanus.  *grin*  If they won't believe what the GAME ITSELF says on the char creation screen, it's time to give up on em.<br />
<br />
On the semi- thread hijack topic - not getting the level-based damage bonus is (I think) what Icebain was talking about.  The one that shows up on the weapon.  Only real melee classes get that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There are different damage tables for different classes. Monks, for example, have a different damage table from other melee classes, and do more damage with the same weapons/skills because of it. <br />
<br />
This is hazy, and I don't remember the exact details. But some time ago, back when the &quot;melee balancing&quot; fixes were done, part of it was changing the damage tables that hybrids and bards used. I know that the bard damage table was changed, as I remember reading about it on the bard board. But I would likely get it wrong if I tried to explain exactly who is on what table and how they changed. Priests are on a weaker damage table than melee classes, resulting in even lower damage (along with lower skill caps, no multiple attack skills, no mainhand damage bonus, etc...). <br />

Someone told me it helped them with their mana regen.  Rather than get into an argument I took the easy route - it's included with HoS.  How in the world dexterity could ever possibly help with mana regen is beyond me.<br />
