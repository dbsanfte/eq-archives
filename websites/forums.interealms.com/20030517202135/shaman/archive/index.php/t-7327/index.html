<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else having problems getting into the game? After I select my character right before it gets into game it kicks me out to windows...anyone else having this problem?<br />
<br />
Wasnt having any problems till latest patch..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They may have made changes to the UI, I'm at work so I can't confirm.  Try modifying your characters .ini file so that it loads the default skin and see if that fixes the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Exact same thing happening to me.  I thought maybe my zone files screwed up so i delted em and repatched.  Still geting booted.  Also i used both my custom and default UI, still nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make sure RaidOptionsWindow and RaidWindow are in your EQUI.xml. Not only that, make sure you do not have a custom Raidwindow. Check out eqinterface.com for more help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boogaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kept happening to me today.  I updated my UI from the author's webpage (didn't go back to default) and now it is working fine.  I had to change my UI from the UI file since I couldn't get on to /loadskin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to have that problem.  Try updating your video drivers.  I have had a patch that conflicted with mine and caused it to crash all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's a custom UI issue. Patch your UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Acanthurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Happened to me too tonight.  Replaced my custom UI with default and was able to log on fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont think its that. I've had this problem off and on ever since I moved from the oldUI to the newUI. Improved UI my arse.<br />
<br />
To date, I have re-installed(with the latest  MS-approved drivers) video/sound/all zone files and run using the standard ui (no custom skins). I also reset all of my mobo settings down to their failsafe defaults.<br />
<br />
To put it another way, I think there are certain pieces of hardware/drivers that this game just doesnt like a whole lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Current Config<br />
=======<br />
IWILL KK266R MOBO (VIA)<br />
AMD 1.33G/266<br />
512MB Ram<br />
Visiontek GeForce 3<br />
Onboard (CMedia) sound<br />
<br />
Fortunately it only happens maybe once or twice a night. It's still pretty un-fun though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">woot did what Boogaba said and it works, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Are you using the Visiontek drivers or the Nvidia drivers?  I have an Asus card and was having the problem with the Asus drivers.  I switched over to the Nvidia driver set and the problems have not come back for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VisionTek is a pure reference board design, so I used the Nvidia ones. Thats definitely one nice thing about the video board mfgs being so lazy, no waiting around for updated drivers. It's just too bad this game is so finicky. I guess it's all my fault for not buying a 'Falcon' branded PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kalduin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Either change your UI back to default (go to you EQ directory and press &quot;u&quot;, you should find it, put the raid window stuff into your custom UI directory, or change the resolution via the options menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">if you are using a custom ui...this worked with icey blue<br />
<br />
go to default file after patching...copy both equi raid files...and paste them into ur custom...worked for me<br />
<br />
i was having same probs...all the way to toon selection..picked toon..crashed to desktop<br />
<br />
this fixed it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Belinor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its the EQUI and EQAnimations files together causing the problem.  They added a few new items to EQAnimation on the 21st and then added the two new lines to the EQUI on the 31st.  If you can, download a copy of Beyond Compare (Scooter Software (http://www.scootersoftware.com/))and run a side by side comparison of the default copy of EQAnimation and your copy in your customized folder.  Using Beyond Compare you can then just highlight the new sections from the default EQAnimation and copy them into your customized version.<br />
<br />
You can then either edit your customized EQUI with the two new raidwindow entries or just copy the default one into your customized folder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Having this problem as well after patch last night.   I'm using a custom UI and I was pretty sure it had to do with this. Didn't tinker with it much last night. Did delete default folder and it re patched all those files.. No success. I imagine if I find the settings file it'll show that i'm still trying to load the custom UI.  Sounds like an easy enough fix.<br />
<br />
Multiple places to change it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had this problem as well.  I copied the files from the &quot;default&quot; folder and pasted them into my custom UI folder &quot;ice&quot;.  I was able to log in fine after I did that.  Now to rebuild my fancy UI : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Belinor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For some reason the EQAnimation change on the 21st didn't cause problems until the new EQUI change on the 31st.  If you have a customized version of either of these files then you will need to add the new stuff to your customized version.</div></div><hr />
