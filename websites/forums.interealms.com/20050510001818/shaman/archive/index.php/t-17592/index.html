<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally ground out SCRM and am loving the fact that my buffs last longer.  I also have FA now.  It was driving me nuts recasting every 6.5 minutes on the melees.  It's not quite so bad now but I'm hoping peeps have some novel ways of keeping track of when FA wears off.<br />
<br />
I've tried casting on my pet but with all the spam in my chat windows I tend to miss it more often than not.<br />
<br />
I've also tried telling the main tank - you need to let me know when FA drops...and that's kinda hit or miss.<br />
<br />
I'd really rather avoid doing a stopwatch if possible.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of any good ingame solutions?<br />

You aren't using the pet buff window?  I find it pretty easy to tell at a glance when my pet loses FA and then I start the cycle again.</div></div><hr />

Duh ummm...no :)  I turned it off because I needed the screen real estate.  But ya know, that's the first good idea I've heard about turning it back on!<br />

 there you go. <br />
<br />
probely the best timer out there if you ask me :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UnderToad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">pet buff window is really cool<br />
even just showing 4 buffs it is very useful if u stack ur pets buffs properly<br />
<br />
cast regen and haste first so ull see at a glance that they are still up<br />
next cast primal essence or anything else that will be overwritten by avatar<br />
<br />
now comes the trick<br />
cast torpor as 4th buff and while torpor is still running quickly cast any remaining buffs u wish<br />
be sure to keep torpor running the entire time while finishing buffing<br />
<br />
this will leave an empty buff slot in ur pets 4th slot<br />
so while ur fighting u can see at a glance at all times if he is torpored or not<br />
when u cast avatar it will overwrite pe<br />
<br />
this allows u at a glance to see regen haste avatar and torpor at all times while still keeping the pet buff window at the default 4 buff size</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just know how long your FA last, and run a rotation; eg if my FA last 11.5 minutes, I run a 7-8 hard rotation on boss or 5-6 lazy rotation; that way it rarely drop and I can insert some random FA tell into rotation<br />
<br />
if it is exp group and there are only 2-3 people need it, just buff them in a row, they usually let you know when start drop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">with SCR1 i can keep FA on about 5 people, but no more.  It tends to wear off before i can recast at 5, but its about right.  It seems like there are always 4 people in my groups that want it..so ii usually use my pet as the timer and cast on the rest.  helps my pet's dps slightly at least :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ha ha, Undertoad, my pet NEVER has more than 4 buffs.  Focus, haste, FA (sometimes), Q (as needed).</div></div><hr />

You do realize you can resize the pet window and see ALL the buffs you have on your pet... Although If i remember correctly it only resizes horizontally not vertically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">eqwatcher.com - talking parser with buff module. May get on your nerves after a while though and timers get all screwed when people are dead, but then you just unload and reload the buff module.<br />
<br />
Speaks out other useful info too, like when a mob is gating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UnderToad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yes i know u can resize it but he was saying he had limited real estate on his screen for an expanded pet window</div></div><hr />
