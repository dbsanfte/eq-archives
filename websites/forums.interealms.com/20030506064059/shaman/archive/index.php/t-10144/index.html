<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got flagged in hedge last night and spent some time in a 7 man team killing inside TT at zone getting about 1.5-2%AA per kill.. repops were about 20-21 minutes apart.<br />
<br />
Anyone know some good maps/guides on this?  Don't really see much info on this zone.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>atarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats because there's essentially nothing in PoNB except the road to terris, and her 'lair'. Its a primrose path to an interesting, if at first frustrating, encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How do you mean frustrating encounter?  Do you have any info you can share?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>atarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nothing that isn't already spoiled elsewhere no doubt, just learning the timeing, and knowing that you have a time limit lest respawn outside her building happen (they agro through the walls and can turn a good win into a bad loss).<br />
<br />
Not knowing how much is spoiled elsewhere (I really do try and avoid reading spoilers since it tends to make it less enjoyable overall for me personally), I'm loathe to go into more detail. So long as your guild understands that learning the encounter is part of beating the encounter, you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lets just say its my understanding that Terris has a few suprises up her sleeves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try her once and see her surprises. Then go back a second time and use what you learned the first time. It's a fun little battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guildless and only 60 so was merely curious whatcha meant by it.. but thanks for the heads up :)</div></div><hr />
