<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone heading to GenCon this year?<br />
<br />
Just my usual yearly question.  Look for me at the Master Europa table all weekend if ya do.  I will be wearing the khaki Globex hat, and others at the table will know my whereabouts if you want to hook up for food or bevies.<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ubiqu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GenCon never seems to be a big deal for the EQ community, which is too bad.  However, I am going to be there, I'm leaving tomarrow ;&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll be there, same deal.<br />
<br />
Look for me at Nascrag events with The Donut Disciples. I might even try to explain what these things mean if you find me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll be the person sitting wearing a faded shirt yelling 'mise!' in the CCG room, probably playing magic the gathering!<br />
<br />
Good luck finding me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have a *%$&amp;!*#&amp;# Fan Faire in the Midwest and I wouldn't have to go there, but I will if Sony/VI is going to have something on display. <br />
<br />
I don't wish to immerse myself, nipple deep, in pre-pubescent Harry Potters, Frodo Baggins and scantily clad 400 pound Elven maidens unless I have to.<br />
<br />
Anyone know for sure if Verant is going to have someone there or PoP stuff on display?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">400 lb elven maidens!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I apologize for the hyberbole. That was just a rough guess based on some people I saw when I attended GenCon two years ago. Frankly, the two lovely ladies were probably no more than 350 pounds each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'll be at GenCon myself.  Look in the CCG area for the Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG) booth running Warlords TCG, L5R (Legend of the Five Rings) CCG and 7th Sea CCG.<br />
<br />
I will either be playing in L5R tournaments or helping to judge / organize tournaments for all their games.   If you go to the L5R table and ask for &quot;Naga Nik&quot; you will find me :)   BTW - many of the game design staff of AEG play EQ, most on Solusek Ro, and there are several direct references to EQ within Warlords.<br />

<br />
Again -- this one was also addressing a PoP game system question. If it's not done, we're not talking about it. <br />
<br />
That said, we did show and talk about some parts of PoP in May at E3, and will again do so this week in Milwaukee (where I'm actually typing this from a hotel room right now) at GenCon. <br />
<br />
What we won't be addressing are game system or advancement specifics. The team would unanimously like to have those solid before we get into any details on them. <br />
<br />
Avoiding foot-in-mouth syndrome is something we're really trying for. When we have the ability, we'd rather underpromise and overdeliver from here on out. <br />
