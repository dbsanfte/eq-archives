<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay I haven't played EQ since early summer '04, at which point I had all spells up to the GoD ancient cannibalize (and yeah, gates spells used to be difficult to attain, back when mobs dropped a specific spell rather than a broadly usable rune :)).  I was bored and browsing Lucy and noticed shaman have three new cannibalizes post-PoP... The OoW ancient, the lower OoW version, and the GoD ancient, all of which have an 18 second recast time.<br />
<br />
Anyway I was just kind of wondering, in extreme mana efficiency situations, like solo exp grinds, do you all keep two cannibalizes memmed... both the 18-second recast one and cannibalize 4?  Or is mana no longer an issue for DoT soloing?  Is the limiting factor more the number of DoTs you can keep memmed or just cast times vs. DoT durations?<br />
<br />
Hm, I miss EQ, but my server is devoid of high end guilds, how's the solo and one-group content in OoW/DoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope - combined recast timers. If you use Pained Memory, you can't use Can4 for 18 seconds anyway. Specifically to avoid what you're suggesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Solo and one group content in OOW is awesome, IMO.  I have had (and still do) incredible fun in OOW zones, both grouped and solo.  Getting 66-68 spell runes solo or grouped is a breeze.<br />
<br />
DoN is still pretty new but for now I must say I am having a lot of fun doing the one group missions.  They are more interesting than LDON's and (for me) the point-bought stuff is pretty dang nice.<br />
<br />
I just keep the OOW cann memmed (pained memory) and use Cann V.  That keeps me pretty efficiently caught up in most all group and solo situations.  Only time that gets a bit strained is if I'm say, debuffing, slowing, healing, AND throwing rains/DoTs out in a group. <br />
<br />
With your current gear and focii, pained memory and cann V should keep you pretty happy in mana, I would guess.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just my 2cp.<br />
<br />
EDIT--forgot to mention that we can now purchase a cheap AA extra spell slot (yay) and using spellsets to quickly swap dots etc in and out while soloing is such a beautiful thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Woah, a 9th spell slot? Heh that's awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">9th spell slot, 16th-21st buff slots, rez ability (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5880&amp;source=Live), aa group heal over time (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5935&amp;source=Live), infinite mana (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5932&amp;source=Live), phenominal cosmic power (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6667&amp;source=Live), and a cupcake.  Just forget about Alchemy for now, if you were into that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hrm, why would you say forget about alchemy with the new augments we can work on?  And since I can't click on the link, which spell did you link under Phenomenal cosmic power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably because they upped the skill cap to 300 and raised the trivials on augs accordingly, without putting in a new viable skill-up path. Unless you count the DoN potions which all require foraged/dropped components.</div></div><hr />
