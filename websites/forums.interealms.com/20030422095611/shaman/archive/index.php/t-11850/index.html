<br />
I dont post here much, but one of the many avid lurkers, great site!<br />
<br />
Been looking into upgrading my BP and got it down to 2 now.<br />
<br />
I know HP/AC are good things, but just not sure id the 15hp a tick regen on the fungi would offset the extra HP/AC on the TECT<br />
<br />
My gut tells me I should get the Fungi, just because every 21 seconds I get the HP of the TECT back!<br />
<br />
Just looking for a sanity check really, or any other proposals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea I went and got stoicism the day the Crucible come back up and I found out more about the quest.<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you kind of answered yourself, you said that you have no downtime due to stoicism.  If you have no downtime, they you realy don't have a NEED for the fungi.  Save the extra pp and get the Tae Ew for the AC+stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorted by AC (x2) and Hit Points (x1) on Allakhazam's for droppable Chest pieces, the Tae Ew Chain Tunic is No. 4. That's a BP that's not only droppable, but  player crafted. Since #'s 1 and 2 require drops from the elemental planes, and #3 ruins CoV faction, the Tae Ew is an excelent choice. You really can't get any better unless you can get your hands on a No Drop bp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">really the only real question is why you might even think this.  What is going to help you more in the long run.  The fungi is really only valuable for say the first 49 levels...but when it comes down to straight fighting in the PoP zones and such..you will not survive with a fungi.  Yeah, the regen is nice, but when you are getting doubled in the 300s every hit, then you will want the extra hps and especially the extra ac that you get from it.  If you want a BP to use early on that is invaluable, then choose the Fungi.  If you want something that you will prob. keep for a really long time, then get the Tae Ew Chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used the Fungi Tunic up until I got lvl 60, and Cannibalize V.  I group lots, and don't do a whole lot of tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My BP is comparable to the Tae eww but solo I'd still rather have a fungi and I'm lvl 65. In a group situation I'd much rather have the Tae eww. Do the math and Fungi is like having FT7 or FT8 cant remember. The difference between the two solo in pop zones imho isnt realy noticable. If I'm ever healer/slower in a pop group I still throw on the fungi at times.<br />
Depending on the prices I'd buy whatever is cheaper or if same buy the fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tae Ew would be much cheaper.  The pre-crafted tunics are only 15-20'ish, but the blood is easy to get, so you could have someone craft it for you.  Much simpler than a fungi camp, or dropping 50k on one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tae Ew is what im gonna get apart from anything else I got 9 blood together now :)<br />
<br />
Smith said he will do the combine for 8 blood (yea 4 times what he needs but /shrug a lot cheaper that trying to raise Smithing)<br />
<br />
All being well I can get a shield at the same time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a Spirit Callers Bp banked for when (and if) I get Torpor (havent bothered with Stocisim yet, RL keeps rearing its ugly head) until then I will wear my Fungi....but if I didnt have the Spirit Callers banked, I would sure go for the Tae Ew (and given the stats I still might).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Guildie just made me a Tae Ew tunic, so I have the luxury of holding on to both for a bit to see what I want to do.<br />
<br />
First off, that tunic puts my unbuffed AC DAMN near 1k, which just makes me happy on its own.  But I think I'm going to hold on to both for a while for one simple reason.<br />
<br />
When it hits the fan, I need that regen.  Once everything's slowed, I need mana (regen) a LOT more than ac, and switching the fungi back on last nite was the difference between winning and gating for us.<br />
<br />
Raid wiped and you're trying to get everyone going FAST?  You'll wish you had that fungi in your pack.<br />
<br />
Fungi is a PL'ing toy for everybody but shaman and monk.  Maybe a downtime soloing tool for some melee types.  For us, it's still a powerful tool, and the reason we'll be FM and buffing before the last corpse gets a click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Buffcake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you're talking droppable BP, then the Tae is a nice one.  If that's not a requirement &amp; your guild is Vindi-capable, I highly reccommend the Chestplate of Vindication for any shaman (check my Magelo for stats).  I still use mine @ 65</div></div><hr />
