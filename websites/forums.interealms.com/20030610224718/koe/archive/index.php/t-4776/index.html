<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow sounds like a good night for alot of people Congrats all who got something.<br />
<br />
Bearan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Varrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey guys  :)<br />
<br />
Had a great time in Hate last night, that would have to be one of the best mini Hate runs I've been on. Very few deaths, lots of cool stuff droppin for folks, an excellent job was done by all.  Thanks for the invite, Kithal had a great time. Feel free to gimmie a holler next time you head up, I'd be happy to attend.<br />
<br />
Take care my friends, I'll see ya in Norath.<br />
<br />
*was that Ransure I just saw running by in green tights?*  hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow!<br />
<br />
Quite the loot list. I knew it rained Cleric armor in hate, but 3 BP in one raid is still a ton.. I am glad none rotted and they will be put to good use. <br />
<br />
Congrats to all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">nice haul, and 3 cleric bps! I think the key is for me not to be there. The tales of woe when I was in need of one lasted over a year. My faction is so bad there that even to this day Mobs head right for me while I'm standing up and haven't cast a heal yet. <br />
<br />
Nice drops in maidens also, I have been there once and I think the key is to find a camp spot out of pathing agro.<br />
<br />
I wish I could stay up as late as many of you :(<br />
<br />
gratz all on the upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grats everyone. That's a lot of nice stuff.<br />
<br />
Where did that stuff drop in Maiden's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">we had a great time in hate !!!<br />
<br />
We also had quit a few gems drop<br />
<br />
:D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WHOA!!! EM night in Hate!!! Grats guys :)<br />
<br />
Kly, Bear, Sham, V, Falino and Anuin were all in Maiden's too for a bit and had 2 of the melee idols drop, 2 shrouded medalions and one o the caster necks. The necks all came from the Xi thingies in the long robes, and the idols came from Goranga Scouts. Also we had a 9/20 1HB and a 12/23 5AC 5 Str 1HB drop from the gorangas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmmmm...<br />
<br />
I'll take one of those, and one of those, and one of those.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who else wants to go shopping in Maidens tonight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">mememememememe. =)<br />
<br />
Bem, we were set up in the dome in front of the akheva zone, where we were using the horrible pathing to see who could make the mobs most angry as they came to us, ran back to the entrance, then followed the wall back to us again. =)<br />
<br />
The other group was set up pretty much on the exact opposite side of the zone, in another ruined temple like thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Congrats on the Hate gear, folks.   Sounds like a barney loot evening!  :D <br />
<br />
<br />
Moe, I've been trying to get together a semi-regular Maidens group for a while now.  There is a lot of other stuff in that zone that is just about one step down from ToV gear.  I'd love to spend a couple nights there with a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meiwyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Woot!<br />
<br />
Had a good time in Hate, thanks for the invite :)<br />
<br />
Would love to go to Maiden's.  Count me in!<br />
<br />
Meiwyn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The other group.....was set up by the Overlord Spawn point near the DP zone inside the ruined city.<br />
<br />
This is a great place...it is away from the people that are pulling towards the zone and we had no one (except Traz, and Nolani when they came to collect their belts) come anywhere near us.<br />
<br />
Add to the list that in the Ruined city they drop spells from the Xi mobs...we got a Cleric Spell(forget the name) Grats Infinate....and Spirit of Eagles Grats Barain.<br />
<br />
Side note where we were the mobs range from lvl 52 to lvl 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hi there!<br />
I have been grouped with KoE in the past and Canelek was nice enough to invite me along last night. I had sooo much fun.  I really enjoy grouping with you all. It was so amazing watching the mezzing and pulling.  You all know your stuff.  Anyway, I was lucky enough to get a revultant (I think that is spelled right) whip.  It is so nice!.  I realliy like it.  But, that was just a very niced added bonus because I had a fun time and got to see Hate for the first time.  Thanks so much Keepers for letting me come along and for the whip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Had an awsome time last night in Hate. We got off to a rocky start with 2 groups getting creamed but after that we kicked some ass. I would really like to thank Traz for helping me get this raid going, was my frist attempt to lead a raid and Traz was a huge help. Grin did great at our main tank, Hal did great job of pulling, our chanters kept our adds locked down and our clerics for keeping us tanks on our feet. We had textbook kills on Maestro and the other big ass stone thing(I forget the name). Thanks again all for coming, we got some great upgrades and had a lot of fun. Also like to thank Imas for helping me pick up the stones doing a great job of Crowd Control for us. Gratz again all that picked up some drops. I am thinking about doing another run in about 2 weeks, there are still a bunch of us that could use some upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">OMFG 3 EM BP ????? Never seen so many drop in one PoH run :p<br />
<br />
Grats to all on the nice gear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nekky I would love to go on the next raid with you all. Please let me know when you plan it.  I was already in a group that night and didn't feel right leaving them once I committed to it. But I would love to go next time.<br />
<br />
Grats to everyone who got all the great drops. :)</div></div><hr />
