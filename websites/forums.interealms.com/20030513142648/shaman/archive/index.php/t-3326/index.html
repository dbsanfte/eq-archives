<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am thinking on doing the coldain military wristguard quest but you need both coldain and kromrif faction to do this. Both have to be at least dubious. <br />
<br />
My faction right now is KoS to Kromrif and I think maybe ally to coldain. I have heard some people talk about being able to get both factions but it is supposed to be hard. Anyone know anything about this. I have searched the boards and haven't come up with anything on how to get both factions at the same time.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lumppy, don't bother.  Seriously.  Just have a friend make a troll warrior worshiping rallos zek and have a druid port it to Kael.  It will be dubious automatically, and can do the kael parts of the quest.  My understanding was that a troll warrior on Rallos Zek faction started out dubuious to both Kael and Thurg.  Believe me, you don't want to try to fix your faction.  You can switch, but without slaughering your coldain faction, the amount of work to get Kromrif and Kromzek to non-KoS status is staggering.  By the way, you will need both Kromrif AND Kromzek for the quest.  While the quest mobs are Kromrif, they are surrounded by see invis Kromzek mobs.  I believe the guy you need to speak to is under the ice bridge to Tormax's throneroom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">or if you dont have friends that will help, you can make your own troll.  Just get a bind for your troll in Thurg.  Run to CC, not that hard to avoid mobs.  Usually people are killing orcs at fort so you can walk right in, if not, get an invis to go inside CC.  Get your main to kill orcs inside until the acid drops.  Log on troll to loot.  Get killed, you will go back to Thurg with all your stuff.  Its like gating.  Turn in acid.  Have main kill wolves til harness drops.  Give harness to troll, you can drop on ground and log on troll or just hand to someone to hand to troll.  Have troll run to Kael, do turn in. Get killed to gate to Thurg, get an invis and run to Broodmother cave.  If she is not up just camo and check periodically to see if she is up.  When she is up park your main in front of coldain mines.  Turn harness of control to BM, log main, and wait for her to come.  DO NOT attack Korf before BM arrives, he will not drop the bracer.  Take out Korf when BM arrives, get bracer.<br />
<br />
Oddly when you hand in your harness in to Kael, the quest giver handed me back the same harness PLUS the harness of control.  Dont know if this works for everyone but it happened to me twice.  Therefore you can repeat quest as many times as you want and all you need is the karcin acid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks folks.<br />
<br />
I took your advice and had my brother create a troll warrior on his account. I twink it and powerleved it to level 10 in 2hrs 10min just so we would not have to worry as much when traveling. We then completed the quest twice in an afternoon. Got one bracer for my Shaman and one for his level 60 Necro :) Can do the quest for friends now in an hr as long as the Mother is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can a 52 Iksar Shammy do this quest solo?  Of course, I'd make the troll warrior too but taking down the other mobs, can they be done solo?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only tough fight in this quest is the final fight against Korf Brokenhammer. He is a level 55 ??? drof that can be rooted and slowed. This guy is a piece of cake to a level 60 and I personally think quite doable to a level 52 so long as you get the slow in and you have really good gear (and a strong heart because it will be beating). I would take along a high level back up just incase I got in trouble. I tried to solo the dorfs in the cave in my early to mid 50's but was unable to get a solo pull so always made a run for it, but I think I could have soloed one if I could have gotten one solo.  If you can solo a frost giant elite I think you can solo this guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zephreus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He didn't take the harness when I did this last week, either.. just the gem, gave the mule ogre the control harness.  <br />
<br />
Also, Korf is NOT 55 when you kill him for the quest, he despawns as a lower level version - he was light blue to 60, hit for about 117 max, nothing special.  I did take a dwarf faction hit for killing him.. couldn't have been much though, as I'm still ally to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is there any scenario where the brood mother might eat the harness?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK, finished this quest tonight using a level 1 mule. I did this:<br />
<br />
1.  Made level 1 troll warrior worshiping Rallos Zek. Left Neriak and went immediately to Plane of Knowledge and he had a lot of fun goofing around there, talking to the pretty ladies and petting the kitties. Then he went to the Great Divide and on to Thurgadin.<br />
<br />
2.  Some nice soul shrunk him as he entered Thurgadin so he didn't have to walk around stooped over. Couldn't find a soulbinder so asked in ooc for a nice person to bind him there.<br />
<br />
3.  Headed back out to Great Divide and on to Eastern Wastes. Two people stopped him to ask if he was lost and explained that this zone was probably too dangerous for him. Troll explained, in his most elegant troll vocabulary, that a pretty shaman was paying him in rabbit meat to die for her. Both of them were nice enough to buff him and wish him luck.<br />
<br />
4. Made it to the RyGorr fort in the center of EW without incident. Someone was pulling orcs out of the fort so he was able to run around the wall to the Crystal Caverns entrance and zone in. At that point he camped and the shaman logged in.<br />
<br />
5. Took shaman to Crystal Caverns and bopped orcs on the top level until one had the bottle of karsin acid. Made sure path was clear back to troll, and camped. Logged troll in and looted acid, then troll found an orc, punched him, and found himself back in Thurgadin.<br />
<br />
6.  Took bottle of acid to Erdarf in The Holy Harbinger, a bar marked as location 18 on the eqatlas map. Gave Erdarf the acid, he took sick and left, and dropped a gem of persuasion.<br />
<br />
7.  Troll left Thurgadin and headed to Kael Drakkel via Eastern Wastes. He was dubious to the giants so it was an easy trip thru Kael to the wolf trainer. The trainer is located under the bridge leading to King Tormax's Throne Room. Location is approximately neg 1100, pos 1700 on the eqatlas map. You can see a spot of water directly east of the bridge. It looks like there's a down slope on the left side just before the bridge, but there's ice everywhere and he slid into the water. He got out ok, slid over to the wolf trainer, turned in the gem of persuasion, and received a giant gem of persuasion. He turned in the giant gem and received the giant control harness. <br />
<br />
8.  Troll jumped in the water, drowned himself, and returned to Thurgadin. He then went back to Great Divide and followed the river to the shardwurm caves. A group was pulling the shardwurms so it was an easy trip to the broodmother. He entered the caves from the north end and stayed up on the left-hand wall. He took the first passage on the left, and then the first left into a double chamber. The broodmother is in the back chamber. The troll was able to tiptoe between the two guardian shardwurms and camp behind the broodmother, as he was indifferent to her.<br />
<br />
9.  Had a wizard friend position himself on a hill southwest of the Coldain Velium Mines entrance, at approximately neg 6300, neg 3200. Moved shaman to position directly north of the shardwurm cave entrance, camped her, logged on troll, and turned in harness to broodmother. Broodmother immediately started walking out of the chamber and headed toward the north end of the caves. Camped troll, logged on shaman, and had plenty of time to see the broodmother shamble out of the cave, turn east, and head southeast toward the coldain mine. Shortly after the harness turnin, two coldain dwarves spawned outside the cave entrance, and the wizard targeted Korf. It took another 2-3 minutes for the broodmother to wander over to the cave. She attacked one dwarf and Korf took off southwest across the hill. He resisted roots and snares from the wizard, and kept running. The shaman was finally able to aggro him with some spell (can't remember which one, sorry) and rooted him, nuked him down, and looted the wristguard. The wizard was supposed to camp to avoid the faction hits, but stayed to make sure Korf didn't get away. Took negative hits for Dain and Coldain, and positive hits for Kromrif and Kromzek.<br />
<br />
All in all, a fun quest with a satisfying ending. Korf conned dark blue to a 50 wizard and 50 shaman, definitely lower that when he is inside the caves (conned red there). You should be able to solo this at level 50, and maybe lower. If you are going to solo, I would recommend camping the looter at the mine entrance. You will have 2-3 minutes to summon and buff a pet, if you want to. I lost mine while following the broodmother, so we just nuked. We did ooc some notices to the zone while the quest was in progress, asking people to leave the broodmother alone until after the quest was over.<br />
