<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winteris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's a silly question, which I'm asking mostly because I'm feeling wicked powerful with my new level 34 spells. *flex*<br />
<br />
I know shaman (or shamans, I don't want to start that old argument *grin*) eventually become capable of having some pretty bloody impressive solo kills at the end level. What I'm wondering is: does anybody know of any fun &quot;baby trophies&quot; shaman could handle early on? Silly stuff, named's around one's level? <br />
<br />
I'm just looking for a challenge but not stuff that's a guaranteed death-night. Plus I'd love to hear what some of the kings of the hill here have accomplished at my level. <br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, for giggles and just to see if I could do it, I went after hill giants in RM at 34. At that time, it was quite a challenge, spine chill spear and SBS got quite a workout. Sometimes dogdog lived, sometimes not, but it was always a good fight. Sand giants in SRO were fun too, did manage to get the AC a few times while I was there. That sure went a long way getting money for gear selling that MQ. Named mobs at 34 though, I can't really think of any around that level to go after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I soloed the AC at around 31 or 32.  Did a few HGs and SGs also.<br />
<br />
When I was around 26 I accidentally pulled a red tae-ew something or other in Feerrott.  Managed to kill it.  I was proud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">best i killed at 34 was the corrupted HG in rathe, some ks'ing druid killed the tainted and the corrupted spawned and beat him to death.<br />
took 10 minutes but i won :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuibumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could match your skills against Chief Goonda in WK. He's a 34 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this thread reminds me... I need to go back and kill that big treant in NK.... he owes me from back in the day.<br />
<br />
As far as solo kills at 34 - someone mentioned the tae ew in CT but since the revamp all of the lower level lizards are outside in the swamp.  This might be a good place for you to test your skills.  Not 100% sure on their levels since things were changed - but at least a few of them still agro on me (lvl 65) when I have run past - so I'm guessing low 40s?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While you're in RM anyway, you could kill Tabien and Glaron.  I don't remember how hard Glaron was at 34, but Tabien's LoH made him a difficult fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Be careful of that treant in SK. Saw him one day as I was running thru and thought wth an easy kill...I was lucky to escape with my life (I'm lvl 65) The treant did not die. Talk about magic resistant...definitely mem and prep before taking on this guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Winteris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ooh. Giants. Since my last main, a ranger who never had a good kiting bow, was permanently and completely terrified of giants, I would LOVE to take a few down. Giants, cyclopses, *snarl* anything big and mean. Can't wait to give it a shot. <br />
<br />
Would the HG's in EK be a better first attempt? (Fewer roaming around, less chance of him picking up a friend, I would assume...) Or is Rathe roomy enough? <br />
<br />
Chief Goonda's a shaman, huh? I don't know if I want to fight him. I dread fighting shaman. Shaman are nasty in a fight. (Hee hee hee... Gawd I love this class.))<br />
<br />
Never thought of the AC, though. (Never killed him with any character in the past, either.) That would be a hoot. <br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon, Frostfang, sharpen those claws of yours. We're goin' cyclops huntin'.&quot; <br />

You mean the druid epic treant in NK?   I don't think there's any named treants in SK other than the infamous grizzleknot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You're not the only one that wants to kill that stinky giant tree! It's killed me about 3 times now, and corpsecamped me twice.  I despise that thing!  I also think that's the treant the druids do their final epic turn in at.  Imagine the poor dr00d that zones into NK thinking to do their final turn in only to watch poor Xannasuss (or however you spell its name) get dropped.<br />
<br />
Other mobs that are on my list:<br />
<br />
Ella Foodcrafter (another evil druid)<br />
Holly Windstalker (evil ranger)<br />
Dark Deathsinger (does he still exist?  I can't seem to find him in Innothule)<br />
Stinky little gnome necro in Rathe Mountains<br />
Hasten Bootstrutter (he ate my Ring of the Ancients!)<br />
Stinky little Troll in Neriak Third Gate.  When you're a troll in Neriak and see another Troll, you tend to assume it's friendly.  Great idea, Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Try the named goblin in the mines of lake of ill omen, I forget his name but I did him back in my 30s or so, he was really tough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did Glaron and Tabien at 32.  It wasn't easy.<br />
<br />
Tabien had to be kited to exhaust his mana.  I would hit him with a cheap dot then just run around till he healed himself and then did it again and again till his mana was gone then went in and tanked him down.  Took several tries to get it right.<br />
<br />
Glaron was much easier.  Just a straight up tank job and hit him hard with everything I had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You dont want to be messing around with the tae ews in feerott on the pyramids..they will all come running at you.<br />
<br />
I know this isnt something you could manage, but it reminds me i need to kill tundra jack in EF one of these days..tried once and had to gate as i went oom healing pet (wasted too much attempting to slow him &gt;&lt;), was level 62 at the time i think.<br />
<br />
You could also consider solo crawling some dungeons, maybe permafrost or attempting runnyeye.  Possibly solA is in this range.  cant think of anything named or otherwise around this level as a trophy though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oowomp in TD was fun at around that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ogrefiend in rather mountains might be fun. Assuming he still exists, and assuming that he still drops totemic you might get some old old old school uber loot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">HG's are a good choice :) <br />
<br />
I remember doing them and it took my poor old troll everything he had!<br />
<br />
The level range is large. My druid can still get exp from the odd one at 54; if the fight seems way too tough...it probably is :D <br />
<br />
Pull right back to a spot near HG area boundary; pretty much mountain walls all around. <br />
<br />
If you do this for some time, feel free to swear at the KS'ing droods. Note: if you pull a HG and it plops over dead and you get no exp, the droood that loots it may have been on it first. Having played both classes, the druid will kill it faster; all other things being equal. As a shammy I cursed my fair share of Ks'ing good=for=nothing ^%@^%@! druids. As a druid I have been accused of KS'ing when that was not the case.<br />
<br />
Lotta work but at least the coin is usually good. Have fun! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You could try the named cyclops in wk, and also in ek. Broon, froon, choon or something like that. Be careful of the on in ek, when ya kill him his big brother spawns and hes alot more nasty. The ones in wk spawn as a pair so ya probably gotta root park one then pull the other out of range of getting agroed when root breaks. Once they split should be easy.</div></div><hr />

As previously mentioned the two epic quest guys in RM are a great test.  They con around even at 34 and you would be fighting a pally and an SK.  A nice little test.  Plus you can solo pull them with adds to worry about.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">There's probably some good challenges waiting for you in guk (old world guk). I went there last night with my brothers bard to get him a DE mask. I was overcome with nostalgia from when it was _the_ place to grind from level 35-50 back in the day. I had the zone to myself, and was wandering around while waiting for the ghoul froggies to spawn. Doing things like taking the whole executioner room on at once (approx 7 frogs at one time) and wiping them easily was cause for a solid permagrin.<br />
<br />
Its mostly a graveyard to farm faction for the WE illusion quest and farm a few items.<br />
<br />
Try playing around with a couple frogs at the entrance of lower guk (zone in from the live side, not through the water or the entrance at the north side of the zone) and see how far you can get in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The gaurds are on a different faction from the Chief. It is possible to single pull him. I'm not sure of what faction they are on but were amiable to me at the time while Goonda was kos. I would usually just walk close enough to camp to aggro him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I would usually just walk close enough to camp to aggro him.<br />
Tried aggro range pull as well and got an HT before anything else, then ended up with a multi pull (LONG TIME AGO).  They might be on seperate factions, and Ghoonda likely has a larger aggro range due to relative lvl (guards are about 10-15 lvls lower).  Not sure how it worked that way for you.  I had previously hunted inside Ogguk, perhaps that trashed some faction, but I do know the guards assissted Ghoonda.</div></div><hr />

I used to farm the giants in DL and I would do this to take down Patriarchs (lvl 47 or so, hit for 120) when they spawned. I was low 40s at the time.</div></div><hr />
