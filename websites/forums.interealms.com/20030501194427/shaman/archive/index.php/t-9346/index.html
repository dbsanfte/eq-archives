That's all there seems to be here anymore.<br />
<br />
Bitch about this, bitch about that, bitch about every single aspect of the sinking game.<br />
<br />
If you hate the game so much, why are you even playing?  If you hate SoE so much, why are you supporting their product?  Do us all a favor and just leave the game.<br />
<br />
Damn people, this is a game.  It's supposed to be FUN.  If it's not fun, go do something else fer christ's sake.</div></div><hr />

More importantly, your pearls of wisdom have not only made me a better shaman, but have given me an entirely new perspective on the human condition.<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Discussing aspects that aren't perfect is within the purpose of a discussion board, don't you think.<br />
<br />
Christ I hate these posts.<br />
<br />
Yes, some folks post stupid whines.  Others post stupid whines about people whining.  Or bitching.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with chewing over opinions and views.  Or, we can read more threads about gear and where to solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
You missed the point entirely.<br />
<br />
Discussion != bitching / whining / crying<br />
<br />
I'm all for discussion.  That's the problem, we don't have any discussion left it seems.  All anyone does is scream and cry about perceived slights that they take waaaay too personally.<br />
<br />
And Litchebane ... you got me there, LOL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shame we can't click a &quot;bitch&quot; or &quot;whine&quot; message filter on and off.<br />
<br />
Haha! :)<br />
<br />
And for all you whiners out there:<br />
Shamans roxxor. Just S.T.F.U. and play the game.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;Whining&quot; and/or &quot;Bitching&quot; is highly subjective.  To me your post, Meener, is the epitome of worthless and meaningless.<br />

See what I mean.  It easy to label.  Now Grey this post Henora or Mojo :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you?   The Discussion police?    Who right is it to interpret what is worthy of talk ... comments ... or for that matter discussing things.<br />
<br />
My God man ... if we followed your own logic ... then based on the following quote ... If you hate the game so much, why are you even playing? If you hate SoE so much, why are you supporting their product? Do us all a favor and just leave the game.   ... leaves only the option of doing everyone a favor and YOU leaving the board.   <br />
<br />
These kneejerk reactionary statements kill me ... &quot;well just leave the game&quot;.    Anyone that pays for this game has the right to play it ... post on this board as long as Mod's allow ... and thumb their nose at you and anyone else.    It's call freedom of speech .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kind of sad, though, when we're starting to be regarded as the whinest classes around: <br />

<br />
Whatever ... I just took a nice trip through a couple boards.    This board and Shaman's in general don't have a lock on Whineage.    It's the current rage ... and if anyone wants to point to the common cause can only look at the breakdown of the Dev boards.<br />
<br />
The Dev and management group within EQ could shut this all down by taking a strong stand on things ... getting enaged into the community ... and starting to take some responsibility before 10,000 Druids petition it into their heads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heeeeeeey maybe we should write a petition too.<br />
<br />
But seriously now guys there are several bitchy posts now on in the general topic. Oh this spell sucks oh these spelsl are useless. what is our role etc.<br />
<br />
I enjoy playign my shaman and this board has a very good rep let's not ruin it folks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Avoree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Everything has a purpose, including &quot;whining and complaining&quot;. Sometimes, these threads bring to light the fact that there is a problem, that the game isn't all roses and sunshine. *shrug* I'm not much for whining myself, prefering instead to discuss the pros and cons of something, but I'm all for people expressing their opinions, even when they're negative.<br />
<br />
I refuse to believe we all absolutely adore this game, and think there's nothing wrong with it. Haven't you ever been frustrated enough after a playing session to just want to vent about it? I normally vent, bitch and whine to my hubby, who also plays - but I suppose that if I didn't have him, I might come here and do it!</div></div><hr />
