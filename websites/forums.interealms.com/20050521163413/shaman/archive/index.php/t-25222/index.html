<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seriously! I know there was one post about this, but the longer SOE waits the harder it will be for those that want to stay.  Even on a populated server rebuilding a guild is hard, but now with the numbers down from those who have left, it makes it worse.  Guilds are suffering for people to recruit and raids keep getting cancelled.  I know raiding isn't an exploit, so please try to help the ones that want to continue. <br />
<br />
I am posting this because it needs attention.  I know others have posted, but SOE needs to see this again.  The high level guilds that want to stick around are struggling.  The more time that goes by the worse this will get.  <br />
<br />
What is it going to take?? Obviously, people over at Sony don't know thier game that well if they aren't willing to even comment on this fact.  Rebuilding sucks, but doing it with low numbers and seeing it just get worse is harder.  <br />
<br />
Wake up people....this may be your last chance at rezzing a game.  Its like someone throwing them a rez box, and them being afk at a raid.  Hello McFly!!!<br />

<br />
The game was great fun and had a lot of subscribers before raiding was what it is today, mandatory. <br />
<br />
SoE would just adjust content in the future and instead of having to have 54 for an encounter you'd need 24. I prefer smaller guilds and raids, just like doing 1 group encounters for the epics, MPG trials is huge fun.<br />
The number of people you'd lose from those huge guilds, just because they think being 1 of 54 or 72 sheeps, where their contribution is almost meaningless in the grand scheme, is fun, would be about that of the people comning back who detest raiding in large numbers.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, the game can be challenging and fun for 24 just as much as it can be for 54 raiders, and if you think that when subscription numbers really start dwindling down SoE will keep on edsigning raid encounters for 54, thus making it impossible to raid, you are very short sighted, my friend.</div></div><hr />

Add the word &quot;uber&quot; in front of &quot;guilds&quot; for his true question.  The answer:  Just about all of them.<br />
<br />
Lots of small casual guilds are undergoing a renaissance now.  Sony shows some signs of recognizing that fact by (supposedly) setting up 1-group doable quests for planar access.  They need to scale zone progression to encounters doable by one or two groups of the zone-appropriate level.  They shouldn't scale down the major bosses of course, or their rewards, but with the population dwindling through annoyance, apathy, and frustration, they need to adapt to the realities of a smaller, far more casual player base.</div></div><hr />

With holidays and finals over soon, and people finishing their first month of WoW/EQII, I would not be a bit surprised to see tons logging back in to EQ1 in January.</div></div><hr />

Got to agree with this post.<br />
It is the &quot;Uber&quot; guilds that seem to be suffering more than any others.<br />
Wont mention any names but on BB it seems to be the uber zergy guilds that are suffering rather than the plain old uber guilds.<br />
Yep also a lot of casual guilds are losing players but they are also consolidating and looking stronger because of it.<br />

<br />
Currently, we're down to 2 Time, 1 EP (maybe 2, I don't visit boards enough to know for sure), 2-3 Luclin... and I couldn't tell you on pre-luclin but it's alot more than all the above combined.<br />
<br />
Only thing I have to say about it? The top 2 guilds, and were the top 2 before EQ2 and WoW and this &quot;silly season&quot;, have had their pick from the ones that've folded and seem to be plugging along just fine.<br />
<br />
My guild merged, then the guild we merged with folded, and now we're waiting to see what's next. Alot moved on to WoW, some stayed.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that guilds have lowered alot of req's and are willing to do more backflagging, etc, to keep things alive. What's the problem? If you're looking for a guild (like me) it's a buyers market for sure *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally I think that encounters everywhere should be retuned, so that they're doable also by 4-5 groups max and do not require 7-10 groups like it's now. Holiday season or not (and of course, it is such season :) ), the fact is that the EQ is no longer the only 'big' game out there in this genre and it's successors are actually pretty good, if not to say even better. So in the long run, while some people will return, more will probably leave. EU WoW isn't even released yet, which means that after couple of months, when it's out too, another big chunk of population from all the servers will leave. Not such an issue to US west coast guilds I guess, but on many servers east coast guilds also have a lot of EU players. And, of course, will be the biggest issue to EU guilds.</div></div><hr />

The problem with retuning is that you then trivialize encounters designed for 54 by retuning to 30.</div></div><hr />

No need to retune.  <br />
Item Mudflation is making this happen with little/no retuning necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds about like where my guild is at right now. On our server we had 6+ guilds before wow/eq2. The top guild didn't seem to loose to many. Most that moved to eq2/wow had already left for linage and such and what they did loose they seem to have replaced and they are moving right along. Behind them we had 3 guilds all about equal in progression. All 3 off us where at the uqua/qvic stage of GoD progression. The other 2 guilds folded in eq. My guild lost a few but not substantially and not much in critical areas but we've been able to replace them with selective applicants from the left overs of the other 2 guilds. The guilds behind us in the farming time stage got hit a bit but they both seem to have recruited a bit and doing ok again.<br />
<br />
Over all this seem to be hitting things harder than previous launches but I also think things are a bit sensationalized too. Guilds and high end guilds have always been loosing people. This is the first time I've seen entire guilds moving to another game but I think the issue looks worse than it is because of the releases corrisponding with the holidays. Once the holiday's pass and the new game smell wears off some I think things will be alot better.</div></div><hr />

If SOE havent been following the development of WoW for longer than 2 months they are indeed mad. Likewise Blizzard would be mad if they havent been taking note of all the mistakes SOE made/makes so that they can avoid them and maybe even make stuff that people want (unlike SOE which excels in telling people what to like).<br />
<br />
Most of you seem to forget that there are very few raid encounters implemented in WoW now. So it would also be a valid argument to say that even more people (the hardcore raiders) will leave EQ when WoW has stuff aimed at them.<br />
<br />
Its undeniably true that lots more will leave when WoW is released in the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
Its also important to remember that continually there are new people starting to play mmorpgs. If a new player can choose between EQ and WoW its hard for me to see why they should choose EQ.<br />
<br />
So the way I see it all of this will lead to fewer people playing EQ in the near future and unless something drastic happens also in the long run.</div></div><hr />

I am not going to argue with this prediction, on its face, but I do have some issues with the &quot;logic&quot; you used to come to this conclusion.<br />
If SOE havent been following the development of WoW for longer than 2 months they are indeed mad. Likewise Blizzard would be mad if they havent been taking note of all the mistakes SOE made/makes so that they can avoid them and maybe even make stuff that people want (unlike SOE which excels in telling people what to like).<br />
Of course SOE followed the progresssion of WoW. Why do you think they released EQ2 2 weeks earlier than WoW shipped? Pure marketing, plain and simple. <br />
<br />
And of course WoW learned a TON about whats good and bad about MMORPGs from EQs trials and tribulations, but there is a LOT to be said for the theory of &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot; and the theory of &quot;be careful what you wish for, you might get it&quot;. I am not going to bother trying to explain these things, but its honestly how I view a LOT of the &quot;stuff people want&quot; you mention. <br />
Most of you seem to forget that there are very few raid encounters implemented in WoW now. So it would also be a valid argument to say that even more people (the hardcore raiders) will leave EQ when WoW has stuff aimed at them.<br />
This is true, to an extent, but dont you also see this as a factor in people RETURNING to EQ1, at least on a part-time basis so they can raid? My guildmates that moved to other games come back once in a while to raid. Its not that hard to play a couple different games at once you know. <br />
Its undeniably true that lots more will leave when WoW is released in the rest of the world.<br />
Can't argue with this. WoW will certainly make an international impact when its released overseas. But I dont think it will make an impact on the status of US players that much. The US guilds have already taken the hit. More may leave, or some may come back. Adjustments will be made, guilds will merge, etc etc. When WoW ships overseas, its the Euro-Asian guilds that are gonna take the hits. But you are right, more people WILL leave EQ when WoW ships overseas.<br />
Its also important to remember that continually there are new people starting to play mmorpgs. If a new player can choose between EQ and WoW its hard for me to see why they should choose EQ.<br />
I agree 100% here. I do not think that EQ1 is picking up ANY of the &quot;new online player&quot; market whatsoever. However, I see that target market as a BIG reason for the release of EQ2 in the first place. EQ2 serves to compete with WoW for the new players, and for the established EQ crowd as well. Not saying EQ2 is better, have no idea. Just saying, SOE, as a company, has something in mind for new player target audience.<br />
<br />
Not trying to pick on you Spirit, but the &quot;tone&quot; of your post was, overall, &quot;shovel on the dirt, the holes gonna get deeper&quot;. Not gonna argue that point overall, as I said, but I think that EQ1 has plenty of life left in it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Really ?<br />
Its been 2 months since WoW CAME ON THE MARKET which is when its going to affect EQ.Sorry i didnt state this implicitly and lead you to think that SoE didnt even realise before the release that there was another big MMoRPG being released.<br />
<br />
SoE have probably done what any business does and looked at market trends and seen the same thing happening in the past with the release of DAoC,SWG etc with people leaving en masse for these new wonder games and then returning after a few months.<br />
<br />
Maybe this time the market wont follow this trend but SoE cant read minds.<br />
<br />
Wouldnt you be whining now if SoE had merged servers on release of WoW and not many people had left for WoW etc and you then had massive traffic jams for raid targets etc.<br />
<br />
I am not a lover of SoE (in fact quite the opposite) but this time whatever they had done would be wrong and complained about so they took the safe way out ie wait and see.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Catabrie Fatewielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I see a lot of people commenting on how its the time of year and all that.<br />
Im sorry but i have to disagree with this totally. EQ hasnt ever been quiet around winter and the xmas month. Summer has and remains our quietest times but there has never been even a summer like this in all the years ive played the game.<br />
<br />
Theres a big difference between a server losing a handful of people every week and a server losing hundreds of people every week. If we lose 50% of the server population which has and is happening the servers become a lot less viable.<br />
<br />
There is no 'easier' content being added for smaller guilds. The new content for omens is aimed at group play or big raids as with all the other expansions virtually. A large percentage of those still playing the game are guild players. The casual players were the first to goto new games when they were released.<br />
<br />
This isnt a matter of panic. Its not a matter of putting your finger in the hole to stop a leak. Its a great big bloody hole in the side of the dam and the playerbase is running away fast. Small guilds and large guilds are being affected across the board. This has nothing to do with being uber or not. On Cazic all sizes of guilds have been destroyed due to lack of people online to keep them running. If you lose 50% of your players, whether or not you were a large guild to start with, you are still unable to continue achieving your goals.<br />
But putting guilds aside. Lets look at casual players. Ok so you log on...you go LFG. How long does it take you to find a group? Ok now remove 50% of the playerbase...how long is it going to take you now to find a group? The maths is pretty simple.<br />
<br />
The game is for most about progression, hence the new changes to the flag system today which should have happened months ago. Guilds dont want to back flag. They dont want to step back and do old content because the lack of players online demands they rinse and repeat events and encounters they have long since outgrown.<br />
<br />
We cant sit back and say oh dont worry they will come back. This isnt a matter of Dark Ages of Crapolot or any of their ilk. Sony produced a game which is directly in competition to Everquest, it even has the same game world and story line with changed graphics. This in itself was a dumb move...why take from the right hand just to give it to the left. But the facts remain, even if EQ2 doesnt stand up to the long term scrutiny that EQ has, the release of EQ2 predominantly and now WoW is killing EQ. The lack of people on each server is killing EQ.<br />
<br />
Joining servers together wont cause overcrowding because even 2 server populations added together doesnt amount to the population of one server 3 years ago.<br />
This isnt a phase. EQ populations have been in gradual decline since pre GoD. GoD only sped that process up. Omens whilst nice is very much a case of too little too late. So SOE if they genuinely want to keep EQ1 going(of which i have my doubts despite their assurances) have some pretty big decisions and moves to make in order to make it happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok so you log on...you go LFG. How long does it take you to find a group? Ok now remove 50% of the playerbase...how long is it going to take you now to find a group? The maths is pretty simple.<br />
I dont think you can boil it down to this form of &quot;simple math&quot; How about this example? You zone into PG, and do /w, and see 58 players in zone, you KNOW its going to be difficult to find a decent camp or group unless someone leaves and you get their spot. Now, cut that number to 1/3, and you have 18 players in the zone, meaning you KNOW there are decent camps available, and you gather your group and go. <br />
<br />
Yeah, maybe the people who sit there with LFG on waiting for the world to come to them will have a bit harder time. Maybe not, though. With more camps available, and less people to fill the groups in those camps, maybe group slots are going to be MORE available. At any rate, people who are pro-active in this game are ALWAYS going to manage, while people who are re-active are ALWAYS going to complain (too many in zones, no camps open ---&gt;&gt; no one in zones, no one to group with). <br />
<br />
Personally, I kinda like the fact that I can log in, do a /w all friends, click the LFG button, send a couple tells, and almost be CERTAIN a reasonable camp will be open somewhere for us to play in. Nothing sucks more than running a whole group to MPG and finding 60 players there, and not having the right &quot;mix&quot; for a trial, and sitting there going &quot;OK now what&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Panspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As an EQ2 player, I can tell you I wont be returning to eq1, after 5 years, Ive had enough of the engine and the expansions are not anything really inherently new but more of the same. For me, nothing they do could make me come back to eqlive. Same same.....<br />
<br />
Furthermore, on EQ2, I have asked many players if they have played EQ1 and most of the players have, some quit 5 months ago and some within the last month. I have an account yet that is good till April 2005, I paid a year in advance awhile back, but I can never see myself getting into it ever again like I used to. For me, an era has come and gone and its time to move on. It is for me like it was when I used to play runequake, there was a point where it went from having fun to just hanging out with the same friends doing old content over and over and over. It became a religious experience and eventually thats what will be left of the eqlive playerbase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the former EQ players I have conversed with have no intentions of returning, and many are well past the 1 month trial date now as well. EQ2 and Wow was a great excuse to get away from what eqlive has become. A religion in its on right.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I mean those hard cores that go back a long ways, I have met a lot of new players to EQ within the last 2 years and they wouldnt fall into this category:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My guild is experiencing a resurgence, as several experienced players who had quit for eq 2 have come back to EQ 1 in the last week.<br />
<br />
I don't want server mergers for two reasons:<br />
<br />
It's too early to tell how many who left are gone for good<br />
<br />
And some of us are enjoying the lower population servers, it is creating more opportunities for advancement among what you might call second or third tier geared but still competent players.<br />
<br />
My server merging with another would more likely cause me to cancel than lower population on my server would.</div></div><hr />
