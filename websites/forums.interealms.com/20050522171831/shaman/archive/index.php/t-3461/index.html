<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes.  I know of two places that could be done, and I remember the GM's putting up messages about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Answer: yes. If you can mess with a mob but it can't get to you to mess back (cos even casting mobs may just start running into a wall or something instead of casting, trying to get at you) then it's an exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seriously, best way to define an exploit:<br />
<br />
<br />
If it seems wrong, it probably is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you feel bad, you should. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Doesn't sound like an exploit, because the casting mob can still cast on you. Now if it were a melee mob and it couldn't hit you because of geography but you could cast on it, then I think that would be more of an exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So say you're in Chardok and you're at this place in front of the fort that you can stand and mobs won't path to you. Instead, when you attack them and jump up onto the magic sweet spot, the mobs just run in circles. If I pull necro, wizard and shaman sarnaks, I'm perfectly safe and it's not an exploit, but if I pull melee sarnaks, it's an exploit?<br />
<br />
Sorry, if the mobs can't reach you physically, it's an exploit. There's no splitting hairs here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Either way it's not an exploit, its bad programming.<br />
<br />
Far as im concerned if Verant doesnt want people to do things in game then they need to fix their bugs.<br />
<br />
As long as your not using something outside the game to help its not an exploit.  It's just someones opinion that it's cheating, and I disagree with them.  I call it outsmarting the game, thats what your supposed to do when you play a game.<br />
<br />
If the mob is trying to attack you and it cant because of geography then it should be smart enough to back off, get help ect.<br />
<br />
The game itself cheats.  Casters hitting like melee, casters with melee HP, casters using outdoor only spells while indoors, ect.  They do this because their stupid, aka bad programming, bad AI.<br />
<br />
What would you do if Nintendo came to your house and said, &quot;Your using what we consider to be an exploit in Mario! Your banned!&quot;  Then he takes your Gamecube lol?  You'd tell em to go **** himself wouldnt you.  Then you'd kick his ass, get your system back and resume play right?<br />
<br />
If Verant would fix their bugs then we couldnt &quot;cheat&quot; could we.?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its common knowledge among guides as to where these spots are, exploit them at your own risk. And yes, if it can cast but cant reach you its classed as exploit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I understand if I get a warning because I don't zerg a MOB and allow tons of them to hit me at the same time. (Aka &quot;The Vision&quot;)<br />
<br />
When a MOB can cast on me through 3 walls, 1 flight of stairs and 2 turned corners, yet when I can see them clearly but get the &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; message, well I am just a tad miffed.</div></div><hr />

If God would fix the universe, then I couldn't 'kill', could I?<br />
<br />
It's a fallacious argument. Cheating is cheating. Yes, the game isn't always fair, but them's just the breaks. <br />
<br />
Not that I have anything against it. As I said before, I never, ever used a sploit in CoM. Ever. But if I did, and I didn't, I would call it cheating, and not justify it with some BS false logic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree that the whole notion of a &quot;exploit&quot; is the stupidest excuse for lazy bug fixing i have ever heard (or more correctly, bad AI).  If verant didn't want something to happen, then they should &quot;GASP&quot; fix it.<br />
<br />
But unfortunately Verant is lazy with fixing bugs.  My advice (and here comes the flames) is to get showeq up and running before you go and &quot;exploit&quot;  There's no sense in getting banned for exploiting bad NPC pathing that Verant chooses to let remain in the game.  They'd much rather ban you for doing it rather than fixing the bad programming.  But to be honest - I don't know of any remaining exploits that are actually really beneficial anyways (you're still usually mana limited as to the rate of exp you can earn) so even more reason to not &quot;exploit&quot;<br />
<br />
My first advice is don't bother - I doubt your exp gain is significantly better by &quot;exploiting&quot; anyways...<br />
<br />
But if you insist on &quot;exploiting&quot; at least get showeq up so you can see the GM's coming.  Don't lose your account over something like this... it'd be a shame...<br />
<br />
Now if only verant would ban more general idiots in EQ we'd be doing all right :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I always get a chuckle when I see people bashing Verant for being &quot;lazy&quot; about fixing their bugs.<br />
<br />
You know nothing of their source base, their tools, their development environment, or their workload.<br />
<br />
Fixing bugs causes instability, which causes bugs.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's better to leave a known bug with a workaround in the system rather than risk bug-causing instability.<br />
<br />
EQ is huge, the world is huge - the number of MOBs is huge, the number of possible paths is huge.  If there were no bugs I'd be astonished.  Would you rather they fix this minor pathing bug so it's not possible to exploit, or spend their time implementing the bazaar code?  Why not just agree not to cheat and let them get on with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Toorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree to an extent, although some exploits require fear.. <br />
<br />
Such as in Nurga. There's a spot you can fear mobs and they will get stuck. Now, if fear wears off they will hit you.. <br />
<br />
How would you classify that? I mean Necro's fear and the mobs cannot hit them.. Given.. they have to snare to make it effective. The only differance in Nurga is the fact that no snare is required.. <br />
<br />
So would you call that cheating? If so, is it really exploiting? If fear doesn't hold, the mob will hit and cast on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">To Oldlurk:<br />
Really?  I don't use ShowEQ so I can't test, but I always thought that EVERYTHING showed up on showeq.  I'm not advocating cheating here, I'm just saying that I personally believe that these pathing exploit bugs aren't a big deal, and people who use them aren't evil or anything :)  No sense in banning these people - I can think of many worse examples that should be banned before &quot;exploiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
To Weissblau:<br />
I respectably disagree here.  12.95 a month from 400,000 suscribers means I want a near perfect game.  They can afford programmers to fix the small things as well as the big bugs - they just choose not to, and we choose to keep playing (and paying)  ;)  I program for a living as well and I do agree that fixing bugs can be a pain etc. - but after three years they *should* have everquest in shape.  Again, it's a matter of priorities and they choose to ignore things like pathing because we all keep paying for a pathing bug ridden game.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is that if Verant is too LAZY (yes I said and mean LAZY) to fix pathing bugs, then individuals shouldn't be punished for &quot;exploiting&quot; them.  Especially since none of the &quot;exploits&quot; are game unbalancing anyways....<br />
<br />
OK I'll get off my soapbox now - but the pathing in EQ is my biggest gripe and I get heated whenever the issue comes up LOL.<br />
<br />
Kongar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&gt;How would you classify that? <br />
<br />
Its an exploit. When you fear a mob it is running. A mob running is a risk, it could run into aggro range of other mobs, snare could wear off and it could run even faster into aggro range of other mobs.<br />
<br />
When you remove any aspect of the risk to yourself by using a buggy spot in the zone - the mobs ability to run, its ability to melee, then its exploit.<br />
<br />
And to preempt the inevitable comments I dont class using walls to avoid AEs or assing out an exploit - neither of these are without risk as the mob can still path toward you should it have reason to, theres a difference between using geography to your advantage and using bugs to your advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There is a difference between using geography to your advantage and using a bug to your advantage?<br />
<br />
I agree but it is too broad a comment considering often the geography is what causes the bug in the first place.<br />
<br />
Maybe not the best way to word it, but I do agree with what I believe you meant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">What would you do if Nintendo came to your house and said, &quot;Your using what we consider to be an exploit in Mario!

<br />
All I have to say is LOL.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the difference between Everquest and Super Mario is the monthly fee.  Once you buy a Nintendo game, that's it, it's yours for good.  Everquest is more of a rental kinda thing, and they can choose to terminate your lease at any given time.  Call it fair, call it unfair, but as long as they keep the cash flowing, I don't think it really matters to them.<br />
<br />
I do however agree that they should work hard to fix their bugs.  Bugs are bound to occur, but some have been around so long it's ridiculous ie CoM, OT (fear wall close to SF), etc.  Sometimes, it is a matter of outsmarting the game, and discovering bugs to exploit can be a rather interesting process.  <br />
<br />
The Western Wastes charm bug, I had heard about it, but I never knew how it worked till one day me and this bard were cruising around looking for wolves to kill, so she charmed a rhino for an extra hand, and bam cov dragons came to assist.  Of course, wolf was under level 55, so we got no exp, but it was still fun to watch.  We didn't even know about the 55+ assist rule, but we wanted to see an ice burrower go head to head with like a cragwyrm.  Awesome fight, and lo and behold, at the end, we got exp and a couple silks!  It was all new to us, and gradually we found out how to get ourselves ac 7 +6 all stats/saves talisman from around ToV entrance.  Call me a cheater, but for once I was doing something different and liking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Look, everyone agrees that there are a number of bugs that remain in the game for a long, long time but you have to remember the technology that the game was built on is _how_ many years old?  There's a limit to what you can code that game engine to do, it's that simple.  I'm willing to bet that fixing most, if not all, known pathing exploits would require a redesign of the zone from the ground up.  It is not reasonable to expect VI to redesign CoM from scratch to fix one spot, the amount of time and money to fix it isn't practical.<br />
<br />
If I host a race, you need to start in my back yard, run down to the corner, touch the stop sign, then run back to me and touch the tree I'm standing next to and charge you for it, does that mean if you just touch the tree and claim you win because you paid the same as everyone else in the race?  VI's exploit rules basically boil down to one statement:   Whenever you can find a way to circumvent the difficulty of a quest or encounter due to unforseen limitations of the game engine, it is concidered cheating.<br />
<br />
There are still plenty of grey areas, however.  If the mob can cast on you is it exploiting?  Tough call, arguments can be made either way.  It's probably grey enough that they won't take action on you.<br />

<br />
When I was lower level I didn't notice the bugs so much.  I read the message boards and heard that things were really messed up, but I didn't see it.  I thought everyone was just complaining.<br />
<br />
Well, once I hit 49, I started to notice.  I used to solo a lot in CoM.  I hade never even heard of an exploit such as this one.  I had a JBB, and eventually stumbled onto it.  It was just stupid with a JBB. <br />
<br />
I used it a few times.  It was extremely boring.  It had a lot to do with why I quit the game shortly after.<br />
<br />
What is 12.99 times 400,000?  Verant is lazy.  If they didn't spend so much time pumping out the expansions, they would have more time to fix their ****.<br />

When I die because I &quot;couldn't see&quot; a mob that was clearly visible on my screen (in first-person view of course) but it had no problem beating the snot out of me, or because i got aggro through a wall, or because of any other pathing bug in the game, as has happened more than once, the standard GM response is &quot;sucks for you&quot;. No free rez, no attempt to fix it (who remembers the sarnak fort in LOIO? how long has that been broken?), no acknowledgment that the mob was cheating (by &quot;removing any aspect of risk to istelf using a buggy spot in the zone&quot;).<br />
<br />
But if a PC uses a pathing bug to whack a mob that doesn't know how to reach him, it's an exploit and ban-worthy.<br />
<br />
Not to advocate cheating -- i would never use such a technique to kill a mob unless the mob could not be killed fairly, and i needed it dead -- but the double standard is sort of irritating. If a PC who uses a bug to his advantage gets punished, a PC who suffers due to a bug while trying to play fair should be compensated.<br />

Actually, the bigger difference is the fact that EQ is multiplayer.<br />
<br />
As a game developer, I didn't really care how badly the players hacked single-player games.  Who were they hurting?  Multiplayer games need to be airtight, though, because cheating puts the cheater at an advantage over the honest (or ignorant) players they are playing with/against.<br />
<br />
No, Nintendo wouldn't come take your GameCube away if you hacked your character in Diablo or whatever, but they sure as hell would terminate the game and put up a dialog telling the other players what you'd done.  And rightly so.</div></div><hr />

I wish I lived in this magical world you guys live in where servers, web space, tech support, office space and all that other behind the scenes stuff that people tend to not think about was absolutely free so Verant could put 100% of their revenue back into programming for the game. It must be great there. Hey, does it rain ice cream too?</div></div><hr />

I get your point.  However, that is still a great deal of money, regardless of overhead.  My point was that if they have the money to keep pumping out expansions, they could shift there priorities into fixing the game instead.<br />
<br />
In any case, it is true that we really don't have any idea how Verant allocates there spending and I don't think their accountant would enlighten us.  I am going in circles here.<br />
<br />
Verant is stupid big evil company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can get on top of the wall, cast on a guard, and run towards commons on top of the wall, and cross the zone line without actually zoning over.<br />
<br />
Anyway, stuff never reaches you, ever, as far as I can remember.  It's fun to see everyone walking into the zone say &quot;Why the hell are 15 guards running around in circles?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Let's see here...<br />
<br />
12.95 (i think that's what I'm getting charged) times 400,000 suscribers per month (average) equals 5,180,000 dollars PER month.  FIVE MILLION, ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND.  Times 12 = 62,160,000.00.  SIXTY TWO MILLION ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND per year.  <br />
<br />
Now let me ask you this - do you still think we're talking about some magical world here?  A place where office space, web support, server cost, employee compensation etc is seriously going to eat up 62 million and change every year?  Not likely.  I've written a business plan for a venture capital based startup company and I estimate I could start it up on one million - so I'm going after 5.  How many businesses have you run or tried to?<br />
<br />
Let's put some other numbers to this issue.  The company I work for now - nets about 35 million per year in sales.  We have office space, web servers, heavy networking demands, high slaries, company cars, tech support, administrative departments, and countless other forms of corporate overhead.  Company size is just about 100 employees so not that large - but probably what?  1/2 to 1/3 the size of Verant interactive?  I can't imagine it takes much more than a few hundred people to run norrath...If it does they need more talent...<br />
<br />
AFTER all the costs, my company earns about 15 million per year. This money is banked to carry us through tough years, and believe it or not, we actually share in some of this profit (although the prez takes most of it)  :)<br />
<br />
So, even if verant was 300 people big (holy inefficiencies batman), we can probably assume worst case scenario - verant breaks even every year.  20mill cost per hundred employeesX3=60 mill.  This also assumes a linear relationship between adding employees and overhead (which isn't true - My MBA taught me that - where's your MBA?)  I think you get my point.<br />
<br />
Verant could - IF THEY WANTED TO - stop working on EQ, and release EQ2 as a FREE upgrade - and STILL make money every year (or at least break even).  So I'm going to hardcore flame the next person that tells me that Verant CAN'T fix the pathing bugs.  They could build a NEW damn game and call it &quot;Improved Pathing Bug Free EQ&quot;<br />
<br />
I call it LAZINESS - and it's certainly not unfeasable to want a pathing bug free game from verant :)  The reason they do it is because we are all lemmings and we keep paying to play this game - bugs or no bugs.  Pretty good business plan huh?  :)<br />
<br />
Gotta give Verant credit - they make boatloads of money and they don't have to do squat...  LOL<br />

<br />
If you don't like to burp, you choose not to drink Coke.<br />

The pathing problems are a byproduct of EQ's engine and design.  If you don't like EQ's pathing, go play AC or DAOC or UO or Anarchy Online.  You choose to consume the product.<br />

Making a game is a tremendous risk.   A hit is a tremendous cash cow, but the 90% of games that miss are major losers.    Capitalism is speaking when Verant is pulling in a big profit.  Let it speak loudly enough and viable competition will appear.</div></div><hr />

When I was mid-30 and camping the bar in SolA, I knew that mobs couldn't see across the bar and they also walked around it, while I could jump over it.  I used this knowledge to my advantage.<br />
<br />
We all know that Lord Rak has a mean AoE, but that Mage fire pets are immune to it.  We killed Lord Rak with a single group.  One level 49(?) fire pet, Enchanter hasting pet and KEI'ing mage, Cleric and Shaman.  Rogue unlocked castle and pulled Rak. Cleric got too close during heals and died half-way thru fight. Everyone else watched fight from a distance. Level 53 shaman (me) was back up healer and kept the pet a live.  Took like 10 minutes, but we got him. Was this an exploit or advantagious use of acquired game knowledge.<br />
<br />
Hey this is a game.  I play for entertainment.  I enjoy a challenge. I take pride in the items I've acquried and the means by which I acquired them.  When I see someone else taking advantage of their acquired game knowledge, it's no big deal. They pay to play too and that's how they want to play. If they are &quot;exploiting a bug&quot;, I just consider that they have a different notion of what they consider entertaining and challeging.  To me. exploits are only an issue when item ego, envey and toon status come to visit and although I know these three, I chose not to spend much time with them.<br />

<br />
Actually I was talking about soloing the Black Dire in MM to get the SoW boots and not taking any damage. <br />
<br />
I used the caster mob as an example to see your opinion, but the Dire is a SK. I am pretty sure killing him like that is an exploit though.<br />
<br />
...or would be considered one I mean.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pull mobs to The Deep zone in and they can only come so far.. Been wanting to get a wizard friend to AE the entire place but haven't bothered. They'd all be green and MAYBe a light blue or 2 scattered.<br />
<br />
In Ahkeva the first drop down as you come in. Just past the ruins you can back yourself up as far as you can and the things get stuck a lot of times. (Not a perfect science, but there's definitely something here)<br />
<br />
There are tons of these.. Doesn't make for a fun game for me so I don't even bother other than to see &quot;Oh neat, another spot.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">pretty sure the black dire sploit was removed, and so was the OT skyfire ramp pathing trick.<br />
<br />
anyway....some people say that cheating totally ruined diablo, and I understand that. i've played a lot of quake and counterstrike, and while I haven't noticed that many cheats really, I've seen a few and they're definitely lame.....people running at double speed, the voodoo card see-thru-walls cheat in CS, etc. it just ruins the game, and if everyone could use exploits or even 'grey area' exploits freely in EQ, it would suck ass. everyone and their mother would be in WW all day soloing/duoing and farming. people would religiously use the CoM exploit (whatever it is), and everyone would be in line to do it because it would be a good common xp spot. everyone would be fearing in the right spots (remember the little rock outside ssra in the grey?).<br />
<br />
i'm glad gm's see harshly on exploits, maybe they don't warn/ban everyone who does it, but it will keep many people from doing it out of respect for authority (and verant has that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Kongar, Bahimiron, and anyone else interested:<br />
<br />
Interesting tidbit from August 2002 Computer Shopper Magazine (hey, it was in the office restroom :) ):<br />
<br />
David Levine, CEO of Butterfly.net is working on an online gaming project with IBM.  Here's a relevant quote to our conversation regarding the costs of hosting online games.<br />
(and Yes, Everquest was specifically mentioned in the article):<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Our whole focus is to get the price point below a dollar per player per month.<br />
<br />
Right now, for a lot of games, it's between $4 and $6.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
So out of the $62 million per year that EQ rakes in (using Kongar's numbers) approximately $19 - 30 million is spent on computer resources. ie. server hardware, maintenance, bandwidth, etc.<br />
<br />
Is EQ making a ton of money?  Sure.  Are they *spending* a ton?  you bet.  I dunno how much is left over for profit but I'm sure it's a lot, but less than what some people think.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
edit - btw Kongar lay off the arrogance.  You just sound like an ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>xano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">If you didn't know there is a thing with bear/wolf form that that makes the mob's think you are in 2 places at one basiclly and they just freeze. Bear form up with invis on of course and back that thang up into the back left hand corner right bove that table, the inside right of the corner pillar. make sure u are snug as a bug in a rug, drop invis, if yer KOS the 2 bards will make a B line for the dorr and stop. Thats the freeze point, u can epic them all day long, about 2 clicks and they dead and  its risk free exp. pull isabella the same way when u have the other 2 there and cast Torrent of posion, usally lands for a full 540 all all of them once and one 540 on one of the 3.  You can also grab the nobles run  back into the room then go to the spot and they freeze. This is a sploit i am sure, use it at your own risk, Exp is great you could gor from 54 to 58 in 3 weeks easy playing on the off hours getting all the spawns.<br />
<br />
XANO<br />
<br />
p.s. this may also have ruined the spot since now ppl know, oops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Trust me on this, regardless of what anyone here has said or argued.. If a casting mob gets bugged where it can't hit you physically (yes I know where that is), it IS AN EXPLOIT.<br />
<br />
You can blame it on bugging coding or whatever you want to.  But if you are seen doing this by a guide or GM you will get a soulmarked warning placed on your account.<br />
<br />
Like I said, trust me on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">It wasn't my intention to come off as an arrogant ass :)  It's just that we all have our little pet peeves, and mine is the pathing in EQ.  Not spell drop rates, not level design, not anything else - I just can't stand watching the poor pet class players get screwed by poofing pets etc.<br />
<br />
It's just a pet peeve that I REALLY wish verant would fix...<br />
<br />
I watched a mage the other day - pet poofed - mage went splat LOL -  I laugh now but it's really not very funny  :eek: <br />
<br />
I just took offense when it was suggested that I live in a &quot;magical world&quot; when in reality Verant COULD fix whatever they wanted with EQ.  Sorry to the shamans here for degrading the thread with a flame :(<br />
<br />
But you guys are right - we keep playing and they don't NEED to fix it so I guess I'm wasting my breath :)<br />
<br />
So is it really true that someday my pet will be not worth summoning?  (currently lvl 52)  I think it's a nice thoguht to not have to depend on him for damage anymore....If he poofs I'm still OK<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Can anybody tell me where in COM the magic spot is so I can..um...warn people?<br />
<br />
Yeah, sploiting is wrong, I suppose.<br />
<br />
But, when is the last time you had an item poof or died from game lag and no one would help you?<br />
<br />
Maybe it's not justification, but I consider sploited xp my payback form all the XP I lost to stupid game bugs.<br />
<br />
Only problem I see with them is people fighting over camps.<br />
<br />
Look, eventually, you're gonna get a little bored playing eq, probably worse if all you do is sploit for xp.<br />
<br />
It's no skin off my nose if some level 30 necro is powerleveling in MM, let him have at it.<br />
<br />
As if fear kiting isn't enough of a sploit already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I'm new to EQ...and I've already discovered this.<br />
<br />
I'm in Everfrost peaks, hunting orcs and mammoth calfs at the mammoth ruins...That little ramp is great!<br />
<br />
They don't come up the ramp if you get'em stuck in that little part, at least not right away...It's enough time to sit down, clear a spell, med gate, and get out if neccesary. <br />
<br />
If this is an exploit, it's not my fault. All I'm doing is what I would have done in ANY game of tag as a kid...run around a car, watch which way you go, and go the other way...What's different? If you can't get me, I can't be &quot;it&quot;...<br />
<br />
It's NOT an exploit if you don't know how to catch me...It's me being better than you! Am I better than Sony then? Well...apparently better than their programmers, if a newbie level 20 Shaman can avoid their mobs for casting DOTS and debuffs.<br />
<br />
If you think it is an exploit, you must have been &quot;it&quot; a lot as a kid...Guess you don't know the tricks to tagging someone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">The problem twobrew is that what you are describing IS considered exploiting by verant and you CAN be banned for doing that sort of stuff.  Although I don't think you'll win an argument with a GM that is based on a childhood game of tag :)  You do however bring up the point - if they didn't want you to sit and med then they should fix it - not ban you =\<br />
<br />
And yes this topic is being beaten to death - and I'm probably most responsible for it....  I just wanted to post one last time to make you aware that you are putting your account at risk by exploiting pathing bugs.  Whether or not you agree with it - that is the rules you have to live by in EQ or pay the consequences.<br />
<br />
Be careful doing this - I'd hate to see you lose your account to this.<br />
<br />

<br />
PS One reason I'm so passionate about this subject is that I had a RL friend get banned for exploiting pathing.  Ya he was doing it - and it's his own fault - but i do miss playing EQ with him and it's kind of a sore spot I guess =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Kongar - It's all good :) ...for the record, I agree with you, and was posting the *only* hard numbers I've ever heard thrown around about how much money it really costs to host a MMORPG.<br />
<br />
They could fix it, if they threw the resources at it...but fixing bugs doesn't bring in revenue.<br />
