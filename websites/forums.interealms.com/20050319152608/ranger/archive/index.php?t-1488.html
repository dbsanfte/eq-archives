Not too much here, but some GREAT quotes by Rumsfeld.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have seen repeated speculation about his possible location, but it has obviously not been verifiable,&quot; Rumsfeld said. &quot;Had it been verifiable, one would have thought that someone might have done something about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh, he's just so refreshingly witty, sharp and direct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean what do they expect people like Rumsfeld to say?<br />
<br />
Of course if we knew where he was we would go get him but something I think the media is missing is that despite all the power our military has with its technology and training they are still just human and not clarvoyant(sp?)<br />
<br />
Osama is a terrorist who has a fair chunk of resources and in a land let alone a world that hails him as at least some sort of hero for standing up to the US.  He is going to have a lot of help in eluding us.<br />
<br />
On a totally unrelated subject last night on the news there was coverage of a series of rapes going on in the Houston area.<br />
<br />
The reporter asks the police what they plan to do about this?<br />
<br />
The policeman kinda looked at the reporter wierd and then said &quot;well we plan on trying to catch the guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reporter was clearly put off but seriously what did you expect the policeman to say?  &quot;Oh we think we will just sit back and let him rape a few more women and when he reaches 10 or so we will go arrest him&quot;</div></div><hr />

So true....like Rumsfeld is gonna be like &quot;Oh, that's right, we found bin laden and killed him. How did I forget to mention that?!?!&quot;</div></div><hr />

When I head him say this on NPR, I was yelling at my radio. &quot;One would have thought...&quot;?!?!?!<br />

Can't you just come out and say &quot;We would have gone in and fragged his ass back to the 14th century&quot;?<br />

<br />
If we knew where Bin Laden was we'd shove a nuke so far up his ass even Allah wouldn't be able to find it.<br />
<br />
But since that would get him smeared in the press I don't think he is stupid enough to commit politcal suicide.</div></div><hr />

But so be SO non-commital as to say &quot;one would have excpected someone to do something about it&quot; is the epitome of asinine.<br />
<br />
&quot;If the information had been verifiable the full might of our Afganistan forces would have been put to locating and capturing or killing him in that city.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's the kind of thing we need to hear, not that the US is sitting back expecting that &quot;someone&quot; will take care of Bin-Laden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact is the US is having to do JUST that.<br />
<br />
Right now until Bin Laden gets gutsy enough to stick his head out of some hole so one of our Snipers can be moved to the area to pop him we are playing a waiting game.<br />
<br />
Right now our military is in recon mode.  We are waiting and gathering information and listening.  The media however hasn't had any good bomb shows or shoot outs in a while.<br />
<br />
You see ACTIVE military engagements is like cocaine to the media.  They THRIVE on it.. they are ADDICTED to it.<br />
<br />
Hence all the attention is on Isreal right now where the action is.<br />
<br />
When the action returns to Afganistan or to whatever country is next on our list we will see the media turn from Isreal to whereever we are going.<br />
<br />
Guard duty != high ratings and right now the US is on guard duty/low profile recon and spy missions.</div></div><hr />

Actually I couldn't disagree more.  To me it's the epitome of tact and pointed sarcasm at the idiot reporter who thinks they know more about what's going on there than he does.<br />
<br />
And frankly I don't want my leaders sounding like some spaghetti western vigilante.</div></div><hr />

W took the stand for the whole country, and now everyone's trying to back down and make everything PC again. Pick a side, fight for that side, and win. Don't say we're going to bring Bi-Laden to justice but leave it to a nebulous &quot;someone&quot; to &quot;do something about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having some tact has nothing to do with taking a stand or not.<br />
<br />
I have yet to hear Rumsfeld ever not take a stand on something that he had either a) sufficient information to make a stand on, or b) wasn't classified so he couldn't say anything about it.<br />
<br />
He's the first Secretary of Defense that I've heard yet, who gives pointed intelligent answers, doesn't dodge questions and bluntly says when he can't or won't answer questions because of confidentiality issues.</div></div><hr />

on another topic tho.<br />
<br />
I find it confusing how the American public can be so nonchalant about these things. Killing Osama won't solve any of our problems in the Middle East. It will only make him a martyr and make some people feel better. I obviously do not condone any acts of terrorism, but we have certainly brought it all on ourselves. And imo, we shouldn't really try to blow up (literally) the situation we have created. Bin Laden should certainly be brought to &quot;justice&quot; but declaring war on terrorism is a dodgy thing for us to do. Seeing as how if we are in favor of guerillas they are freedom fighters, but if not they are terrorists. We have supported such groups in the past. The taliban and Sadam have both benefitted from of resources in fact. My point is that a knee jerk reaction to blow the bloody hell out of everything isn't wise or appropriate. Life is sacred, ALL life, not just our own but those of others such as the Taliban as well and all should be done within the power of or government to protect it. Our own citizens come first of course, but i'm getting off on a tangent. I think more should be done to understand our differences and problems between us and Muslems, but it does not seem as if the American public even realizes that alot of people around the world doesn't like us and that we might want to find out why. I guess i'll just get off my soap box.</div></div><hr />

It won't solve ALL of our problems, but it will solve one of them....namely: Osama<br />
<br />
<br />

Really? Dodgy, eh? Well, when I read opinions like yours, Wwen, the lack of something always strikes me. And that something is: A better plan. <br />
<br />
What would you have america do? Sit back, do nothing, and try to just understand the differences between muslim culture and our own? Yes, I am sure once we understand those differences, we can write a 500 word essay on them to OBL and he will call off the whole terrorism thing....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I need to ask:<br />
<br />
How did we &quot;bring this on ourselves&quot;?  <br />
<br />
Unless you support some type of Isolationist approach to the Middle East, our involvements was full of tough choices... and yes some bad ones.  But if not us making them.. then who? and at what cost if nobody did anything?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes all life is sacred including the members of the Taliban.  However I fail to see a more effective approach than what are currently doing.  I don’t feel I am naive in thinking the US is doing all in its power to handle the situation with minimal bloodshed, as well as taking every possible measure to insure innocent people do not die.  Oh and by the way putting American lives on the line to do so.  <br />

Errr how much more of a stand do we need to take here?  Personally I MUCH prefer the no-nonsense, take care of business, professional attitude to the Rah Rah, we are here to kick ass, it's payback time, B.S.  <br />
<br />
I mean is it really in any way unclear we are after Bin Laden?<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
I didn't mean this to sound too confrontational.  Not meant as a flame at all.  It's just a naturally passionate subject.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somehow I seriously doubt that. Troops in Saudi Arabia is not the one and only reason OBL is doing what he is doing. Many of the reasons he has cited in his own video tapes that he sends to Al-Jazeera are nonsensical conspiracy theories involving the US. I have a feeling there is little we could have done to NOT piss this maniac off......</div></div><hr />

I lean towards isolationism towards them. It seems everything we do or how we do it ticks off some person somewhere enough for them to send their kids off straped with dynamite. I mean look at the situation in Isreal now. These people have been fighting throughout history, and take everything so personally. Are these really people we want to become entangled with? Screw the oil. Were America, we should invent some better way and say $^&amp;@ OPEC and those bums over there with their religious wars. Taking sides in anyway just makes us the enemy of the other. Its kind of a no win situation.</div></div><hr />

If we step in on the side of isreal, we piss off arab leaders, if we step in on the side of palestine, we piss off isreal, and if we don't step in at all, we piss of everyone :( <br />
<br />
We are already in a lose lose situation, the best we can do is ignore who we are gonna piss off and just do what we think is right.....now figureing out what is right, that is the hard part.</div></div><hr />

I'm all for reducing our dependancy on fossil fuels, however it strikes me that drilling in a nature preserve isn't the way to do that.  We should be researching alternate fuel sources, not further entrenching the oil industry.</div></div><hr />
