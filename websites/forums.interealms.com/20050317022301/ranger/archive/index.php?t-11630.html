I've been playing EQ for a while now, started 5 or six months after it's release.  I've sunk alot of time into the game.  What are the chances of Verant keeping EQ1 up and running after EQ2 comes out.  I'm only level 39 now, and i'm looking forward to seeing some of the end game content but it's going to take probably a year or more for me to get up into the 50's.  I don't have a machine powerful enought to run luclin, let alone EQ2(i'm not sure when the release is maybe i will have a new comp by then).  But the point is, that i've been playing this game for quite some time, if verant pulls the plug on EQ1 after i've spent the time and money(in monthly charges) to play this game, not only will i be flipping pissed I will certainly not play EQ2.  This may be as much rant as a request for info, but anything you can add would be appreciated.<br />

Online games have long histories of continuing far after their developers expected them to last. EQ1 may not get all the updates and expansions every year that we get now but it will be maintained and operated as long as their is a financial base to support it.</div></div><hr />

Right now it's so far off that of course everyone is saying 'no way im gonna play that'. I'm personally very tired with EQ overall, I can't wait for SWG and I will be very interested in WoW when it finally hits. But even with all the new competition coming out, I seriously doubt Everquest will go anywhere in the next 5 years or so at least. Hell, UO is still around after all</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arundel Chichester</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ2 has an announced date of November 2003 (don't recall the actual date, but it's listed on the official site).<br />
<br />
I think everyone is kidding themselves when they believe that EQ1 will remain strong. Will they shut the servers off? No, of course not. Will people leave in droves to EQ2 and force Verant to merge EQ1 servers? Yup, no question in my mind.<br />
<br />
Remember that there are a large amount of people who like to see the newest things. As soon a new zone is opened, people flock to it. Also remember that as a new expansion approaches, people start to begin playing again, as they've gotten bored with the content already in game. The same can be applied to EQ2's new world. By this time next year, there won't be any further surprises to be found in PoP, and at the last Fan Faire, they stated that for the first time since release, there is no work on any expansions going on.<br />
<br />
By Novemeber, people are going to be bored stiff with EQ. The lines between classes are being intentionally blurred, and the game is losing focus. Part of me believes that this has been done on purpose to give players a sense of closure on the old game by the time the new one arrives so they won't feel guilty about leaving thier old characters.<br />
<br />
Anyway, mark my words. After one month of release, just about everyone will be playing EQ2.</div></div><hr />

We are talkin about alot of hardware upgrades for people. Im pretty sure that there will be alot of people staying with EQ because of system requirements. They will join on when they catch up to the technology.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not really, if the have a good game engine to use it should run just as smoothly on the same systems.  Right now EQs engine uses graphics horribly.  DAoC support far more characters in a given area and far higher quality for even less lag than in EQ.  Plus alot of the partical effects on spells are down right the bane of low end systems.  Eq is just using an outdated engine thats really inefficient.  Yes there will be some upgrades on the video side for the newest effects like reflective water, good shadows.  But given the option to turn them off most of the low end video cards will do fine.<br />
<br />
Not sure what engine they are using for EQ2, but the NI4 engine that DAoC just upgraded to is wonderful.  Like i said i can have a massive amoutn of people all with spell effects going off and still be able to function where as in EQ your video card explodes and your CPU takes off like a rocket...even ont he top end cards, its all in the engine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LucernRanger</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well some people won't have to worry about their machines running EQ2(I'm one of them).  But two of the requirements are 512 megs of RAM and a gforce 3 or better video card, which not everone has.  So I think there will be some people that will stay with EQ1 until they can run EQ2 and then move over.  I plan on playing both of them because I don't want to just give up on my character, but I don't want to miss out on the way things evolve in EQ2 either.  I started playing EQ after Kunark was released, so I hear some of the older players talking about how Kithicor forest used to be and other things like that that I missed out on.  I want to be part of EQ2 so I don't miss the events like that.</div></div><hr />

It would seem a little unfair.</div></div><hr />

Verant has already stated they will not allow characters from eq1 to move to eq2.  I really dont see how they *could* allow it, the level and class structure is going to be ALOT different.  About the only thing they could do is transfer equipment, some of which may not even exist in eq2 which would wreck initial game balance horribly.  Personally, im looking forward to gettting a fresh start with eq2.  I think the time I liked eq best was back during realease when everything was still new and fresh.  As far as hardware requirements go, people will do them, they did them for previous expansions of eq 1, and technology only moves in one direction anyway, forward.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kabouter</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it will remain here for a long time, but I allready left eq and I will definately go too eq2 when it comes out. Then everyone is a noob again and it will be uber to get those bronze pieces and that fine steel dagger :). I can't wait!<br />
Anyways the only reason I can think of that will make people stay, is the fact that they got real high characters with good items. But I personally don't give a **** about some pixels, I just want to have fun playing a game and I guess it will be more fun playing eq2 then returning to eq :).<br />
WoW looks good too though I actually would like a more diablo like game for a while ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ1 looks so dated, even the new Luclin upgrades, compared to the graphics of the new games these days.  It is not unexpected given how old the game is, relatively speaking.<br />
<br />
EQ1 won't die as soon as EQ2 is released, but that is the day it will start to fade slowly into history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kabouter</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe something that hasn't good much to do with eq2, but while waiting for eq2 too be released. Is asherons call2 a good game or?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont care if I have to start over, but would miss my hunting partners. <br />
<br />
I am very wary of their item decay policy and will wait to see what others have to say about the game.<br />
<br />
I am very wary of Sonys fiscal practices like allowing their premier rate customers first dibs on beta testing and grotesque name and server change fees.<br />
<br />
I'll take a wait and see attitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damacles</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what everyone said when EQ first came out about UO.<br />
<br />
They predicted as soon as EQ came out UO would not last another year. But UO is still going VERY strong. Although a majority of UO players are not from the us anymore.<br />
<br />
EQ will last another 3 years EASILY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grazyn</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see how EQ2 must happen. EQ is milking all that it can from its current engineand really needs a complete over haul. <br />
<br />
As far as character transfers. While I agree many have much invested, I dont see how character transfers can work for EQ2. I seriously doubt it will happen. As it is....each consecutive expansion from this point forward faces the ever growing challeng of increasing end game content. There is no need to continue to add more low and mid level as there is an abundance already and does not have a static player base that needs a constant influx of new content. <br />
<br />
The end game in EQ has players that are static and live simply on the content provided as the highest challenge there is. Where do you go from there as a player. The major guilds in EQ like FoH, AL, Triton, etc...what is next for them.  It seems only logical that the solution for Sony is to try and transition EQ1 players to begin again in EQ2. <br />
<br />
Like it or not....Everquest does have an end. You can beat the game. Games like Worlds of Warcraft and Warhammer Online hold so much intrigue due to the fact that the experience is new again, the world differnt, the quests unsolved, the enemies unbeaten. I forsee a very interesting next two years in the MMORPG community. Some will hold fast to EQ1 unwilling to let og of what they have built. Others are going to gladly move on to conquer new challenges.</div></div><hr />
