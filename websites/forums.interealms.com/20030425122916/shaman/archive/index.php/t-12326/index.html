<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basicly I play in a different time frame as my guild and have no desire to leave my guild just because of that.<br />
<br />
I do pretty good on my own buying stuff for myself by spending a few hours a day in the bazaar and having good contacts.<br />
<br />
I want to keep an open mind for a future replacement for stats (primary 1h). I intend to swap it out when I want to add a little epic DPS in groups, but I want something really solid, with good hitpoints and such. Something I could be proud to melee with.<br />
<br />
Since I don't raid much, no_drop recomendations won't help much. So I am looking to find something droppable and somewhat obtainable. It's not all that hard for me to come up with 50-150k, so suggest away.<br />
<br />
If you notice anything else I need to work on, lemme know.<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo link.<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Thundering Mace outta BoT is sort of an ok replacement, but I would bet there is better possibly dropping in some of the higher tier planes.  The downside is that you might be waiting a long time for something of epic caliber to actually filter down onto someone's guild bazaar mule.<br />
<br />
Finding an item that is as balanced stat-wise as the epic is pretty hard to do and most examples I can think of are no drop and come out of VT or other places that require a guild.<br />
<br />
Spend some weekends with your guild perhaps? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Off Va'Dyn in AR is the hammer on my magelo most of the time (40/28 1 hander) does some VERY nice damage, outdamages the JBB easily.<br />
<br />
   Corpsegrinder is a SWEET looking 2 hand hammer that procs a 100 point heal, and still deals fairly nice damage for you.<br />
<br />
  Thundering mace lacks the resists, but it has the hp and the looks all covered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me first pos' :)<br />
<br />
What I use when I wanna fight a wee bit is a Piledriver...drops off o' Junk beast in PoI an' is droppable...36/30 i think are dmg/dly w/ hps/mana/wis an' a proc that does 75DD/stun which rocks b/c w/ almos' max dex an' max 1hb I proc like mad...I can do a far bit o'  dmg w/ it...bes' I have seen by far by me hittin' somethin'...<br />
<br />
Jus' me humble opinions...<br />
<br />
Blessed Be,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">pile driver is 30 36....with very nice proc.  however thats bit too slow for using against blues while soloing....due to our constant `whiffing` skill....<br />
Its great weappon for commiting genocide on greens for loot tho )<br />
<br />
saw the soulstriper in bazaar yesterday  wow awesome looking mace with a FAB proc  15 23 is not ubber, but still a weapon i wish i had in my locker.  For now ill make do with 15 22 spear  instead :)<br />
<br />
Thers a 18 22  mace from LOY<br />
<br />
all i can think of atmo.<br />
<br />
ps  thought it was normal to state damage then delay?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Limneia Smokahontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yer right...not used to postin' stats on weapons lol...sorry...none the less an awesome weapon that I'm able to do mad dmg w/...I also have a soulstripper (I have alot o' weapons b/c I'm a girl an' they like shoes to me)...dmg compared to a piledriver can't be compared...w/ max 1hb, SCHW an' self haste plus max str I rarely miss mob an' hit for max o' 126 plus proc on average o' 5-10 times per fight (75dd/stun isn't somethin' to laugh at more so when they are casters)...<br />
<br />
Only time I ever used soulstripper was b4 I hit 60 an' scribed Torpor...I only used when that 75pt lifeproc was handy an' nvr when soloin' b/c even though dly smaller I only averaged hittin' mob for 15-30 dmg compared to 75-126 plus I los' that proc...<br />
<br />
I'm also that odd shaman that has different gear I switch out when I melee that gives me max dex/str/agil to work w/ so mos' aren't that lucky I don't think...<br />
<br />
Piledriver is by far a better solo/group weapon that soulstripper at least in me personal experience an' soulstriper is only one o' those fun toys to play w/ that I use for rare occassions when it's proc (which it doesn't proc often even w/ max dex) will serve me better...<br />
<br />
Plus ye get 10wis/50mana plus other stats from piledriver...<br />
<br />
but hell, it's jus' this shammies own experience an' each person won't know 'till they try different things out an' find their own grove.<br />
<br />
*forgot to mention--soulstripper is a very easy solo camp in lower parts o' dulak so if ye want a chance to try it out shouldn't take more than a few hours to camp named spawn*<br />
<br />
Blessed Be,<br />
