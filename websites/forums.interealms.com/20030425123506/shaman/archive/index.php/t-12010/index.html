<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, I'm on Rallos zek, and trying to get a pair of no drop sleeves with good ac, Sleeves of the ancients (hence the title) I know they are dropped from the named cycle in Frontier Mountains, and I know I've read how to do the cycle... but I can't seem to find where I read it, I tried searching here, but I'm a search n00b so I prolly didn't do it right, the only post that came up was one on EK /boggle.  So if someone could explain to me how to do it (or post a link) I would be very much appreciated.  Alternatively, if you know of a soloable or duoable (with 52 shaman and monk) pair of no drop sleeves that are an upgrade to grimling armband of servitude (2ac 2wis 2sv magic, 2hp 2mana, 2% throwing mod and a bunch of other crap LOL) I would be much appreciated.  I'm an Iksar, so that of course has some impact on what quests I can do.  But I'm not abject to working on faction for a nice pair of sleeves.<br />
<br />
yes, I could get a pair of nice sleeves, and bag them if being pked, but then what's the point.  I have Nasthar Vambraces I wear when I'm in a safe group, but as I'm quite poor (tradeskills + saving for a Lodi shield) and have no desire to spend plat on equipment when I can camp something I'll never loose, my wis is fine, and other than resists, I'm quite pleased with my stats.  I'm 5 skulls, and the FM and SoNH drop from getting my 8th mace, I have my tear and max faction, just waiting on a RAk Raid for my epic, and trying to save up for a Lodi shield (wanna duo in Kedge, and prep for Veksar when it goes live)  My magelo is here:<br />

If you can think of any other easily obtainable items that are no drop, I'd love to know some upgrades<br />
<br />
(I have 4th shaw, and am working on shaw quests, I'm almost done with PoTC quest earring, and I have the parts for the Coldain Military Wristgaurd quest, but need to get someone with giant faction to help me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno man.. sleeves are an asstastic slot. I had horrible sleeves till I got wolf callers from tov(then onyx chain later). Think I wore jarsath for a while, then got rune etched(not for you.. leezard) then just bit the bullet and wore some droppables.(grey flesh sleeves rule, even if they look like ass++).<br />
<br />
As for other slots.. looks like you have a bit of scaled heirophant stuff.. that stuff is great.. destroys rune etched(grr). Really in your level range I would complete your scaled heirophants and just bide your time waiting till you start heading to halls of testing in ToV. Especially if you intend to avoid droppable stuff like the plague heh.<br />
<br />
Really though, most nodrop stuff pre tov is just horrific and completely asstacular. I cant really recommend any of it lol. I mean.. even for the poor shaman, unless you get jacked on a daily basis, its worth it to just get some good gear and not fret about losing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did some more searching and finally did get the sleeves, Solo (no tracking required to get them) in frontier mountains.  There is an AMAZING site for the FM rares http://www.eqexplorers.com/frontier_mountains/fmcycle/frontier_mountains4.htm<br />
<br />
All in all it took about 2 hours, which includes a 25 min stop when I tried to take a dark blue (level 45 Sarnak) with 20m... heh had to gate back to LoIO zone and re-med.  But I was running both cycles as well just cause its so easy to do it.  Got my self a medicine totem while I was at it (5AC 5Wis range, improved healing 1)  and sleeves of the ancients 17ac 3str 8cha.  which have more AC than hate gear, and same AC as PoG gear... so I'm pretty happy about it :-)  But you're right, its prolly better to just wear good gear... I'm just stupid and forget stuff like that I'm wearing an Ikky BP at a nexus portal, or get bind camped and loose all my gear, ect.  Its just generally easier to avoid having to get new gear :-)  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure how viable hunting in ME is on RZ, but there is some pretty decent ND gear that drops there off of robes/4 arms like the Shrouded Medallion and the Stone Idol.<br />

Level up a tad and give it a shot. :)</div></div><hr />
