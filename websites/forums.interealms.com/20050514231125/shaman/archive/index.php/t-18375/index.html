<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I've been reading a lot of rants lately about the price of our spells in Bazaar, mostly along the lines of &quot;it's not fair!&quot; or &quot;I shouldn't have to spend 100k on my lvl 60 spells&quot; or &quot;those vendors are ripping us off!&quot;. I haven't heard a single complaint about the cost of Bane at 650 adventure points. The reason is that the currency to buy Bane is different from the currency to buy stuff in Bazaar. LDoN has its own economy separate from EverQuest.<br />
<br />
What most people haven't recognized yet is that Bazaar is also a separate economy, and has different currency. Unfortunately this currency has the same name as the currency in EverQuest, so people are confused. To eliminate this confusion I'm going to start calling Bazaar platinum Blat, which is different from EverQuest plat.<br />
<br />
All our spells are free for the taking, either by killing the guy thats got 'em or killing the guys that have the research components to make 'em.<br />
<br />
But Shiuna, you say, that takes too long, I have to get a group together and go to dangerous places and kill hundreds of monsters to get the right one to spawn and it might not have the spell I want. OK, then just buy it in Bazaar. But Shiuna, you say, I don't have 35,000 Blat to do that.<br />
<br />
Ah...In EverQuest, as in Real Life (tm), it's Time Versus Money.<br />
<br />
The official exchange rate is 1 Blat = 1 plat, but we can estimate the real exchange rate by looking at some typical transactions. If you go stomp a spiderling and get 2 spiderling silks, you can sell them to a vendor for a few silver each, but if you take them to bazaar you can easily get 5 Blat each, for an exchange rate of about 1 plat = 100 Blat. If you make silk thread from them and combine them with a stinky low quality pelt you get a leather padding, which sells for about 25 Blat, for an exchange rate of about 1 plat = 750 Blat. So, adding labor to raw materials improves the value.....Time versus Money. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately you can't just take plat to Bazaar and expect to trade for Blat at 1 to 750, you have to take stuff there, stuff other people want and are too busy (or too lazy) to get for themselves.<br />
<br />
But Shiuna, you say, those vendors with all the spells are lvl 1 players who have never been outside the Bazaar, they just sit there day after day buying and selling, they never adventured for a single spell, they're ripping us off!<br />
<br />
Ah, they may be lvl 1 EverQuest players, but they're lvl 65 Grandmaster Bazaar players. They know the rules, they know the items, they know the prices, and they know what you, the unsuspecting novice Bazaar player, will pay. So, if you don't want to adventure for your spells, then you'd better learn to play Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Well, Shiuna, you might ask, how did you get your spells?<br />
<br />
I learned to play Bazaar. I made leather padding, blessed fishing poles, heady kiolas, whatever other people weren't interested in making for themselves, and sold them for Blat. I memorized the list of spell components that I needed for all my 50+ spells and prowled the Bazaar for them. I watched the shaman spell market for months, learning the prices, learning the players, watching their strategies. I bought low and sold high, and, except for 2, I've filled my spellbook from Bazaar at a net cost of zero.<br />
<br />
Wow, Shiuna, you might exclaim, that sounds like something I can do. You've really given me some hope that I can eventually get my spells. Will you teach me how to play Bazaar???<br />
<br />
No.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's great Shiuna but you didn't even address your first line. Like &quot;it's not fair&quot;. I would take that statement as someone comparing our spells to another class. You went on at length about working the bazaar for months when the issue would be more of a supply/demand. The fact that the spells just don't drop enough. Someone could do endless combines for months to make PLAT but that doesn't matter when the spell or components aren't for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It really comes down to drop rates. We have the crappiest drop rates in EQ and hence we have seriously expensive spells at 60+ <br />

<br />
 :p  ROFLMAO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The main complaint isnt about the cost of the spell but the cost of the spell vs other classes spells.  even kei and blessing of aego can be found now on fv for 10k but malo is still 20k+ and torpor 30k+.  if you add up the average going rate of all 55-60 shaman spells it will be much higher than any other class.<br />
<br />
The other problem is that soe raised the lvl cap and introduced new spells with out ever reconsidering the drop rate of the old lvl 60 spells.  add in the fact that since pop most of these old world zones are empty and you have 60-65 lvl spells that are much more common than 55-60. If soe had been smart enough to make 55-60 spells drop in pop then value of these spells would be alot more inline with thier uselfness.<br />
<br />
so basiclay your options are to spend outragous prices for lvl 60 spells or just go lvl to 65 and buy the marginaly cheeper spells, especialy since its faster to lvl to 65 than it is to camp malo and torpor...  many of us dont want to sit around all day power lvling to 65 after spending all that time geting to lvl 60...<br />
<br />
as for bane its about 25 adventures for the points, at an average of 200pp per adventure that is 5kpp.  ie 650points = 5kpp sound like a resonable price to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It has always seemed from my perspective that our class' spells get price hiked like no other. It seems more like a bazaar culture hangup, rather than a mutiny against shamans. Still see things like pox for 30k, Str of the Diaku for 15K etc, level 65 spells oever 70K until more than 2 people start pricing stuff at a fair rate, which is when people buy up the spells, if they have been watching.<br />
<br />
I wonder what type of clothes Shiuna is wearing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">even kei and blessing of aego can be found now on fv for 10k but malo is still 20k+ and torpor 30k+.  <br />
<br />
You need to compare spells of the same era.  Those spells were introduced in luclin and only drop off luclin mobs.  Our equivalent was group focus at that time.<br />
<br />
Torpor and malo compare against other kunark-era spells, like the 59 necro pet or Sunstrike.  Or if you want the other end of the spectrum, Mala =P (I swear I've destroyed at least 50 copies of that spell).  The drop rates for Kunark spells has always been poorly aligned, leaving all the good shaman spells pretty rare.<br />
<br />
<br />
It really comes down to drop rates. We have the crappiest drop rates in EQ and hence we have seriously expensive spells at 60+<br />
<br />
All spells 61 and up are gotten by turning in an ethereal or spectral parchment or a rune.  Therefore, spell drop rates for different classes are 100% equal, because we all use the same runes.<br />
The difference in drop rates is really almost entirely contained to the Kunark expansion (level 58 through 60 spells), and has never been fully fixed (they claimed several improvements back during kunark/velious days, but it hasn't helped tremendously).  Most of the drops for velious (focus, can4) and luclin (group focus) are pretty even across all classes.  Including absurdly rare things like GRC, levitation/enduring breath, PE, group acumen, as well as spells for other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is an interesting musing on the economics of EQ.  Your &quot;plat&quot; currency is really what an NPC vendor would pay, while your &quot;Blat&quot; is the fair market value in the bazaar.  Your theory is that the difference is related to adding value with time invested, either in trade skill work or in time waiting for a buyer in the bazaar.  But really, the difference is arbitrary in the sense that vendor prices are arbitrary.  For example, you have Jaundiced Bone Armor which has retained an inflated &quot;Blat&quot; price of 300-500pp each, because that is a little more than you can get selling to a vendor.  Or Blue Diamonds, that sell for about 290pp since you can get 238pp for them at a vendor.  In those two examples, the fair market value in Blat is distorted (propped up) by the unusually high vendor price.<br />
<br />
In most cases, I would say time and effort is simply factored into supply.  For example, a Jade Mace drops off an easy solo mob (Drolvarg Capt in KC), but is a very rare drop in a place most farmers get no exp anymore.  So the price is higher than the utility of the weapon would otherwise dictate.<br />
<br />
No point to my post really, except that the dynamics and distortions of the economy are kind of interesting to watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So...the 'secret' to getting Torpor is farming spider silks?  lol.<br />

<br />
I bought low and sold high, and, except for 2, I've filled my spellbook from Bazaar at a net cost of zero.<br />
<br />
The only thing that could make this better is if we knew which two spells you are missing?  Torpor and Malo perhaps?  or mebbe RGC and Raptor?  Oh that would be hilarious.<br />
<br />
I wonder why your patented &quot;Play the Bazaar game to win the EQ game&quot; method hasn't worked for those spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
btw - is your main a druid?  I only ask because it seems like you are really into tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It really comes down to drop rates. We have the crappiest drop rates in EQ and hence we have seriously expensive spells at 60+ <br />

<br />
This isn't true for the range that you gave.<br />
Nor is it a true indication of todays market.<br />
The 61+ market doesn't affect shaman as it does in the 55-60 range.<br />
The reason is simple, you have just as much chance to gain a EP,SP, or GR as any of the other five people in your group. <br />
The issues that we had regarding sub 60 spells seems to have dramaticly improved in the last year or so.<br />
Take Bane of Knife as an example, historicly speaking this spell was rare as well and brought a premium price. Now I can find on any given night at least 2 copies for sale. Same with Poxx.<br />
<br />
It has also been a VERY long time since I've seen any shaman spell over 50K. Torpor is ranging around 25k, Poxx 10k, Bane, 3-4k, ect.<br />
<br />
hehe <br />
The only spell that I see overly price has been Acumen of Dar'Kar. Ussually at around 20-30k... I just shake my head at that one. But then again I finially saw it for sale for 5k the other night, amounst all the 20-30 sells... So there can bve sanity in the market.<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking of playing the Bazaar.<br />
I found some chain tunic the other night for 1pp, very nice stats etc, looked it up and the other were all 3k+, so I snagged it and resold in five minutes for 4k. Or the time I found a CoCW for 6k... Sold that for 30...:)<br />
Thats playing the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, what two are you missing?  If they are malo and torpor then your advice is completely worthless, because those are the only two spells worth anything, and even then they are quickly made obsolete. <br />
<br />
Second of all, let's look at the &quot;I watched the shaman spell market for months&quot; bit.  You spent months without your spells?  That is not a good thing.  I would not give any younger shaman advice that included waiting months to get their spells.  And, in all honesty, if your money-making strategy takes several months to pay off, it probably isn't a very good strategy.<br />
<br />
Third, the &quot;at a net cost of zero&quot; part.  No, you did not do it for a net cost of zero.  As you said, time is money, and you invested a lot of time in to this little endevour of yours.  You might have the same amount of plat in your bank as you did when you were level 52, but you had to go several months without your spells to do it, and you still aren't level 65.  You realize you're going to have to do the whole thing over again in three levels?  What are you going to do this time?  Spend a few more months farming spider silk to buy quiescence and malos?<br />
<br />
The whole point of plat is to get things you want, when you want them.  The more you are willing to pay, the sooner and faster you get what you want.  If you spend months waiting for a good deal to come along, yeah you will get what you want for less plat than you normally would have paid, but you still would have had to go without it for months.<br />
<br />
For anyone without malo and torpor who is reading this and thinks it is a good idea, listen to this!  What this person suggests is good advice for giving yourself a steady (albeit small) influx of plat, but it IS NOT a good strategy for getting your spells and thus improving your character.  My advice is this: forget about malo and torpor, you do not need them any more.  If a copy of them happens to fall in to your lap, take it, but do not pay normal price for them or waste time camping them, it will only slow down your character developement in the long run.  Instead, go straight for level 65.  As soon as you can, start grouping in BoT.  People say a lot of bad things about bot, and I don't go there any more, but at a certain stage of your character developement, it is the best zone for you.  You can win loot, which you can then sell (1 drop, belt of thunderous auras, easily pays for 2 or 3 65 spells).  You can also win spectrals and runes, which you then turn in for your spells.  Most LDoN loot is pretty worthless, but there are a few items in normal mode which still sell for 10k easily.  Spending time in bot with a little ldon will get you plat (F your blat) and chances at winning your spells for free.  What the original poster doesn't realize (since he isn't 65) is how much easier it is to get plat at 65 than it is at any other level (there is a huge difference between a 65 and a 64).<br />
<br />
I've said it many times, and I will say it again:  Being level 65 will make all of your goals at least twice as easy to accomplish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">this may have been said but i didn't read it all, the big diffrence i see w/ bane being 640 points and not complaining about price is its always avaible when you get the points.  I'm sure there are some of us who saved for a long time to buy malo/torpor (pre pop) and our spells were so rare that when they did show  up they were gone to fast, thus driving up the price, but with ldon those vendors will never run out of copy's of bane to sell me and will never hold out for someone willing to spend more on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">as for bane its about 25 adventures for the points, at an average of 200pp per adventure that is 5kpp.  ie 650points = 5kpp sound like a resonable price to me.<br />
<br />
She speaks the truth, she's saying don't complain because it will take shorter to farm 35k using padding etc than it will to go farm malo off of guardian wurms etc.. <br />
<br />
Your argument I don't understand. So you are saying you make 200pp per adventure and it takes 25 adventures to get the spell. 200pp x 25 adv = 5000plat a fair price for the spell.<br />
<br />
I say to you, you are being ripped off! I make only 50 plat per adventure, I do hard adventures and so it takes 6.5 adventures to get this. So I am paying 6.5 * 50 = 325pp for the spell. Damn soe is against the causal player once again.. OR these calculations are just arbitrary and don't mean a thing..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>zymar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Bane costs 650 adventure points.<br />

First off Blat? LOL crack me up to think we all are gonna change what we say.<br />

Secondly, Everyone can do an Ldon raid. Not everyone can Kill a Kunark dragon or Camp the Emporer in SSra to get spells. That is where the un even factors apply.<br />

When I signed up for EQ, I didnt see the sign up sheet for Uber_guild_001 to help me plan the future of my newly made toon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors dont have un-even advantages or disadvantages. The problem is this, Non-Shaman toons should not be able to loot Shaman spells, and spells as a whole should be available to all Shaman.  Unfortunately this is a business to SoE and not a game, hence the make us buy LoY etc to get Stoicism. Its a scam.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wow, this is a great response, thanks. I'll put my comments inline:<br />
<br />
&quot;I watched the shaman spell market for months&quot; -&gt; &quot;except for 2, I've filled my spellbook from Bazaar at a net cost of zero.&quot;<br />
<br />
First of all, what two are you missing?  If they are malo and torpor then your advice is completely worthless, because those are the only two spells worth anything, and even then they are quickly made obsolete.<br />
<br />
I'm missing Focus of the Seventh and Quiescence. I passed up opportunities for them when they were 10-15K a couple of months ago and now, of course, regret that decision. I snagged the ornate chain boots for 45k instead, which eases the pain somewhat. These two spells are going for 45-60k these days on my server.<br />
<br />
Second of all, let's look at the &quot;I watched the shaman spell market for months&quot; bit.  You spent months without your spells?  That is not a good thing.  I would not give any younger shaman advice that included waiting months to get their spells.  And, in all honesty, if your money-making strategy takes several months to pay off, it probably isn't a very good strategy.<br />
<br />
No, I started when I was level 45. My goal was to have all my spells banked 3 levels in advance.<br />
<br />
Third, the &quot;at a net cost of zero&quot; part.  No, you did not do it for a net cost of zero.  As you said, time is money, and you invested a lot of time in to this little endevour of yours.  You might have the same amount of plat in your bank as you did when you were level 52, but you had to go several months without your spells to do it, and you still aren't level 65. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, ok, you got me there. I guess I should have stated that I'm a casual player with no goals other than to enjoy myself. I'm in no hurry to reach level 65, and actually don't have much interest in the end-game. Recently I spent time trying to figure out a way to clear the Windscorn by myself before the first pirate repopped (nope, didn't quite do it). But, as I said before, I always had at least 3 levels of spells banked in advance, for exactly the reason you stated, so I wouldn't have to do without.<br />
<br />
You realize you're going to have to do the whole thing over again in three levels?  What are you going to do this time?  Spend a few more months farming spider silk to buy quiescence and malos?<br />
<br />
Well, no, I've moved on to higher-level tradeskill stuff and more fruitful areas. The point I was trying to make was that there's more than one way to get your spells, some of which aren't terribly interesting but accomplish the goal.<br />
<br />
The whole point of plat is to get things you want, when you want them.  The more you are willing to pay, the sooner and faster you get what you want.  If you spend months waiting for a good deal to come along, yeah you will get what you want for less plat than you normally would have paid, but you still would have had to go without it for months.<br />
<br />
Hence the popularity of the real dollars for plat web sites. Instant gratification...its just not what gives me satisfaction in this game. The goal is irrelevant, as long as you pursued and accomplished it yourself.<br />
<br />
For anyone without malo and torpor who is reading this and thinks it is a good idea, listen to this!  What this person suggests is good advice for giving yourself a steady (albeit small) influx of plat, but it IS NOT a good strategy for getting your spells and thus improving your character.

<br />
I agree, the higher level you are, the easier things will be. I have really enjoyed the trip from level 1 to 62, and I'm sure I will enjoy the trip the last few levels. I want to get to 65, finish my 8th shawl, and get my epic, and then I'm out of goals. When I read Richard Lawson's adventures of Monual on alt.games.everquest, I realize that his level of play doesn't hold much interest for me, so I guess some soul-searching will be in order. I really just wanna have some fun *sigh*<br />

I suppose if you are catagorizing &quot;recent&quot; in a geological time frame, then the last 3 and a half years would qualify, but issues with our spells have existed since THE DAY KUNARK WAS RELEASED.<br />

Let's take 2 level 60 spells...Malo, and Mala. Mala drops at roughly 100 times the rate malo does. That is not an exaggeration. Mala is vendor trash for 15pp. Always has been. Malo is $$$. Less now with Malos, but it is still one of the most expensive 51-60 spells in the game.</div></div><hr />

I would take that statement as someone comparing our spells to another class. You went on at length about working the bazaar for months when the issue would be more of a supply/demand. The fact that the spells just don't drop enough. Someone could do endless combines for months to make PLAT but that doesn't matter when the spell or components aren't for sale.<br />
<br />
Well, ok, I started when I was level 45 trying always to keep spells banked 3 levels in advance. The stuff has always shown up eventually. I guess, because shamans are the best class to play, Sony nerfed our spell drop rates so the game will be &quot;balanced&quot;. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It has always seemed from my perspective that our class' spells get price hiked like no other. It seems more like a bazaar culture hangup, rather than a mutiny against shamans. Still see things like pox for 30k, Str of the Diaku for 15K etc, level 65 spells oever 70K until more than 2 people start pricing stuff at a fair rate, which is when people buy up the spells, if they have been watching.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My point exactly, to play bazaar you have to be patient, and wait for the influx of spells. They seem to come in bunches, I guess from a guild farming a zone.<br />
<br />
I wonder what type of clothes Shiuna is wearing :)<br />

Actually, its Focus of the Seventh and Quiescence. I haven't done any of the LDoN spells yet. I passed these two up a couple of months ago for something I thought was more important to me at the time. In retrospect, however....<br />

Ah, hadn't thought of that. I do all my foraging in Bazaar.....pay someone else to root around on the ground for stuff to eat (yuck!).<br />

Here in SC (and where you're from, too) we have an adopt-a-highway program where people periodically go out and clean up a stretch of road. Lately, whenever I see a group doing that, I think of druids and rangers trying to get one more dragon egg before they log for the night.<br />

That's a great idea until you're the one with 35k in the bank when you hit lvl 60 and there's one copy of torpor on sale for 35k. Jinheim would tell you don't bother, level to 65. I would say buy it, you might not ever get to 65. I guess it depends on your playstyle and goals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">One of the problems with Shaman spells (ESP 60) was that they dropped (not exclusively but over 50%) in a hard to get to zone. (VP). OR, they dropped off of Kunark Dragons.  Sure NOWADAYS you can get 2 65 SK's and they can duo Trak (or so I've read), but back in the day Trak PWND.<br />
<br />
So it was a combination of rare drop along with tough MOB.<br />
<br />
Oops here's come Velious.  Well yeah, we WANT to do Kunark, but hey, Dain, Vindi is up, ...so less drops.<br />
<br />
Oops here's Luclin. Well screw Trak, we got SS armor which blows Kunark armor away, and oh btw, sorry Shaman, just Malo and oh you don't have Malo?<br />
<br />
Sure you can go fool around in VP these days, but why would you? To mess up faction? Because you want a Robe of the Azure sky? (woooo l33t)<br />

Thank goodness and the Tribunal for research. <br />

Oh, just to provide a counterpoint - my 63 Enchanter had ZERO problems with all spells to Kunark. The ONLY spell I paid more than 10k for was KEI and I made that back in about 2 weeks in Bizaare  pimpn KEI for donations. <br />

It's a fantasy answer that'll never happen, so enough with that line already.  The housing market in California is insanely high too.  Want people to not buy houses till prices drop?  Sure, some do, others can't afford one, but save up until they can.  The rest sell to those people that want to live here and are willing to pay the price to do so.  It's like telling people to live in Montana until the house prices drop to $100,000 in Cali.<br />
<br />
If you want your spells from the bazaar, keep saving.  Those prices aren't dropping because there'll always be people with lots of plat more than willing to pay that.<br />

I started when I was lvl 45 by checking the bazaar before I went adventuring and after I came back. I left myself in trader mode whenever I wasn't adventuring. I can assure you that 98% of the traders are afk, the only people staring at laggy walls are the buyers. Of course, this probably isn't an option for dialup users.<br />

I would guess that you have all your spells already the way you're talking. If the price for a certain spell is 30k how long do you think it would take to get down to say 5k if no one buys it? Two weeks? A month? Two months? Not many are going to wait around without their spells for the price to slowly go down.

<br />
I don't necessarily agree with the level to 65 asap philosophy - that may be fun for some but isn't for me.  I level very fast but I also keep my gear and spell book up-to-date (although I don't have all spells, some just aren't worth the cost like Pox (I don't solo) and Malo (I don't raid and not enough need for it in my normal grouping - although I'm considering getting it if I see a deal just for annoying assassination bosses)).<br />
<br />
I get a decent amount of plats from normal xping...but I make vastly more plats via the bazaar and minimal tradeskill manipulation.  I very rarely farm anything (sometimes with alts I'll go out of my way to xp off of critters that drop things I can use - two birds with one stone, ya know - and helps alts pay for their gear).  I spend a minimal amount of time in the bazaar and doing combines, which doesn't hinder my leveling, and I have less than 100 in my trade skill - and I easily make 10-30k per week to supplement my plat income.  At my level with my xp and item farming options that's still good money.<br />
<br />
Before I figured out how to easily earn plats I used to be very upset about shaman spell costs.  I'm still not all that happy about it but other classes get the shaft too.  The thing that truly bums me out about the current EQ economy is the people that buy/sell plats online and can pay stupid prices for things I want without earning and damn thing, which ends up keeping prices high or driving them higher.  That and all the exploiting/hacking going on that ruins the game in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol agree. Albeit Shiuna cleared that up later. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Generally i have to agree with the content somewhat, playing the 'bazaar game' can be a valid alternative for shamans to get their spells together (depends on your playstyle and time though).<br />
<br />
But in my experience when you want to play this game successfully, you have to check bazaar at least once, better twice per day. That IS indeed time you loose, where you could do better things like XPing, raiding or whatever. And this few minutes per day add up after months.<br />
<br />
I made a check some weeks ago, how many post 59 spells were in bazaar priced above 20K. From ca. 40 spells throughout all classes 20 alone were shaman spells. I checked randomly, if the other spells for other classes were available, most of them were generally available far below 20K (Note: LDoN has changed the situation somewhat, but that isn't the point).<br />
<br />
Are shamans more stupid than other classes, unable to keep their spell prices down? I don't believe that. So there MUST be some flaw in spell drops and their relative availability across the classes. The second influence i see here is, how traders perceive shamans spell situation subjectively (i believe, some relict from the good old Kunark times /sigh), but there isn't much one can do about that.<br />
<br />
The valid points in your study 'bazaar economics for dummies' ;) don't adress the core issue. Have to agree with some poster above, just forget about Malo and Torpor and go straight for 65 Malos and Q, saves a lot of headache.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, we can't do anything about the core issue for the 50-60 level spells, which appears to be the drop rates for scrolls and components. We can only deal with the game as it's presented to us. I assume before the bazaar was available that our spells were even harder to get and more expensive.<br />
<br />
For the 61-65 level spells, I guess all the classes are on an even playing field. It seems to me that it will take just as much game time to put together a group in the appropriate zone, kill stuff until a rune or parchment drop, win the roll, then turn it in and hope you get the spell you want. Of course, you are gaining experience while you're doing this, which makes it more productive than the tradeskilling/farming/bazaar route, but this is more a shortcoming of tradeskilling in EverQuest.<br />
<br />
And, finally, bought Quiescence last night for 35k (yay!), just one more to go.<br />

<br />
I only have 1 character above level 50 so I really don't know what problems other caster classes have with getting their spells. I think one of our problems is that torpor/malo at level 60 and quiescence/malos at level 65 are REALLY REALLY important for us to operate at maximum efficiency as shamans....and everyone knows it. So if we can't get them ourselves, then we pay big bucks to them that can!<br />
<br />
(derail)<br />
Regarding people that buy plat/items/characters on auction sites...that can't be very much fun and I'm betting they won't be around long. When I find myself losing interest in the shaman's life, I start a new class and play them to level 15 or so. That seems to get me out of whatever rut I've dug myself into. These people skipped all the fun stuff.<br />
