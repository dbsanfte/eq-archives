<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm an old EQ player thinking of returning, but it seems the Shaman which I favored most has been getting the short end of SOE's stick... so why even bother?<br />
<br />
After 3 yrs absence from the game, and reading all the complaints from players about how the Shaman has been shortchanged and neutered, I'm seriously considering not returning, what can anyone here say that could change my mind?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why bother? Because its a wonderful class, no matter how unbalanced it is now. If you have been away for 3 years i think you should try for yourself and see what it is like. Since we dont complain about whats good here, you will get an overly negative image of a very diverse class if you only read the complaints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi Mystic !<br />
<br />
I would say this . In my opinion shamans are really quite balanced in all play from 1-65 untill you get too the point where you can fight in the hardest exp zones in PoP . Even then in the hardest exp zones in PoP we arent THAT bad off .. The constant midigation of slow hurts us but we can still contribute somewhat as Back up healer and Slow is still vital enough too be usefull .<br />
It isnt untill you are 65 with quite a few AA and respectable gear that you will be moving into GoD . It is in GoD and ONLY in GoD that i feel truely useless . <br />
So unless your shaman is at a level of play where you will be comming back and instantly moving into GoD content you will be fine !<br />
<br />
So fire up that shaman and Have fun in PoP and all prior expansions becase we as a class can do quite well in any of that content .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, as I left just a month prior to SOL comming out, and at that time the Shaman was hanging out as the best class (IMHO), I was very concerned that everything I've read recently has been bad press. My current Internet Connection speeds are so bad that it's not worth even loading the game, let alone trying to play it... I'd be getting killed before I even knew anything was killing me. When I move into town, i'll be (hopefully) on broadband, barring that, I should be able to limp along on a 56k dial-up connection. It really all depends on where in town I move, some areas have broadband, and some still only have dial-up.. and that suxxxxxxx!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's really best to not pay attention to what others say and do what you feel you really want to do.  Only you can determine if you are happy at what you are doing, not others.  I sometimes get the feeling that I'm a bit under performing in my abilities because of what the shaman can and cannot do, however if I had it another way, I would not want to ever pick another class to play right now.  With a RL friend that has one of almost every class in EQ right now, the shaman is the one that I think is the best and most fun and I would never switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's true-- no offense to anyone here but I've a feeling that if I didn't read class boards I would be a lot happier about my char.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kezlar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've played a shaman for 5 years and ONLY a shaman that whole time, more than 300 days played.<br />
<br />
I always thought that the Monk class website was the worst class site due to their constant whining and bitching.  I'm sorry to say that I find all the carry on here to be verging on the same pathetic whining that the Monk site offers.  Not as bad yet, but verging on it.<br />
<br />
Don't listen to the hype, shaman always have been and always will be the superior class choice IMHO.<br />
<br />
Log in, have fun, ignore the moaning.  Make up your own mind.<br />
<br />
NB.  I do appreciate that some people have gone to great lengths to &quot;better&quot; the shaman class and cause.  I'm not criticizing the efforts you have put in, more power to you.  I just don't agree with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In my opinion nobody can really tell you why to return to a game or not. its all based on individual preference. After 5 years im still having fun in EQ. ive tried other games and they just dont measure up to content and fun i have playing EQ, its not for everyone and yes its frustrating at times and yes we like to rant on Sony but in my opinion its still the most immersive game and shaman being one of the most fun classes to playin IMO ( again this is solely based on personal pref hence why nobody can really tell you to come back).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wisesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wait till EQ2 or WOW comes out, don't come back to this game, it's not worth your time and your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If (after a three-year absence) some of the folks/friends you originally played with still have active characters, that'd be the reason for me. Yep, I think shaman could use a bit of a tweak for the higher-end folks, but bein' that I'm not one of them (and won't be for awhile), I'm perfectly happy with my shaman and his abilities, in spite of the massive complaining that goes on. We're still a great class, IMO, and I still have fun on EQ. Not worth the money, some say ... well, there are days I'd agree. But then I go back through and look at the screenshots I keep of funny things people say, or neat mobs I've killed/raided, and that makes it worth the $12 to me.<br />
<br />
Kezlar, you ought to be President. &quot;Log in, have fun, ignore the moaning.&quot; Couldn't have said it better myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Esquel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't come back, if you are clean stay that way.  If you need a new hobby try CoH or Lineage2, etc.  Taking up EQ again after so long is like buying a pack of cigarettes just after paying your last teeth whitening bill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">im not sure how it is now, but a year ago playing on a 56k connection was just fine for me, its downloading patches where the 56k really &quot;shines&quot; :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Esquel, that cracked me up.  Perfect.<br />
<br />
Mysti, find another game until you see shamans ecstatic that the fixes are really &quot;done.&quot;  There is no situation now where I wouldn't rather have a chanter or a beastlord in a group.  I also play an elemental level SK, along with my elemental shaman, and have also extensively played a druid and monk, as well as dabbled with a warrior, so I'm not saying this just out of being a bummed-out shaman.  It's really true.<br />
<br />
There's not any point in being a class that can so easily be replaced by not just one but TWO others who can do essentially the same thing (slow and give reasonable buffs) plus add an awful lot more -- a better buff or two plus offtanking ability and much more damage for beastlords, or, for a chanter, much superior buffs, mez, better haste, KEI/VoQ, and even the possible use of a pet that so vastly outdamages your group that it renders both the rest of the group and the rest of the game as close to trivial as imaginable.<br />
<br />
Either one of those classes kick our butts so thoroughly that at this point only the ignorant or the most loyal friends choose to include shamans in groups.  And in raids--well, we don't really stack all that well, and there is a flood of shamans into the game going back to the days when a weak dragon was first soloed in Velious, so we're not in very great demand for raids either.  <br />
<br />
Very sorry to say all this, and it sounds so negative that it's natural to think that it couldn't possibly be true or must be somehow exaggerated or mistold in the telling, but...that's my honest summation of my experiences in the game and insights for now.<br />
<br />
It may change later, but later is not now.<br />
<br />
Give it I would guess at least six months, so some more shamans quit and burn out, and maybe Sony will actually feel inspired by competition to make all classes worthwhile again instead of just being incredibly lazy and stupid by making the game revolve around the holy trinity of cleric/chanter/warrior yet again.  <br />
<br />
When that happens, and there's a true place for shaman that you can really look forward to, think about coming back. But there's no hurry.  There may be something for shaman to look forward to, but not now.  Maybe that day will come, but there's no point in spending your money and wasting(perhaps vast amounts of) your time fooling around in the bungled mess they have right now.  Wait for them to get it right, then come back.  <br />
<br />
If you want to listen to those who are at lower levels saying everything is hunky-dory, be sure you're at that level yourself and definitely have every intention of staying there for a long, long, long time.   If you have moving up as a motivation, though, you won't be well-served by coming to a situation in which you can spend many hundreds of hours more just to come to a dead end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman is probably the most FUN class you'll play till you want to play the high end game.<br />
Depends what you really want out of EQ whether you come back as a Shaman or any other class.<br />
<br />

Play something thats coming alive or is fresh and exciting. EQ is dying slowly IMHO and i am starting to believe nothing is going to save it from itself. Corprate minds move too slowly and too too little risks to make changes and EQ has strayed so far from what made everyone get addicted that i cant see how itll come back.<br />
<br />
<br />
So i would say pick up City of Heros or play a FPS for a few months till WoW comes out and then check that out. I hate to be the spreader of negitivity, but fact is, i cant even find a reason to stay in EQ anymore. I log in and after 5 min im like... this is boring. I guess if i was in a guild with friends around it would be different, but unless i wanna raid 5 days a week for 4 hours a night, i cant get into anything that isnt beyond velious or SoL. No guild that is in PoP+ wants someone that cant raid 4-5 hours every single night.<br />
<br />
Yes im bitter, sue me.</div></div><hr />
