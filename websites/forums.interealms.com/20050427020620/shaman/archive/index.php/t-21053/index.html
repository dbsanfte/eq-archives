BLOODGILL GOBLINS in Lake Omen (Lazy Typer)<br />
<br />
Levitate over the water, look down. If you do this &quot;just&quot; right, you can see to the very bottom of the Lake. the BG's spawn 2 at each corner of the submerged temple. Root one BG and make a dash to the coast... aggro dies on the rooted one if ya back off real quick. Root/Slow/DoT x2.<br />
always keep SoW/Levi/Chloro on... make sure to have Canni II also.<br />
<br />
As I posted about what kind of gear a Shaman should have, I recommend HP/Mana, Focus Effects, Recovery (Iksar Bp-Fungi/Solstice earring) gear. This helps out ALOT! I was a Wis phreek until I was shown the error of my ways...<br />
<br />
Once you hit 46 it goes alot faster! You can get that nice Chanter/Shaman/Cleric/Pally/Druid buffs! I was Root/DoT'ing 2 at a time with ease! took me about 4 minutes to kill 2 BG's at a time... a lil advice, use you Pet to kill off those pesky &quot;Greenies&quot; that might bother you when you meditate. Also, you can use your pet to finish off the BG's when they're almost dead and are &quot;Slo-Mo'ing&quot; away from ya!<br />
<br />
Of course I did this back in 2000, hopefully they wern't nerfed in anyway!<br />
