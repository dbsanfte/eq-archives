Anyone know the specific manna benefits of riding on a horse, say for example if you are constantly dd'ing with JBB, or even chain casting Cannibalize over and over.  Basically, how much manna does one regen standing up, versus sitting down (on a lizard) at say level 60.  What does that amount to as a Flowing Thought number?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">em2johns<br />
<br />
I don't recall the exact numbers, but being on a horse(or lizard) is ~FT20 I believe.  To test this, cast to OOM, and stand.  Time how long it takes to med up.  then cast OOM again, and sit.  Time how long that takes.  Being on a horse or lizard is like you're sitting all the time.  It's a huge difference.  I definately miss my horse(and/or lizard) when I'm indoors now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a barbarian shaman, if that makes a difference.<br />
<br />
1) Has anyone had both a horse and lizard? If so, which do you prefer and why?<br />
<br />
2) For a horse, does shrink make the head go away altogether? I'm used to shrinking myself most of the time, so it wouldn't be a big pain to do so. If not, is it worth the extra 1kpp (apparently lowest price for lizard is 9500) to not have the horse head in your way?<br />
<br />
3) After the horse nerf, you have to have horse models visible, and you have all the drawbacks of horses - acceleration/deceleration, lag, unable to interrupt. I move around to target mobs, and I interrupt spells fairly frequently - is it still worth getting a horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I hate the horse &quot;fix&quot;.<br />
<br />
If I did not already own my horse, I would not buy one.<br />
<br />
I am leaning towards selling it, but I want to give it a few more hours of play time to see.<br />
<br />
If they would just let me duck out of spells that would turn the balance and I'd be leaning towards keeping it.  The other disadvantages make sense, but it simply does not make sense that I can interrupt a spell when NOT on a horse but I can't do it when I am on a horse.  The slow start/stop is a PITA but understandable and I will deal with it, but not being able to interrupt a spell is deadly in the era of 10-second mini-CH's.<br />
<br />
Edit: yes, I realize I can click off the buff and duck, but I rarely have my hand on the mouse or know where my cursor is, so that wastes valuable time - and might well mean the difference between living and dying if I'm frantically interrupting a CH to cast a faster heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
could you not map the key next to &quot;duck&quot; to /dismount?<br />
<br />
then you could press the key for dismount, then duck, saving having to use the mouse to click off the horse icon (which i suffer from too, i often lose my mouse on screen during hectic action :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Too bad the only way to use /dismount is to put it on a socials key or to type it out.<br />

You can't use socials keys while you're casting.... so that leaves typing /dism <br />

It doesnt.<br />
[<br />
1) Has anyone had both a horse and lizard? If so, which do you prefer and why?<br />
<br />
I have both a horse and a lizard.  I like the Lizard for the look.  I dont like the bouncy ride.  Bouncing around causes more video lag, and annoys me.  Shrink pretty much removes the bounce.  But then again, I usualy click of the lizard or horse if I am traveling, as I have the cheap one.  With a lizard there is no head in your way, on a horse a shrink will take care of the head problem.  It SEEMS to be easier to target from a lizard than from horseback -on a horse you frequently target your mount even if you shrink yourself.<br />
[<br />
2) For a horse, does shrink make the head go away altogether? I'm used to shrinking myself most of the time, so it wouldn't be a big pain to do so. If not, is it worth the extra 1kpp (apparently lowest price for lizard is 9500) to not have the horse head in your way?<br />
<br />
Shrink makes the head go away, but there are still some targeting issues.  I found the price on my lizard to be LESS than my horse, but I bought a black horse.<br />
[<br />
3) After the horse nerf, you have to have horse models visible, and you have all the drawbacks of horses - acceleration/deceleration, lag, unable to interrupt. I move around to target mobs, and I interrupt spells fairly frequently - is it still worth getting a horse? <br />
VERY much worth it. The mana regen is unreal.  I dont notice a lack of KEI.  I can do an exp group without cannibalizing (I am starting to TALK to people now... instead of constantly clicking).  Even if nothign else, the lack of sitting agro will save your life.<br />
<br />
Oh, for those having problems interrupting spells... click off the icon in your buff window and then hit &quot;d&quot; to duck.  Its still annoying, but only one mouseclick more than without the horse.  A fraction of a second delay.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I almost never played FPS before EQ and so never got into the habit of using the mouse to get around and I use the #keypad instead.  I hardly ever use the mouse, unless I'm doing inventory stuff, or trying to pick out a certain mob in a throng (and F8 is still better most often since lag and trying to find where your mouse pointer is makes that slower).<br />
<br />
Interrupting spells just became a royal pain for many.  One that shouldn't exist.<br />
<br />
The inability to duck out of spells while on a horse boggles me, and I sincerely doubt that the programmers intended it to be that way.  More like they're too lazy to fix it.  Create a &quot;lean&quot; key or something instead.  It's utter idiocy to try and pass off that all of a sudden I no longer know how to interrupt MY casting because I'm riding Mr. Ed.</div></div><hr />

There are a couple ways to click off a horse and interuppt spells.  Clicking off the icon works, but also typing in /dismount works as well.  Still a hasstle, but lots easier than trying to click that icon on the screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Depending on how skilled of a player you are and your lag, you should lose only about a second removing the horse so you can duck to interrupt a spell.  Ya i know a second is a second and seconds count, but it's not that bad really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Syndromes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Personally I can't see spending a buttload of plat on one or even a horse.  I bought the cheapest horse when they came out and now I traded that in and got myself a Drog (cheapest one).  IMO, they're best used for med'ing/aggro issues... not traveling.<br />
<br />
If you're a class that can't cast SoW or better, then either do the JBoot quest or buy the MQ of one and save yourself a ton of plat!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I had cheapy horse Wilbur for about six months I think.  Maybe a bit less.  I used him only for medding, and rid myself of the &quot;head in the way&quot; issue with two shrinks.  I type /dism like lightening to interupt.<br />
<br />
However.. I bought bardspeed horse later.  Really, for any sow class, there are two options.  Cheapy horse for med, or Bardspeed horse for everything.  <br />
<br />
Again, two shrinks takes out the choppiness of Lumpy (my leezard).  Also, though, it is MUCH easier to loot from Lumpy than it ever was Wilbur.   He also seems to start and stop faster (or should I say, easier to cast a faster starting/stopping drogmor than the horse, as if you have a better chance of casting the 1sec delay lizard than the 4 sec delay leezard).<br />
<br />
And let's face it - leezards are cool as hell!<br />

I love Lumpy and would NEVER trade him!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Zebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I love my horse for the mana regen rates, but it took some time to get used to fighting from horseback.  The head/ targeting issues were a problem.  I used shrink for a while.  This fixes the head problem, but not the targeting.  I've found the best solution is to cast your horse, then cast invis, then click off the invis.  As long as you stay in first person the horse stays invis to you and there are no targeting or head issues.  Of course this doesn't work so well if you are clicking off the horse to duck out of spells, but I almost never do that.   Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />
