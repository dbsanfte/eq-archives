<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick question to anyone that may know the answer.<br />
I have been thinking about trying some new games and was wondering how long my beloved shaman would remain in existence when the end billing button is pressed.  I'm not sure if I'm ready to break my eq addiction yet and I would hate to loose the work that has been put in if  the other games dont pan out.  Any ideas...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">According to Sony they have never deleted any accounts that have ended billing. Your character should still exist in limbo. You just won't be able to log in and play on that account after your billing expires until you reactivate the billing.<br />
<br />
I know a few friends who have ended billing and they occasionaly get emails from sony offering them one month free on their expired account to try to get them to log in again for free and get hooked again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same as  above, though during one of my extended leaves from the game someone did somehow gain control of my accounts, took items off my low characters (not my mains) then deleted all characters.<br />
<br />
After abit over 2 weeks of petitioning I was able to get ahold of a GM and get all my characters on both accounts restored minus the minor gear moved off of the minor twinks by whatever nim-wit did it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly the GM's did not go after who got ahold of my accounts since they thought even though I told them I didn't that I told someone my passwords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shaimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for taking the time to reply.  That was what I was hoping to hear, now to just push that stupid button.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I heard through the grape vine that canceled accounts are taken off their back-up process.  Which means that you account is still there unless there is some sort of data loss.</div></div><hr />
