<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kinadafz60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically, i want the shaman to get 58 fast, and teh monk to get 58 fast also.  What would be the best scenerio?<br />
<br />
1) Powerlevel monk in the hole, shaman outside of group (lb to 57)...can get to 55 in probably a week for monk, then 2box like normal<br />
2) Group em both together like i am now, seems like kills are too slow though<br />
3) Powerlevel shaman to 58 using FD trick, then powerlevel monk to 58ish just straight powerleveling, then group normally.<br />
<br />
My goals are to get both 60 to duo dragons in WW...just sounds like a lot of fun :)<br />
<br />
Monk is twinked good with fungi, cof, decent weapons.<br />
<br />
shaman is lacking in gear sorta, has thurg bp, epic, but not much else...has all spells up to 57 (the beneficial ones at least)<br />
<br />
Of course, would like to make a little cash while doing, but if I don't, thats fine.<br />
<br />
HS sucks, I don't like 2 boxing here...spent 3 hours there last night only to get 2.5 blues....then die and loose it all.  It would be better to fight there if shaman ws 58 so i didn't have to stoicism my monk and kill my dps.<br />
<br />
What u guys think I should do? <br />
<br />
I really dont' give a damn about faction either :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, when my monk hits 53 / 55, he will have new weapons to increase dps even more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dulaks harbor is where I plvl my 49 monk to 54 fairly quick. Go into the refinery area (fort looking thing) straight back against the wall. I did NOT group them. I made a pet and buffed him.Sent monk out to pull swapped back and hit a hot key.<br />
<br />
ASSIST<br />
/assist smaxx (my monk)<br />
/pause 2<br />
/pet attack<br />
/attack off<br />
/cast 4 (slow)<br />
<br />
This was an easy way to slow mob and use pet DPS to speed kills. Gotta watch the mobs they will warp to the above walkway so pull to the side w/ the 2 burdoned ore cart guys or root them.(clear them early in your cycle). I left with a lot of gems and parts/meat from troll,ogre and iksars. At lvl 54 stuff started going light blue so I moved to mines above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice Assist hot key you have there.  Not sure about your lag on it but you can cut at least one line out of it and add another Cast of slow to catch any fizzles.<br />
<br />
ASSIST<br />
/assist smaxx (my monk)<br />
/pause 2<br />
/pet attack<br />
/attack off<br />
/cast 4 (slow)<br />
<br />
Under options you can turn off auto attack on assist.  Then add the line /cast 4, /pa 3 just before the last line in your Hot button.  That way when you get one those annoying fizzles.  Your hot button will catch it faster then you ever could short of spaming your slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With the group bonus i don't know why ya don't just group em til ya hit 58 with shammy, then if ya want monk to catch up dump the shammys xp into aa and continue to dou. You lose 20% xp by not grouping, so either way ya do it by soloing them/pl ya lose time/waste xp opportunity. If ya want em both 60 then aa the shammy at 60 and catch the monk up then.</div></div><hr />
