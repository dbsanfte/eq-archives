<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Omakay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there...<br />
<br />
I am planning on going down to the tunnels to hunt locusts and scarabs for the Crystalized Cloudy Eyes.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done this camp, and can give some info?<br />
<br />
How hard are the mobs?<br />
What type of force should I bring? Solo, Pair or Group?<br />
How many of these things am I going to need to kill to get a couple of eyes?<br />
Anything else drop down here?<br />
<br />
Really appreciate any help.  Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have done the tunnels quite a few times.  My group consists of me, cleric, chanter, wiz and 2 dps.  I'm sure you could use a druid or bard also for the 2 roles also. The dps can be anything pretty much. We've used most dps combos and they all work nicely.<br />
The tunnels are a little bugged (no pun intended) and you can get aggro through the walls, therefore an evaccer is essential, as well as the chanter for mezzing.  <br />
Fight your way to the bugs and set up camp there. The main problem is the aggro-through-the-walls that can, and probably will, happen. When that occurs you will most likely get 4-6 adds. If your mezzer can deal with, then stay and line em up, if not, evac and try again. <br />
A fun place.</div></div><hr />

The worse thing is the paperthin walls, if you have a map it will help alot as you can stay away from the side of the tunnel where there is something on the other side.</div></div><hr />
