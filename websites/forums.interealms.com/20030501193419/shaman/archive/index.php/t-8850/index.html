<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vilyadhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy all,<br />
<br />
Just starting my shaman on the Test server and I heard a rumor that the skill per level cap had been removed from Alchemy.  Does anyone know if this is true or not?<br />
<br />
Your Friend,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I find it hard to believe, as that would allow low level shamans access to spells and abilities they wouldn't otherwise have at too low levels (regen, stat buffs, ect.).  <br />
<br />
I DO believe that the removal of the 180 point limit is coming, along with perhaps more super-high-level potions. (I'm thinking mini-topor in a bottle is appropriate for trials and stuff).<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm operating in the optomistic belief that theres still a Vision (tm), and that someone is still interested in balance..I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

200 now, no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 180 skill cap was removed the day PoP was released.  Yes, 200 is the new skill cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guys, there never was a 180 skillcap on alchemy. Cap was always at 200... But since they had a formula (lvl-24)x5, it lead to that noone could pass 180 in alchemy before PoP (60-24)x5=180.... But it wasnt something they lifted.<br />
<br />
It do however have a skillcap of 200 (as far as i have heard). And btw... Today:<br />
<br />
Alchemy (200)!<br />
<br />
<br />
Another lots of pp wasted ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">205 is the cap actually.<br />
<br />
(Your level - 25 + 1) * 5 = max alchemy skill<br />
<br />
At 60 it is:<br />
(60-25+1)*5 = 180<br />
<br />
At 65:<br />
=(65 - 25 + 1)*5<br />
=(40+1)*5<br />
=41*5<br />
=205<br />
<br />
So there you go for skill cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have you reached 205?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Silly shaman :P<br />
<br />
(level -24)x 5 is the exact same formula as you said there... <br />
65-24=41... 41x5 = 205...<br />
<br />
You didnt get the point of the thread at all... There is a cap for alchemy at 200... noone has ever passed it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dargadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This came up in the SF FanFaire at the tradeskills discussion group.  The developer said he was planning on removing the negative stats from the stat potions (that's happened) and also remove the level-dependant alchemy skill cap, so that a lvl 25 shaman could get his skill to 200 (or whatever).  The skill cap removal he's spoken of has NOT happened.<br />
<br />
Of course it's still tough trying to sell a stat potion, because no one really knows much about them.</div></div><hr />
