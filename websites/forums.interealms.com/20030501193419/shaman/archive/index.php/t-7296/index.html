<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samsonn Thunderfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know the basic pricing for the average potion prices but was curious is there a site that gives the reccomended selling prices for all the potions we can make in single, 5 shot and 10 shot potions?  Any help appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2x cost to make it without failures is a general good starting point, but the actual prices vary from server to server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Benjdragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out what they are going for in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
This is on Bristlebane.<br />
Normal prices for SoW are about 90 plat for a 10 charge.<br />
Ant's potion, Antiweight, and Unlife Awareness goes for 175-180 plat for a 10 charge.<br />
Kilva's Blistering Flesh is 200 plat a 10 charge.<br />
Kilva's Skin of Flame is 400-500 plat a 10 charge.<br />
<br />
If you are carrying them around and not selling in the Bazaar you might be able to ask 10% more for them.<br />
<br />
I have found that the stat potions sell very rarely. Even if priced at cost.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ajgala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why is it that STAT potions sell so rarely?  Could it be that people just don't know about them?   <br />
<br />
For example,  handed my Paladin friend about 30 charges of Null Aura.   It is 15 dex, 15 MR and neg 8 AGI.  He loves it.  It helps his Rodcet Nife proc and Ghoulbane proc more.<br />
<br />
Do we need to spread the word more? <br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />
