<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i had just a couple silly ass questions for you peeps that actually have torpor.<br />
<br />
do you bother having cloroblast memmed?<br />
do you bother keeping regrowth on you?(or even memmed)<br />
<br />
/ponders the thought of some day actually scribing this mystery spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, I love chloroblast, it's a great spell for casters who are getting pounded due to the quick cast time.  It's also the heal I use when /assist healing main tanks during big fights (every little bit helps!)<br />
<br />
I love regrowth!  I didn't use it as much after I hit level 60 and scribed torpor, but now that I have group regrowth, I'm using it a lot more again.  I insist on it when I'm grouped with a druid with a clicky Regrowth of the Grove bp.  Free regrowth!<br />
<br />
I generally don't keep regrowth memmed, I swap it in as needed.  Another good reason to work on the 50% duration increase AA skill!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, chloroblast still always mem'd....but I dont seem to cast regrowth anymore at all. I'm sure i should, but I dont. I dunno, getting by fine without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I solo something for experience I usually don't have chloroblast mem'd, I tend to keep regrowth up though.<br />
When killing things that can put out a huge punding I keep chloroblast mem'd. Soloing stuff that might pound me down really fast, chloro is a good safe gaurd.  In groups I am the same as Gloriana and keep the quick heal out for poor casters.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's very rare that I will unmem Chloroblast.  Regrowth is still our most efficient healing, but I don't really make an effort to keep it on all the time.  It's rarely memmed unless someone else requests it on a raid.  For xp groups, I use group Regrowth as my primary source of healing, with Torpor and Chloroblast as the back-ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use a torpor/chloro combo, f regrowth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chloroblast always memmed.  It's faster casting than torpor, so its a quicker heal for someone getting beat up and since it is faster casting it is also easier to channel...less time to get smacked around.<br />
<br />
regrowth is swapped in and out...I only religiously keep it up when I am in an exp grp as main healer.  Even then it's not for me, it's for the people I am supposed to be healing, love group version of regrowth.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always have chloroblast and torpor memorized, but only swap regrowth in when I need to cast it on someone else.  Lately the only time I've ever got regrowth cast on me is if I'm using group regrowth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Chloro yes, Regrowth no.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes and yes.  I always have heal, canni4, torpor, slow and malo memmed.  Usually root is memmed as well.  Having regen up always is just a habit and I will continue to do it.  300 mana is nothing.  Since regrowth and VotB are on the same timer, I almost always cast VotB immediately after I cast regrowth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Chloro is almost always up, the long cast on Torpor makes it a poor choice in an emergency.  By the time its clear that I need to be healing, I generally do not have time for torpor.    (I rarely set myself up as the main healer, I do back-up heals and slow.  Hate having to choose between another cast on slow and a heal.)<br />
<br />
I have group regrowth, so I generally keep everyone in it.  It gives you that extra edge and strikes me as well worth the mana.  <br />
<br />
I have even had one occassion since scribing Torpor where I had to haul out the fungi tunic, click that fungi staff (regrowth had just dropped) and quaff a Greater Rejuv potion.  Sometimes there is just no substitute for zero-mana hp regeneration. =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>etheria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sometimes I love to throw Nature's Recovery on shamans and necros on top of my clicky Regrowth to make them regen even faster. :p<br />
<br />
But yeah, on my shaman, I have Chloroblast memmed--it's fast, it helps regular xping, and its range is nice. Regrowth, yeah, I use in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Smash, you'll get it someday, but then you won't be a ghetto Shaman anymore. :(<br />
<br />
Btw, I am starting to save now. hehe ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rule #1: Never trust the cleric :D :D   Chloroblast can be a life-saver when a cleric is supposedly afk (but really picking his nose :mad: ).  If you plan on getting lots of AA, I'd even recommend training healing adept (where direct heals have a chance at critting ie doubling in amount), which could make chloroblast crit at 770 which is nice :D Also train the one that makes you interrupt less, don't know the name because I haven't gotten that far yet :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh, and mage focus items help too.  I think it's the ring that decreases the casting time - some people take em for granted, but they come in very handy.<br />
<br />
As for the new implemented focus items, I don't know much about them.  Only item I have with a new effect is flayed paeballa gloves, and it's reanimation haste II, which means only applicable to skellie pets - ***, ghey Verant :mad:  <br />
<br />
Anyways, anyone know what good focus items there are out there for shamans?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">chloroblast definitely.  regeneration, only when i am soloing or in a group where everyone gets hit every once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Smasherr, I've now busted you 2 times with your Illusion Ogre speak worn off. I'm starting not to believe it anymore!<br />
<br />
Stick with Heroes. They kill enough stuff it'll drop within a month I gurantee it. Don't think another Oracle is in need right now so you'll be first in line.  Right before you joined we had 2 copies of malo that went to newly dinged 60's.. Too important of a spell not to make it available for ya imo<br />
<br />
(Don't quote me on this, the logic seeping out in me :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i keep all 3 up. <br />
<br />
chloro for 2 reasons: 1) quick casting time in emergencies, and 2) can heal outside your group if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Regrowth, always (it's a great source of mana), Chloro... kinda can't yet ;)</div></div><hr />
