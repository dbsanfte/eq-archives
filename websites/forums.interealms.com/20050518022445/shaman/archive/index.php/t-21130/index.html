<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all. <br />
I need some help and i need it badly.<br />
<br />
I am suppose to have the MB flag but when i do Guided meditation i dont get the little bit of info that says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Giwin would like you to find him in Drunder so he can present you to Rallos Zek&quot;<br />
<br />
My flag for the MB seem to be bugged. I went on ANOTHER raid and the gnome would not talk to me. Not before or after the raid.<br />
Normally this means that you have the flag?<br />
<br />
Has anyone heard of Bugged flags and what can be done to resolve this?<br />
I have put in 4 petitions but they just get deleted and have put one in Via the everquestlive website, and replied to an automated email with all the details. But alas still not a word from any GM<br />
<br />
here is my guided meditation<br />
<br />
You say, 'guided meditation'<br />
The History translated for you reveals the fate of Zebuxoruk.  Trapped in the Plane of Time you must gain the power of the elements to gain entrance.<br />
The Cipher of the Divine Language appears on your arms for a brief moment then fades.<br />
You have completed all of Honor's Trials.<br />
You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal.  The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
Tylis has been removed from his agony.<br />
Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
Saved from certain doom, Milyk and Adler are forever in your debt.<br />
Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
You remember Nitram's words - 'three small turns to the right on the bottommost rivet should open the door'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that is what you are referring to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure that means you have the MB flag.  If not, it'd say &quot;Tallon Fell before you with great ease, you seem to remember some strange pouches around his body, but... well it's probably nothing&quot;<br />
<br />
I think you only see the part about meeting him in Drunder until you've killed a zek in there.  I'm pretty new to the whole flagging thing myself though, so hopefully someone can confirm that. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://morelight.org/samanna/info_flags.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kamidari is correct.  Once you've killed a zek, the Giwin line goes away and is replaced by the 'pack of notes' line(s)<br />
<br />
What do you not have access to that you think you should?  It seems like you should have access to solro, but perhaps do not.  As far as kills, it looks like you've killed everything but RZ and SolRo.<br />
<br />
Have you gone back to the librarian after killing TZ/VZ and told him you have new lore?  Do that and I think you should see the 'pack of notes' messages go away and be replaced by a line about the Zeks and Solusek planning an invasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey, is anyone having the situation where Magelo doesn't report flags that the Seer says you have? Like, Seer tells me, among other things:<br />
<br />
Giwin would like you to find him in Drunder so he can present you to Rallos Zek.<br />
You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
<br />
Yes, I did the MB and AD events. But Magelo says I'm not flagged. /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You need to talk to Maelin at the top of the library (up the lift) and say &quot;what lore&quot; and &quot;what information&quot;. Then unlock memories and do guided meditation again, you may need to then make another trip back to the library. <br />
<br />
As suggested in the above posts, the following line:<br />
&quot;Giwin would like you to find him in Drunder so he can present you to Rallos Zek&quot;<br />
has been replaced because you have killed TZ/VZ, thereby getting the line about scribbled notes as a replacement.<br />
<br />
Once you've done that I think you should have Sol Ro access from the looks of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">http://b5.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13530.topic is probably the single best reference for flags.<br />
<br />
Looks to me like you are missing &quot;The words of Maelin echo in your mind, 'The Zeks and Solusek are planning an invasion in Norrath, find out more from Rallos if you can.&quot; for SolRo access. You will need to check all your preflags for Saryn/KoS as well as making sure you have talked to the librarian. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE HAILED TYLIS IN THE INFIRMARY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That sick bay is irritating.  When you think you have everything, I would suggest this:<br />
<br />
1) hail everyone in the infirmary<br />
2) hail everyone in the infirmary again<br />
3) do it one more time just to be sure<br />
4) go says &quot;portal's destination&quot; to the fire drake at the fire entrance<br />
5) go hail the guy standing at the disease entrance, and do his dialogue<br />
6) go unlock memories a few times<br />
7) go hail the librarian at the top of pok elevator, then say &quot;what information&quot;, &quot;what new information&quot;, &quot;new lore&quot;.<br />
8) go back and unlock memories some more<br />
<br />
That usually jars something loose.  For my enchanter, it turned out I had forgotten to do a post-flag hail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks alot all.<br />
<br />
The New Lore and New information ritual was the ticket.<br />
<br />
Now time to have a look around Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
Once again thanks for all the help and information</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No flags and no loot makes Homer something something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Figured this might could help you all out. More than likely it's redundant information, but hell. Good information to have. It's made a place on my Favorites list.<br />
