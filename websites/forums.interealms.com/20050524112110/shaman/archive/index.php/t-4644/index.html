<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">who would win and why ?  what strats would you use ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, a LOT of dueling a 55+ ranger has to do with terrain..   if your fighting him on flat ground... well...  you really have no chance once they hit that Trueshot disc...<br />
<br />
If your fighting on hilly ground, it's a battle of stealth and running around obstacles till the TS disc wears off...     and then pray ya can land a slow, or if they get into mellee range they will tear you up.    My strats vary normally from fight to fight, so I really can't give you a good one to use, I'm still looking myself, just make sure the terrain is one that you can hide from the TS in  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ranger I would expect, he's gonna bowkite you. I would imagine one would need to keep out of line of sight. Theres some sneaky things that annoy plinking rangers in PvE, no clue if they carry over into PvP - root yourself, stand in a wall.<br />
<br />
Level 60 with Hunter title, forgeddit, they can out DPS wizzies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">never was much of a dueler<br />
but my friend is a 60 ranger that i used to play duel with,<br />
only thing i can say is owwwwie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">duel'd a nekkid ranger in the bazaar ( I was nekkid also) cept he had a bow....<br />
<br />
malo, blind, invis yaself so he loses target (or he'll keep plinkin ya) drop some dots on him, dead ranjur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All depends on gear. If hes ha sub-par gear, a shaman will tear him a new one. Malo, pet, blind, dots, etc.<br />
<br />
If he has decent gear (i.e. big a$$ bow,primals&amp; Ntov gear with resists)  then unless you have trees to hide behind you are going to bite the big one.  Just had a ranger crit for 2000hps and kill a friend of mine in one shot.  Was sick I tell ya sick.  If they have a chain horse and you don't they may attempt to close the gap and melee you.  Still the Bow is what you have to really worry about.<br />
<br />
I still have to admit to this day the best pvp battles I have had have always been with Rangers.  Rangers are a fun lot  to fight. Well that was till Luclin and the addtion of AA skills. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ehrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just had a conversation about this with a ranger.<br />
<br />
Invis might help, but rangers can track invis if they get you tracked before you invis, and have a see invis spell.  With /target &lt;playername&gt;, he's pretty much got ya with a bow unless you're outisde his firing arc, like behind him maybe.  Terrain is definitely your best friend.  Plenty of arrows poof with just a little bit of the target touching a wall/hill/tree.  Otherwise, that bow sh*t is nasty.<br />
<br />
I dunno how feasible it would be, but imo, the best place to be when dualing a ranger is the magical spot that's out of melee range but too close for ranged attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">rangers dont get a see invis spell.  <br />
<br />
Rangers can't hit you with a bow if you are in contact with a wall . . . any wall.  No you don't need to be behind the wall, just keep yer ass on it or next to it and all of their shots miss.  confirmed &quot;bug&quot; tho it might also be intentional.  Makes arena fights pretty possible vs. ranger since they can be shooting away at you to no effect while you are casting your spells to full effect.  <br />
<br />
Get a pet nippin at em, breaks their concentration. <br />
<br />
Epic dot always lands.<br />
<br />
Use invis if he don't have a see invis item.  Breaks target, gives you time to cast.<br />
<br />
Use disease, most rangers have DR the lowest of any of their resists.  PoI to slow them, and DON'T let them cure!  If they insist on stopping to cure, make sure they are taking rain damage from Torrent of Poison while they do so, or are getting epicced or poxxed (they cant cure our high level diseases without LOTS of casting).  Keep dogdog at their heels.  Keep yerself healthy.  If you get low on hps you can be toast with ranger nukes or a proc or bow crit or something.  <br />
<br />
Respect your opponent and you have a good chance of defeating him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It appears they get it at level 39.<br />
<br />
You can use tricks with walls to break their archery.  Don't forget damage shield potions if they wanna melee.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rangers most definitely get see invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not to mention our Helm of the tracker has built in See invis.. so does Eagle eye, in addition to plain jane See invis :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if the ranger wants to bow kite u, then u have 0 chance.<br />
in order for the shaman to have a chance, u need to force the ranger to melee u.<br />
drink a ds potion, stick ur but in a wall and chain torpor.<br />
<br />
almost nobody can beat a hunter level ranger in a 1 vs 1 duel since thier bow is so powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moogalak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you stick yourself in a wall they can't hit you sometimes... Invis if they dont have see invis up... use walls, etc to hide from arrows... otherwise its pretty easy.<br />
<br />
DoT DoT DoT they die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm, rangers never used to get see invis . . ah well things change.  Not like it would make it that much more difficult.  I wanna duel sunmoon's ranger just to pay him back for nerfing all my sigs!<br />
Gonna go rabid bear on his pansy ass!<br />
RAWR!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't get snared.<br />
<br />
He will snare then he will kite you and you will die.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't get snared... depending on the quality of the Ranger, you might be doing yourself a favor to just JBB yourself to death.</div></div><hr />

Aye Mojokyn. I wonder if people saw that the ranger can hit for 2k+ a pop with a bow/AA skills.</div></div><hr />

Depends.. Who sees who first?  <br />
Maybe easy to beat in a Duel but I can GUARANTEE you not so on a pvp server. Well if they are out of mana :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">With rangers, try and stay in the neutral zone between their range attack minimum range and their melee attack maximum range.<br />
<br />
If the ranger discs trueshot, immediately close range and stay on them.  If they can't use their bow because you're too close, then their disc will be wasted.  Use obstacles if you have to.<br />
<br />
Rangers can be beaten but it takes tactics like anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The irony here is I took out a MB wizzie in a duel once.  However, it was because he had a big ego.  He let me get off two dots first.  Well, that was Bane and Pox.  He couldn't cure em.  So he nuked me to death, but 2 minutes later, as I'm looting my corpse, he dies too ;)<br />
<br />
Haven't fought a ranger yet tho...sounds like it'd be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ouchy Dathurts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My neighbor IRL is a 60 ranger. AM3, endless quiver, critical hit thing etc. We've messed around in the arena. What seems to work is malo/root his ass. Its not too hard to land root...once its on hes pretty smoked. Get too close where he cant hit you with his bow, but far enough away where he cant melee you. Always drives him insane =) As long as root holds he's all yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I can kill a MB wizard without dying myself.  In a fair duel, in an arena . . . both of us know what's coming and when to start.  <br />
I need a tiny bit of prep time to locate a &quot;Shiny Brass Idol.&quot;<br />
<br />
This small insignificant piece of loot drops randomly from orcs I believe in HHP.  Newbies find and discard them each day.  Fairly easy to buy one for a pittance.  <br />
<br />
It casts a 15 second DA.  Time it right as you see the wizard casting his MB.  MB goes off but you are INVULNERABLE!  After that, it doesn't take much skill to kill an oom wizard.  <br />
<br />
I've taken to carrying this idol about with me in the off chance I'll have to duel a wizard.  I guess I'm just a boyscout at heart<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ouchy Dathurts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Few ppl in my guild have actually been able to live through the MB. Bet those wizzys were pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">remember ranger have to face you to use bow, so you can alway run toward him, then he either can't shoot you and decide melee, or he start run away to get distance, <br />
<br />
if he run, try casting during he run(malo, root, dot), then keep follow him before he stop to try shoot you, you will end up killing him with if luck<br />
<br />
when they use trueshot, then better follow him for 2 minutes of hide somewhere<br />
<br />
 so they can't run faster than you if run backward, then you can alway try follow him and stay close distance, and cast your dot when he try run apart from you for bow<br />
<br />
also, can use pet to follow ranger which block part of damage and cause ranger deal with your pet, wall,tree is also good to hide from ranger<br />
<br />
if ranger hit trueshot, well you better follow him for 2 minute or hide somewhere untill it trueshot gone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you fight a smart ranger in an open area you almost have no chance at all. If you think about it, the range of his bow is probably long. If you start casting on him, a 'smart' ranger would simply back out of casting range but shooting you before he does since firing an arrow is sorta instant'ish?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ranger + chain horse (or god forbit, ornade chain horse) is ungodly. Ever seen a EQ3 + TS ranger take down a MB wizard BEFORE he finished casting? Remember, they get to double attack with bows on stationary targets, and crits = PAIN.<br />
<br />
If he's a newbie to pvp, you can kill him easy. However, any well-equipped ranger in a high level guild would have enough DR/PR to make any shaman cry. Not to mention, the range of 90% of good bows is greater than our spell range. If he knows what he's doing, the only thing you can do is decide how much time passes before you die.<br />
<br />
However, if you really want to try, then duel him in VERY hilly areas preferably full of trees. When he gets on your tail, run up/down a hill, first turn one direction and run half a circle, then immediately turn 90% to the oppisit direction and run the oppisit way. Example, if you are running downhill and turned right, then you should turn left and run uphill. If there's any lag around, this usually confuses the EQ client on his side, making it seems like you've continued turning that circle. The hills should prevent line of sight for him to shoot you, and the trees can (sometimes) block an arrow.<br />
<br />
Now, after you've lost him, stand still and heal(if damaged)/chain tap whatever spell you want to cast. Eventually, he will run in range and get hit, and if you do this enough, he'll get bored and zone.<br />
<br />
That's about all you can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Said it before and I'll say it again.  The game is balanced for PvM class strength.  PvP was added later and Verant has never tried to balance BOTH the &quot;Main Game&quot; of PvM and PvP.  If they ever were to try to balance both aspects, then we would all look like cookie cutter chars or each other.  This means that while the classes are fairly balanced in the regular game, there are wide gaps in PvP.  <br />
<br />
Rangers and Pally's are just plain TOUGH to beat in PvP.  If the player is only halfway competent, then he'll take you apart like a jiggsaw puzzle.  You can try tricks like uneven terrain or trees, but he knows that his strength is archery and knows terrain effects better than you do.  If yer on a blue server, I'd say pick your target wisely and if yer on a red one, I'd say keep your head down and retreat :)</div></div><hr />
