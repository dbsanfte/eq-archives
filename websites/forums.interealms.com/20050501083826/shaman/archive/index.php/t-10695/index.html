<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tumamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have played EQ for three years now and after the disappointment of PoP and the newest changes I must admit it is time to dump EQ.  I have a level 61 shaman and a 58 monk that I play mainly and assorted other 25 plus characters.   My shaman has failed almost 50 trials now and cannot seem to get to a second tier plane.  Why didn't SOE say that PoP was for UBER guilds?  It is sad when a level 52 cleric is getting flagged for the second tiers and a 61 shaman can't get in even though I get four or five tells a day asking me to come to PoV or PoS.  PoP was by far the worst expansion I paid for.  Totally disappointing.    What a joke it was when they announced that they are increasing drop rates in the third and fourth tier planes, LMFAO.  It is a dream to ever get to those tiers.<br />
<br />
What about Torpor, Malo, and Pox.  How friggin pathetic to have to pay 70k for a spell.  SOE kiss my ass.    It has been increasing painful looking at what they have done to shaman and don't even get me started on how they srewed my monk.  Take a class that is not broken and screw them.<br />
<br />
It should not be the exception to be level 61 and not even have all your spells up through the level below you.  <br />
<br />
Why is it there isn't a Cudgel type item for Barbarian shaman?  Why is it they put some of our spells in ultra hard areas like SSRA for a spell that is used by someone that is of a much lower level than is required to go in SSRA?<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, who is ready to pay to buy EQ2,  what a joke.  I was going to, but there is no way I am getting into that crap.  <br />
<br />
Have a good one.  I am leaving here to cancel my subscription.  I can do something else with my $26 a month that I spend on my two accounts.</div></div><hr />

Just think. With $26.00 a month, you can take the family out to McDonalds once a month or maybe go to the movies once a month.</div></div><hr />

Krakster what exactly are we supposed to be &quot;getting&quot;?<br />
<br />
Cuz personally, I'd like a reacharound while I take it in the you know where.<br />
<br />
Simple Disclaimer on the box or when you first boot up:<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the World of Everquest. (That is a threat btw and not a greeting).  If you do not have 6 to 8 hours a day to dedicate to this enterprise - you're screwed. If you don't belong to an Uber guild (and if you don't know what 'Uber' means - then we'd like 6 months payment in advance - tks) prepare to miss out on a lot of content. While eq can enthrall you, wonder you, and wow you, it wil also frustrate you to the extreme.<br />
<br />
&quot;eq is a MMORPG (Massive Multi-Griefer, On-line (More on that in a second) Role Playing (No really!) Game.  This means that customer support falls into one of two categories: 1) Non existent on-line help (SUCKERS), or .10 a minute (Yes you pay  for help.)<br />
<br />
&quot;RPG - this ain't your daddy's Dungeons and Dragons. Since vocal intonations, inflections, hand gestures, facial expressions are lost on most of the PS-2 generation, you get to roleplay by TYPING!<br />
<br />
&quot;On-line - You know that crappy AOL dial-up your parents have? Well you may experience a SLIGHT loss of eq experience in a crowded zone.<br />
<br />
Then when you're at the character selection screen:<br />
<br />
&quot;Class balance. Done. Complete. No really.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spells. Dunno, we just gave the testing toons theirs.<br />
<br />
eq will survive. The frustration mounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tetarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dumped. <br />
<br />
cancelled both accounts and both preorders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Slow day at work here so, enjoy.<br />
<br />
I have played EQ for three years now and after the disappointment of PoP and the newest changes I must admit it is time to dump EQ. <br />
<br />
woot can I have your stuff (tm)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a level 61 shaman and a 58 monk that I play mainly and assorted other 25 plus characters.<br />
<br />
Twenty five toons? And when you say &quot;play&quot; - meaning people accts you have access to or you leveled them up yaself? 3 years and only level 61 eh?<br />
<br />
<br />
My shaman has failed almost 50 trials now and cannot seem to get to a second tier plane. Why didn't SOE say that PoP was for UBER guilds?<br />
<br />
Not anyones fault but your own that you cannot get flagged for tier 2+ planes. In the time spent on your 25+ characters over the years you must have made some friends along the way. BTW this is a social game, everything about progressing to the top requires help from people. I failed the first 10-15 times also. Since then I have helped lots of people pass it.<br />
<br />
Sony DID state that this expansion is geared to the top end game. Why is it people like yourself just seem like they want to log in and be handed stuff? EFFORT and DEDICATION are required to get to the top. Casual players need not apply unfortunately. Sad to see it took you 3 years to see this. Hopefully you had some fun along the way.<br />
<br />
PoP was by far the worst expansion I paid for. Totally disappointing<br />
<br />
By far the best I paid for. Much better than luclin ( which I like also ). I only have access to BoT as well. <br />
<br />
What about Torpor, Malo, and Pox. How friggin pathetic to have to pay 70k for a spell. SOE kiss my ass. It has been increasing painful looking at what they have done to shaman and don't even get me started on how they srewed my monk. Take a class that is not broken and screw them. <br />
<br />
You know how to aquire these spells. They are within reach of the non uberguilded player. You are simply not willing to put forth the time/effort required to get them. <br />
<br />
Painful what they have done to your shaman? <br />
 I get four or five tells a day asking me to come to PoV or PoS<br />
<br />
WHOA IS ME! SHAMAN ARE CLEARLY BASTARD STEPCHILDREN. Yes, noone likes you obviously, you are nerfed beyond repair.<br />
<br />
And the affliction &quot;nerf&quot;....yeah guess what...day 2 of the &quot;nerf&quot; and not a damn thing has changed in my shamanly life. Still kicking ass and taking names. Slow mitigation? Its in the best intrest of the game. Same reason they lowered clerics max CH to 7500hp.  Sure there are bugs to be worked out, but hardly worth pulling your teeth out with a pair of vice grips over.<br />
<br />
Why is it there isn't a Cudgel type item for Barbarian shaman? <br />
<br />
Who cares? Ever heard of differences between the classes?<br />
<br />
Why is it they put some of our spells in ultra hard areas like SSRA for a spell that is used by someone that is of a much lower level than is required to go in SSRA?<br />
<br />
PE is hardly a game breaker. This is not something exclusive to shaman either. Notice group regrowth drops off of yard trash here? Far more powerful spell than PE. How about the druid group regrowth? Lil more difficult to obtain eh? Same spell? What the hell do you want, a spell vending machine. Ding 51, spellz plz. I sure don't. <br />
<br />
<br />
I do commend you for cancling your subscription if it is no longer fun for you. I hate people who keep pissing on the third rail and complain when they fry their sausage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">easy = not very much fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lovisla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gimme your stuff please ...my shamans name is bonezz.<br />
Reason I won't be quitting ...well I have real life friends playing I use EQ as an enhanced chat room I love it ....I quit for a year and came back after trying various other models out there ...there simply is nothing beter for me to play. I would love to use whatever equipment you can donate seeing as my shaman is using sub par stuff ..I totally understand your frustration though ...I just got over it and realized that throwing a fit at SOE is useless and went back to using it as a chat room I pay for. I am very content now.<br />

<br />
Beating the trials, Exe especially is not hard. Getting into BoT is not hard. Fighting in Ssra, especially post-PoP, is not hard. It is possible to complete the Iksar Cudgel quest as a non-Iksar.<br />
<br />
These things become hard without friends. Maybe stop playing enough chars to make your own guild and work on getting some real people in game to help you out.</div></div><hr />

Yep.  Time, not skill.  A mass of unwashed bodies, not a skilled small group of friends.  &quot;Success&quot; in EQ is all about time spent.<br />
<br />
Kinda sad really.  Not that EQ isn't a fun game at times, but it could be so much better.  Can't wait for someone to get the right formula.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>tetarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sorry... sold all my items already. <br />

Dumped the newly worthless focus stuff on a newbie (where it belongs) before I ended billing, signed off, and uninstalled the game.</div></div><hr />

When it's not fun anymore and you play it and you don't know why you even bother, it's time to move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Anwariad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Best of luck in RL.<br />
<br />
Sooner or later we all will stop playing this game.  It appears sadly to be a game many play beyond the point it is fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you are not having fun,<br />
<br />
a) change the way you play<br />
b) quite<br />
c)  complain, gripe, cry<br />
<br />
It is a game and you can play it any way you want.  If you log in night after night and don't have fun then you are a moron.<br />
<br />
I would simply say to evaluate your in game goals in relation to the type of player you are and be realistic about what you can acheive.<br />
<br />
Any person of any level can win this game... it's called having fun.<br />
<br />
If you are a miserable lvl 65 with all the greatest gear, highest hp, highest DPS, bla bla bla and you are miserable then you lost and are a looser.<br />
<br />
If you are 45 and frustraited and hate the game then you should have a hard look at what you are doing and either quite,  take a different aproach,  or cry and be a looser also.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day :)</div></div><hr />

When I took a year off I was certain I'd never come back. Lol was I ever wrong. I'm having more fun now than ever in this game even if torpor and malo are nowhere in sight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nayoki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Good god people, get over yourselves. EQ is a game. not a job, not a career. a GAME! if you don't like the game anymore. quit. and why, oh WHY do you insist on coming here and bitching to us that your unhappy? if you don't like the game, and you quit, then get over it! why do you feel the need to come here and whine about how EQ didn't fulfill your needs. a lot, and i mean a whole lot of people paly this game. and they play it for fun. if they get frustrated, they try again, and they work hard for their accomplishments. this game is in no way meant to be easy. its not like a console game, where if your having a hard time you cheat.. no, this game is meant to make you work, and not get everything just by wanting it. <br />
I will reiterate. if you don't like the game, tough ****, get over it, and don't bitch to us. just quit the game, and save us the waste of our time to read your whining. <br />
KTHX glad to see another whiner gone.</div></div><hr />

&quot;assorted other 25 plus characters&quot;<br />
<br />
About spells - while Torpor and Malo are still good spells they are no longer the best because the game changed around them. Yet the droprate hasnt changed. And Pox is a situationally useful spell that also shares an insanely low droprate. Why? No reason at all to not put this spell on plenty more mobs now. Just using the standard &quot;work for it you whiny fool&quot; doesnt show much willingness to try to understand how the game has changed.<br />
<br />
And just because other spells drop in the wrong places doesnt mean that ours should too.</div></div><hr />

 I whole heartedly agree. I would be 60 too if I didn't have AD&amp;D when it comes to these games. When the progress stops, I get bored and like to start over. Works for me, but doesn't work for most. I just do not have the time or patience for the big raids and guilds. A personal choice.<br />

Gratz on 60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh? So what? Noone else's Kunark spell droprates got changed just because SoL/PoP came out. Now they did up the drop rate on Bane and Tigirs because people bitched and moaned about it. Everytime a change is made in the game you want them to redo spelldrop rates? &quot;Ahh, well this is old now might as well put it on a vendor..&quot; BS. Part of the fun of the game is going above and beyond to get things (spells).<br />
<br />
See how angry people who spent DKP/cash on focus items only to have them changed at a later date? They put alot of effort into getting them because they WANTED THEM. Making pox/torpor/malo/etc easier to get would be  &quot;ASITFTSE&quot; to shaman who put hard work in for them. This game is already MUCH easier than when I started it. HARD = CONTENT = MORE ENJOYABLE WHEN YOU GET THE BIG W<br />
<br />
 &quot;work for it you whiny fool&quot;<br />
