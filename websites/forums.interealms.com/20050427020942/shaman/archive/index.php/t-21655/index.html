<br />
<br />
What is reputation?<br />
<br />
See those little green squares at the bottom left of a post? That is the reputation of that poster. The more green squares, the higher that persons reputation. If they have one grey square, or one or more red squares, they have had a lot of negative feedback. Reputation is a feature of these boards, and is raised or lowered by the other users of these boards. <br />
<br />
How do I check my reputation?<br />
<br />
On the top right of the screen is a button labeled user cp http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/top_profile.gif Click this and at the bottom of the page, your current reputation will be listed, and if you have any, the previous 5 rep-bumps you have recieved.<br />
You have to be logged in to check your reputation.<br />
<br />
You can also check the reputation you recieve on posts by clicking on your own post in a thread, just as if you were adding reputation. A pop-up windows lists the last 5 rep-bumps and comments you got for that post.<br />
<br />
How do I bump other's reputations?<br />
<br />
When you are logged in, click the little talking head icon next to &quot;Edit&quot; on the lower right of someone's post. A pop up box will appear and you can either select &quot;I Approve&quot; or &quot;I Disapprove.&quot; There is a space for comments as well. <br />
<br />
 How do i check other's reputations?<br />
<br />
By clicking on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/memberlist.php?&amp;sortorder=DESC&amp;sortfield=reputation&amp;perpage=30&amp;ltr=&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; or by listing members, and then sorting by reputation. By consulting the table of titles below, and seeing what title a user has, you can get the range that their reputation is within.<br />
<br />
How long can my comments be?<br />
<br />
Your comments can be as long as you want, but have to be on a continuous line. It is considered good etiquette to leave your name with feedback.<br />
<br />
Why are some reputations worth more than others?<br />
<br />
Your reputation is based on a number of different criteria. Sunmoon (the owner of this board) has set these at their current levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Administrators can add or subtract 5 rep points<br />
 For every 180 days you have been registered on the board, your rep bumps are worth 1 extra point<br />
 For every 100 posts you have made, your rep-bumps are worth 1 extra point.<br />
 For every 100 points of reputation, your rep-bumps are worth 1 extra point. <br />
<br />
So, as a formula, the amount one of your rep bumps is worth is (round all numbers down):<br />
(days registered/180) + (posts made/100) + (current reputation/100) = current rep-bump power<br />
<br />
Why do I have grey dots when I check my reputation?<br />
<br />
You have to have made 30 posts before your reputation effects others. The grey dots are from other users that have not reached the 30 post threshold yet.<br />
Also, if your reputation is below 50, your rep-bumps do not effect others. If you pass the two checks, you can alter others people's reputation.<br />
<br />
How many Rep-bumps can i give in a day?<br />
<br />
You can give 4 rep bumps over a 24 hour period. Administrators have no limit. You can also only give reputation to a person you have already given reputation to, after giving rep-bumps to another 15 people.<br />
<br />
What are the different reputation titles?<br />
<br />
The number at the end of the title is the reputation level required to reach that title. You can see these titles by leaving the mouse pointer over the green squares in the bottom left of a posters box.<br />

I hope you found this helpful. If you did, rep-bump me! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You forgot to mention that if you click on the rep icon for your OWN posts that it will notify you if the rep for that post is positive, negative or neutral, and has had rep bumps will show the last bump made for it (I think only the last, might show multiple, been a while since I looked).<br />
<br />
  Now I'm really curious to find Glori and sunmoon posts to see if their rep values are over the 2K mark or not ;)<br />
<br />
  Oh, can you tell from the info gathered so far what the value is corresponding to each dot?  I'd figure it's 50 or 100, but be pretty nice to tell at a glance so no mouseover is needed whien idely curious.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Found a Glori post and amazingly she is only in the 450-550 bracket.  I woulda lost money if I had time to bet before finding that one out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would still like to see some kind of FORCED comment before you can give rep. I realize it won't completely solve the problem, and a lot of people will just hit .  and be done with it, but maybe, just maybe, having a pop-up that comes up saying &quot;Please comment on your choice&quot; or something if the line is left blank would make it a LITTLE better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would like a forced comment and forced name please. This hide in the bushes and throw stones way of rep handling is not very good. People should be held accountable for there comments and actions. Please sunmoon =)<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW good job with the FAQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second bump, call for a sticky ... this is good stuff. Thank you to Kumoe for putting it together.<br />
<br />
I will agree with the others ... force a comment and force a name. If you cannot force the comment, at least force the name. Litgruv said it rather well, folks should be held accountable for what they think. Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but IMO your words mean nothing without your name behind them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Found a Glori post and amazingly she is only in the 450-550 bracket.  I woulda lost money if I had time to bet before finding that one out :)<br />
<br />
Yes, this is a great thread! Thanks, Kumoe! I'm going to leave it here for a couple of days and then move it over to the Medicine Cabinet (this forum gets mroe traffic)&gt;<br />
<br />
Back when reputation was first implemented, Mojokyn artificially inflated all of the mod reputations pretty high. I liked &quot;glorious beacon of light&quot; so whenever I get bumped to the next highest level, I just move myself back down to 450.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/rep bump Glori ... just to make her lower her title ;)<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
I got a negitive bump for this heh. Comment was &quot;My name is Loka, I live on the second floor.&quot;  I rest my case<br />
<br />
#1 Reputation doesnt mean much to me. <br />
<br />
#2 you prove how much of a puss you are by not leaving your name and rep bumping me for no reason. Anyone can stand far away or hidden and take pot shots, but till you ack like a man you spinless tube of spooge, then its hard to care about anythign you say for more then 10 second.<br />
<br />
#3 Like is said you a pathetic spinless weaking that cant stand up and back up the things he says and you know the beauty of it all? Your too weak to reply to this and you cant rep bump me again :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game ... Set .... Ownt  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, the problem that I see with a name on the rep bumps is the chance of people being petty enough to give &quot;revenge bumps&quot; to other people.  Granted since you cannot rep bump someone again till you ahve bumped 15 or os others it would be limited in scope, but you shouldn't be prone to a neg bump just because you felt the need to downrate a certain post.<br />
<br />
  Of course, most people that are that petty would only be a grey bump anyway :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the feedback :)<br />
<br />
Anything else I should add to to the FAQ, or any questions that need answering?<br />
<br />
FYI, of the 5 feedbacks I received, only 2 had names to them ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No, you can't tell who wrote a comment or gave you a bump.  Most people will sign their name on positive rep bumps though.  Click your &quot;user cp&quot; buttom for an example.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Helzik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As an avid, long time reader of these forums (and very occasional poster) I know whose opinions I value and whose advice has helped me time and time again.  So I rarely even think about the rep squares I see on others’ posts, I just go by what they say.<br />
<br />
I suppose it is nice to get constructive criticism and/or comments, though, so I’ll try to get off my lazy Barbarian arse and start repping people when appropriate.  I think I’ll start with Kumoe for this excellent and informative thread.<br />
 <br />
Oh, and /agree Gloriana.  The title fits you well - seems custom made, even.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">wow, Im at -86, what the hell..Youd have thought I ran over a bus load of drunken nuns in a past life or something..Do I have to sacrifice a chicken or something to get it moved up...lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Let's split into factions and battle it out in Rep Wars!<br />
<br />
Drive by bumpings, counterbumps, pre-emptive bumps, gangbumps and even bumping when you're down!<br />
<br />
It'll be crazylike messageboard action! With the special goggles (and matching helmet) the green and red dots will be totally 3-D! Better than BubbleBobble bonus level!!<br />
<br />
Sign up now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">interesting, just wandered back into this topic and for curiosity of how many top ranks we had I clicked the link to sorting out the listed users by rep.<br />
<br />
  I am pretty sure that we have a LOT more people with rep over 1 green bar than it shows, and I wasn't able to find myself, Vigdis, Samanna, Shandy or any of the other multi-greens in this thread really.<br />
<br />
  Not sure what exactly is up with the sort by reputation button, but it doesn't really seem to work.  Just so I could actually see if I was in the listings at all I limited it to users with a C_____ name and sorted by rep, I showed up on page 15 with Ceno and Chulain and a screenload of single green dots.<br />
<br />
  Not that it matters much, but I guess if an admin gets bored they can have that curiosity to fill time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bah, -39 I guess Im still the devil!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fawlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks for this... I never knew how to rate a post here /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Can someone with 200-249 rep points please confirm their title and dot count? I expect it to be the spectacular aura title, but I also expect it to be three green dots rather than two. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">219 rep points, Spec Aura title and 3 dots here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Bingo, thanks. Looks like, for some levels, there are title upgrades without dot changes at xx50 pts, and dot upgrades without title changes at xx00 pts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If it helps you figure it out, I keep mine set to 450, which gives me 5 green thingies and &quot;A Glorious Beacon of Light.&quot; 401-449 is &quot;just really nice&quot; and 5 green thingies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, yeah, that was going to be my next question, thanks!<br />

Chart above updated. Will update home version later on.</div></div><hr />
