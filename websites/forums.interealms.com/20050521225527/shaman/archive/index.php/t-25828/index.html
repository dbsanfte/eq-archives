<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys:)<br />
<br />
I am looking for opinions on Spirit Call.  Is it worth getting at all?  It certainly looks cool.  If it is worth getting, when should i get it?<br />
<br />

Here is my magelo for present, and minimal AAs<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like the AA personally, it adds a little bit extra dmg overall that you can do, however, I would not even look at getting it until you are well beyond 100AAs.  There are so many other stuff that you should have first before you get anything like that.  It's not something that is essential to the shamanhood (like canni) and it's not something that in the overall scheme of things will make you a lot better shaman (like SCR/SCM/QB.. etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got it at around 100 (SC3) for interrupts and raid positioning. I got ASC2 (SC5) for the increased DPS at around 200.<br />
<br />
It's not super fantastic, but it is good when you need to finish off a mob - either soloing and don't want to dump mana into finishing the mob, or when your group got an add and the main damage dealers have already moved over to the add to get it off the healer. I also pop it on nameds, just for the extra dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I personally find this AA pretty useful. though Im an 80% soloing shaman. its great for taking out those gating casters or dealing with healing mobs.all good for trying to break a nasty camp, just send in the dogs and use those extra seconds to root/CC.<br />
<br />
I got it right after I got canni 5 as sort of a fun AA. its not great DPS but its nice for that last little bit of damaged on named mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This aa should have gotten better for dps when our pets got innate dual wield. It just summons multiple of the true spirit pets for 1 minute <br />

<br />
Not sure if the ASC pets picked up dual wield too or not but it sounded like they did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use this AA in 3 situations:<br />
<br />
1:  pushing targets during raids<br />
<br />
2:  pushing casters to interrupt spells while grouping/soloing<br />
<br />
3:  extra bursts of DPS while soloing/grouping, and on a hard burn call in raids<br />
<br />
Personally, I've found the AA useful to have, but I only have SC1.  When I get to around 250 or so AA, I'll come back and max this AA out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Continually my pets before duel wield change were doing approx 6 - 7k dmg on an Msha (not including procs).  After the change I'm getting a solid 10 - 11k dmg (not including procs either) from them every summon on the same mob.  I like the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Basics are more important, I think all agree.  But once you have your hp, casting mastery, reinforcement, canni all done, this is a good one to get.  I click it anytime they'll get to fight for most of the minute, either on one boss mob or on several smaller mobs.  With a 12min reset, it's never really down when you can use it.  <br />
<br />
If (IF) (big if) you managed to get full damage out of it each time it popped, and clicked it whenever it did pop, you'd get like 18dps from it.  18dps ain't bad for us :)  As a bonus, it's not actually 18 constant dps, but a burst of high damage when you ask for it.  Being a minute duration damage, it stacks well with our main dot damage plan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spirit Call is great.  <br />
<br />
It lets us do something we cannot do naturally - any AA that does that is a boost to our power.<br />
<br />
It is mana free damage every 12 mins.<br />
<br />
The pets interrupt spellcasters (gate/ch) like mad. <br />
<br />
One of the most useful way you can use it is on summoning mobs.  Root the mob, bring the pack in.  While the mob is rooted it will fight the pack and not summon you.  This provides a time for you to recover, mem spells etc.  Very very useful indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Agreed, it is a great tool for positioning.<br />
<br />
When soloing tougher mobs SC can make the difference between losing and winning.</div></div><hr />
