<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been having a lot of problems using magelo on my 2nd computer.<br />
<br />
Initially I couldn't even access the site but solved that. Now I can just get to the site and view it but not make any changes.<br />
<br />
It does not refresh and even affects the forums. If I go to lets say General forums and later want to switch to another forum, I keep getting sent back to General Forums and have to close IE and restart it to get to another forum.<br />
<br />
I also cannot update my equipment and info but can see the changes made using my other comp after refreshing the page.<br />
<br />
I check with my other computer and all the settings seem to be the same.<br />
<br />
I am not a computer savvy person and any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help/info.<br />

PS Also is there anyway to get magelo to work on an apple iBook?<br />
PPS See title so this shouldn't be moved to the grey :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Magelo appears to love to cache itself (serve you an old version of the page along with any problems you once had), not sure why.<br />
<br />
Heres what fixes problems for most people using IE I've found:<br />
<br />
Garbled text<br />
Go to Internet Options &gt; Advanced<br />
Under HTTP 1.1 settings ensure 'Use HTTP 1.1' is checked.<br />
<br />
Page/profile doesnt update on refresh<br />
Internet Options &gt; General. Temporary Internet Files &gt; Settings. Check 'Every visit to the page. Alternatively click the cursor on the area of the page thats being problematic, right click and choose refresh from the fly out menu, just hitting refresh on the browser toolbar seems to just refresh the frame and not the frame content.<br />
<br />
If those don't fly then check you've got exactly the same version browser on both PCs. Help &gt; About Internet Explorer will reveal which version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can also force a refresh by holding down control and clicking the reload button up top, for those too lazy to navigate dropdown menus (like me:)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Magelo appears to love to cache itself (serve you an old version of the page along with any problems you once had), not sure why.<br />
<br />
Technically it's the browser doing the caching. Not sure what exactly it is about the way magelo does things tho but it definitely seems very sensitive to caching settings/corruption. Personally I just use mozilla/netscape. Ever since they fixed the unimplimented features in mozilla it seems to work alot better for thier site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the replies and info guys.<br />
<br />
Will check it out when I get back home. Definitely have done this &quot; Under HTTP 1.1 settings ensure 'Use HTTP 1.1' is checked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will go through the rest of the suggestions and also check on the version of IE I have on both comps.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok just want to let anyone else with a similar problem as I faced, that the above steps work iiin solving the problems.<br />
<br />
After checking the &quot;refresh page every visit&quot; it works like a charm.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help guys!</div></div><hr />
