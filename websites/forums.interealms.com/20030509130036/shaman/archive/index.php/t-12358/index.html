<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I am lvl 65 with 60 AA currently (3 saved). Here is my progression thusfar:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3<br />
<br />
MC3<br />
Can5<br />
<br />
MGB<br />
<br />
QB1<br />
<br />
SCF1 (gotta have some fun)<br />
<br />
SC1<br />
RC1<br />
<br />
SCR2<br />
ND2<br />
SCM1<br />
<br />
I am storing 3 AA right now for either ND3 or SCR3 and was wondering which direction to take after that.<br />
<br />
Currently I have roughly 4500 HP and AC around 1100 with self buffs and Virtue.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be most appreciated...Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Combat Agility 3 and Lightening reflexes 5.  I can't recommend them highly enough.  I'd recommend them over ND3 or SCR3, or pretty much any other skill you might be thinking about getting.  By the time you get LR5, it seems that the mobs miss you like 3 out of 5 hits.  When most stuff in PoP hits 500+, that's huge.  LR5 will increase your lifespan tremendously.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hard to tell, since you didn't put a link in your signature.....   If you die a lot to mobs, the go CA, otherwise, you can't do better than ND3..... it's GREAT!<br />
<br />
BTW, VP can be awfully good at saving your life at times....  SCRM is good if you raid a lot and QB is great if you Torpor of Quiesce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">max spell casting mastery</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ND3 then CA3 no doubt, after that its a toss up imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toein Athkatla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would say that if you solo mostly or just do xp groups mostly then concentrate on the offensive skills, of course Mass Cann is a must in any event. but in the instance of a shaman that raids alot then go with the skills that increase your buffing power. Myself being in a guild that tends to raid daily, my points are spent to make buffs last longer, cast faster, and have set up my character to lean toward Mana regen efficiency. Really all depends on how you plan to play the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">finish ND3<br />
Get SCM3<br />
<br />
that should keep you busy.  Check my magelo for the AA path I took.  I did waste a bit on some extra wis a while ago, and wasted some on a point of stamina too.  Btw, if you raid and progress thru this game, stamina becomes quite worthless.  I'm still not uber and my unbuffed stamina is like 254 or something, so I'd be maxed stamina if I had maxed planar power which I can't bring myself to train. <br />
<br />
Next for me is probably something fun like doing more SCF to see happy fun nuke crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks all for the advice.  I think I'll finish out scr3 for the longer lasting torpor then ND3 just to get it out of the way.  I don't normally die alot, and with more raids in my future, the longer lasting buffs seem too good to pass up right away.<br />
<br />
After both are out of the way.  CA3 or lightning reflexes?<br />
<br />
I'll quit buggin ye for a few weeks after that.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SCRM would be my advice.  1800-2100 hp Torpor, 9 minute Avatar, having to cast SLTW 33% less, 9 minute Avatar, FoS that lasts forever, did I mention 9 minute Avatar?</div></div><hr />
