<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>-Kjeil-</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been away from the game for about 2yrs plus. I quit just befor Luclin launched. I was getting bored with all the Raiding.  I back sporting NTOV gear , My shammy is lvl 61 just by a hair.  I have the Spear of Fate and Bane of Nife and Torpors, Pox, lvl 61 pet, and Primal avatar. I have NO AA.  I have about 2200 hp. and just over 1000 AC,  <br />
<br />
Where can I solo? and build up some AA's?  I have ROK, SOL, VOL,POP,LOY expansions.   Which AA should I get first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome back to Eq. If ya want to solo you should be able to root rot in pon, or pod. Or any of a number of old world zones, sebilis and droga should still be decent xp as would chardok in spots. Personally i recommend getting 62 and joining a bot group, but unless ya have malo that might not be a place you can easily slow. Pov/pos are good spots to group also. AA's I'd get run3, regen 3, mental clarity 3 then cannibalization.</div></div><hr />

What is pon or pod?  and what is run3?  I do have Malo.   What or where is BOT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Plane of Nightmare, Plane of Disease, Bastion of Thunder; and put your first three AAs into Innate Run Speed III (Run3).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Stol on the aa's but Personally look at going to Acrylica Caverns to solo. You might be able to handle Inner with Virtue and KEI. You should be able to make some decent aaxp there along with cash depending on if you get any named or not. That should help you get your big 65 spells and some upgrades Check the thread titled Inner Acrylica. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW if you are on Mith Marr, Ignore everything I have said :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grubsnyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have an EB item you can solo the Skeletons in The Grey.  they are decent exp, no loot.  Plane of Disease if you zone in and head left along the wall untill just before the gap in the wall, set up and reverse Kite the goos might work.  But for the best EXP try to get into groups in Plane of Valor... can't remember the level requirement, and then get flagged for Bastion of Thunder Bees.<br />
<br />
Also level to 65 before you bother with AAs as you will get in better, faster groups and in certain zones get an AA in 45 mins or so... thats with Elemental flags, you need to be guilded and 65 for this.  But even BoT Beez or PoV groups are pretty good exp.<br />
<br />
Go for run3, regen 3, mental clarity 3 (enables Canni5) Canni 5, then if you like to solo go for Virulent paralisis, the new DoT crits and Pet sumoning (starts with 3 dog pets that last 1 min every 12 mins that are like a free dot).  I also like extended buffs and am working on Quickbuff for quick casts of Quiesence.  I have mass group buff for raids as well but if you are not in a guild that raids it is totaly useless.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a little.  Best advice is level up to 65 then get cash for spells while you work AAs.</div></div><hr />

That isnt true all the time. It depends on what server you are on. I know my server has pickup raids for PoP flag mobs. I got EP flagged that way. Secondly, alot of guilds that are currently raiding SSRA/VT or Higher won't even consider a shaman unless they are 65 and have MGB and Canni V. So unless you want to stay in a small family guild and never raid anything more than 2 groups, Get MGB after you get Canni V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Grey has the second worst xp modifier in the game, behind only the lake of ill omen. I doued those skellys for 3 hours getting vt keys and got 5% regular xp at 63, and maybe 15% aa at 65 on my ranger. And every mob I killed was blue to 65.</div></div><hr />
