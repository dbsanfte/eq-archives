<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild had its first shot at Agnarr last night and did ok until we wiped on Agnarr.<br />
<br />
We only wiped for one reason, it took too long to get rid of the portals. The Wzzies were having a little trouble on the first level and excelled on the second, but in the Agnarr room I dunno if it was cause there were too many portals for 4 wizzies or not but they failed to do it fast enough.<br />
<br />
Anyone know why? I had to log after the wipe, and maybe they CR'ed and got it done but I'm curious to know whats really invoved with getting rid of the portals?<br />
<br />
Plus if anyone has some tactics to hsare on this fight it would be much appreicated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On the final level, one of the portals can not be killed and continues to pop out named mobs when Agnarr reaches certain levels of hitpoints.<br />
<br />
On the last level, we do something like this:<br />
<br />
Zone in. One ranger aggroes Agnarr (without damaging him), snares him and runs him around and around the room.<br />
<br />
The rest of the guild takes out the portals which can be destroyed, puts a MA on the named mob and gets rid of the trash.<br />
<br />
Named mob is killed, trash is killed. <br />
<br />
Everyone but the kiting ranger runs back to the stairs, everyone gets rezzed, everyone re-buffs.<br />
<br />
Ranger uses WS to bring Agnarr to the waiting MA. Agnarr is shoulder pinned to the wall. When mobs pop, everyone but the MA (and clerics healing MA) runs over and fights the other named, returning to Agnarr when the mob is dead.<br />
<br />
Rinse/repeat until just Agnarr is left, kill Agnarr.<br />
<br />
Run up the stairs, find Karana standing in his pool, tell him &quot;I will follow the path of the fallen&quot; or something like that, get flag.<br />
<br />
Voila.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was under the impression only Wizards could attack the portals, can anyone attack / destroy them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The wizards are the ones that blow them up, but still good to help them out with a malo/tash before they try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Zone in. One ranger aggroes Agnarr (without damaging him), snares him and runs him around and around the room.<br />
<br />
Just root him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman/Wiz combos are what we have used - Shaman malo and Wiz disentegrate. Possible downside is the resist rate of disentegrate. Spell has long recast time so while waiting for it to reset the portal remains open.<br />
<br />
Depending upon your raid make up, either shaman or enchanters can debuff. If you are fortunate to have 4-5 wizzies they need to understand backing each other up. Assign portals to blow up and if there is resist have an extra wiz standing by to attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">make 3 teams.  Each team has chanter, shaman, wizard.  Assign portals BEFORE you click up and each team takes their own. Malo, tash, disentigrate.  Hardly ever get a resist when using that.<br />
<br />
And yeah, just root agnaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the problem with rooting agn is stupid people, and we all know every guild has them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">portals can be meleed too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get malos and tash in ASAP on the portals, then the wizards disintigrate them.  If wizards were having trouble disintigrating portals, it is probably because they got resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Make mages mala/malosinniaiaiaiiaia.<br />
Shaman are too busy maloing the adds/Agnarr and slowing them and healing.<br />
Also another tactic that will help a lot is you can get pretargets for the portals before you port in.<br />
You lose your target when you port through, but that's up to you to figure out how you want to deal with it.<br />
Also, I don't think our guild ever will do Agnarr without having 4 or 5 wizards that can disintegrate.  It's just not worth the headache.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/agree<br />
Make the mages MalX the portals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">make 3 teams.  Each team has chanter, shaman, wizard.  Assign portals BEFORE you click up and each team takes their own. Malo, tash, disentigrate.  Hardly ever get a resist when using that.<br />

<br />
<br />
This is what we do as well, and it works very well. We also send a shaman and chanter up with the ranger to help debuff for the snare. We dont like to root Aggy, he has a HUGE melee range and will snuff a chanter in 1 round every time if they get to close. If hes getting kited though, he usually wont stop to hit someone if they get too close. <br />
<br />
Although my guild is EP enabled, we still do this event. Its fun. We generally help smaller guilds do it, show them the tricks, use our 10K MA, etc. I am so happy with my guild and their attitude about such things. I have many friends in smaller guilds that would never get a chance to do these fun events without help. Its just a shame that Big Red and Big Blue only drop a rune and no loots. Lotta time investment for 2 items, although Aggys drops are pretty solid, even by EP standards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wizzys with disintigrate aren't needed. You can nuke em down regularly or just melee them down. They don't have that much in the way of hps. Usually when we do itwe have wizzy's disintigrating and almost everyone else is running around trying to kill em too. On agnarr's floor the middle one on the opposite side can't be killed just leave it alone. It spawns the giant adds every 25%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One of the portal in Agnar room can't be disintegrate.<br />
My guild melee portal when wiz have a resist on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for all the valuable advice, this will mean a win at our next Agnarr raid...Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Regardless of how you do it, the best advice you can get is make sure the portals die...fast.  Melle them down, disentigrate them wahtever, just dont leave them alive.  Have some backup methods incase the wrong person dies at the wrong time, don't put all your eggs in one basket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Eggs? dang I didnt know we needed eggs too, this is getting complicated. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Portals really take priority when we do it.  Shamans/mages do the malo line on the 4 targetable portals.  Wizards come in and dis them.  1 warrior on agnarr, moves him to a side of the room then another on the starting mini named (sand i believe) and moves him away so no low hp aggro transfers.  If a portal is left standing (not counting the untargetable) we have raid kill off the sand named and wait at the live portal until its shot down so no adds pick off casters.  After all mobs/portals down everyone on agnarr until 75% then a named comes out of the untargetable portal, kill him (slowable), then back on agnarr until 50% another named comes out (slowable), kill - then back on agnarr, at 25% last named comes out (unslowable), after that dies yer homefree...nothing else happens cept agnarr getting owned  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We do basically what Burz said.  We have never kited/rooted Agnarr.  Just stick him on the wall on a big Tank and keep up the tank.  Move the dmg from him to adds and back as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Another question, how do you get everyone up Agnarr quickly?<br />
<br />
I zoned up straight away but half the guild had trouble porting up via the vortex.<br />
<br />
They were using both R-Click mouse and 'U' keys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I always found that &quot;u&quot; works best, but people need to have the Vortex targeted first, it isn't like a door that you can just be facing and it works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Stand under the vortex.<br />
Look straight up into it.<br />
Press U.<br />
Seems to work most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We dont have enough wizards in our guild, so a lot of times, one portal has been meleed down. They have a DS (os so the melees bitch) so we dispel the portals before they engage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thankyou everyone for all the advice, it payed off immensley and we polished off Agnarr flawlessy. We off tanked Agnarr as opposed to root/kite simply because we could ( had a Time equipped War friend tanking him, even did approx 3% damage solo while we killed each named, amazing)<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">since disintegrate has a  long refresh and downing the portals is key, your best bet is to fully debuff the portals. This include bard debuff which I didnt see in the thread.</div></div><hr />
