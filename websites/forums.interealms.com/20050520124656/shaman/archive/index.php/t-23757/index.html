<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since yesterday the odd occasion ive cast Q on myself and got the didnt take hold message.<br />
Now the 1st time i was in oow and had a dot on me wondered if this could be the cause.<br />
2nd time i was soloing,had no dots on me etc.<br />
3rd time was after post rez c5 but only died once so didnt get the chance to see if rez effects had something to do with it.<br />
I had no cleric heals on me or any other type of heal when this happened.<br />
And no i didnt have a full buff box either :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have had no problems with my Q hiting me while i was doted or rez effects..  It worked great for me as main healer in WoS last night...  my self and teamates..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have had issues with some spell messages not being displayed . I have a funny feeling it is to do with a connectivity issue whilst in OoW . My lag-o-meter (f11 key if i remember correctly) always shows massive fluctuations when i am in nobles causeway and other OoW zones . Not a hinderance but slightly annoying at times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am seeing it (or not seeing it, depending on how you look at it :p) like Wulfbane, when I'm on my horse or my mage is on his lizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I keep losing my title when I zone.  That is quite annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Beeen noticing the same thing with various other spells the last few days, people not getting group buffs when in range, says it would not take hold, not sure what is causing it aside from some spikey lag.</div></div><hr />
