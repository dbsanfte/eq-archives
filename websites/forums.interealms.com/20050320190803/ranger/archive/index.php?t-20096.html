<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twyll</div><div class="date">03-15-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello!  I just thought I would post this guide to help out some fellow rangers.  My ranger was made just after Scars of Velious and is my main character.<br />
<br />
*Spells*<br />
<br />
We get a lot of usefull spells (we don't get the luxury paladins have and can mem 4 stuns because they have nothing better to do with there slots) and only 8 slots to use them in.  Depending on what my circumstances are vary what spells I have up.<br />
<br />
<br />
SLOT 1: Harmony of Nature/Harmony (if pulling or soloing); Flame Lick/Immolate (if tanking indoor or tanking and not pulling); Nuke or DoT (if DPS)<br />
SLOT 2: Tangling Weeds (if tanking); Jolt/Cinder Jolt (if DPS); Panic Animal (if soloing or got some buddies fear kiting with me)<br />
SLOT 3: Snare/Ensnare<br />
SLOT 4: Highest Root spell (not level 9 root sorry)<br />
SLOT 5: SoW (always if outdoors); DoT/Nuke (if indoors)<br />
SLOT 6/7: Buff slots<br />
SLOT 8: Highest Heal<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;For Slot 1 having a DoT or nuke really depends on what mood I am in.  Harmony is up if I am puller (which I usually am) and not indoors, or soloing in a dangerous place i.e. PoD or PoN.  Flame Lick/Immolate has high aggro for tanking.<br />
&gt;Slot 2 is pretty strait forward.  Tangling Weeds is up for the rare occasion someone pulls aggro off you (.5 second cast snare pretty much speaks for itself).  I use Cinder Jolt unless fighting high FR mobs then I switch to Jolt.  Panic Animal if your group is fear kiting or you are soloing.<br />
&gt;Slots 3 and 4 never change, ALWAYS HAVE SNARE AND ROOT UP.<br />
&gt;For Slot 5 always having SoW memed is invaluable.  When indoors I always have my highest DoT here.  I can imagine putting a nuke in Slot 1 and a nuke here (Icewind/Calefaction or Frozen Wind/Brushfire) when I get those spells for some very high DPS.<br />
&gt;Slots 6 and 7 I cycle through my buffs while grouping or solo (what buffs I use will be covered a bit later***).<br />
&gt;Slot 8 also never changes.  Put your highest heal spell here.<br />
<br />
*Buffs*<br />
<br />
Rangers get a lot of buffs.  I can exceed 15 buffs with self buffs  at my level.  This portion of my guide is geared towards higher level rangers because it was just to long ago when I was lower  ;) .  In any group I will start buffing immediately.  I will always give myself the buff first so that when mine starts to blink I know when to rebuff others (I won't keep up DS on myself because it's duration is to short).<br />
<br />
First thing you do is find out what other classes are and their roles so that you can find out which buffs are needed.  Sometimes the druid in a party is main healer and can't keep DS on MT so you will have to.  Sometimes you will need to use all your buffs and other times all you will need to do is self buffs.<br />
<br />
Talk to the paladin.  I don't know what is up with paladins and their BMB trip (sorry my guild is full of dwarven pallies so I talk a lot smack out of jest).  Tell them only person that needs BMB is MT and possibly casters.  Strength of Nature is far more usefull for non-MT melee because it adds DPS to the group and therefore faster exp.<br />
<br />
I will ask who is MT and give that person Skin Like Diamond, Call of Earth, Storm Strength, Strength of Nature, Feet Like Cat ,Chloroplast, Highest DS (fill in your higher or lower level equivalent as needed).<br />
<br />
Other melee in a group is DPS (obviously) so I give them Strom Strength and Strength of Nature.  I find it to much of a pain to keep Force of Nature on them with all the roles a ranger has in a group, but if you can then more DPS for the group and the cleric will not have to heal others as much.<br />
<br />
I will usually give cleric and chanter defensive buffs (Call of Earth, Feet Like Cat, Chloroplast, etc.) if they seem to need it.  <br />
<br />
I will give anyone a buff if they ask for it specifically.  Group buffs are obvious when to recast but I currently only have (Mark of the Predator).<br />
<br />
***After cycling through my buffs I have DS/Highest Bow Buff (depending on if I need to DS the MT or not) in Slot 6 and Proc Buff (Call of Sky, Call of Fire, Cry of Thunder) in Slot 7.  Why? because these are the shortest duration buffs and you will have to recast them the most.  When I need to rebuff I will put new spells in these slots buff then I will put DS/Bow Buff and Proc Buff back.<br />
<br />
If you are dealing with dispelling mobs or PVP it is good to have Proc buff and other short duration buffs high in buff list.  Also, it can be good to have some crap buffs if you can spare the slots (I usually can't; I have trouble deciding what buffs to keep when I need to make a slot for a cleric's heal over time spell).<br />
<br />
*Grouping*<br />
<br />
When your group gets trained, snaring and rooting adds, making sure everyone is SoWed, and healing casters will make you a lot of friends.  Root parking adds is a very nice crowd control when you don't have a chanter/bard or when a caster is getting beat on.  Higher level mobs that summon will only summon if they have taken a bit of damage, so you can root park them if your group knows how to assist.<br />
<br />
If you have AM3, Jolt/Cinder Jolt is a good way to pull without getting summoned.  I will snare when I am back at camp and they get in range for it.  I can usually get off my jolt by the time the MT engages.  If you find yourself having aggro issues wait on snare.<br />
<br />
If tanking, snare when mob gets in range.  Then you will have time for Immolate or Tangling Weeds while casters tash and slow before the mob even engages.<br />
<br />
It is nice to ask if anyone in group needs summoned arrows.  Summon arrows during buff times or other downtime.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
There is my first draft.  If anyone has anything to add or anything different to say please do.  All of this information is my own from 58 levels and 12AA of experience.  I welcome more opinions especially from higher level rangers.<br />
<br />
I will be adding a PVP section soon also.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twyll</div><div class="date">03-16-2003, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted the guide to try and help people.  I know plenty of non-ebaying rangers that I have given this advice to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalantia</div><div class="date">03-16-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BMB is a group spell.  I advise getting used to having it overwrite, or at least coordinate with the paladin on buffing.  TELLING someone how to buff is a sure way to annoy them.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twyll</div><div class="date">03-16-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye it is a group spell.  But all group spells have a range.  The paladin can either move away from us or have us move away from him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalantia</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easier to just ask the paladin to buff and then have people click it off if they want yours.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twyll</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I guess there is a number of ways you can do it.<br />
<br />
Have the paladin cast first and everyone that needs SoN click it off, or the way I already said.<br />
<br />
Most people announce group buffs.  I have seen clerics announce BoA and the casters with PoTC leave the radius so it doesn't overwrite.<br />
<br />
I find it to much of a hassel to tell everyone to click off BMB because most people don't know what either buff does and I get tired of trying to cast SoN on them to ge the &quot;you spell will not take hold&quot; message.<br />
<br />
Don't take anything I sadi personal I am a really nice guy.  I just like to give pallies a hard time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalantia</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe..<br />
<br />
225 HP is a good thing, and so is ATK.  *shrug*  I know offensive classes that swear by HP because they'll live longer if I drop.<br />
<br />
It don't matter.  People are lazy  *laugh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taewedar</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It honestly depends on the mob. If it's a very heavy near unresistable aoe, I'll take every hitpoint I can get and sacrifice some atk. <br />
<br />
Othewise it's atk &gt; hp.<br />
<br />
Cussing ignorant brell happy paladins is in our job description :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalantia</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just like cussing out ignorant rangers that don't know when to buff is in ours?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twyll</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL paladins rock.  I am not talking about thier class, but the people behind the computer screen.<br />
<br />
/cheer Dalantia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corenia</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i hate it when people post guides thinking they are the almighty ranger of rangers... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twyll</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm I don't know where you got that from.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is my first draft. If anyone has anything to add or anything different to say please do. All of this information is my own from 58 levels and 12AA of experience. I welcome more opinions especially from higher level rangers&quot;<br />
<br />
Please read before you post rude remarks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalantia</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehehe...<br />
<br />
I've also been doing some long, hard thinking about the sorts of people that make X type of character as their first character.  You start to really notice some character attributes about people who have specific race/class combinations as their first main, especially when it's so consistent.<br />
<br />
But that's more of a philosophical debate than anything I can really put down on paper at the moment.  ;)<br />
<br />
I also take it upon myself to give the rangers a hard time; even the one I'm living with at the moment (don't want to go back to college!), even she isn't exempt from my teasing.  *grin*  I love her to death, but I still tease her.<br />
<br />
And I only mem three stuns, thank you very much; Cease, Stun, and Quellious.  The rest are spells that could save your or my arse in a pinch.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twyll</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There actually is a study done on EQ.  Forgot name of the psycologist but based on age, sex, location, and other stuff I forgot, he can pinpoint what class and race you will pick.  Really interesting stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalantia</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fascinating!  I'll have to look for it sometime.  I always thought the parallels between a person's race/class and their personality were rather strange, but I guess others noticed it too.</div></div><hr />
