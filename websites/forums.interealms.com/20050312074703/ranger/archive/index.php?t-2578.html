<br />
---From todays patch message <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
May 8th, 2002. 3:00 am <br />
------------------------------ <br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- We've made some changes that will cause a few proccing items to be out of charges after the patch. Players with such items will need to petition and ask a GM to swap the item out with a new one <br />
- Focus items using the &quot;Naki's Pernicity&quot; effects should now be working as intended <br />
- Focus items that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items <br />
- It should be impossible to equip an item that will reduce your hit points by more than your maximum hit points. Also, hit point reduction items should not lower hit points below 1 <br />
- Tinkered Compass now adds the appropriate bonus to the sense heading skill <br />
- Hit point bonuses on food items should be working <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- Higher level familiars should once again survive when their masters go invisible, Abscond or Evac <br />
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the Lesser Familiar mana regeneration component from working <br />
- Familiars no longer cause damage to their master upon death <br />
- Familiar buff remains after the caster uses the /pet get lost command to remove the visual representation <br />
- Torrent of Fatigue should be working properly now <br />
- Allure of the Wild has had its level cap raised to make it a useful upgrade <br />
- Umbra has been improved to give a slightly higher AC benefit <br />
- A character can no longer trade with an NPC when invisible. Character must turn visible before starting the trade <br />
- Characters can no longer scribe a scroll that they can't cast due to deity restrictions <br />
- Invisibility should now remain after a link death <br />
- Theft of Thought will no longer give mana when cast on PC classes that do not have mana (in PvP or in a duel) <br />
- Drain/Share spells can no longer be cast on players on blue servers, and can no longer be cast on group members on PvP servers. Spells Affected: Succession of Shadows, Crippling Claudication, Mind Wrack, Degeneration, Zevfeer's Theft of Vitae, Torrent of Hate, Torrent of Fatigue, Torrent of Pain <br />
- Spirit Armor scroll no longer lists Shadowknights as a class that can use it (they couldn't anyway) <br />
- Bard AE songs now have vertical limit of 50 feet. This is also the case for Mass Group Buff <br />
- Gating and porting while in tree form should no longer cause crashes <br />
- Removed all &quot;Begins to cast X spell&quot; text from procs <br />
- Resurrection request box will now reset if you open another window while it is up, preventing a problem where a character is unable to be resurrected if he has the res box up and he loots a mob or opens a trade window <br />
- Fixed a bug with lifetaps that would cause people around a lifetap to see, &quot;You feel drained...&quot; instead of &quot;Fippy feels drained...&quot; <br />
- Issues with Healing seeming to be delayed have been fixed (see Spell Filters) <br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing &quot;soandso's song ends&quot; to show up as &quot;he's song ends&quot; if the bard was targeted, &quot;it's song ends&quot; if not targeted <br />
- Divine Glory received a small upgrade to make it more in line with the spell series <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spell Filters ** <br />
<br />
- Issues with healing seeming to be delayed should be fixed. The problem was with filters that allowed players to ignore spells that were hitting them. The following changes were needed to fix this issue <br />
- Player characters will now always see spells that hit them and spells they cast <br />
- Players with the Group option set for PC spells will see the start spell casting messages for people in their group and they will also see when member of their group are hit with spells <br />
- Players with the ALL option will still see all PC spells and spell hits <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spell Stacking ** <br />
<br />
General stacking changes: Some buffs were not being allowed to stack which now will stack, and other buffs were being allowed to stack which should not have. <br />
<br />
For example, many stacking problems with spells that have a See Invisible or Levitate component are now gone (e.g. Dead Man Floating), while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration, too much offense (ATK), too large of a damage shield, or too many hit points have been fixed. Here are some of the details: <br />
<br />
- Vision abilities (natural or spell-granted) should no longer cause spells to fail to take hold <br />
- Bard songs should in general overwrite fewer spells <br />
<br />

- Call of the Predator and Warder's Protection should no longer stack <br />

- Shroud of Spirits and the Cloak of the Akheva should stack properly now <br />
- Cantata of Soothing should no longer overwrite Clarity spells <br />
- Cantata and Chorus of Replenishment should no longer overwrite Acumen <br />
- Bladecoat no longer overwrites Clarity II <br />
- Lower level druid group buffs should now be less likely to overwrite higher level buffs <br />
- Avatar and Force of Nature will no longer stack <br />
- Ancient Feral Avatar should now stack properly <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Improved Familiar should now be better than Greater Familiar <br />
- Fixed a bug with Permanent Illusion that was causing the caster to see his illusions drop when zoning, even if others continued to see the illusion <br />
- Trolls and Iksar no longer receive double regeneration ability from AA abilities <br />
- The Archetype skill Casting Deftness will no longer supercede the Class specific Quick Buff casting time reducing skill. Note that at this time there is a maximum benefit to casting time bonuses of a 50% reduction <br />
- Casting deftness was changed to reflect the increases presented by the in-game help (5, 15 and 25%) <br />
- Turn Summoned should now work on all summoned creatures, not just pets. The text should correctly say that there is only one level for this ability <br />
- Improved Reclaim Energy now works with the epic pet <br />
- Fixed a crash bug caused by Call Corpse <br />
- Alternate Advancement abilities that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items <br />
- Quick Summon should now work for Call of the Hero and Manifest Elements <br />
- Quick Summon also changed to match the benefits presented by the in-game help <br />
<br />
<br />
** Skills ** <br />
<br />

- Poison should no longer be interrupted <br />
- Sneak only breaks when a character is hit, not when he hits someone <br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing a problem when Pick Pockets was used before Beg had refreshed. Beg and Pick Pocket use the same timer, so now using Beg or Pick Pocket will cause both buttons to gray out <br />
- A message is now displayed and skills are properly reset when a rogue breaks sneak and/or hide because he is looting a corpse <br />
- Beastlords should function like other hybrids when casting in melee <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones ** <br />
<br />
- The Hole now uses Kunark-level Mez/Charm/Taunt rules <br />
- Petrified humerus should now be available <br />
- Zones where mounts cannot be summoned will now remove mounts when they enter the zone <br />

- Fixed pathing exploits in Chardok <br />
- Fixed a pathing exploit in Cazic Thule <br />
- Fixed a pathing exploit in Acrylia <br />
- Fixed a pathing bug in the Tower of Frozen Shadow <br />
- Fixed a pathing bug in Fungus Grove <br />
- Fixed a spot where characters could get stuck in Twilight Sea <br />
- Moved the Permafrost 'safe point' closer to the zone line <br />
- Addressed an issue with an aggressive NPC that appeared outside of the Arx Building in Sanctus Seru <br />
-Modified the Vyzh`dra the Cursed spawn trigger to make the various incarnations more accessible <br />
-Modified several NPCs in the temple of Ssraeshza to address the disparity between melee and caster effectiveness in the zone <br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Adjustments have been made to the 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl quest <br />
- High Priestess Alexandriana should be working properly now <br />
<br />
<br />
** Tradeskills ** <br />
<br />
- Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes for all levels of skill, along with many recipe books. A few of the vendors of Norrath might be able to get you started on your way <br />
- Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant <br />
- Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin <br />
<br />
<br />
** Guilds ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed many bugs with the guild system, for example: GMs can now rename guilds without the need to destroy and recreate them, guilds can have names that share the first 15 characters with another guild (they couldn't before) and people should no longer experience random guild kickouts when a guild on their server is deleted/reformed. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Pets ** <br />
<br />
- A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the same time <br />
- /pet attack range has been limited to prevent its use as a targeting tool. Asking pets to attack targets outside the range will generate a &quot;not a legal target&quot; message <br />
- Pets will once again tell you who they are attacking by sending its master a /tell <br />
- Pet attack animations should now be working for all pets <br />
<br />
<br />
** Chat Channels ** <br />
<br />
- Players can specify a chat channel as their default channel using the /channel commands (e.g. /channel chat mychannel) <br />
- The 'old' method for setting the default channel is also now saved in the INI file <br />
- Kick and Invite should be working for chat channels <br />
<br />
<br />
** Horses ** <br />
<br />
- Potions now work while on a horse <br />
- Skeletons can now ride horses (meaning: PCs should be able to mount and ride horses while changed into a skeleton) <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing the AFK flag to sometimes not be visible to players entering a zone after it was turned on <br />
- Made some adjustments to factions to make Beastlords, Druids and Rangers (as well as small adjustments for Vah Shir) a little better liked by animals (those that don't adhere to a faction) <br />
- No updates are sent when the player character is not moving, saving resources. We've also increased the rate that position updates are made by moving player characters, using up some of those saved resources but making movement a bit smoother <br />
- Stationary NPCs should no longer warp when they aggro/summon <br />
- NPCs who shout names while they Death Touch should be fixed <br />
- Teleports arriving in some zones should spread the arrivals out a bit more. Affected zones are Nexus, Skyfire, Emerald Jungle, Butcherblock Mountains, South Ro, Greater Faydark, Tox, North Karana, West Commons and Lavastorm <br />
- Fixed the bug that was preventing players from seeing the &quot;your spell is interrupted&quot; or the NPCs spell interruption message <br />
- Fixed the issue with boats depositing players at the safe point of the zone after zoning <br />
- Fixed the strange floating NPC bug (seeing NPCs floating in the air after zoning) <br />
- /cry is now working <br />
- /consent %t should allow the consented character to drag your corpse <br />
- Target Nearest NPC (F8 by default) has been fixed. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Sullon Zek Rules Change ** <br />
<br />
We have increased the number of character that can be created on an account to three. These characters, however, must be on the same team <br />
<br />
<br />
** Firiona Vie Rules Changes ** <br />
<br />
Since the launch of Firiona Vie we have had tremendous support for this special server from players who want a very roleplaying immersive environment. Players have made numerous suggestions to tweak the ruleset a little more. We have taken many of those suggestions and made changes accordingly. <br />
<br />
We will be keeping the following rules intact: <br />
<br />
* /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in character is strongly recommended. <br />
* The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of race-based community and to allow people to continue to roleplay someone with a native tongue. <br />
* The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items will remain. This has worked out nicely for the sense of community on the server. <br />
* The one character per account restriction will remain. <br />
<br />
However, we will be removing the following restrictions: <br />
<br />
* Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain available, but forcing anonymity on characters was causing undue problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to enjoyable gameplay. <br />
* The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While the idea of limited languages seemed like a good idea, this is another item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. Roleplayers that don't want their characters to be overly literate always have the option to play their characters that way. <br />
* /shout and /auction have returned to unrestricted use to allow easier grouping and selling. People are welcome to filter those channels if they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them availabe is just too great. /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended. <br />
* Alignment restrictions has been removed. Forced restrictions for grouping make playing the game too much of a chore. Characters, however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any factors the character perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of Quellious wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do so. But not allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that character 'in-character', and a real hindrance to general gameplay. <br />
<br />
Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying preferred server. The rules that we are changing were often as much of a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the artificial barriers to grouping, especially the trouble created in just finding a group, needed to be removed to allow people to actually play the game</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1) Were Rangers having that added attack unbalancing to the game?<br />
<br />
2) If they took the time to nerf the stacking, why couldn't they take the time to fix the stacking with Brells and Mage/Druid Damage Shields?<br />
<br />
3) ***?</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Call of the Predator and Warder's Protection should no longer stack <br />
<br />
This was from May 8th patch message. As Relv pointed out a while ago, that it should not stack. Yay our level 60 all in 1 buff might give us a little more attack but worse stats. Like Furor stated that Wizards are outdmging Rogues 3x on Luclin encounters because of the High AC/Mitigation on these mobs, just imagine how useless we pretty much are unless we use AM3 and EQ on mobs since we're not even close to Rogue dmg on these mobs.<br />
<br />
With 1455 attk I get lots and I mean a lot of 1dmg hits and 30-50 hits in Ssara.  that's basically cut my DPS in half, damn we need to be nerfed so our DPS can be cut in 1/3.<br />
<br />
Well here's my Rant anyways.</div></div><hr />

-Modified several NPCs in the temple of Ssraeshza to address the disparity between melee and caster effectiveness in the zone <br />
Besides, without any stacking issues I have 1543ATK, I never used the CoP / WP stacking bug and dont have a problem with it beeing fixed, it would be VERY nice if they would fix the other stacking issues tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- A character can no longer trade with an NPC when invisible. Character must turn visible before starting the trade <br />
<br />
<br />
Does this mean fletching?<br />
- Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes for all levels of skill, along with many recipe books. A few of the vendors of Norrath <br />

<br />
What's the jest of this? I can sneak up to a mob and whack on it and not aggro those next to it if they stay turned away?<br />

<br />
Does this make the hole eaiser/harder/the same?<br />
- The Hole now uses Kunark-level Mez/Charm/Taunt rules</div></div><hr />

Now too bad i couldn't get to level 60 before the exploit was fixed.<br />
Gotta love the fact that Divine Glory has been upgraded.<br />
Maybe it's too hard for them to consider a WP upgrade, as it is, right now this spell stacking sucks Bad...</div></div><hr />

CoP &amp; WP not stacking is anoying. Whats worse is HoS not stacking with any str/dex buffs.  That really bites. <br />
<br />
Apart from the negatives on the spells... a lot of good fixes elsewhere. I can see why they may need a few extra hours for some of these fixes.</div></div><hr />

How long has HoS stacked with other spells? A long long time. One of two things...<br />
<br />
1. Verant didn't know they were stacking. Shame on VI then for being clueless about their own game, get a real VI paid tester in the game.<br />
<br />
2. They knew and blew it off. Spell stacking can't take months to corrent, if it does VI has bigger problems than spell stacking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes. Thats how Rogues sneak pull. Hide drops when you hit attack, but sneak doesnt unless you get hit. There appears to have been a bug though that occasionally dropped your sneak when you hit things.  - Kinda like dropping your pants in a crowded shopping mall.<br />
<br />
Havent you ever used sneak to reduce your agro radius on a pull?</div></div><hr />

Soon as someone combines 4 items in a kit for a new recipe and gets an item  of equal or better stats to NToV (oh wait that's summoned focus items).<br />

Fix YOUR bugs, Verant, not just the &quot;exploits&quot;.  <br />

I had rationalized before this patch that I would stack these buffs in silent PROTEST of stacking bugs until Verant FIXES the stacking issues with Brellicide, damage shields and that damn Shroud of Hate which screws up fighting in Chardok and Akheva.

Now I see the greatest thing I had going for me has been nerfed to hell.  And that's the only change that affected shamans, the nerf.  Thanks VI.  Thanks.  Getting Harness of Spirit was a major accomplishment for Numbuk, as it took me 2 years to get high enough to get it.<br />

Kind of a mixed blessing though prolly since before there were only one or two groups ever there due to the extreme difficulty of the zone with no taunt, now it might start to get somewhat crowded.<br />

p.s. since I logged on with CoP/warders stacked does that mean they will still be stacked when loggin back on?  If I am really careful i can keep them refreshed befor ever wearing off heh, ya right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FoN + Avatar did stack... cast storm strength, cast FoN, then proc avatar... avatar will overwrite STR because they both share a +str mod in the attrib 1 slot, but won't overwrite FoN due to the ATK in the attrib 4 slot as it normally would.<br />

Warders protection simply put sucks in everyway. IT USED to be good because it stacked with COP and thus gave an additional 70 attack. This made the spell well worth not having brells. With the recent alteration in stacking Warders is a complete flaming piece of crap.<br />
Let;s look at the spells along with what you can stack:<br />
warders does <br />
1)75hp/ 70 attack /20 pt DS /14ac.<br />
it stacks with jack *)(@#*()@<br />
<br />
2) OR you can have <br />
COP= 40 attack<br />
SON= 25 attack 75 hp<br />
shield of spikes etc=17 pt damage shield<br />
COE= 26 ac  4 damage shield<br />
natures precision=15 attack<br />
<br />
so  NOW let's see the total benefit of the options:<br />
1)warders <br />
75hp/ 70 attack /20 pt DS /14ac<br />
2) SON/COE/PRED/NP/DS<br />
75hp/ 79 attack/ 21ptDS /26ac<br />
<br />
AND if you have a paladin you can replace SON with brells which is 200 HP<br />
<br />
this makes warders protection our new lvl 60 spell a flaming pile O poo.. <br />

I agree WP was SUPPOSED to be an aego for ranger buffs but we BOTH know it sure as hell isn't. AEGO gives more benefit then the indevidual buffs AND at the same time lasts longer LIKE warders. WARDER gives MUCH LESS benefit then the indevidual buffs and lasts longer. So other then saving buff spots it has no purpose. Furthmore, since WP is still overwritten by brells but none of the &quot;old&quot; and BETTER buffs are, no one will bother to use warders asstection ever again.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and shroud of hate shouldnt overwrite  ; )  but I don't think verant is listening to us on this  =*(<br />
<br />
*edit* I say *should* because other classes either get all-in-one buffs that are better, or they get group buffs of previously single target spells, we get neither...maybe Verant thinks brells is the paladins counter to us having CoP as a group buff, who can say</div></div><hr />

They need to re-examine this spell.  I've had it a month or two now and don't see the point of using it really.<br />
<br />
Originally this was supposed to be castable on OTHERS.  That would make a huge difference.<br />
<br />
They need to make it desirable to cast this over the 3-4 component buffs.  Not just an option, but some reason why you do this.  If I recall it's something like a net gain of 6 less AC for 10 more attack.  Oh whee, that's incredible.<br />

This patch changed one thing, and one thing only with the spell stacking engine: how stacking multiple buffs that shared multiple attributes was handled to prevent exploiting.  While it would have been nice to see every fix to the game in this patch... one thing at a time.<br />
<br />
Elvarr if people don't use WP they are just silly and are losing a lot of ATK and buff slots.  As far as self buffs vs. group buffs, I don't believe spirit of oak OR blessed armor of the risen OR transon's phantasmal protection stacks with POTG... not exactly unique to rangers.  There are a number of self-buffs in EverQuest that don't stack with group buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Criongel</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fix is fair comment, WP is our all in buff which inclides CoP to some degree, therefore the 2 buffs shouldnt stack.<br />
<br />
However I think Elvaar pointed out, that unlike ohter all in wonder buffs, ie Aego/Focus, WP is self only.  Add to that the fact that it gets overwritten easilly, makes it practically pointless to cast over Coe, son, cop etc unless your trying to save on buffslots.  I hit 1595 attack yesterday and tbh cant really see anything unbalancing about it.  Its not like we can stack the buffs to uber augment anyone elses attack.  <br />
<br />
I'd like to see WP/Brells stack maybe and change WP so that its not self only and eventually see a group version of it. DS stacking needs to be sorted as well.  For the time being however we'll have to carry on receiving tells for CoP/CoE, and continue re arranging re loading and re casting our own buffs to work around things that conflict/overwrite.</div></div><hr />

WP and CoP were &lt;b&gt;never&lt;/b&gt; supposed to stack.  Fixing this is therefore not a nerf.  If Verant accidently puts in a Ranger sword that proc's death touch then removes it I am sure some of you would still consider that a nerf.  Get over it.  You still have better attack than most.<br />
<br />
I also like how someone pointed out that Rogue fixes/enhancements that were made.  Yay!  Lets go back to being envious of other classes.<br />

<br />
1. Call of Earth is on my tunic.<br />
It costs me zero mana to cast.<br />
<br />
2. With Mental Clarity 1, it is very easy to maintain Call of Predator, Strength of Nature, Nature's Precision, Chloroplast (if needed,) a Damage Shield and Call of Fire while soloing. This is provided that I am not getting nuke happy and nuking away all my mana.<br />
<br />
edit -<br />
When you are soloing, you won't have issues of too many buffs. When you are in a group, you'll have Clarity 2 or KEI most likely, which just makes maintaining all those other buffs even easier. Warder's is just a lose-lose situation either way.<br />
<br />
<br />
My opinion of Warder's Protection is that its only good for filling your spell book or tossing into the nearest lavapit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the using Brells makes you a traitor theory, far from it. <br />
I've had Brells save me from getting sent to my bind point a few times when I knew I was going to be eating dot damage from an AE. (That's about the only time I'll take Brells over ranger buffs.)</div></div><hr />

They could have taken the time to make it a better spell and not get overwritten by all those other spells.

It's an exploit COTP + WP stacked, if you stacked them you were exploiting, it is not a nerf but rather a fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Brell is better because atk means CRAP with the damage mitigation now on Luclin mobs)<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, ATK means even more on high mitigation mobs than ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
Relv, there are a LOT of warders out there who don't have the luxury of being above the cap.<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to bet most level 60 rangers, with buffs, are above the warrior AC cap-- nevermind the ranger one.<br />

Buut I guess since no one ever believes a word I say, your fungi tunic is nerfed, PC Gamer never had EQ 2 coverage, COTP + WP were intended to stack, WP sucks, ATK is useless, AC is king and no one is AC capped, Verant hates the ranger class, and this was a nerf!  DAMN YOU VERANT!  Damn rogues got hooked up in this patch... I'm startin a rogue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this isnt even taking into account that now we have a totally useless lvl 60 buff save for 1 situation. soloing.</div></div><hr />

and Whiners Glade? come on man this is a discussion in an attempt that to hopefully improve the Ranger class, isn't that one of the main points of The Glade? if we don't voice our concerns, do you think they will ever fix stacking issues?<br />

stats as displayed in game not in spfdata file<br />

1. - Brells - FoN - CoP - NP<br />

225 hp - 3 pt regen - 92 atk - 3 pt DS<br />
<br />
Pro - no stacking issues with mage/druid DS and no worries about Brells ninja buffing. <br />

2. - WP - FoN - NP  <br />

75 hp - 3 pt rege - 129 atk - 24 pt ds - 11 ac<br />

Dead ranger = no dps. Now this can't easily be calculated out into an exact overall increase of dmg output by us over 15atk, I know It can't easily be proven, just take my word on it =P  I can't go back in the game and test it out, but I'm sure many of us who raid all the time will agree to this fact. Overall If you're confused like I am, I'm just gonna lay it down like this:<br />

Yah COP and WP should not stack. But WP is not an aego of ranger buffs. Even a self buffed version is BS.<br />
 <br />
Aego can be cast on the full group  same bonuses as the 3 seperate buffs, but cost less to cast than the 3 seperate buffs. <br />
<br />
WP cost less to cast but only is self buffed and is a magor downgrade to 1 of the buffs and a minor upgrade to another.<br />
<br />
WP should not have stacking problems with Brells they should both say sorry won't take hold. WP should be  targeted buff. WP should have same stats as all 3 buffs it replaces and cost less to cast. WP shouldn't stack with CoP.</div></div><hr />

I do think that some peeps are being a drama queens here. Warders is certainly not useless. Attack &gt; Ac for a damage dealer, 9 times out of 10. Plus, not having to re ds between pulls saves alot of mana, and in turn reduces downtime (I'm talking soloing/small groups, which I do alot of for exp).<br />
<br />
That being said, I really wish they would fix the stacking issues.<br />
<br />
I'm alot more pissed off about sneak turn ins being nerfed, if indeed I'm reading that correctly.</div></div><hr />

Relv, what is this ranger AC cap vs. the warrior AC cap please (numbers). imo I have fairly ok gear for a level 60 ranger and my MAX ac is around 1250 with full raid buffs.<br />
profile : http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4570<br />
<br />
Now as I said earlier I have no issues with the fix of this stacking bug, but why not fix them all while they where at it ? Now they have to go back and look at the spell on more time at some later date, that seems illogical and plain stupid imo.<br />
<br />
The problems as I see them with stackin issues arent that complicated its really only X spells :<br />
Shield of Lava (mag)<br />
Aegis of Ro (mag)<br />
Shield of Thorns (dru)<br />
Shield of Blades (dru)<br />
Legacy of Thorn (dru)<br />
Ancient: Legacy of Blades (dru) (if ever found heh another problem alltogether)<br />
Any and all ATK debuffs makes it go away too, maybe make it so that it works like slow / haste.<br />

Any your agument about other classes have similar problems arent really valid here, just because other ppl starve does it make hunger ok ?</div></div><hr />

Yes, of course it was an exploit, but dam fix the PoS spell before you disallow us to stack it.<br />
<br />
This just in WP is SELF only, then why the hell does Brells overwrite it? Retarded.<br />
<br />
Verant ALWAYS fixes the stuff that players &quot;exploit&quot; but drag their asses when it is negative to players.<br />
<br />
Unless they upgrade the spell I wont use it anymore.  A few more attack isnt worth the HP reduction.<br />

1) see my above post cause yes i think we got shafted unless warders gets upgraded<br />
<br />
2) STOP TALKING ABOUT THE DAMN AC CAP  THERE IS NO SUCH THING DAMN IT!!!!!<br />
<br />
once and for all.. <br />
attack vs AC is what matters<br />
mobs in different world had &quot;caps&quot; on thier attack/ac which seemed to go up with every expansion. Thus the apparent 'soft cap' on ac. however, technically speaking there is no freaking ac cap !!!</div></div><hr />

Sure raises your mitigation skills though. I think most 60 Rangers can hit that pretty damned easy.<br />

And eh... Atk &gt; HP period, I'd never use Brell's... ever. WP is a bit weak, but its still a great buff. It was a fix, big deal.<br />

1250 AC is what warriors found the warrior AC cap to be, (without any AA avoidance/mitigation skills), so I'd say you're set :P  I think Sean said in another thread the rogue cap was found to be around 1050 or so, and rangers have less defense skill than rogues-- so our cap would be lower than that.<br />
<br />
Now as I said earlier I have no issues with the fix of this stacking bug, but why not fix them all while they where at it ?<br />

What everybody seems to forget about Warder's Protection is that it has a damage shield component that lasts for 2.5 hours.  If you solo or tank at all, that is amazing damage/mana efficiency.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shield of Spikes lasts for 6 minutes and costs 100 mana to cast.  Keeping that buff up for 2.5 hours will cost you at least 2500 mana (since you are bound to fizzle it at least once in the 25 times you have to cast it to keep it refreshed).<br />
<br />
MC1 will regen 1500 mana over that 2.5 hour period, and we haven't even counted the mana required to keep up those other buffs you mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rangers just got nerfed to hell.<br />
<br />
Making CoP not stack with Warder's Protection just cost us 55ATK, reducing our dps by 6%. Making FON not stack just cost us 20 more ATK (drops dps another 2%) and we lose a 3 point regen.<br />
<br />
^@&amp;%#$ Verant. Instead of FIXING the stack problems with WP and Brells/damage shields/Shroud of Hate, they just nerfed it to hell because that was &quot;the easy way out&quot;.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, rogues get a whole lot of attention and bug fixes in this patch (go figure, seeing that the Safehouse mods sleep with Verant).<br />
<br />
Now, assuming I get Avatar (primal or cast on me):<br />
Brells is preferable, and my WP self-buff gets tossed into the trashheap. So long my SoL level 60 &quot;best&quot; ranger buff. So long all my SoL spells. Useless rubbish crap. Hello again paladins, mages and druids.<br />
<br />
new &quot;ideal buff choice&quot;<br />
CoE+Brell+CotP+NP+random mage/druid/ranger damage shield <br />
================== <br />
39ds, 55atk, 25ac, 225hp <br />
<br />
over <br />
<br />
Verant's &quot;new&quot; unstackable Warder's Protection<br />
WP (now that CoP and FoN don't stack anymore)<br />
=================== <br />
21ds, 70atk 13ac 75hp <br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda sucks, doesn't it that rangers after this patch got Jack**** for Luclin spells? We got no new DoTs and no new DDs with SoL, and now only have self buffs which are inferior to our old Kunark buffage.<br />

Thanks for the numbers Relv :) Ive heard alot of different things, (1000ac casters / 1200 chain / 1400 plate for one) but since I havent done any testing myself I have no idea.<br />
<br />
My personal belief is that there is a cap and there isnt ;) ie. the cap vs. a mob with 1k ATK might be 1k AC (fictional numbers) but for a mob with 1200ATK you might benefit from 1200AC ... *shrug* havent tested it so cant tell. (besides how do you do those tests Sean ? How can you test stuff like this vs. uber mobs that quad for 1k ?) ;)</div></div><hr />

It could definately use an upgrade, but it's still very usefull.<br />
<br />
Pro - Less buff slots, longer duration <br />
<br />
Agreed, the biggest benefit of having WP is for sure the longer duration. I love having a long lasting 21 point DS, I always hated having to recast Shield of Spikes all the time. I don't really care about BMB overwriting WP anymore, nor do I care about mage DS's overwriting it, since I can always click those buffs off and recast my WP, and usually if you ask the Mage or Paladin to give a warning, or do single target buffs instead, they will.<br />
<br />
The real problem is Shroud of Hate, Scream of Hate and Despair, these are low level debuff spells that SK mobs cast constantly, they will all overwrite Warder's Protection AND Call of the Predator. Those small newbie buffs just turned into a  major debuff, the ranger went down 75hp, 14ac, 90ATK and lost it's 21point DS, which is quite sad for a low level SK buff. It's like Siphon Strenght(str debuff) would overwrite Focus of Spirit or Scream of Pain(ac debuff) overwriting the Bulwark of Faith line, including Aego (since the bulwark line is included in Aego). Shamans/Clerics would go crazy if these spell lines were overwritten by low level SK debuffs, it's the same case here, yet they won't fix it, which is imo a slap in the face to the ranger class, their lack of action is like saying our class isn't important enough to waste time on fixing spell stackings.<br />
<br />
In areas that's populated by tons of SK mobs (HS, Akheva, Ssra, Acrylia is just a few zones where there are alot of SK's that constantly casts Shroud of Hate, and there's a ton more)  you can't use WP at all, nor Call of the Predator, which is just.. out of whack. No other class has it that way, and no class should.<br />

WP no longer stacks because it's an exploit??<br />
<br />
Oh boy.  I can't wait to hit level 60 and get my big elite buff that can be OVERWRITTEN.<br />
<br />
Why even bother ??<br />
<br />
And how about the MQ nerf??  Just wait till the faction challenged peeps holding SEoC pieces see this.  GRATZ destroy button.  You think getting one was a major pain before, you better take your thorazine now.  Cause you may be dead and buried before you EVER see one, especially if you live on a high population server and don't belong to an uber guild.  In the meantime, you can go park youself in LOIO and listen to Xenovorash gets nuked twice a day. <br />
<br />
For the first time in my long life of playing EQ I am honestly wondering if it's even worth it to level my ranger to 60.  It seems like EVERY time we get to a point where we are actually useful to the high end game, we get smacked back down.  All in the name of  &quot;exploit removal&quot; or  &quot;class balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
You can try to put rose colored glasses on this if you want, but I'm now 95% convinced that the group that claims Verant just plain doesn't like the ranger class is true.<br />
<br />
And the wonderful new recepies??  Well, I'll not hold my breath waiting for it to have a major impact upon Fletching.  A new crafted bow that did 36 or 37 dmg with a REASONABLE delay just seems too good to hope for.<br />

<br />
One good reason (no exploiting) in the past for stacking WP and CoP was when you were fighting in Akheva or Chardok...if Shroud of Hate overwrote one of these, at least you could then maintain the other ATK buff.  And since it's a bug that Shroud, a low-level spell could overwrite either WP or CoP,  I never considered this an exploit, but rather a &quot;bug fix&quot;, since the end result was that we maintained what Verant considers a &quot;proper ranger buff set&quot;+Shroud.</div></div><hr />

I hate to break it too you, but, in the real world if someone can do something that enhances their life with zero consequences, they will.  As far as I'm concerned the nature of this game is the PC vs. the Software Designer/Developer, not those cartoons we fight in ToV or anywhere else for that matter.  <br />
<br />
The Developer's job is to setup an order of operations for the PC to complete to either advance in level and/or enhance the PC's playing ability.  If we are able to take things that have been placed in game by these developer's and utilize them in different ways the term &quot;exploit&quot; is not applicable and irrelevant.  (*NOTE* I would not apply this viewpoint to those PC's that choose to using pathing bugs to accomplish goals.  That's just a matter of technology not being able to handle certain situations and is not something that the software developers can fix or adjust easily, i.e. not something that should really be taken advantage of.)<br />
<br />
Now the real issue here is did the stacking of WP and CoP something that significantly unbalanced the ranger class?  In my opinion no, this is a situation that might not have been intended to occur, but, at the same time was not necessarily<br />
a bad thing.  IMO ranger's should always have a higher or equal ATK to other melee classes of comparable level and equipment this is our role in terms of melee combat.  From what i've noticed in both group and raid situations this spell combo put us on more equal footing as far DPS and other &quot;damage dealing&quot; classes.   <br />
<br />
WP still is a good spell, but, just barely.  What most people are upset about is that this is an issue that should've been way down the list in terms of issues that VI needed to address if they even needed to at all.  <br />

The main reason for the buff ripper being added was stacking exploits far more severe than WP + COTP.  It was just a causulty of war as this was a true fix for stacking bugs rather than hardcoding a few specific instances.  I'm sure you remember the early issues with C3, circle of seasons, etc... this stuff has been driving verant nuts for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do a LOT of soloing and a LOT of tanking so WP will always be beneficial for me because of the long duration dmg shield.  As for raids, I'll prob stick to CoP just because of stacking issues and the fact that WP gets overwritten so easily.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what VI intended WP to be but I guess IMO it should have been like an aego-type spell for rangers.  On those lines, it should be ATLEAST as good and a little bit better (i.e. the extra atk we get but match the AC).<br />
<br />
I've always tried to get as much AC as I could because I never really believed the AC caps.  I only heard rumors before and didn't have so many people agreeing with it.  Thanks for finally clearing that up in my mind.  Sean says 1050ac?  That's sounds about reasonable.  I would like to see some actual testing results but in the meantime I can live with that.<br />

GG Verant for making WP semi-useful/useless <br />
<br />
The problem has always been that so so so so many buffs could overwrite that nice single buff.  It can really damage our ability to melee if a simple DS is cast on us.  That is wrong.<br />
<br />
I'm sure your numbers are slightly off but tht's not really important.<br />
<br />
CoP and WP were stackable and most of us knew it was an exploit but it was an innocuous one.  It really hurt no one and it was single target benefit (the ranger). The shaman stacking exploit allowed it to be cast on anyone.<br />
<br />
Many used the exploit because they were pissed that verant wouldnt' fix the other stacking issues.  As it said it is cheap logic to have Verant fix something that is self only as a priority fix vs. fixing a stacking issue which really pisses us off (ds overwritting wp).</div></div><hr />

second,<br />
as per sean &quot;Its not hard capped, but it soft caps to a point that AC past X ammount has such diminished returns that its pointless. They said it doesn't hard cap, but does have diminishing returns. &quot;<br />
<br />
sean I think your right about ac however what you leaving out is that the point of diminishing returns &quot;X&quot; tends to vary a bit from mob to mob and vary ALOT from expansion to expansion. ie: just about any place in the old world and 1000ac will let you tank like a beast. Go to luclin and things there will eat you alive. The issue is attack vs ac. Your attack vs the mitigation of the mob.. and your mitigation vs attack of the mob. The attack/mitigation numbers for mobs vary greatly but seem to be bounded within expansions.</div></div><hr />

[B]While Verant couldn't put the time into fixing the stacking bugs between WP and Brellicide, DG, damage shields and Shroud of Hate, I couldn't help but note how many things rogues got fixed for themselves (again):<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep, I noted that too.  Was a bit alarming.<br />
<br />
EVERYONE,<br />
<br />
It isn't really a problem that they fixed the exploit.  All of you stating that we shouldn't complain are right.  But we've been complaining about the problems with other stacking issues for longer then the bug has been known.  These other stacking issues are as much a problem for rangers as the exploit was a benefit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Man, do I get pissed while in the middle of a fight and I have to scream at the mage that did the DS on the group.  I just lost a bunch of buffs, lost a bunch of atk, lost my own DS, and lost HP to boot.  I'm sorry but this should never happen.  No magi low level DS should overwrite my high level ranger buff, PERIOD.<br />
<br />
I DON't HAVE THE TOLERANCE TO TEACH EACH OF THE OTHER CLASSES WHEN AND WHEN NOT TO BUFF ME.<br />
<br />
Ranger's have it bad enough when it comes to reputation.  Now I have to put up with the riducule of my fellow rangers in the guild becuase they attempt to get the other guild members to understand the stacking issues.  For me, this is arbitrary and needs not be there and wouldn't be there if Verant would get their heads out of their asses and address problems instead of just fixing exploits. Sheesh was it so important that they fix self only stacking issues?<br />
<br />
I can't shoot arrows half the time and loose my trueshot most of the time because the guild doesn't care if the mob is in the wall.  I can't get higher ac items and better equipment because most guilds think i'm well enough equipped with my archery and epics, so I go months and months without getting a single upgrade while rogues and warriors have the cream of the crop.  And frankly the players that stand in my way and block my shots are really annoying.  But then again I AM NOT AN ARCHER I AM A RANGER AND MELEE.  ARCHERY IS SECONDARY.<br />
<br />
I didn't play this game for 3 years to have verant dictate that after 3 years I would be resitricted to archery where I just stand there and hit my number &quot;1&quot; key.<br />
<br />
As well,I could care less about offensive spell casting.  Verant seems intent on making a melee class that focuses on non-melee as their primary either via archery or spell casting or pets and it frankly makes absolutely ZERO sense.  They tried it with kunark and seem intent on carrying trhough with it.  I thought they'd gotten their heart set on doing it to the beastlord but it seems they still have their sights set on the ranger class.<br />
<br />
I don't want spell casting upgrades at the expense of my other abilities when they do caster rebalancing and I don't want archery to be my main way of doing damage.  I didn't play that way for 3 years and don't want to play that way now.</div></div><hr />

Who cares if it wasn't what Verant intended originally, does that change the effect it has on us in game?  <br />
<br />
Simple fact of the matter is that some peeps over at Verant have the mentality perhaps that does not see the need for class balancing for raiding purposes.   My concern over this change is the effect it might have on Rangers as a desired class for the high end guilds; guilds that sit down and focus on the hard numbers and what it takes to mow down lvl 60+ mobs.  (Highlight the word might, I dont know)<br />
<br />
As it stands, you only need 1 Ranger to cast group CotP for a whole raid.  What is the desire then to have more than 1 Ranger on a raid if you lessen our damage output to close to that of a warrior?  I do not have a lot of experience in the high end game, and I do not have great insight into how something like an additional 40+ atk will affect my damage dealing (I sense a lot).  What I do know is that if I have two classes with similar damage, but one has much higher defensive skills and hps than the other I dont want the other.  <br />
<br />
Oh oh, yar, the other thing that bothers me:  I dont have class envy, but when it appears (I have been wrong before) that some peeps over at Verant play Rogues and so enhance Rogues?  Well, that just sucks.  :P<br />

But the problem I have with it is, they are both level 60 buffs.   And I always figured that  WP is more of an upgrade to SoN than CoP(CoP is after all a group buff and WP is self only).  And seeing how SoN stacks with CoP, I dont  see why CoP should stack with WP.  <br />
<br />
Even if verant doesnt envision it, they should have stacked in the firstplace.<br />

I never used that stacking exploit.  My attack is normally at 1545 (self buffed) without having to bother with stacking exploits or SK buffs, so I never used either one. *shrugs* <br />
<br />
I really don't care to compare what other classes got or didn't get in this patch either.  A futile endeavor at best that will only end up in frustration.

It is the fact that they took the time to fix something of this nature wihout fixing something that we have been complaining about longer.<br />
<br />
As well, it is a matter of them putting a priority on fixing a self only buff that gives a 6% increase.  This means they have their priorities screwed up if you ask me. <br />
<br />
So they fix a bug giving it a priority and that bug is a fix for a self only 5% or so increase while ignoring a bug that can and will reduce our effectiveness by a greater amount--any DS overwriting WP.<br />
<br />
As well, this isn't just a general stacking issue patch as they spent a great deal of time fixing other areas of the game.<br />

The pet attack assist was to see if a mob is up that rangers can't see on tracking.  Rangers are an outdoor class hence tracking.  Dungeons are a different thing even though tracking works but tracking was not intended as something used to tell the guild if a mob is up, not in a roleplay sense anyway.<br />
<br />
the HP thing was used mostly on pvp servers.  Players would be near death and remove the HP item and die.  But when they die they didn't loose exp.  It saved them experience deaths.  It is sort of like them jumping off a cliff or drowning.  They don't loose exp for dying in those ways.</div></div><hr />

While this &quot;correction&quot; of the stacking issue may not make us all happy, we did NOT get nerfed &quot;to hell.&quot;  We're still a very strong, viable class.  We should not lose sight of all of the good things VI has done for the ranger class.  <br />

Other classes got spells which can be cast on OTHERS which are better than ours.. they enhanced their class with new spells.  Well, not only did we not get a new buff for others but our own personal spells are weaker than previous ones.  How does that make sense?<br />

You can also no longer stack CoE with Warders.  It used to be that you could cast FoN and WP and then cast CoE over FoN to get extra AC.  Now, when you cast CoE it destroys both FoN and WP.  Yippee skippee.<br />

I hope shamans aren't saying the same thing.  I've only seen a few people mention it, but this stacking was about the clearest exploit in the game since the higher level version of the spell, added earlier, did not allow this stacking.<br />

I wish they had fixed the stacking with other buffs and warder's too.  Sucks that they only fixed it half way.  Then again, they left out the overwrite of VoG by HoS, so they should be revisiting that sort of thing.<br />

1) They need to fix stacking issues with WP.  <br />

2) They need to make this a buff we can cast on others.  It is quite silly that all 4 spells that make up Warders can be cast on anyone but Warders itself isn't.  Someone really screwed us on that one.  Needs fixed bad.<br />
<br />
3) Warders could be buffed up slightly to make it more worth while casting over the single buffs.  Other buffs from other classes like this one do so.<br />

This &quot;nerf/fix&quot; affects all the unusual &quot;stacking&quot; that was going on.  They didn't say &quot;OK lets fix HoS/dex/str, and the druid circle spells, and oh ya lets get warders and CoP while were at it&quot;. Its a general change to the way spells stack, and Warders/CoP. Wolfform/FoN, Warders/sheild of spikes, and Avatar/FoN (none of these stacks work now), all got caught in the crossfire as they used the same &quot;technique&quot; to be stacked.  I'd be willing to bet just about every casting class got hit a bit by this general fix.<br />
<br />
As for WP, I do think a slight upgrade would be in order and the stacking issues MUST be fixed. However they didn't review this spell an fix the CoP stacking, it simply got affected in the general change.  Lets hope WP gets a real look in the caster/hybrid balancing.<br />

<br />
And in addition, they really need to make it so that buffs cast by other people DO NOT EVER overwrite a buff I already have on.  Since when do other people get to control the buffs I have on?  If I want their buff, it should be my choice to click off the buff it doesn't stack with.  Buffs overwriting each other was a holdover back from when you couldn't click some beneficial buffs off.<br />
<br />
Fixing these two things (or even just the last one) would solve a lot of problems.  Then I might actually use WP instead of keeping up COTP/SON/COE since I usually need to cast them on the rest of the group anyway.<br />
<br />
At least the WP &amp; COTP stacking (I agree it was an exploit) was a nice bone thrown to rangers for a bit. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally have poor AC and HPs...but my job on raids is NOT getting hit and tanking.  It is dealing damage.  I have the tools to do so (ATK buffs and Aggro Reduction spells) and I will continue to use WP because of it's long lasting time.  And in my guild (rather small) we have one Paladin with Brell's and that's it.  I just wait until he casts it, then click off and put WP up.  It's really not all that difficult.  They (Brell's and WP) last the same time (2.5 hours), therefore I have yet to get WP overwritten more than a couple times when I first got the spell and the Paladin's didn't know any better.   And on raids, the only people getting DSs are the MA / SA / TA.  And THEN they get single target DSs because they do more damage than the group versions.  I rarely do pick up groups with people outside my guild.  Then, if I do, I just request they not cast spell XYZ or whatever and they comply.  It's not difficult to ask someone to not cast a certain buff.  They usually understand.  My AC raid buffed is around 1100.  I self buff to around 1050ish.<br />
<br />
Also, it's easy to NOT get on the Rampage list.  Just wait to start attacking by maybe 1 or 2 seconds after everyone else.  It is my understanding that Rampage list is determined by order of aggro, not most damage done.  So, try to be at the bottom of the Rampage list and you shouldn't get hit by Rampages.  =)<br />
<br />
I'll continue to use this spell as is.  Just means for me that I don't have to pay as much attention to worrying about rebuffing within a certain time frame.  Ah...the pressure of timing my CotP and WP is gone...<br />
<br />
Yes, I am sad at the loss of ATK.<br />
<br />
No, I'm not going to rant and cry over it...it was after all a known exploit.<br />
<br />
I have lots of patience still (Born December 28, 2000).  Maybe I'll lose it, maybe not.  But I won't give up hope that eventually Rangers will get a few more goodies...</div></div><hr />

Maybe they should have done a Griegs end sort of fix, you do that with a 50+ NPC, your pet warps to the targeted NPC, does damage and then you get summoned to your death. <br />
<br />
I wasn't saying allowing them to do it was right.  I'm sure that is why they fixed the bug.<br />
<br />
The problem though is that we aren't indoor trackers because tracking is, well just that, &quot;tracking&quot;.  While I must admit that some tracking indoors is possible it is rare.  I was simply trying to point out that tracking was never, from a roleplay perspective, meant to be a radar.<br />
<br />
Tracking is still an issue for me.  The dialog box is too small, the wording is too small and it is just a pain to scroll the list.<br />
<br />
Heck they could have enhance that and made it more beneficial then fixing an interrupt bug on poison.  Frankly if you are applying poison then you could be interrupted, from a roleplay perspective.  So that was simply a matter of opinion on verant's part, not a necessity, that it had to be fixed.<br />
<br />
As well, I can't see the health of the mob against a dark background with the white lettering.  I really need Verant to fix this so I can see it.  Hundreds of people asked they change it or allow us to alter the color scheme yet they don't.  There are otehr huge errors in the game that they could fix but they don't.<br />
<br />
I think we have a matter of priority here.  Whether a magi could see if a mob is up is not really a big issue, yet the stacking issue for rangers is a big issue, at least to us.</div></div><hr />

No biggy, I'll just go back to the old way.  I like to tank more then I like to shoot a bow.<br />
<br />
But this still doesn't negate that they adjusted this stacking issue for a self only buff while so many other lower level spells can overwrite this one.  And to know they knew about it long before they fixed this buff is one thing but to seemingly arrogantly ignore our posts for months on end and not fix this one is just plain stupidity.</div></div><hr />

You are most correct Dlaritan.  Of all the posts in this thread, this one scores a bulls eye.  They***had*** to have seen all of the stacking issues rangers have complained about so that they could make their stacking changes. :(</div></div><hr />

Originally I was going to flame Verant, Relv and Arkus on this thread, but I patiently waited and read through all 5 pages and I encountered this reply. It sums up everything I could ever want to say about this topic and much more simply and clearly than I could hope to accomplish.</div></div><hr />

FIX THE STACKING ISSUES WITH WP, DAMAGE SHIELDS, ATK DEBUFFS,  AND BRELL'S, ETC..<br />

What good is our wonderbuff if it gets overwritten by every two-bid druid/mage/paly, or SK MOB casting on the group?<br />

BAH, some wonder buff! I'll be sure to buy a tube of lubricant before purchasing EQ2.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elured</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think one of the major problems with rangers being ignored is that we are a hybrid class.  While you can say that it would be boring, or so and so, shamans, enchanters, rogues, warriors and monks, and of course clerics, are where it's at.<br />
<br />
No one else does their job nearly as well.  Monks are the best pullers.  Clerics are the best healers.  Warriors the best tanks.  Rogues do the damage.  Shamans and enchanters slow and haste; shamans buff and enchanters clarity.<br />
<br />
You can make do with another class, but the six classes above each in a group together will breeze past you with your ranger, SK, pally, two druids and necromancer.<br />
<br />
Where it hurts the most is &quot;hybrids&quot;, where we get the least of both worlds.  We can do fair damage...in the right situations, with the right equipment.  Just about any rogue or monk can outdamage us.  We can tank to a degree, but a warrior is usually, if not always, better.  We can cast spells, but in the grand scheme of things they are trifling toys.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that &quot;balance&quot; should mean every class is essential to make a single good group.  But &quot;balance&quot; should mean that hybirds, mages, necros and, strangely enough, wizards, do not sit at the zone-in LFG for an hour or more while the hunting groups search for rogues and monks.<br />
<br />
Those SKs, paladins, wizards and rangers should be able to take the backroom in Velk's, or the TR.  Instead, it's a fight tooth and nail to survive a single combat.  Meanwhile, that group with the warrior, bard and cleric just cleared all the other spawns on the floor and have started pulling from the other levels.</div></div><hr />

Maace said:<br />
why does verant kick rangers in the face while doing nothing to help them, then turn around and devote a whole section of the patch to helping rogs out even more then they already are. rogs already get all the weapons and damage enhancement.<br />
Pal said:<br />
Monks can get fain death fixed asap,Rouges can get thier bugs fixed, blah blah blah but the Ranger usually,and always,get the short end of the stick. Maybe they should make one of the starting items in a Ranger's inventory a Jar of Vasaline.<br />
Bladeth said this amusing little thing:<br />
Is it me or did anyone else notice Monks and Rogues get more powerful as Rangers get the schlong up the arse?<br />
My point was Raogues and Monks get something AGAIN and Rangers get well...nothing again.<br />
Valphoo said<br />
.... yeah rogues have needed those fixes for a while. I pitty those poor bastard. It must suck to be a rogue cause every uber guild needs them. I pity those bastards cause they only do 100-170 DPS. Rogues need a real upgrade. I think maybe adding triple backstab and allowing backstabs with the off hand would be a good start. maybe making the emperor drop a rogue only poker which is 20 damage and 15 delay would be good.? <br />
<br />
<br />
Whee... Such an intelligent bunch of people. Hmm well lets look at what got them so steamed shall we?<br />
<br />
- Increased the velocity tolerance for the Hide skill. This may slightly improve the functionality of the Evade skill<br />
Well a mobs knockback can interupt evade. (it is the hide skill afterall). Rogues dont get channeling. How would you feel if Rangers didnt have channeling and tried to cast Jolt?  Big upgrade? Not likely. Probably affects 1% of all evades. <br />
<br />
Bonus - Rangers with the hide skill get the same benefit. How much benefit I dont know. Will have to test tonight.<br />
<br />
- Poison should no longer be interrupted <br />
Gee - a bug introduced with the previous patch. Poisons work like spells, but Rogues dont channel. Considering how many Rogues actually use poison (they dont stack, they cost a minimum of 3pp a shot, they require uncommon items from all over the planet, poison damage is highly resisted on 40+ mobs) this was SUCH a huge fix OMG!<br />
<br />
- Sneak only breaks when a character is hit, not when he hits someone <br />
This was a fix for Rogues? NOPE. This was a fix for all other classes using Sneak. Rogues could always stay sneaked while attacking. Bonus to Rangers<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing a problem when Pick Pockets was used before Beg had refreshed. Beg and Pick Pocket use the same timer, so now using Beg or Pick Pocket will cause both buttons to gray out <br />
About fricking time. Affects Bards as well. Nothing better than having your entire screen lock up mid fight. This was supposed to be fixed last patch, but guess what? It wasnt. <br />
<br />
- A message is now displayed and skills are properly reset when a rogue breaks sneak and/or hide because he is looting a corpse <br />
Actually a Nerf for Rogues. Wow. Rogues got nerfed. You didnt realise that Rogues could ninja corpses and stay sneaked/hidden did you. It wasnt reliable but it could be done.<br />
<br />
Oh and the last thing. Invis breaking when trading with NPCs. OMG another NERF. To Rogues no less! <br />
<br />
<br />
So. All this whining about Rogues getting hooked up, when the tally really stands at:<br />
2 bug fixes, 2 nerfs, 1 minor improvement.  - and two of the changes are probably beneficial to Rangers.  <br />
<br />
Talk about overreaction...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevastian01</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my personal take on the situation. When i first got Warders, i knew it sucked. It was totally out of sync with other classes level 60 spells. I voiced minor complaints, but didnt really care too much, because the other spells could be stacked. Was it an exploit? Sure. Should it have been fixed? Yes. BUT, now since i can't stack them, I am left with a very limited spell, that still has major stacking issues. The spell needs to be something i want to use ALL the time. Paladins want to use Brells all the time right? Why should my level 60 buff be situational? <br />
<br />
What i think warders should be:<br />
150 HP/70 Attack/30 AC/<br />
Remove the damage shield component(yes i know its one of the best parts, but read on)<br />
This spell should not stack with Strength of nature, Call of earth, or CoP. BUT it should stack with everything else, including Divine Strength, and it should remain self only. Thats NOT overpowered. That is something i would use all the time. That is in sync with other Luclin level 60 spells. <br />
I really hope someone at verant takes the time to pour through this thread.</div></div><hr />

how can you say that blade? we sow and snare, and monks and rogues can't do that!  why would we even need luclin armor or weapons? we got stuff in velious!  /sarcasm off<br />

Good to see them continuing to fix bugs.  Kudos as well to all the other classes who got some needed fixes and/or improvements in this patch.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad the exploit was fixed. <br />
I'd rather do things the proper way than not do them at all.<br />
<br />
But hey that's my two cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriana</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, I don't think them being able to stack was an exploit.  As far as I know, that is how the spells were supposed to work.  <br />
<br />
How on earth was I supposed to know it was an exploit if they worked like that from day one?<br />
<br />
Second, I didn't even realize that WP gave 70 atk till I looked it up just now.   CoP gives 40.  WP gives 30 more.  Now that I realize that, I don't mind them not stacking - though I wish they still would.<br />
<br />
But please don't call it an exploit.  That means that I knew the spells were not supposed to stack and was doing it anyway - which was NOT the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As mentioned above, this also was an issue for bards.<br />
It's been in the game since the game came out, and it was a bug that caused a crash. It's not a &quot;rogues are special&quot; bug fix, it's one that's been a geniune problem for a very long time. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of you folks who are complaining about WP...<br />
<br />
Thpppppft. :P<br />
<br />
Try valium.<br />
<br />
Better yet, try being a level 60 ranger who doesn't spend all thier time in raids or with c2 or c3. <br />
<br />
Also, Harness of spirit... uh... it's supposed to be a lesser version of focus of spirit. Str and Dex don't stack with Focus of Spirit either, why should they stack with the lesser version of it?<br />
<br />
And to those of you who couldn't see that WP and CoP was an exploit, I guess I'll put it in simpler terms...<br />
If you have to cast in a certain order and let spells overwrite each other to get it so you can have them, they're not supposed to stack. Shocking, yes, I know, but that's the way it's always been.</div></div><hr />

Talk about overreaction... <br />
<br />
You don't need channeling so any argument about channeling and those lines are irrelevant.<br />
<br />
The idea is that there are other bigger bugs that need to be quashed and they spent alot of time fixing stacking and rogues and ignored fixing these bugs.<br />
<br />
I'm a big miffed that they would keep putting time into a class fixing small issues, and these are small issues as none of them have been of such a nature as to affect rogue performance in any major way.  This is easily proven by the fact that the rogue is overwhelming in their ability to outperofrm the other melee classes.<br />
<br />
Rogue poison frankly should be interrupted.  It should not be instantaneious.  In a roleplay sense you would take a risk of being discovered while attempting the task.  That's just a comment froma roleplay perspective.  I think it was a decision made on an opinion.<br />
<br />
What bothers me about that decision is that there are so many other problems in teh game of signfificant import and they are of the opinion that rogue poison and evade needs to be improved.</div></div><hr />
