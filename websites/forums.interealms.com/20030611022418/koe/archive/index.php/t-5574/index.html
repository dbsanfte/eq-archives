<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All I can say after downloading and trying the Demo out (Pre-patched version)...WOW<br />
<br />
For those who don't have a clue what this game is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westwood.com&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; and go to Command and Conquer: Renegade.<br />
<br />
Basically, Renegade is based on the Command and Conquer world, but instead of you being the &quot;Overseer&quot; or &quot;Commander&quot; of the game, they throw you right down to the unit level.  Much like missions in Counterstrike similar games.  C&amp;C fans that like first person shooters will drool all over this game.<br />
<br />
In the C&amp;C mode (Which is the only mode you can play in this demo) your mission is to take out the enemy base by any means necessary, much like an original C&amp;C game, but this time it's in the First person :)<br />
<br />
You have the option to buy vehicle units, drive them around and fire them, as well as being an infantry units.  They even preserved the major weapons from the game as well.  Ion Cannons and Nuclear beacons are in game, when they go off, you should see the show :)<br />
<br />
Oh and this is in the game too ;)<br />

<br />
Anyway, this game is going to be HUGE when it hits shelves.  Plus you don't need fancy specs to run it either.  I'd suggest downloading the Demo using a file sharing program like Kazaa or something else if you want to try it out though.  Last time I checked, Fileplanet.com was up to 300+ minutes wait time just to get in line to download it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thumbs up here, anyone else try this yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seran Swiftstrike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It has the potential to be fun if they fix the absolutely horrific netcode.  The few times I've been able to play a reasonable length of time without lagging all over the place, I've had fun.  The vehicles are really good.  The infantry combat could use some work, though.</div></div><hr />
