<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would anyone be able to suggest a good secondary item? Preferably a shield, for the AC. Currently im using a sarnak battle shield 25 ac 5 str 5 sta 40 hp 10 sv fire cold and magic. I was looking into a braced bone buckler to camp with a few of my friends(25 ac 10 str 10 wis 55 hp 55 mana) however the stretched fungus hide shield looked good to me too: 32 ac 15 sta 10 wis and sv disease. I am very low on poison and disease resists and would like to have some gear with those stats on them on my normal gear rather then only in my resist set. Any other suggestions rather then those? Thanks in advance <br />
:D :cool: <br />

PS Im a 57 barb with jbb and no epic, and cash is a little limited atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oddly enough, the SBS is not a bad choice till you can save up the money for something big.<br />
<br />
BBB is good too - prolly would choose it over a SoBW.<br />
<br />
I personally use an Orb of Infinite Void... but I considered a Lodizal shield too.  I decided to drop my Hiero cloak and use the Lodizal on my back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Might as well just save money for spells... /Sigh, Its gonna take forever for me to get them, if at all. /rude verant need to increase drop rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm carrying a Bone Braced Buckler now.  Nice, rough look to it, far more appropriate than a SBS--which is now in my resist gear.  Looking for a Lodizal Shell Shield for my back =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what about a skull marked shield? they are inexpensive on bristlebane which is why i suggest it and theyre not exactly crappy:<br />
<br />
+22 AC +7 Wis +50 HP +50 Mana<br />
<br />
From UP. It looks like a plain old wooden shield tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suggest you go do the Summoning Beasties quest in FG and try to get the Stretched Fungushide Shield.  The stats are very nice. <br />
<br />
I was there recently with my guild and saw 2 of them drop in 8 hours.  Who knows, you might get lucky and see a Fungi Vest drop, and there are a few other nice items that can drop as well, including a decent 1HB, Focus Staff.<br />
<br />
Save your money, go to Fungus Grove!!!  The quest can be done with a balance group lv. 55-60, or two groups level 50-55.  Besides the possibility of saving pp and getting the drop, the quest is something fun and different.<br />
