<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well Ive been AFK since shortly after pop was released :)  62 Shaman Most of my 62 Spells no Pox... Iksar.... Whats new in EQ?  I know about the LOY Expansion although not much any fun zones for a shaman?  Just curious if any major thingsg  have changed while I was gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">- Armor dyes, DAoC style;<br />
- Big lizards mounts;<br />
- New inventory slot: Charms. Them charms have 'dynamic' stats whose values depends on individual factors (i.e. player wealth, weapons skills, stats, time of the day, number of players in the zone or group, number of PoP zone flag earned, etc);<br />
- sub-50 version of Torpor, Stoicism;<br />
- early-50 group Disinfecting Aura, Blood of Nadox;<br />
- Bunches of quest fixed, bunches still broken;<br />
- New tradeskills recipes;<br />
- Group Exp upped, PoP zone ZEM lowered;<br />
- All of PoP's Tier 2 zones and half of the Tier 3 zones flag requierment lifted (with level restrictions);<br />
- Spell quest drops somewhat rebalanced;<br />
- Useless Gindan spells replaced by Tiny Terror (group Shrink) and Talisman of Alacrity (group Celerity). They're still mostly useless, mind you... group shrink can't be casted out of group and ToAlacrity is 10% slower than the store-bougth Switch like the Wind;<br />
- Useless Diaku spell line side-graded from a STR buff not stacking with Focus to a STR/DEX buff not stacking with Degeneration;<br />
- Shamans high level spells still gimpy in duration, effects or both compared to other casters or even hybrids;<br />
- DOTs now give you damage updates every ticks;<br />
- Dark Blue range at 65 extended down to level 50. Light Blue range extended down to level 45. I.e, you're not stuck in PoP anymore if you're level 61+;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Theres a new server as well, named stromm. They didn't allow transfers so it is basically a rat race to 65/uberness. Some high level guild all started over there and already are killing High end Velious content as well as some luclin bosses.</div></div><hr />
