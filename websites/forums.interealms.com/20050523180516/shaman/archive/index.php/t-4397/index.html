<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Building a new comp and already have the OS win xp.. Is it true once you register it on 1 comp you cant fire it up and run it on a new comp? What bunk is this? Really dont want to fork over another 90$ for an OS i already have eheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need to find the corporate version online.<br />
<br />
But frankly, win2k runs EQ better than xp.  Especially if you want to run EQ Windows.<br />
<br />
XP is still a pile of trash OS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, that's true what you heard.  Not only that but if you had to format you couldn't re-activate it because it had been activated previously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you reinstall XP, you just have to re-activate it..<br />
<br />
Its not a &quot;one time install&quot;<br />
lol</div></div><hr />

Actually I have no problems running 2 EQW windows, not that I would ever use such an evil application or anything :o<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just biased because I helped code XP though :p</div></div><hr />

Most of the people I play with all switch from using xp because it is a resource hog compared to win2k.  That and you guys did something to the socket configuration that makes it WAY more sensitive to crappy internet connections.  The XP boxes ALWAYS go ld in a lag spike while win2k boxes keep on trucking.<br />
<br />
Its pretty funny, one of our members is still using xp because he is too lazy to reinstall.  He can't hit the Z key because he remapped it to be the task switch button (the whole alt+tab xp thing in eq windows).  He is always asking for people in guild who have names that start with Z to send him a tell so he can respond.<br />
<br />
XP = pretty.  XP != stable.  Yet.<br />
<br />
Just like any other Microsoft product.  Wait a couple years and its worth using :P<br />
<br />
P.S.  See if you can get your buddies to unscrewup the battlecom code.  That product was great until they got a hold of it.  We still use BCOM to communicate, tried Gamevoice? and it just doesn't work half as well.</div></div><hr />
