<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This actually started at level 37, but, whatever.  I went to Gunthak after searching the levels on Alla's and Gunthak looked about right.  Boy, was it right on the money.  First off, I don't have CanII, but usually don't play without KEI, so no biggie.  My equipment is decent, IMO, but not uber by any means.<br />

I ran over to the beach and tried a few spots.  A lot of mobs here are undead, but very low agro radius, so there are plenty of spot to chose from.  I get about 1.5% xp per kill at 37, and still get nearly 1% at 44, though some stuff is light blue to me now.  Mobs here rarely resist Slow, but often resist our DoTs.  Once I hit 40 and my soulstripper began to proc, I can chain pull pretty much nonstop.  However, using my Staff of Living Sand / Blight, Hammer of Scourge swap combo for procing is super sweet here, too.<br />
<br />
Also at 40 heading towards the &quot;shrine&quot; or &quot;castle&quot; area in gunthak is a large area filled with shrooms and drogmoors.  Along the right hand wall is a pretty safe spot, but some of the pulls can be difficult.  I wouldn't recommend it prior to level 40, but the xp is still nice, but the loot kinda sucks except for the occassional mushroom (potion) that will drop that is a one charge Fortitude or Clarity or someothereffect.  They are lore so ya can't farm them either.  I've also tried the two &quot;town&quot; areas but the pulls are difficult and the mobs are much harder for the same amount of xp. (though some will rarely drop fire emeralds, etc.).  Don't fight the augur's or mystics near the towns, they are risky and not worth the effort.  Don't fight the luggalds because most of them are chanters.  I'm about to ding 45 and will start exploring some spots in Dulak to solo . . . I hope.<br />
<br />
OK.  Spent some time in Dulaks last night solo.  A decent spot is to follow along the right wall until you get to the first dock, in the corner.  Pretty safe spot to pull to.  At level 45 now, I can take the troll fisherman and the three dock spawns, as well as, a wandering guard or two before the fisherman repops nearby.  He's kinda close, but still plenty of room.  All these guys are blue to me, even the iksar dock guardian I pulled; however, the dock guardian was twice as tough as the rest, if not moreso.  But, I did get a whopping 3% xp for killing him.  Getting 1% on all the rest and they drop decent plat and got one star ruby in about 2 hours.  I only managed to pull one drunken pirate (trying for the flask for the stoicism quest) because I wasn't brave enough to pull them from the houses at my level.  If you keep the boat scrubbers on the dock clear, you also have a chance of spawning Vurag, and he can rarely drop a decent haste item.  Looks like I'll be back here for a few days or so until I can manage to get my flask, at least.</div></div><hr />
