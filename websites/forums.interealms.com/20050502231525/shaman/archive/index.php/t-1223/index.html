<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I mean, we are supposed to be the healers of our respective races, right? So, if the healers of all the other classes can rez, why not shamen? Just curious. <br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Resurrection is a western religious concept that primitive peoples would have nothing to do with, even if it were offered.  Why would they want to forcibly recall a spirit from the next world?  What if the spirit didn't want to return?  Spirits belong in the spirit world, in their worldview, and it's inappropriate to tinker with the will of the gods in this way.<br />
<br />
That's the /roleplay reason.  The real reason: because it would unbalance the game.  You can put whatever conceptual interpretation on our class that you want, but in the end if the class is unbalanced, it's not gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Expecting any story-based explanation for anything in EQ is futile. We can't rez because we get to do so much other cool stuff, and wanting to rez would be greedy.<br />
<br />
If you really really want some kind of reason, then even 5 minutes should be enough to come up with something better than the EQ writers could. F'rinstance, take a look at the shaman races; we're all tough mofos who have cultures that do not believe in coddling the weak. We're the types who leave babies out in the cold to see if they have the strength to survive. Why do we need resurrection, when a glorious afterlife is the reward for a brave life?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't want a rez. Rez is a bane not a blessing. However I don't see any unbalancing issues by giving druids and shammys rez tho. We don't get better at soloing. And we can't replace Clerics cause they have better heals and better rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A weaker version of healer res perhaps.  He can't steal all their glory.  But I believe it would have to be defined in a different way than a healers res.  Perhaps by making it more dangerous to use.  For example, the shaman would have to sit down by the corpse and lose body control till the res was completed, leaving himself open to attack.   I loved playing a shaman and I like helping people, so anything to be able to help my fellow players would be apreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Angelok Wolvenspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thats called Reincarnation .. the rez the AD&amp;D Druids get .. I wonder who ever said yes against a rez like that. :)  Can be fun tho .. mostly for your fellow players .. who you need to help get up on their chair when you rolled up your new race .. and now you are a Sathir Thief .. try move silent .. with those nice horsie feet ... ROFL     Or some other options that are hilarious .. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway .. I dont think the 'primitive' races should have a Rez able class .. I kinda agree with the 'survival of the fittest' idea and a glories afterlife.  (Like Stovokor (sp ?) of the Klingons, or Walhala of the Vikings).<br />
<br />
Would be fun to have a 25% exp rez with temp illusion effect of a random animal in the zone .. lasts like 15 minutes or sumptin .. but I cant see a real roleplay like explenation for it tho .. soo I doubt this will EVER be implemented in the game. :)<br />

That would be a totally sweet concept for EQ2: KARMA. Based on your past behavior, your death penalty is to be reincarnated as an NPC for a few minutes. If you are evil you come back as a spider or moss snake to be pummelled by newbies of your own race.</div></div><hr />

Possibly I'm missing something of use there... but it seems like a pretty questionable use of AA points for shaman -- hell for all the healers.  Those skills suck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Clerics have one spell.  One spell that gives them any use to anyone and thus makes them required to do the hard fights. That is Complete Heal.  Because of this one spell and the way it skews the game, clerics have nothing else.<br />
<br />
Clerics pay the price for this one spell very dearly.<br />
<br />
Clerics can not invis nor do clerics get any items specifically for them that is a clicky invis.  Mask from Sebilis (which is all/all) is the only item.  Warriors have a bp and legs.  Heck rogues can get a cloak that casts invis! /boggle<br />
<br />
Paladins and Necros can rez people.  There is no market to be monopolized by clerics. <br />
<br />
Paladins, Necros, Shaman and Druids can heal over time people.  Though I will admit clerics are superior in that field.<br />
<br />
Paladins and Necros can group heal.  Though I will admit clerics are superior in that field.<br />
<br />
BUT when it all comes down to it, when and why do you need a cleric? Certainly not safe exp grinding at 60 for AA points.  60 warriors can solo happily without a cleric.  Groups can grind easily without a cleric, with a paly or shaman or druid to heal.  <br />
<br />
I personally sat in Velks yesterday and shouted for 30 minutes for a group.  Know what happened? I had a body dropped in my lap instead of a group offer.  I rez'd the monk and off he went back to duo'ing with a warrior.<br />
<br />
Clerics are quickly reduced to bots.  I personally have taken the character I have grown to love and turned to a 2nd pc with a warrior to duo with.  Or group with another duo pair of Shaman and Rogue. <br />
<br />
Unless the group is pushing its limits somewhere, there is no need for a cleric.  Its simply nice to have one around available to rez.   Uber fights clerics are reduced to CH chain monkeys but there is no need for them up till that one fight.<br />
<br />
So Shaman are welcome to having a Rez in my opinion.  Its not going to dilute an already unbalanced class.  That has already been done quite throughly.<br />
<br />
But, be careful what you wish for, rez is more of a curse then blessing.</div></div><hr />

Too bad you can't play with me. If I didn't already have a cleric, I would have snapped you up fast. I like the safety of the best heals and the insurance of the best rez. I'm not l337, and I don't care.<br />
<br />
Though I would like to get Reanimation at some point. It can come in handy despite the lack of exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why the hell is res &quot;unbalancing&quot;? <br />
<br />
 &quot;I do not think that word means what you think it means&quot;<br />
<br />
It wouldn't unbalance the shaman class in the slightest if we had a 95% res.  What it WOULD do is eliminate a time sink and make death much less painful due to the mass amount of ressurection capable classes in the game.  Getting a res would be much easier.  That's no unbalancing, that's just convienence and EQ is not about convienence, it's about making you play for as much time as possible and accomplishing as little as possible so you have to play again tomorrow.  In fact i think that's the first words on the everquest design documents.<br />
<br />
<br />
There flat out is no roleplay reason for shaman to not have resurect by all means they should have it from a roleplay perspective, though it should be harder to accoplish and have a margin of error.  Evidently the evil races are all supposed to look towards the dark elves for resurections.  And what about the iksar?  No roleplay reason exists, which further enforces my theory that verant didn't have the skill to make this a roleplaying game from day one.  They looked at ALL the classes and races as a whole rather than looking at each in and of itself.  So from day one trolls were expected to be grouping with high elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Maybe we should get better heal instead.  Or gates.  Damn I would sooooo love gates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only Cle and Pally will get res until we have more timesinks to make up for it. Necro res has a built in timesink.<br />
<br />
Shamen don't need res spell, but res potion would be cool with res effect being also monster summoning illusion.  You get res, and stay a random mob illusion till efffect wears off. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely true, but since we know that the EQ designers are all some kind of wierd fetishists when it comes to making things as painful as possible, we know it's never ever ever going to happen.<br />
<br />
Given my timezone, when I play there are at most 20 clerics in the entire game capable of getting to the zones with my corpse, and they usually have better things to do. I've eaten more unrezzed deaths than I care to count, because if you're off the beaten path (either in game zone or by virtue of living outside the U.S.) they are effectively unobtainable.<br />
<br />
But VI will never fix it. As we know all too well, they just don't give a damn. Hence the &quot;only the strong survive&quot; approach, since we have no alternative but to suck it up and get on with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
On the other hand, maybe there are so many bot clerics out there precisely because of rez. Once you hit 54th lvl, it's kinda painful to do anything interesting w/o a rez handy. You either do something safe and boring, or end up bugging someone for a rez if things go wrong. SInce I  hate to bug strangers (or friends if I die in a really outta the way place and can't get a convenient rez), odds are we won't do anything close to pushing the limits. <br />
<br />
What if there where 90% rez potions available for 300p? Either shaman made or sold by a vendor. What if druids and shaman got a spell to summon someone to their corpse and extend the rez timer to 24 hours online, or a spell just to extend the rez timer? <br />
<br />
I don't see where any of those would impact a clerics ability to get a group, I'd argue that it might even help because fewer people would be dragging along bot clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I vote YES for winged courier and NO to rezzes for shaman!<br />
<br />
Clreic is a tough class to play, no utility spells, hard to find groupage until 34 (druids and shaman heal nearly as well WITH snare and sow to offer a group).  Boring play, med, heal, med heal, med heal, buff, med....Absolutely needed by guilds at the high level, suffer from burnout, victims of their own sense of responsibility (in my experience, Ive had several high level cleric friends burn out, leave the game, or change mains).<br />
<br />
Let them have rez! I'll keep slow, sow, invis, acumen, SoW, alchemy, lev, dots, stat buffs, malo line...<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want to play a cleric, it looks like the most dull job on Norrath, let's keep our current clerics HAPPY so we dont have to start botting clerics at every raid and can keep playing our fun shaman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If VI put save points in the game so that when you die you only lose exp from the last save and if they let your gear stay with you upon death they wouldn't need to give everyone Rez.<br />
<br />
You would lessen the load on Clerics who will only  be called to Rez those with a lot of experience since their last save, not those who died because they went LD, fell for 10,000 damage or died to a train while traveling.<br />
<br />
Give everyone a &quot;call to corpse ability&quot; so they can get back to their group if they still want to play or they can just stay where they are, no more losing stuff due to corpse decay or deadly CR's. <br />
<br />
I spent a few weeks playing AO and this set-up  was one of the few redeeming qualities that game had. I was not afraid to explore for fear I would waste a whole night looking for a Rez or a whole month or more of exp. When you play a few hours a day one death equals a months work sometimes.<br />

3 hours a day is a few hours.<br />

No res thanks. Class lines are blurred enough as it is. <br />
<br />
I dare you to find ONE thing in the Kunark, Velious or Luclin expansion that shaman acquired from another class that was fundamentally different from anything a shaman could before.<br />
<br />
- Did we suddenly acquired the capacity to cast DOTs? Nope, that was the Clerics and the Mages? <br />
<br />
- Did we wake up one day with the new ability to stacks DOTs of the same line together? Nope, that was the druids. Gained powerful Fire based spells? Nope, again it was the Druids who suddenly could cast Cold DDs better than us. How about AC and resist debuffs? Nope... Druids again. Man, did they get 'rounded' in the last expansions. Won't even comment on the fact some of them thought they still needed to petition for more.<br />
<br />
- Did we overnight became able to have free (both of mana and component) Avatar on us whenever we melee? Nope... that, that was everyone and their cousins once someone figured out about ST and started farming primal velium weapons. What really burn me on this one is that they had a cool, underused 'Primal Essense' effect in the database already... couldn't they have figured to use that one instead? Instead we got that whole mess with Avatar and Primal Avatar.<br />
<br />
Heh.... we got bearform. That was fundamentally new. Of course, nobody had bearform before. Druids had wolfform, 'chanters could have been renamed shape-shifter and nobody would have blinked and, again, anyone with a pre-nerf Mask could be a DE.<br />
<br />
It's not that I agree with with the idea we *need* a rez spell (I don't, really... would be useful, probably not unbalancing but in the end it wouldn't be worth the aggravation, both from the clerics feeling slighted and the folks hounding you for a better than 75% rez). Nor do I disagree with the idea of keeping the class more or less unique. It's just that, for once and before everyone aggree to stop doing that kind of thing, I wouldn't mind being on the pilfering side rather than the pilfered. <br />
<br />
N.B.: The idea of a rez potion WOULD be cool, but you know they would just mess up with the implementation (rare drop as a component, 2K+ price on the herbs, 75% failure with 180 skill, etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was the only thing I really appreciated with AO, the ability to walk up to an Insurance Terminal, insert some creds and make a backup of your current level. I played AO with a MetaPhysicist after the game first came out and I finally gave the came up at lv127. The terminals were great at first because as a newbie, they're all over the place. But as your character grows, the better hunting spots and missions start to move further away from cities and outposts. <br />
<br />
Now here is where is starts to get real annoying. Our group is hunting with several others groups and all of us are camping Cyborgs. Halfway in a fight one of our team mates says &quot;flying to the outpost to save, brb&quot;. This happens all the time. Nobody likes to risk several hours worth of XP earned. They'll run off every 15 minutes to save their XP. Get's pretty annoying because now out team is making less XP and dishing out less damage. One time 5 of my team mates jetted off to visit the Insurance Terminals while camping with several groups ata a cyborg camp. The loss of firepower was deadly because somebody pulled several cyborgs and it was enough to get several other parties wiped. There were bodies everywhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like something &quot;fun&quot; and twisted though.  I've seen lots of ideas on the net.<br />
<br />
1) Animal Only Rez ((IE: Wolf/Bear formed pcs))<br />
<br />
2) Reincaration Spell that brought someone back in non-clickable off illusion.  Without XP regain, but also without burning rez timer.<br />
<br />
3) a Rez Timer extender ((shaman holding spirit close, druid maybe holding the body from decay))<br />
<br />
4) Rez Potions <br />
<br />
Basically trick would be find something limited (but useful) and fun, without being too clericy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Maybe not a full on rez<br />
<br />
Maybe the shaman could chant over the corpse/speak to the spirit world of the fallen comrade and gain them a little exp back or something (and i mean a little) without actually rezzing em on the spot, would still have to retrieve corpse and stuff?<br />
<br />
We are meant to be in touch with the spirits, but mostly I see none of it...<br />

<br />
Hmmm? Poison DDs? What are you thinking? If my Cold DD are resisted, I have Poison DDs, Poison Rains, Poison DOTs, Disease DOTs and Magic DOTs (through the Epic). Are you trying to teach this old chimp how to make faces? You seems to have widely missed my point, snapdragon. I don't want Fire DD. Between our DOTs, our Epic and our DDs, we can attack on 4 of the 5 resists. The number of MOBs that are open ONLY to Fire and immune to all 4 others is insigificant. We really don't need Fire DDs. <br />
<br />
To spell it out, my point was simply that, to the question &quot;Why can't ClassX do Y&quot;, the answer &quot;because it would blur class lines&quot; has never stopped Verant where other classes were concerned and that it would really sucks if it boiled down to THAT for shaman and rez.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I did.  We got our Poison DD in Velious. <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to let you in on some big secret, or get into an arguement, or even defend VI for the way they have done things in the past.<br />
<br />
I don't want Fire DD. Between our DOTs, our Epic and our DDs, we can attack on 4 of the 5 resists. The number of MOBs that are open ONLY to Fire and immune to all 4 others is insigificant. We really don't need Fire DDs. <br />
<br />
<br />
:confused: Umm...ok.  /shrug.  Go back in my post and point out where I mentioned Fire DDs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
To spell it out, my point was simply that, to the question &quot;Why can't ClassX do Y&quot;, the answer &quot;because it would blur class lines&quot; has never stopped Verant where other classes were concerned and that it would really sucks if it boiled down to THAT for shaman and rez.<br />
<br />
I went back and looked at your earlier post...with all the stuff about druids and clerics, etc.  I really cant see how anything you posted is really &quot;blurring the class lines&quot;.  I'm not bored enough to look through each point (and I'm not trying to get in an argument either) but are you really complaing about the Magicians getting a SINGLE DoT spell at lvl 44? <br />
<br />
The only point of my post (all 3 lines of it) was to semi-sarcastically point out that Shamans now have these cool and mana-inefficient Poison DDs to use if we don't feel like hitting the mob with a Blizzard Blast.<br />
<br />

You simply aren't NEEDED here!  Go to a more challenging dungeon, you'll have more fun, get better lewt, and be far more appreciated than if you were exp grinding in velkewhore's, charging up the old CH button every ten minutes.  in my experience, one shaman is enuf for total group support in velks.  You just dont need anyone else for support.  You got all yer best buffs like str and speed and acumen and regrowth, you got slows for dmg reduction, you got roots for control, you  got heals for when someone gets injured . . . all that's needed is more damage (and spiders usually).  <br />
<br />
Velks is the armpit of dungeons.  I can't respect you if you exp here unless yer doin tents or pits or maybe broodmaster/mom.   Yer setting yerself up to be a gimp ass player, who knows nothing so well as how to /petition for &quot;KSing&quot; and whine loudly in /ooc and /shout about whoever stole yer pull or camp.  Meanwhile those of us with brains and ambition are going to chardok, sebilis, Howling Stones (uber exp and lewt), Akheva, and Siren's Grotto.  If yer truly uber, you'll go to Cazic Thule to hunt, where the risks are great, the exp is the best in game, and the rewards can resell upwards of 100kpp (hello FT3 booties?).  <br />
<br />
I get on average about 3 requests to go to CT a day of playing.  It's still the best exp in game, as long as you don't gimp the group by adding druid/wiz to it.  Cleric is a must, so is enchanter or bard, so is shaman for the most part, tho i admit we CAN be replaced by another chanter or something.  Warrior is also a must, unless you have a kick ass pally or SK to replace.  The rest should be damage dealers in order of desirability 1) rogue 2) monk 3) necro, 4) ranger, 5) mage. <br />
<br />
A truly uber wizard or druid can be added and you'll do fine, but you simply won't do as well as with a true damage dealer.  <br />
<br />
You really don't want to add any more casters than are necessary tho, it hurts your chances at FT3 boots.  <br />
<br />
Exp?  Best I've seen was a yellow and a half per hour of AAexp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Sorry, snapdragon, given that we both had DDs before and were a poison oriented class (with both with Poison Rains and Poison DOTs), I didn't understand that you were throwing the Poison DDs as an example of a new, fundamentaly different ability we got with the expansions. Blame it on the 'writing-before-coffee' syndrome *grin*<br />
<br />
So, rather than going widely off on a tangent like I did before, let me re-iterate: Poison DDs, to a Shaman with a line of each Poison DOTs, Poison Rain and Cold DD spells, are not fundamentally new or different. Same as the Druid spell 'Mask of the Hunter', while different from spells they had before, is not a fundamentally different spell for them. <br />
<br />
And as opposed to Ro's Fiery Sundering or Smoldering Disjunction which added a completly new, very cool (and very needed) dimension to their abilities by giving them a debuff capacity.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen anything that fundamentally different added to the shaman line-up in a really long time (if ever). So, given all those new abilities classes have received over the years, a lot of them in areas overlapping with shamans' abilities, it would be a shame if the best that somebody would come off as a reason against a rez spell would be 'because it would blur class lines'. <br />
<br />
Especially when there is so many BETTER reasons not to as well as so many possible alternatives.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Errmm....I assume you are referring to the lvl 60 aaxp crowd here. Fighting as a single shaman doing heals/buffs/slows/crowd control with a bunch of melees in a mid 50s group can get pretty marginal most of the time (unless mobs are like hen's teeth due to the number of level 60s doing aaxp ;) ).<br />
<br />
The main problem with Velks, as far as I've been able to see, is the number of people doing aaxp generally far exceeds the spawn rate in the place. If the spiders were light blue to level 60, the spider partof the zone would be largely empty, or perhaps the sub-60 crowd would start going there again with a reasonable expectation of actually finding a group or mobs to hunt :) <br />
<br />
From my obervation healers and crowd control people generally have no trouble finding groups there (particularly clerics and chanters). If there was really no need for them you would think that groups would choose PCs with damage output in their place, but that simply doesnt happen [In other words, you're smoking something ;) ]</div></div><hr />

Winged Courier<br />
Courier goes out and finds the spirit of the person's corpse you cast it on and asks them if they wish to return (box)<br />
<br />
When cast brings spirit back to a body. No exp loss/gain. Just summon person to the body. <br />
<br />
It differs from res spells because it doesnt effect the timer on the body.<br />
<br />

Winged Courier was meant to carry an item to the targeted player but never worked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I was grouped with a cleric in Velks once.  Group was having a difficult time before we picked him up.  Ah, maybe it's because I'm 'only' level 53 and between the resists on slows, etc., plus my inferior mana regen abilities (no canni4/5 here folks!) I was running out of mana to heal the monk and warrior in the group while handling the slows.<br />
<br />
See, I'm not level 60 yet with malo, torpor, 30 aaxp points, the title &quot;Oracle&quot; in my oversized sig and I'm not in a guild with nToV equipped monks.  So some places like FG/Velks are actually challenging for me still.  Even on the 1st floor /gasp.  I promise to do my best and not be a gimp when I reach 60 though and hit those uber lewt dungeons like Landradoran recommends.  After all, your opinion means everything in the world to me.  I base my entire existence on it.<br />
<br />
I'll always be glad to have a cleric in my group and other classes are always welcome as well.  For no other reason that I hate being viewed as a masochistic ass who thinks my class is the greatest thing since sliced bread.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I still lfg in KC too - guess I won't be impressing anyone with my class bashing posts on Shaman's Crucible.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  As far as whether we should have rez capability or not.  I wouldn't mind reanimation, myself, or even better - a specific shaman or shm/dru only &quot;call to corpse&quot; type spell that has been suggested already by a couple posters.  I don't think we should ever get an exp rez though.  We have so many great abilities as it is.<br />
