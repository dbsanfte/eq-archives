<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would appreciate tips on this. Assume I am naked and will be buying everything, but easy nodrop and quest items would be fine. <br />
<br />
I want to max Wis for trade skills.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wis is overrated.  You're not a druid.  Once you're at 150 or so wis, shift your stat priorities on gear to that of a warrior (while keeping your wis at 150 or whatever you're comfortable with).  <br />
<br />
HP&gt;AC&gt;Wis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">youll find yourself having a problem with regaining mana if you goo too high. i'm running at around 180 wis and doing just fine!<br />
<br />
Gwain is right, the more HP you get the faster you regain mana, the easier it is to get FoM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Testament of Vanear quest?  I did that once :p<br />
<br />
Kylong gaunts +4wis, 400pp or less.<br />
Brown Chitin Leggings +5wis, 1.5k.<br />
Chitinous Belt +5wis, 1k or less.<br />
Sentry Bracer +2wis?, 300pp.<br />
Buncha new +wis earrings in bazaar for 300ppish.<br />
Skyiron Cudgel of the Arisen free and no group required!!<br />
Also, lots of player made stuff like Acryilia and Arctic Wyvern armor that has +wis for a few hundred pp per piece.<br />
<br />
It is prolly the CHEAPEST time ever to throw a shaman character together and still have good mid-level gear.  Go to the bazaar and just browse. :)</div></div><hr />

Do the Shield of Bane Warding. It's a nice shield for a shm and has 20wis. The quest will take some time but it's a pretty good one and you won't have to hold a dolly even for tradeskilling :). Since you're a tradeskiller, you might want to look into doing the Coldain shawls. You can get up to the 4 wis one pretty easily. That will get you some wis for the shoulder and range slot.</div></div><hr />

Under profiles there's &quot;wisdom shammy&quot;. that's my pottery outfit. You'll notice the epic is swapped out to make room for my pottery geerlok, so I had to make up the extra wis loss there.<br />
<br />
Chipped bone bracer, polished bone bracer, velium jade veil, velium jade rings, golden effriti boots, acrylia studded cloak, foreman's tunic, or acrylia tunic, at one point I was using soiled breechcloth for legs for the tradeskill suit, jade earrings, black alloy medallion for the neck, totemic helm, eye of the griffon for range.<br />
<br />
Remember bearform gives you 5 wis. Greater bearform gives you 10. Stat food - I use misty thicket picnic and queynos afternoon tea- give you 10 wis. Just don't eat them :). (I stuff myself while I tradeskill). So my wis outfit only needs to go up to 235, greater bearform and stat foods do the rest to get me to 255. I prefer to get 255 without KEI, as it means I'm not wasting kei trying to do endless clicks on wu's, but if you're starting out, remember kei boosts you 25 wis.<br />
<br />
Good luck tradeskilling. I'm on my 5th shawl, working on my 6th, all tradeskills are over 150 except smithing (133), 180 in alchemy, 222 in pottery, and I just trivialed wu's in tailoring.<br />
<br />
The amount you spend in your wis suit pays off when the cost of a combine goes 80 plat or more... which it does, fast, especially in tailoring.</div></div><hr />
