<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bdc63</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Everyone,<br />
I am starting a shaman and have narrowed the selection of race down to 3, Ogre, Iksar, and Troll.<br />
I have been reading on a few webpages on some advantages and disadvantages on all of the races, such as Regen, Exp Penalties, and armor penalties.  i was directed to these boards and am looking for any feedback possible.  Thank You</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they all have xp penalty , they all have regen but ogre , iksar cant wear plate with mean no JBB ( right  click  265 nuke at 45 if you have 17k to buy it then ) a iksar will tell you its not important , but anyone else will tell you your daft to not get one.<br />
<br />
<br />
basicly it comes down to 1 thing ... whats most fun for you. When go into 3rd person view and see yourself , whats going to make you happiest to look at and to role play , the rest WILL even itself out. All races are just as fun as the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/nod Litgruv<br />
<br />
I have played all 3 and I am playing an ogre now.  They are all good, and I would order them ogre, troll, iksar.  I baught my JBB for 15k and it is well worth it.<br />
<br />
You will find strong advocates for each race but post 60 - torpor the differances between the races becomes more a mater of flavor then substance.  Iksar will not compare favorable between about lvl 45 and 60 if you have the resourses for a JBB, an Ogre only starts to top the list after level 60 and torpor marginalizes the regen advantages of the iksar and troll.<br />
<br />
Any of the 3 will be fine.  I would just take each out for a test drive and then play whichever you personaly find to be the coolest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wait a few days and make a froglok shaman<br />
<br />
then you can do backflips ! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can't go wrong with any of the choices. However if I had to start over I'd go Troll worshipping Inny over anything else. That gives you nice regen, a snare necklace, able to use JBB, slam and not as hated as an iksar. <br />
<br />
I've never been envious of Ogre unstunability but I've always been envious of the troll regen and snare necklace. :) Oddly though I don't see many troll shaman around on Karana, mostly everyone is a barby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bdc63</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you all for your input, i have decided to create an iksar shaman.  i appriciate your input :-)<br />
<br />
Thanks Again<br />
