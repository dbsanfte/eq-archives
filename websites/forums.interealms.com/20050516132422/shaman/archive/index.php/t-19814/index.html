I'm happy with it, level3 gives good punch when you are soloing with 5 dots, I can break 300+ DPS with a good round of crits (works on curse of spirits too *cough* shhh ;) )<br />
<br />
My only gripe is critical affliction should have a Big White crit message like crit heals/nukes have, purely so i could try for crit heals/nukes back to back while dot crits were going off ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Galgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Advanced Spirit Call/Spirit Call V isn't that great. It only casts three pets, but three more powerful pets. The dev's thought this would lessen the push and make them more valuable. (though thats why I used them in the first place) On parsing, I did around 3.4k damage with my three new pets. Same reuse time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was still finishing up my PoP aa's when GoD came out. Managed to get all I wanted in PoP(except for suspended minion, but I can live w/o it for now, hehe) with 5aa's banked. I got SC1 for instant gratification on my favorite 'fun' aa. SC4 is so bad, it ruins SC3. I then felt obligated to get SC5 to repair some of the damage to the ability. I'm very disappointed in my whopping 3 pets now. <br />
I did some aa pounding in fire and got 19aa's this weekend(could have been more-but I had to work 9hrs of overtime on Sat, bleh). I got crit dots 1 and SCS1. Im 4aa's from crit dots 2 atm, will finish that off tomorrow if I have time. Then I'll get SCS2, then finish off crit dots. I usually do my aa's this way unless I feel they are important enough to stick with one until it's maxxed...which none of these are, imho. I notice that if I get a good crit shot on Bane(1000+ damage) I get a little extra aggro-that's another reason I'm doing SCS at the same time, to hopefully reduce some of the initial aggro before crits start hitting. We'll see.</div></div><hr />

I've also picked up Spell Casting Subtlety 1 and 2.  With #1, I was noticing I wasn't catching aggro nearly as much from early malosini/slow.  I might get tagged with a hit once, but then I'd lose aggro almost immediately.  I'm not used to this.  With #1, I was in Pofire xping in the first castle yesterday with a Paladin with an Earthspined Staff (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24879).  I was physically unable to pull aggro off him by dropping Malosini, Turgur, Blood of Saryrn, Bane, Ancient Scourge of Nife, and Pox of Bertoxxulous on the mob.  I was amazed.  I haven't seen how useful #2 is so far.  I'll know more when I party with my regular xp partner I usually xp with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So far I've gotten FoMM3, CAff1, CotA1, PC1.<br />
<br />
FoMM and CAff are winners.<br />
<br />
CotA sucks until they fix it and I haven't even noticed PC working at all.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know the particulars of Persistent Casting?  I know it allows you to continue casting through a stun, but is there also a chance at the end of the casting that you'll be interrupted or will you always get off the spell if PC kicks in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>sirrini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I saved 29AA when GoD came out and I put in SCS3 (18 pts), PC1 (3), CAff1 (5), and CotA1 (3).<br />
<br />
SCS3 seems to be the winner, I gain less aggro with the same slow and/or dot in xp groups.  On the other hand, hybrids been complaining recently that warriors' taunt works more effectively now so they actually have better aggro.<br />
<br />
CAff1 is worth the $$ also, it's always nice to see some crits, I got SCS3 first though in case I gain too much aggro =D  But I agree, we should get a clearer message when the crit goes off.<br />
<br />
I didn't notice any difference so far with PC1.<br />
<br />
CotA1 is pretty much a waste, since every druid/cleric would pretty much put in similar level 1 effects just for kicks anyways.<br />
<br />
I mainly use Spirit Call 3 for some serious pet pushing/spell interruptions so at this time SC4/5 seems pretty useless.<br />
<br />
If I would have put my points again I would have skipped PC and CotA and focus on SCS3, CAff and FoMM.<br />
<br />
Secondary Forte looks nice with 200skill but I'm suspecting they would &quot;fix&quot; it eventually.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I use Rains/DDmore than DoT's, so FoMM was of more interest to me.<br />
Currently:<br />
FoMM3<br />
PC2(next to complete)<br />
CotA1(completing after PC), very nice for single group efforts.<br />
<br />
Hopefully a few of the AA will be adjusted/fixed so they are of more interest to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My 29 saved aaxp went into Persistent Casting 3, Spell Casting Sublety 1, Swift Journey 1, and Call of the Ancients 1.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't tell whether Persistent Casting is helping me or not, so I guess that is not exactly a ringing endorsement.<br />
<br />
I guess that I will max out Spell Casting Sublety next.<br />
<br />
The DPS aaxps look fun, but I will probably buy all of the utility / mitigation stuff first, since that is how I view my primary role to be as a shaman.</div></div><hr />

It's completely retarded, and an absolute waste of 6 AA at the least.  3 AA I could tolerate, but I'm not pleased about the 6 AA I wasted.  <br />

Going to finish healing AA off, then I'll probably get Secondary Forte.</div></div><hr />

had i known how great SCS truely is i would have gotten SCS2 instead of regen or run.<br />
<br />
have SCS 2 now and saving for 3. great AA. can slow and dot or nuke or heal or all of the above right away and not pull agro.<br />
<br />
prolly the next bit of AAs will go for either the nukes or the dots, haven't decided yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm working on Advanced Radiant Cure now. Got lvl 1. Sometimes in the past I wished RC would refresh faster especially on Rathe Council I'd be hovering over my hot key waiting. <br />

I totally agree with that approach Taabya. I didn't save aa's with GoD approaching for that very reason. Healing aa's alone are better than any of the new aa's appear to be, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My point of view, which is a raiders pov, was LR5 was more important thatn ND3 because I was dying much less from AE's than I was from slowing a mob and having it wack me. From that perspective I feel like scs is more importan than lr5 or nd3 if you are not worried about AE's and are getting whacked to death a lot. Because ND will give you hps to live if you get whacked, LR5 will keep you from getting whacked often and SCS will keep you from getting whacked at all. If you follow my train of thought.<br />
<br />
IF secondary forte remains 200, then IMO it's all about SCS followed by SF. The rest are great in any order 3 extra regen that doesn't count towards limit, faster running, more crit nukes more crit dots etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Thanks folks, after reading this I had decided to go with SCS to 3. Then in doing some LDoN last night I realized how much CC I end up doing (AoE slow and root park adds that come to me).  How much do you think this will effect that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Can anyone confirm that Secondary Forte will allow a second specialization to reach 200?  Screenshots would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I did critical affliction to level 3 so far.  Reason is that I see shamans saying they solo 3x as fast as me using LDON dots in plane of fire -- they can solo a mob in 5 minutes there, takes me almost 15 with my PoP and old world DOTs.  I've ignored LDON till now, too busy with raiding, just living, or even part time playing my SK.  But now I figure I'm going to get my LDON dots and open soloing up again as a serious possibility for experience again, which it hasn't been in a very long time, it seems.  And if I'm going to try soloing via dotting, I might as well maximize my power doing it with the crit DOT AA's.<br />
<br />
Also, I've been earning these AA at the tables in plane of fire, one of the few places grinding doesn't drive me nuts.  I've been grouped up, stacking poison spells.  Crits are nice there.  Would be even better with the LDON DOTs.  It'll all be working together for me and helping me get even more AA faster, so I can do other things.  I always like using AA to help you get other AA faster.<br />
<br />
That spell casting subtlety really does seem like a key AA for shamans though.  Maybe the best thing since canni 5?  That's next on my list.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ausafin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Just completed SCS3. Still get the initial aggro but i feel its much easier for others to taunt mob off me.. :p  Heard from friends that secondary forte secondary skills can go up more then 100. Druid , bard tracking skill seems can go up without getting the aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">So far I've bought:<br />
<br />
Caff1 (love it, wish it had a big white message like people have said)<br />
<br />
Scs1  (Don't notice much difference, but I'll get 3 and letcha know)<br />
<br />
SC4   (Hate it, hoping they patch the HP so it's at least decent.  Wish I had read the crucible before I bought it)<br />
<br />
After that, I went back and started getting my healing aas, since I hadn't gotten them yet, and concluded that the stuff we get in GoD just isn't worth it until I get all of them (all 60 aa worth) taken care of first.  After that, I'll go back and get scs3, then caff3, then start looking at the others.<br />
<br />
I was hoping for something a little more interesting, but really, they're at least decent.  With only 211 aa, I just don't have all the luclin/pop abilities I need yet.  Once I get them, I'll finish up some of the better GoD aa.  Just my preference, ymmv.<br />

I will prolly buy CAff and SCS and the new run speed at some point, but the older aas are just too tasty to worry with that atm.</div></div><hr />

My saved AA's went into:<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety 1-2-3.<br />
Critical Affliction 1.<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery 1.<br />
Shroud of the Faceless 10 (finishing it off...I'm anal that way!).<br />
<br />
Since Secondary Forte was stealth nerfed to 100, I won't be doing that any time soon.  If they put it back to 200, that's what I would do next.<br />
Call of the Ancients looks less than appetizing.  Critical Affliction, FoMM, &amp; Persistent Casting look like the ones I will do next.  After that, the overpriced dog AA (or even Run4) will probably be next.<br />
<br />
SCS3 seems to be doing funky things to aggro in small groups.  I need more time with it to figure out what's going on, but I'm thinking this will be making alot of tanks that adventure with me very happy.  It is nice (&amp; funny) to see pure casters briefly get aggro when I'm tanking in the face w/ 3 dots running - something I'd NEVER seen before getting SCS.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I still have a lot of old AAs to get, which are way better than anything in GoD. <br />
<br />
I looked through all the classes new AAs to see what everyone was getting. From an outsider's perspective, the big winners in GoD seem to be mage, wizard, cleric, ranger, monk, and beastlord. I'm sure some people who play those classes will disagree, but they seemed to have the best, or the most, new abilities. Oh, and can I just say again - all clerics AND beastlords must hang. Nothing against the people who play these classes, just the classes themselves are utterly and completely flawed.<br />
<br />
The ones I was not impressed with are shaman (obviously), druid, warrior, and shadowknight. Berserker, too, because they have no AAs yet.</div></div><hr />

Crit dots I stoped on because of no emote hehe I'll finish it but later.  spirit call 5 is a nice extra kick but probly wouldn't have gotten it if I knew about the 250 hp thing hopefully it is a bug that will be fixed.  Fury of the ages mastery 2 didn't really seem to be to major of an increase probly 2-4 % each lvl.  Persistant casting is what i'm maxing now and it does seem to work quite nicly.  SCS is also quite nice very noticeable maxed.<br />

I'll probly get swift journey next then get the final lvls of crit dots/nukes</div></div><hr />
