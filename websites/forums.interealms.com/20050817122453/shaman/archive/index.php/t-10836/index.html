<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any clue if they will throw the priest classes a bone and make our rarer 60 spells questable/researchable? Just dinged 63 still no malo!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siamese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ugh!  Think of that as a blessing that we don't have research.  I play a necro and an enchanter as well, and research just plain bites.  Collecting components, and praying you succeed on that combine.  That is one thing I am glad for with the priest classes, no research.<br />
<br />
That said though, I sure wish they would make some viable way to get Malo and Torpor other than sitting for hours on end in Sebilis, racing to kill the Kunark dragons, or pulling Guardian Wurms until I get incredibly lucky enough to get those spells.  It's rather frustrating to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Count me out for research. I thank VI every day for not giving that to priest classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">These days it's not as bad for INT casters to research their spells because there are lots of people selling runes etc in the bazaar for a few pp each.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, if they don't do something for the WIS casters all hell will break loose. I'm pretty sure they will come up with something but, I dont think it will be soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Man!  the change isn't even LIVE and the class envy posts are already starting.  <br />
<br />
Not that it makes any difference, but it is being reported elsewhere that the change has been removed from test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They can keep spell research and gem reagents, for that matter. Be glad we never had to do that or carry stacks of this or that gem for this or that spell. Think Avatar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope they decide to do something for us. With PoP and the upcoming Frogger expansion. Noone is interested in doing the mobs that drop the level 59 and 60 spells.<br />
<br />
And when they pop up in the bazaar for sell..... Peeps want 100k plus for them! I saw torpor in the bazaar of SoluSek Ro the other day for 150k... I have yet to see Pox in the bazaar...<br />
<br />
I'm lucky to have 20k at any given time..<br />
<br />
Most guilds that raid are after uber loot these days as well.. Ask for a raid to get a shammy spell is a waste of time...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't understand the people saying they don't want the research to be an option.  AFAIK, they're not removing the dropped spells.  They're adding an ADDITIONAL way to obtain these spells.  Torpor and Malo will still drop like they always have, but now extra copies would be available through research.  Even if the research stuff is as rare as torpor/malo are, that would double the number of spells available.<br />
<br />
Adding research as an option costs you NOTHING, it helps everyone involved.  If you don't like it, don't do it, but there will be a number of folks who will, and have spells for sale in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Question: Would you want the 'researched' spells to be no drop? If it is that way then no one will be researching Torpor and Malo to just sell it in the bazaar. On the other hand, no drop research wouldn't really bring more copies of the spell into the market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hell if the components that drop for researching Torpor are half as rare as Torpor itself I'll take it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Agreed. Torpor, malo and pox are starting to become big problems in actually finding the spells. Few guilds want to do kunark mobs anymore as the loot is sub-par which makes it extremely hard to even kill the mobs with the spells. Which also hurts the bazaar mode of it. I've scrapped every penny for the money for torpor yet I've ended up spending 45k pp on upgrades for myself this week because I have more money then I need but no torpor scroll.<br />
<br />
They need to find a way to start getting torpor and malo back into the game because as it is now they are much more rare then they were a year or so ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Assuming they want to keep the influx of spells constant, then by adding Research as a option to dropped, the number of dropped has to decrease even further. I still dont like the idea. If they are gonna replace dropped with research, i like it even less. If they are gonna increase the influx of these spells, why bother adding research...just increase their drop rate. If the spells started to drop, i can guarantee people would camp the mobs that drop them regardless of the zone they drop in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Delmustatrar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually, it would be nice if they added 59 and 60 spells to parchment drops...<br />
<br />
I could deal with that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I hope they do something to make it easier to get the level 60 spells... like my ranger buying Warder's Protection for 4 plat in the library when PoP came out.<br />
<br />
Research is not as bad as it used to be.  It's fully trainable to get past the lower levels (or higher if you have the plat) and you can now buy components for practice in the Bazaar.  My necro bought all of his research spells before the bazaar even opened... there are always other people who will do it and need to sell the spells they got from practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think only wizards have any trouble at all getting their final Kunark spells out of the INT casters.  Enchanter final spells you can't GIVE away.  Mage final spells drop like rain from any two-bit jugg that spawns.   Necros also have very very minor trouble getting one or two spells.  Pets mostly I think.  But it's in NO WAY the kind of awful deal that priest spells for 59-60 are.  <br />
IMHO this is just icing on the already frosted ice-cream cake for INT classes.  Or perhaps just a cherry on top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Land ask all the necros u knwo how many have funeral pyre :P<br />

Guys research sucks ass. Ever play an int char and tried to do it? Omg raising it and farmign giant toes zombie skins fungus bah it's one of the things that sucks the most about playign an INT char (other than being frail like a toothpick).<br />
Research = bad.<br />
There ARE other solutions like um let's see... DOABLE, UNBROKEN quests, um Increased drop rate. Or even the ridiculous idea of actually puttign them on a merchant.<br />
Ok so last option may not happen but the other 2 can be done easily and it's not &quot;Too hard to code&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Anwariad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My offhand is a wizard.  I had no problem raising his research skill and making the spells I needed was fun.  Every time he earned a level his skill points raisied research 5 points.  Isn't that what skill points are for?  I think he still has over 100 skill points because he made all his up to 49 spells with a skill of a 100.<br />
<br />
There is no way my shaman would be able to increase research to the point she could make 50 to 60 spells having blown my latter skill points on things like maxing H2H.  <br />
<br />
I will be fine if only int casters get to research 50 to 60 spells.  At least I will finally get Levitation and Everlasting Breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Trust me, Jaruden, none of us object to them making it easier to get our spells. I object to giving priests research, because it makes absolutely no sense for us to all of a sudden be able to research spells like the robes do. Not to mention, we dont have any research skill to be able to do it, if that was the case.<br />
<br />
What would make more sense is to put all spells from previous expansions on vendors in the library in Plane of Knowledge. It is the Plane of Knowledge after all. Or, if they dont want to make it that simple, let us do some rinky-dink little quest for any dropped spell from previous expansions and have the rest on vendors. It's stupid that so many people (not only shamans) still dont have spells from 2 or 3 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have a necro as a main, I'm not bashing INT casters or showing any class envy. I'm simply asking if anyone knows if we will get another method of collecting our rarer spells. I for one wouldn't be happy, it took me a year and 60k to buy torpor and its worth every pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">is the game a progression ?<br />
<br />
do you need to kill certain mobs to get certain spells ? <br />
<br />
emperor, protector, and guardian wurms are low probability targets .... but Talendor, Sev, etc are higher probability targets. can't take more than 2 groups seriously.<br />
<br />
is it a pain in the ass, yep. but just about every other class has some gripe. fek we are given our most powerful spell at 51, and its store bought.<br />
<br />
The spells drop ..... just not in Velks or where the exp is best to 60/65<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">guys really, torpor/malo/poxx all drop from the emp in seb.  at lvl 60 i went to the emp in seb with a lvl 56 monk and Duoed for 4 hours one morning and got poxx and malo.  ended up buying torpor in trade for my lodi shield (when they were worth something).  Just requires not going to PoP to exp for a few hours.  The emp pops quite often and it is rumored that he can be soloed at 60 (i wouldnt try it.)  It was even pretty good exp  :)<br />
<br />
Now you say what about the rogue?  At 60 i'm sure you have a rogue friend who can help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Kanelan, from my experience, and im sure many others, you got extremely lucky. Many people have killed emperor for weeks and not gotten a single shaman spell. I finally broke down and bought torpor, and was fortunate enough that the guild had a copy of malo. I still dont have poxx and have hunted in Crypt every change i get for weeks. <br />
<br />
I can agree (off topic mind you) that the spell drops are rediculous. I for one, as i said earlier, do not want research. I would much rather see the mobs that drop the spells increase, or the drop rate on the current mobs increased before they added research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Kanelan just coz you are lucky, no need to rub it in :)<br />
<br />
I've camped the Emperor - I did get Pox eventually but still no malo. In 4 hours, you're lucky to get maybe 3 emperor pops, and to get both malo and pox from that is extremely lucky.  Some people have camped him for weeks without luck.<br />
<br />
Kunark Dragons - I've managed to be on one kunark dragon kill so far (I've just moved guilds so hoping for more now). Downed Sev with ease and I was the only shaman there - but he didn't drop diddly squat for shaman spells, just 3 clerics ones that nobody wanted, 2 wizard ones and 1 necro. /rude Sev <br />
<br />
Still, I know I will get malo eventually, it just requires some (ok, a lot of) effort. I don't see anything wrong with that for one spell, but for pox, malo and torpor to all be so rare is a bit much. Well, avatar too but who cares about that with primal weapons and PoP armour, lol.</div></div><hr />

Research sucks flaming moose genitals.<br />
<br />
I agree there should be an alternate route for the rare WIS caster spells, but trust me...you do not want it to be research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Make them Alchemy Researchable by Shaman.<br />
Rare dropped roots make a potion which teaches you the spell.<br />
<br />
Problem is Druids/Clerics would need a similiar skill.<br />
Clerics I could see &quot;Prayers&quot; easily enough.  1 Charge Scrolls<br />
of prayers they wrote to recite.   Instead of wierd effects like potions are, just make them cleric spells.<br />
<br />
Make components similiar in cost, so that the best prayers<br />
((Rez)) cost like 300-500 pp.  IE: something you wouldnt WANT to use but you would like to have for that emergency.<br />
<br />
Druids im sure could get something nature based.<br />
Perhaps stones, or twigs, or something.  Not sure what effects Id give them to avoid alchemy overlap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">speaking as someone that plays both a necro and a shaman I'd say I'm pretty damn glad that my shaman didn't have to research his class defining spells<br />
<br />
imagine having research malXXX, txgxr's and pets.<br />
<br />
research sucked to get through and it's about damned time it payed off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">no fail combines, like the pages in our epic quest or the skull in the BoSW quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I havent been on too many Kunark dragon kills, but last Gore I was on dropped Torpor, Last Gore the guild killed without me dropped Avatar, Last Sev we killed droped Malo, necro spectre pet and wizard spell, and Sev before last dropped Malo and 2 VoTBs and more wizard spells.<br />
<br />
Got my copy of Torpor early on from Jumpy or Protector (one of those two) and never seen him drop a good shaman spell since then despite killing the two a good many times.  Only been on a couple of Emperor killings and he never dropped anything good.<br />
<br />
I played an enchanter for a while to level 35 and actually enjoyed the research aspect of the game, didnt always get my spells at the level I could use them, but usually shortly thereafter.  Just takes a little extra work in shopping merchants and holding on to every page that drops until you get matches and can combine.  <br />
<br />
I would be all for a difficult quest to get our kunark spells and think it could actually be fun.  I would not like to see them on a merchant at this point unless the price was obscene, a lot of people put a lot of effort into getting some of them.</div></div><hr />

Still haven't scribed it..</div></div><hr />

Research = bad. <br />
<br />
Research is easy as hell now with the Bazaar and PoK.  There is no need to farm all those stupid practice rune items.  Just buy up Runes/Words/Pages off vendors and merchants in mass bulk.  Any extra spells you can dump on a bazaar mule and sell.  Go to the bazaar and search for  &quot;Rune of&quot; see how many people are selling them, tons on Brell.  And they are on merchants everywhere, with PoK it takes no time to get to each city to check for more.<br />
<br />
I seriously hope they add some way for priests to get their spells in this form.  I picked up a Rune last night of a merchant that is used to make GSS, the spell only available from Emperor Ssra... how fair is that?</div></div><hr />

Yeah this is true. My guild had just started killing Sont. On last kill he dropped two copies of Malo and the 59 necro pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Its not that the mobs arent being killed anymore that drop torpor, malo, etc.  They are still killed pretty quick after they pop.  They just aren't being farmed by the higher guilds, to sell the stuff anymore.  They have moved on to the newer content.  <br />
<br />
The guilds killing them are your lower level guilds, of which there are many.  And more often than not, if these spells drop, they are going to someone who needs them.  They are not going up for sell in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
They need to up the drop rate on these spells.  More people need them everyday, instead of less.  Only killed about 20 GW's so far, and have not seen any rare spell drop yet.  Let alone Torpor or Malo.</div></div><hr />
