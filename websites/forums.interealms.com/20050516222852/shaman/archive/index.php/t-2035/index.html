<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, it has been some time (bout 2+ years) since I last roamed the catacobs underneath Qeynos, but please tell me this when the HECK did they add aggro Specters to that zone?  Stuck my ugly Toll nose in there on the way to the Glacier bear, and almost made a trip back to bindpoint... <br />
<br />
Oh I did get the bear =)  He is still on the same cycle as always, kill PH, kill PH and then finally bear!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Specters were there (inside the Bertoxx temple) the last time I was there (Sept 2001).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Specs were there June 2000 I believe. Ran into them with my original char.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have heard about the specters near the temple area before.  The one that almost got me was near the secret entrance at the wall.  He might have been trained there...  but usually people that hunt down there would not last long enough to actually drag one that far, so I assumed it was a new spawn / wanderer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nerd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They are on the Dismal Rage faction I think.  They're stationary (as long as noone agros them) external guards for the evil temple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was a young ogre far, far away from home (in the Karanas in my teens) and when EQAtlas showed a bank in the Qeynos Aqueducts I was excited.  First try I ran into a ShadowKnight who lit me up - I though all evil's were friends (now I know better :) )!<br />
<br />
Second go round, getting totally lost, even getting another player to guide me to the secret area...and I run into those dang specters.  Sigh...I had to run all the way to Oggok to bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I didn't even know that the catacombs existed until I was level 56.  I decided that I wanted a Paw of Opalla, which lead me to this god-forsaken zone.  Incidentally, this was also the day that I ate an unrezzed death from the horde of SK's and spectres that chased me down as I frantically tried to find the seemingly non-existant exit.  No way in the world was I going to ask a cleric to rescue me from that mental breakdown.  I bought a Paw from some druid and went back to Sebilis.</div></div><hr />
