<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jafah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent been able to slow any of them so far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">one (north i think) is immune... the rest are partially slowable last I remember killing them.  A couple are pretty tough to slow though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've only been able to slow them with tash, but I haven't really tried much. If Malosinia doesn't land in a couple of tries I just focus on healing. I've yet to see a 65 Warrior who can't tank them unslowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Laef (Wind) - not slowable<br />
Oreen, Hreidar, Gaukr - Slowable<br />
<br />
Oreen and Hreidar are easy slowable if you use Malicious Decay and then Cloud of Grummus. After That you got time to bring in Malos  and try Turgurs. <br />
Gaukr is almost immune to slow. Even with the method described above I land a slow around every fourth kill on him, and that usually is a Disease Slow...<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, good luck  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jafah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks actually that helps quite a bit!  So its basicly just the north boss thats not slowable all others use MD then Cloud of Grummus and then proceed to malo and slow.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Laef (north) is immune.  The rest all partially mitigate.  I usually just disease slow and then heal unless there is a chanter or bard to help debuff MR.  I have landed turgur's without tash a few times, but more often than not you're better off just settling for disease slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SE tower - Auliffe Chaoswind - immune to slow, difficult to land Malosinia<br />
SW tower - Eindride Icestorm - easy to disease slow, difficult to regular slow<br />
NE tower - Brynju Thunderclap - easy to disease slow, difficult to regular slow<br />
<br />
NW tower - Leistr - immune to slow<br />
NW tower - Hrani - easy to regular slow<br />
NW tower - Iri - mezzable and easy to regular slow<br />
NW tower - Kuanbyr Hailstorm - immune to disease, very difficult to regular slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xorraiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i normally drop in a Malos , Maliscious Decay , and cloud of grummus to at least get the somewhat mitigated slows on Oreen, Gaukr, Hreider..i have landed a turgers on them but it bounces more often then lands...cloud will land about 80% of the time first cast...or will land at least by the 3rd cast.<br />
<br />
Laef..get used to healing...cant get crap to land other then malos and epic.<br />
<br />
Elif...turgers works rather easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only one I have fought was Laef, and he was immune to slow. Cleric in the group (who's husband was an iksar shaman), told me he wasnt immune, that I just got resisted. Hmm...last time I checked, 'immune to changes in attack speed' meant just that. Then she tried to tell me I have to cripple it first to help slow land.  :rolleyes: Dont ya love that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Duh, your CHA obviously wasn't high enough to land slow....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Juff has the lowest CHA on Xev, don't listen to him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Damn, I knew I shoulda equipped my steins first.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whatever that one at the deep south is I've had difficulty landing slow on him before.  The last time I fought him was pretty awesome though.  We had a ragtag group of adventures...with a druid as a healer.  We just decided to go ahead and try him before someone else took it from us.  I pulled with malos and ran him around a sec till i got sinia and slow off on him.  Then I watched the tank die in about 5 secs...so I chain crippled him while letting two rogues and a wizard burn him down... IN TEH FACE.<br />
<br />
Was a pretty awesome fight and made me feel a whole lot better about myself.  Not to mention last night when I was the ramp tank for vindi and even pulled and was one that he was beating on for a few minutes until the real tank could pull him off of me.  Ahh.... feels good to be a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tried Thunderclap in NE Tower twice last night on a little pickup raid.<br />
<br />
I used malo, and I assume the chanter was tashing.  Mages were trying malosinia but doubt any of that landed.<br />
<br />
First fight, landed Turgurs on second try; partially successful.  Then failed 8 times on reslow and raid wiped.<br />
<br />
Second fight, landed slow after about 7 attempts, then got agro and died.  Hot rezzed back in, canni a bit, fail about 4 times on reslow attempts, get agro, die again, raid wipes.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would say just settle for disease slow and move on to healing.</div></div><hr />
