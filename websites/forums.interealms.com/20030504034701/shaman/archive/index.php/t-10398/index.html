You know that spell thats in the back of your spel lbook because you never use it. Well lastnight(not the 1st time mind you) I was killing reavers in CoM with some friends. I would get blinded and only after 2 or 3 or 4 casts would I get cured. That got me to wondering. So, I looked it up on lucy. It appears that it only cures 1 blind counter at a time.  My question is... Do you think Shamen/Cleric need a upgrade?  <br />
<br />
I know that MANY MANY clerics and shamen dont have this spell. Blindness is something that we rarely come across. I have encountered it in two situations I believe. Black Reavers and some doppleganger in West Karana. <br />
<br />
Think its an Issue worth Pressing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">unless boss mobs start AE unresistable blinding,i ts not much of an issue, blind is resisted easily with decent MR anyhow, dont see much of an issue with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Cure Blindness spell has zero effect as far as I can tell. Blindness goes away on its own whenever it wants to, no matter how many times you cast Cure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the only two mobs that blind that really were annoying was The Prince and King in Chardok. This was especially annoying with the Prince because he casts Whirl on you also so you end up pointing the wrong way. Luckily the cleric we were with remembered the spell in mid battle memmed it and saved our butts. Also Itraer Vius in Ahkeva does a blind but his is single target only, usually the tank. It could also be used to help out there. Of course having to cast three or four times or whatever would get old fast, most of these mobs reblind quickly and the Chardok Royals are AE so you would have to be Curing everyone. Although mostly just spam the tank so he stays in position and holding aggro. Hope that helps. btw I killed some reavers in CoM and since I was dual boxing just used my Shaman to keep my monk positioned correctly. Then I remembered I had this spell....Doh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yatta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe the blind proc and AE on IV is a curse.<br />
<br />
Very few cases of blindless left in the game.<br />
I've seen it mostly in orc camps when you're lvl10ish - which is about the only time I've ever used that spell (and it does indeed cure it).<br />
<br />
If you look at some random blind spells though, like the IV touch - and the lvl39 Blinding Luminance spell, they say &quot;Blindness (-1)&quot;. So possibly most cases of blindness are only 1 counter, meaning the lvl9 spell doesn't really need an upgrade.</div></div><hr />
