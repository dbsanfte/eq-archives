<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The time has come for me to start working on my healing AA's.  In a previous post, I decided that HG wasn't really worthwhile, but HA would be really nice.  Since then, I have gotten Quiesence and it has changed my mind.  Here is what I am thinking:<br />
<br />
With Q, SCRM, and SCM3, I very rarely need to use Kragg's Mending.  Before I got Q, I had to use kragg's for regular, controlled healing.  I figured that HA would be better because it would be better to have larger heals than the occasional crit that would normally be wasted because tanks were only down 2k HP.<br />
<br />
Since I have gotten Q, I realized that HG is probably a much more viable AA.  The MT in my group has Q on him at all times and its usually the only healing he needs.  Whenever someone else gets slapped around a few times but doesn't keep aggro, they get a Q to heal them up.  Kragg's never comes in to play.  However, when a caster is getting beat or a DD just can't use aggro, I need to use tnarg's.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's with HA3 should do 1430 points, I believe.  1430 vs. 1300 is not going to save someone's life.  However, if I had HG3, that blast heal has a high chance of critting.  A 2600pt heal vs. a 1300 is a HUGE difference and will most likely save the person's life.<br />
<br />
So, in summary, I am thinking that going the HG route will be more beneficial for me since it will make me significantly better at blast healing, whereas HA would be a poor choice since the 10% bonus is not likely to save anyone's life, and I no longer use kragg's.<br />
<br />
I am just looking for other people's opinions on these AA before I start spending points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">same way here. 61 got canniV and gettin HG III before to go to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wonder how many AA you have, to be considering this.  I currently have 123 and don't see these particular AA on the horizon for another 40AA or so.  My profile lists all that I currently have and I'll complete QB and IR before I think about whether I'd like this one or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd have to agree with that logic.  I rarely use KM either, only when the tank has been getting beat pretty hard (resisted slow usually), and I need to catch up.  <br />
<br />
IMO I'd need a ton of aa to bother with either one though.  Unless you're regularly in situations where people are taking sudden damage, the chance to get a crit heal really isn't that high.  If a 1430 heal isn't going to save someone, relying on a critical heal isn't going to save them very often.  I was only healer for a BoT group last night, I think I only cast tnarg's once and KM about 5 times.  Maybe it'd be more useful for spot healing in a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I often find myself patch healing on guild raids against boss mobs. In those circumstances I think the chance of a crit heal is more useful than the steady but small gains from healing adept and could well save the tanks life.<br />
<br />
In xp groups I'd probably say the opposite. I generally use my heals to help out the cleric with mana, or if the cleric goes LD, or a caster gets hit. In those cases the damage is normally fairly predictable and I'll heal once they are 1300hp down. A crit would most often just be wasted.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I think FinalJustice has a point; there are other more useful AAs out there. Although, I'm not so sure I'd include innate stamina 3, metabolism 3 and  and spirit call 3 amongst them.<br />
<br />
Being able to cast quiessence/torpor and Tnarg's in half the time, every time, is more useful to me than the small, random chance of a critical heal.<br />
<br />
The extra hp from ND3, damage mitigation from CA3, and improved chance of channeling that crucial slow from channeling focus are probably all higher on my list than healing AAs. Once you have those though, and the nice PoP ones (I'd suggest SC1, VP1 and RC2 or 3), then the healing ones do look nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think HA is a better investment.  Get the PoP HA afterwards, and that's 19% added on for a 1547 tnarg's.  Add in IH4 to that, and it's 1697.  Wish I had the AA to spend on that.   :p  I'd much rather have a consistently higher heal than a rare super-duper high heal that may even be overhealing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Having said that, I think FinalJustice has a point; there are other more useful AAs out there.

<br />
<br />
Ahhh, you looked at the profile.  On ND3, it's free, perminent 200+ HP's on me and has saved my life from not getting low health aggro on Can V more times than I wanna count.  When I don't have BoT9 or Virt, that makes the diff.  Or did you mean my STA4?  For me, HP's &gt; all and I was trying to help my totals.  I dropped STA whough, once it no longer gave me a good return for my investment (even though that's only 1AA per STA level).<br />
<br />
Innate Metabolism 3 is damn cheap (at only 3AA for IM3) and helps me keep a single stack of Hero Sandwiches and Qeynos Teas going forever (I stuff myself with summoned bread and water).  That too gives good perminent stats and HP's.<br />
<br />
I was going to keep the Puppies O Powa at 1, but my guildboss was playing me one day (before the verify window) and made a hotkey for them...  No, he hit the OTHER button and trained me in SC2, instead.  Once I had SC2, I might as well drop a couple AA and get the fifth puppy (it still wows 'em when they see 6 wolves attacking).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never use KM. This spell is too long to cast for less than 2k hp.<br />
In the same time I can cast 3 tnarg.<br />
Sure it does cost way more mana, but when I need to patch heal, it's now, not in 10 sec and whatever is the mana cost.<br />
HG saved my life once or twice already when channeling under rampage on a mean mob and critting Tnarg. <br />
<br />
With elemental arms, I crit tnarg close of 3k. I plan on finishing HG before spending other AA in healing skills (well I ll finish HG when I ll be done with a lot of other skills).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went with HG because I was raiding a ton and when you are spot healing on a raid it seemed to me a lucky crit at times could save the MT or whomever. It goes off a lot with HG maxed and the PoP one maxed. However now I have an IH4 item so I am maxing out HA as well. Only have HA2 at the moment so I haven't quite broken 3k on a crit yet. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh yeah, I NEVER use Kraggs Mending. I use Q continually with Tnargs thrown in as needed. I am so tempted to rant about how crappy Kraggs Mending is but I know I would be preaching to the choir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Recently I have switched out Kragg's Mending to give a spot for Ferine Avater. Initially I thought it would end up being a bad idea, but honestly, I didn't realize until now how little I ever used that spell. Quiesence is more than enough when you have another healer in the group, I only use Tnarg's when it looks like the cleric may not be able to heal in time. Even in raids I'd much rather use Tnarg's unless there is an obvious shortage of clerics. I am very happy with my decision of going with HG over HA.<br />
<br />
The only time I've slotted Kragg's now was when the cleric got cocky, pulled, and died before he could reach the group. And even then I didn't get it out until after a few pulls when I saw the cleric had a long way to run to get back.<br />
<br />
My advice to you would be go with HG to unless you see yourself as being the only healer in the majority of your exp groups. While relying on crits to save people is a bad idea, you'll be happy in those rare cases when they do.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I maxed out critical heals first for one reason. Whenever I am called upon to use Tnarg's, it is usually when someone dropped below 50% and needs it NOW. A tank with normal grind buffs bordering along 8-9khp won't really notice this heal alot, but when you crit, it will allow you to get Q on him and call it good, or at least allow the cleric to begin casting a CH. On other classes, the ocasional crit heal will damned near fill them up in a grind. With maxed arch and PoP heal adept and gift and a healing IV item, I crit heal for 3k on a regular basis with Tnarg's. Note: REGULAR basis. <br />
<br />
Adept and Gift are both worth the aa you spend, especially if you group/raid alot. But I would put the crits in front of the higher heal average first. The results are well worth it,...if you dont mind being main healer alot ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can see both sides of the issue, truth is shaman have rough time playing healer and any improvement in this area is great.  I'm sure you know, when you need a crit, you won't get it, and when you are topping off you will crit hehe.<br />
<br />
I am getting close to erasing kraggs mending.  You get all the aggro of the cleric CH with 25% of the effect.  Trying to use kraggs mending on MT during a raid killed me 3 times before I switched to using on tnargs only.  Even if I am main healer I don't use kraggs, being tied up in a ten second spell really puts a hit on what shamans are all about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm considering maxing these soon, picked up the IH4 face from terris the other day, which has swung the decision this way a little ;)<br />
<br />
I assist heal a lot on raids, and regularly play the main healer in tier3 xp groups with just Q/Tnargs at present (thanks SCRM/SCM3)<br />
<br />
I bought Hg1 a LONG time ago and it puts a smile on my face for the occasional crit heal, 2874 has been my highest with Tnargs/Ih4 so far<br />
<br />
I don't know whether Ih4 (up to 20% heal improvement) works off unmodified heal amount or HA3 modified, but even in worst case:<br />
<br />
1300 (base Tnargs) +10% HA +20% IH4=1690 before crit, <br />
<br />
for a max crit of 3380hp for ~350ish mana(450mana - SCM3/specialsation max) <br />
<br />
I'll probably end up doing Qbuff2 to take to 100aa and 45% unbuffed beneficial spell haste<br />
<br />
Then sink 10 points into Healing Gift2-3, before going back to CA/LR<br />
<br />
Trouble is, casting fury is looking tempting as well :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Personally I'd probably go with HA over HG. Crits are just unreliable and uncontrolable.<br />
While KM isn't the greatest heal around that for sure I still find myself using it a fair bit when I do any amount of healing. For most ae dmg or someone who picked up a little bit of aggro it's a quiesence. If someone needs a fast heal of corse it's tnargs but a may or may not end up helping out.<br />
<br />
If i'm the main healer tho I will use KM. It's still a big enough efficiency difference that it's noticable. I use Q to keep their hps up as much as possible but when that can't keep up it's KM to get them back up on hps. HA would effect KM and HG wouldn't. HA is consistant, HG isn't and you can't count on it with out risking things.<br />
<br />
For most I would say that these are pretty far down the line as far as aa goes.<br />
<br />
Run3, regen3 and even metabolism 3 (great for stat foods especially with horses) for basicis.<br />
<br />
MC3, ND3, SCM3, SCR3, CA3 are all better for arch skills imo.<br />
<br />
MGB, CANN, QB2, SCRM are all better for class skills.<br />
<br />
For pop skills I'd throw LR5, Radiant cure, VP1 all ahead of it too.<br />
<br />
totaling that up<br />
9+<br />
60+<br />
31+<br />
19=<br />
119<br />
<br />
Thats a fair amount of aa's already. Throw in some fun ones like Spirit call or crits or New tanaan's and your could easily be over 150aa's before getting around to these. Altho aa points aren't as hard to get as they used to be =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Jim if you are interested by critical healing, do your way to advance HG III. 10% HG III + 6% Advance HG III =  :cool: <br />
<br />
Take it as a bonus, will help if you aren't in the shaman top3  of your guild (patch healing) // if you are often playing with a melee partner//if you are soloing (chloroblast on pet X2).<br />
Of course those without any healing feeling will tell you it's a waste of time  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got healing adept, and advanced healing adept before I even put a point into healing gift.  They are both useful but I found the consistant increase from healing adept more useful for my play style than the streaky crits from healing gift.  (I heal early alot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the majority of my heals go to main tanks on uber mobs. the tanks i talked to all said they would rather have double heals sometimes instead of a little bit extra everytime. (although i have gotten both by now)<br />
<br />
with max gift you crit quite often. with mobs in pop hitting 800+ (and that's just trash) crits will be more useful than a few extra hundred points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Not planning on doing healing AAs for a while.  i can see the advantege.  but i just dont heal enough so seems kinda silly.<br />
<br />
i think i would have to go with crit heals over bigger heals, though a 1500 tnargs sounds pretty cool.<br />
<br />
also, as a shaman who had torpor before kraggs came out i barely have ever used kraggs.  its just bulcky and unwieldy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hail,<br />
<br />
I have HA2 now, and no HG at all.  I don't have a IH4 item or Quiescence.  Sitting right at 100 aa's atm.<br />
<br />
I personally feel the streakiness of a critical heal for me is not worth more than a known specific improvement in the quality of the heal I most frequently use on others.<br />
<br />
The top guild (I'm not in it) on my server has minimum AA requirements for new applicants, and they are rather steep (100/150 for x-server applicants).  Each class has specific AA's they must have to even be considered.  One of them is HA3.  Three of their shaman have been ranked in the Top 10 of shaman rankings across all servers (depending on which criteria you select). Healing gift isn't mentioned in their recruiting information for shaman.  I have to wonder why they would select Healing Adept and not Healing Gift as a recruiting requirement.<br />
YMMV of course. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Virulent Paralysis is one of my most-used AA skills.  It's flat out awesome for root parking **** in Tactics pit.  I do get the occasional resist, but mostly I don't.  And since I usually play there without a chanter, it's vital that I be the one controlling the adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have some 177 aa now I think.<br />
<br />
I have the crit heal Maxed out for my level 62 self (All 3 Archtype ranks and 2 more ranks in the Pop boost). And I have 2 ranks in the improved heal thingy from archtype spells as well.<br />
<br />
If I am healing I tend to be oh **** healing. Mainly because I am pulling 95% of the time. The crits Help me with that style of play. The incrimental changes are not as much but considering I have 18 aa to spend to clear all the stuff in archtypes tab I am going to get it next.<br />
<br />
Well if I dont level to 63. Still not sure on that yet either. (Laughs)<br />
<br />
And yeah yeah I know all about the level to 65 argument and less resists and all, but as a leader of a small guild I like to be able to take a group of level 55's and not soak all of thier xp and still maybe get a little xp in justice when times are slow.<br />
<br />
Ill level to 65 when Verant gets thier head out of thier ass and makes dark blue range 15 levels again. Or I max out my AA for my given level for the useful stuff.  Or If I happen upon Quessance and Ferine avatar.<br />
<br />
I like the crit heals. But that is just me. They both can be useful and with a Healing 4 item you will get more use out of the incremntal ones, but your millage may vary..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Along with all my trained AAs I have HG2, Advanced HA2, with SCR3, SCM1, sleeves have 25% improved healing, and I use EE4 item in range I swap out with an ER4 item. Kragg's mending is 2285, Tnarg's is right at or near 1800 (3245 crit), and Q is 1860 (may be  bit over). <br />
<br />
Prior to training HG and HA, I felt useless as a healer and now I don't. Alot of shaman feel we are not healers, well that may be true, but we have the spells so why not make the use of them? Our guild uses our shaman in spam healing the MTs, group healers, debuffing, and nukes. I just felt for my style of play (since I rarely solo) I wanted the better heals now and will take care of the rest after healing AAs are trained.   <br />
<br />
Btw, I rarely use Kragg's and that spot is taken with Ferine and the melee love it. However, when grouped with a cleric exping is afk for extended amt of time or LoM, I pop it in till she/he is ready to go again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I heal...infrequently.  :)<br />
<br />
When I am needed to heal, however, I am needed to heal RIGHT NOW.  With HA3, I might heal for more every time, but against the type of creatures I am fighting an extra 100, 200, or even 300 HP would be a drop in the bucket.  Since that is the case, I tend to take the view that I would rather have HG3 + AHG so that I might have a chance at critting.  If I fail to crit, then maybe I'll have to cast the spell again.  If I suceed, then I am happy and have saved some mana.<br />
<br />
I only have HG2 at the moment (mostly because I like FUN aa's and even if I rarely crit its nice to have something to watch for).  I imagine I'll get HG3 and the AHG series soon enough, though.  I'm kind of running out of useful AA's.  (CA3, lightning reflexes, and radiant cure 2/3 will probably come first.)</div></div><hr />
