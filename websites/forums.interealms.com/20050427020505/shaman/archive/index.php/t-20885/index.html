<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolf Shadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The rain pattered onto the roof of the Foxglove Inn, beating in time with the wild pace of the womans heart. She looked out a nearby window her heart racing infear. If they caught her she was done for. Shamans weren't allowed in these parts.<br />
 Her slightly pointed ears perked with fright when she heard the inn owners southern drawl. <br />
 &quot;Why shure. We gots' us a knew 'un today. A finer lassie oy never did see. Right afeared a somethin she was. Come shootin in that there door like the dark angel Lucifer hisself was after her. She rushed in an' said her name was Peony. Peony Mryhh. Now ain't that a strange name? Named fer a flower an' a herb.&quot;<br />
 Slowly Peony turned to stare at the man standing in the doorway of the Foxglove Inn. Her heart beat wildly in fear, her mind screamed for her to run, jump out the window if she must. Only she had to escape him.<br />
 As if sensing her eyes on him the man turned to stare at Peony. His eyes were swirling black depths of pain,anger,and hatred. Mostly anger and hatred. His long raven black hair swung as he walked towards her. A strained smile plastered on his lips.<br />
 Peony needed no more urging she jumped from her window seat and straight out the window. She heard the man cursing a blu streak behind her but dared not look. She ran as if pursued by devils. Her bare feet slapped the wet ground as fear, and yearning gave her the ability to escape.</div></div><hr />
