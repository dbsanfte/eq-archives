<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This came to me because we're getting a new cripple spell.<br />
<br />
I've browsed the other posts on this subject, but since we're getting a new cripple I'd like to know if it's going to have the same stacking issues with whatever was causing cripple not to stick previously, or if anyone knows exactly why you get the &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot; when casting cripple? <br />
<br />
I, personally, have only seen this in Ikkinz trials. I don't cripple if I'm not on raids unless the group asks me too since all the parses I'd done showed cripple has absolutely zero effect on MoBs. I did a couple hours of parsing a few months back (I'm going to dig when I get home to see if I can find the files) that showed no improvement whatsoever in any of the Barindu Trials or Kod'Taz. I could never figure out why Cripple never stuck without a few annulls. It wasn't that the Mobs were hasted, their delay didn't change after being annulled to make it stick. <br />
<br />
So, if we're getting a new cripple, I'd like to be able to use it without having to mem something to cancl their buff slots first. I thought that was the point of Nihils ... Slowing without having to Malos first...</div></div><hr />

Further subscription to Everquest, much like<br />
Shaman changes, is 'currently being evaluated.'<br />
<br />
I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've noticed that in ikkinz raids as well.  For a while we thought perhaps the mobs had spells on them, but I doubt that now.  I've been annuling them and it doesn't seem to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">think that I narrowed it down to a bard or rogue ability that they were using.  Think it's rogue honestly, although it's been a while since I had the problems, and whenever I do I don't always pay extremely close attention because i'm busy with other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Incapacitate will land on Ikkinz mobs that won't take Cripple.  So, it must have something to do with the -Dex in Cripple.  No ammount of annuling can make Cripple land, from what I've seen at least.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Somebody knows the answer to this on these forums:)  Come on, tell us:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm guessing it is some sort of innate self buff that cannot be removed that blocks it. As Thoss said, I have dispelled 10 times in a row and then tried to cripple and still didn't take hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If nobody knows, then this is of concern. Whatever self buff or whathoozit they have is blocking cripple, and if the newer OoW MoBs can cast this as well ... what's the point of wasting the extra spell slot?<br />
<br />
Oh, that's right. Because we paid 3AAs and broke our UI for it.</div></div><hr />
