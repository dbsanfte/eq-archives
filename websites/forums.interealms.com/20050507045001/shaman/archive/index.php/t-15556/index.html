<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so I'm farting around in Fungus with this 65 Shaman.  I was playing my 63 Enchanter att, you know, mezzing, charming, whacking the big ones so he can get his shard to ....somewhere. <br />
<br />
So anyway, one's sitting there cooking and I ask him how much he's doing per tic with his DOT's.<br />
<br />
His answer?<br />
<br />
500 a tic? Nope.<br />
<br />
600 a tic? Nope.<br />
<br />
EIGHT HUNDRED A TIC. DOT's ONLY. I tried figuring this up:<br />
<br />
Epic + Ebolt + Pox + Bane + Blood of Saryn + ???<br />
<br />
800 - from somebody sitting on their ass. Impressive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">add curses to that when LDoN comes out and it can top 1200 per tick easily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">breath of ultor, ancient scourge of nife, blood of sarym, pox..just my guess<br />
<br />
131+254+320+111=816<br />
<br />
not really that impressive in any case...be a little less if he didnt have ancient and used bane of nife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/shrug, that's really not that special.  <br />
<br />
You can do that with the standard 65 shaman dot set... pox/ultor + bane/bos  = 776 d/tick or almost 130 dps if you can keep up the pace, never let the dots drop.  You can boost that up a bit with Burning Afflicition, Ancient Bane and/or throwing on epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thats not a lot of dps, and really you cant sustain poxx ultor scourge bane blood unless youre doing NOTHING else, which is rare unless youre soloing. Even then,it's not a lot of DPS, and i personally cant keep up ultor bane scourge blood and poxx indoors while kiting and not medding (unrootable mobs) with ft 15 and voq, at least not easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With a JBB, Plague and Envenomed Bolt, (not including pet), a level 49 shamn can do 398.25 damage per tick.<br />
<br />
JBB = 197.25 dam per tick<br />
<br />
Plague = 55 dam per tick<br />
<br />
Envenomed Bolt = 146 dam per tick<br />
<br />
Shamans are quite impressive from what I've seen so far.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well, necros can do well over 1200 a tick now .. bards can do upwards of 250 dps with songs/melee .. wizards can push into the 350 dps range .. mages can do 250 dps.<br />
<br />
Shaman can do some good dmg, but when you stop to think about the raw dps compared to other classes instead of the big number per tick you are doing, it doesn't seem like a huge ammount.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a &quot; good &quot; shamans dps ( or time traveling ability depending on who you ask ) in a traditional group ~<br />
<br />
<br />
depends on the tank doesnt it?<br />
<br />
i'd give an average of 50 dps as an estimate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A good shaman's dps in a group does indeed depend on the quality of the group, since he adds a % of thier damage, via Ferine Avatar.  Dunno about you, but I keep FA on every melee, plus pets, and Malos/Turgur everything, and have extra to throw Tears at most mobs, when backup healing isn't called for.  This is all while pulling, btw.  I hardly ever let the group waste a primary damage/tanking character on that chore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You forget one thing shaman slow in effect more than doubles every ones DPS by slowing time for your group of 6 peps or even a raid of 72 peps or more.  So I would place shaman sustained DPS very higher the only one higher is a charming Slowing chanter.<br />
<br />
But DPS is not the whole story, are you having fun?<br />
<br />
<br />
And most classes can’t keep a sustained uber high DPS mob after mob after mob as a mage I would put my burst DPS around the 300 to 350 mark and then be out of mana very quick. wiz burst DPS is huge but over a one hour and the DPS drops sharply even pet caining like mad my mage is likely only going to be able to sustain 200 210 dps.<br />
<br />
What’s the dps of slow?<br />
<br />
I think it would make 200 dps look very very small<br />
<br />
Fun&gt; DPS any day</div></div><hr />

So I would place shaman sustained DPS very higher the only one higher is a charming Slowing chanter.Time is NOT slowed when you cast slow on a mob.  Think about if this were true for just one second.  If time really were slowed, then everything would be slowed and everything would still be swinging at the same relative speed, even if you were hasted.  Slow does NOT increase any DPS of melees, it DECREASES the DPS of the mob.  Hasting and buffs increases DPS.  Please stop trying to spread this fallacy.</div></div><hr />

However, if it were really true in-game, then there'd be no need for snare.  Why doesn't a monster move any slower when it's slowed?  Why are the slow spells named with insect behavior in mind?  Oh yeah, I forgot, insects are the key to slowing and speeding up time.  Let me just put my live bee hat on and travel into the future.  Wow, I'm in the hospital in the future, wow that's not cool!  Wait, it's not the future, I just got stung a billion times, passed out and I'm in present time in the hospital, whee fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, back on topic... 800 a tick is what 133 dps?  Thats pretty good.  I usualy cant do that much in a group without having agro issues.  I can usualy contribute around 100dps after slowing without pulling agro (counting my tricked out pet's dps).<br />
<br />
If I am root/rotting solo I will do 90ish... using ultor, saryn, and epic.... but then I am trying not to break root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I admit that I didn't read the whole thing on EQ's msg board, but if slow were to increase your dps by &quot;slowing time around the mob&quot; as per Bracy's theory?   suggestion?   supidity?, than wouldn't that mean that hasting a player would decrease dps by speeding up time around the player?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If I am root/rotting solo I will do 90ish... using ultor, saryn, and epic.... but then I am trying not to break root.<br />
<br />
When I'm solo for real good XP (I'm not flagged for elementals though), I do the same thing, but I root/rot 2 MOBs at the same time. I love seeing ticks of epic x 2, BoU x 2, and BoS x 2. I can't really keep that up through out whole fights but I can for about half of the fight...those ticks are some nice DPS :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Doing the in TEH face thing in Veksar I can break 100dps easily, 120 if I think about it.  I'll dig up logs and post them if anyone is interested.</div></div><hr />

Rotting bile<br />
<br />
and once i get breath just add that on in ... will just need to upgrade to a affliction efficantcy 4 item then. how is this possable you might ask? well for one i specalized in Conjeration not alteration and this is realy my only benifite with that besides a ton more work to pull my wait healing and buffing in groups. once i get antiant bane I will add that in and maybe drop plague ... my goal is for me to get to the point where i can sustain around 1500 damage a tick or more. need to finish off my spell casting master AA ( 2 more lvls in that ) and for the curses to go live then i might be happy. may be then i can burst up to the  2k a tick lvl would be nice though<br />
<br />
yes I have aggro issues while doing this, and i dotn do this unless i know the group can handle this, but i got one word for you .... Shadowknights. the awserer to all your aggro issues in one nice neat pactige. just tell them before hand, or get to know one realy well so that thay know to be extra annoying to the mobs when your in the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
This doesnt always happen, because most of us dont have our CHA maxed yet.  Darn put the starting stats in the wrong place, should have put them all in CHA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Yep, that's what everyone forgets. You have to have a high CHA for it to work.<br />
<br />
I rerolled my 52 Shammy and put all his points into CHA. He also doesn't use weapons or a shield, just carries his CHA steins and wears electrum armor. He is so UBER!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">For fun the other day I went anon and joined a PoV lcy group, they were needing a tank.  No one said a word when I did full 65 Shaman buffs etc..<br />
<br />
Anyway,  I pulled with slow, brought mob to group, and loaded up mount.  Then I put ultor, saryrn, and nife on each mob.  Once everything stuck I'd Q myself.  I was doing 131, 320, 214 = 665 per tick.  I normally redid saryrn and nife, depending on how much the group contributed.  I never used epic and I never melee'd.  Once all dots were on I'd canni continuously (cann5, canni4).<br />
<br />
In summary, shaman can do huge dps and sustain it, but its situational.  I've done the same tactics as above with friends in BoT.  Me and the warrior usually end up flipping the mob back and forth between us (both in melee range, no ponging!) :)<br />
With C3/C5, mount etc.. etc.. a shaman can really sustain this damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">That will work, but as well as you having higher CHA and various time warping devices/spells you also need to be standing south west of the mob, not more than 246 pixels away, and shrink yourself twice. You'll get FAR fewer resists that way.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I put all my practice points into sense heading and it WORKS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">All the posts for this thread should be added to Faerns post count, after all she started it :)<br />

ROFLMAO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Men, how do you handle aggro which such a DPS ? I'm 53 at the moment and,when I decide to get aggro, only guys who manage to get aggro on me are really well equipped 65 SK (at least the only one who I saw getting aggro over me where SK, not even 65 paly/monk/rogue/war could do that when I decided to &quot;taunt&quot;).<br />
Now, this is for the aggro factor (cripple is wonderfull to get aggro, just cast it 3 or 4 times and I'm sure a full army of rogues could backstab the mob without getting aggro before it's dead (well, actually a full army of rogue backstabbing wouldn't make a mob live long). Are torpor/quiesscence that powerfull to help  you tank mobs quadding for 500 or 600 (I think this is what you hunt once you reach 60+) ?<br />
Now speaking about DPS, at 53 I can sustain about 300 DPTick almost non stop (Ebolt+Plague+Epic+Burning Affliction 3 =&gt; 160+60+95 more or less), but I do that only when I solo, while I'm grouping I'm usually pulling/slowing/buffing/healing/controlling adds which let me few time to DoT mobs.<br />
Man I can't wait to upgrade stoicism which is already an incredible spell.<br />
