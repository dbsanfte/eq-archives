<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>inane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to find a good place to camp with a 26 Shammy and 31 SK.<br />
<br />
I'm in LoIO now, and yes I'm pretty tired of it.  Was thinking about staying in Kunark and doing the progression from Lake to FM to OT to DL but that gets old.  I don't want to do a lot of travelin so I'm looking for a good continent to park on.<br />
<br />
The moon seems to offer some good places, just wanted to see what ppl thought.  I'm not too worried about lvl'n the SK as I need to have the Shammy catch up, but these two chars seem to be a pretty good match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Orionv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Give Stonebrunt Mts a try. My wife and I are there with our level 22 characters. Not crowded and good xp and decent loot. Lots of fun...:&gt;</div></div><hr />
