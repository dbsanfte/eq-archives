<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey..new here, but that isnt really the point. Let me just start off by saying that i'm fully aware this is an opinionated question, and that this is a shaman board.<br />
<br />
The other day i started a froglok shaman (impulse, dont shoot me) and i transferred a good deal of my necromancer gear (as it was pretty ambiguous HP/Mana gear) to him. I got about 8 levels in, and im really kinda iffy as to what to play. I dont have the money to support both. I tend to solo alot, as when i die soloing with a necro, 99% of the time it's my own mistake. I absolutely HATE dying because of someone else's ineptitude. But the thing is i enjoy helping people when they deserve it also. Im not too sure what im gonna do, i'm just open to suggestions. So let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well im not quite sure what your after here, if you asking can bolth solo well , absolutly , though shaman dont solo well till the 34+ end of their game. There is no hiding it , low 20's to 34 is rough , i thought about giving it up once or twice , but im damn glad i didnt cause at 65 im withotu question one of the more capible soloers in the game. I might not solo fast , but i have the staying power and mana regen and spells to make me battle quite literaly as long as i want. With a necro you cant really help others , they are pretty much self orientated. So it sounds like you have a choice only you can make.<br />
<br />
1. Be a necro and be a solid soloer you whole like , but not really any ability to help anyone.<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
2. Be a shaman and work your way to being a strong soloer and be able to help people with buffs and play a class that in reality can fill just about any slot if played correctly.<br />
<br />
Though one thing to keep in mind , with KEI being sold like mad these days , soloing up to 34 as a shaman isnt going to be near as hard as it was when i did it. Or for a necro for the record.<br />
<br />
Anyway , hope you gain some insight in some way from my post.  Good luck , you know what i would pick ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no class solos to 60 faster than a necro.  shaman don't start out great soloers  but get better once they hit 51 +</div></div><hr />
