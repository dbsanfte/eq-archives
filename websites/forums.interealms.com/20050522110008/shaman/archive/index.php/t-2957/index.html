<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last two days have been extremely fun for me.<br />
<br />
Day 1: Over the course of an hour, some small scale guild vs guild pvp inside CT and in Ferrott turned into fullscale warfare. Swords slashing, firebolts lighting up the swamp sky and arrows thumping into shields, I could almost hear bones and skulls being crushed as enemy melees smashed into our ranks. But our fighters stood valiant, supported by healers and debuffers in the second lines. <br />
<br />
Fighting an outnumbered battle and steadily loosing, much due to a single bard who was draining all our caster's mana, some reinforcements finally logged on and ported into the battlezone. The tide of the battle turned and the enemy could be vanquished.<br />
<br />
Adrenaline pumping and thirsty for more blood, a scout reported that a large force of dark elves, iksars, trolls and ogres were amassed in Skyfire Mountains, having just slain Talendor.<br />
<br />
We arrange our buffs once again, get some mana back and port into Skyfire in force. My nineteen guildmembers and about as many allies soon spotted the evil enemy at the mouth to the Burning Woods zone. Trying to locate primary targets using bind sight, we slowly prowl up on them... but suddenly one of the huge trolls catches our scent in the downwind. Turning on us he spots us and he lets up a great battlecry and smashes his twohanded club repeatedly into the ground. The entire evil force turns on us and sprints toward us with menacing speed.<br />
<br />
The huge ogres and vicious trolls spearhead their force, which soon crashes into ours. The brutal beasts backhand some of our smaller races, which go flying into nearby rocks or simply get stampeded over.<br />
