<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Another item in this (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=55816) thread that shamans should be concerned about:<br />
<br />
5)  Class Balance <br />
<br />
We are going to look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
They couldn't possibly be talking about shamans here.  I'm assuming that the damage being done by mages, wizards, druids, enchanters and necros is what the concern is about.  Each of those classes have multiple abilities and spells that allow them to really deal a lot of damage in a short period of time.<br />
<br />
Shamans have none of these abilities.  Our role in the high end game has erroded to providing marginal buffs and barely needed debuffs in high end encounters.  If dps is the game in these encounters, then shaman tools are far behind other casting classes.  Our strongest contribution is on mobs that live long enough for our dots to be worth casting on.  But if its DoT dps you want, then a necro is much more effective, PLUS they have DD spells and pets that can add much more damage than a shaman can hope to achieve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The melee classes are dicked over at this point. The next time you feel bad about how underpowered you are as a caster, ask an overlord the last time they went soloing for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, or try playing one (without 2-boxing him with your shaman) and see how life is for a warrior. I have two good friends that are 60+ warriors, and I feel real sorry for them sometimes because they are always desparate for somebody to play with them.<br />
<br />
I've said it before, but warriors especially should get some more powerful AA abilities. They have some good ones, but there are some that could be improved. They get half a point of magic resist per level..how about giving them an AA ability that gives them a large permanent boost to magic resist. Or one that makes them immune to all harmful magic for a certain time period. One that makes them permanently immune to stun. One that gives them 200% haste for 30 seconds or so like their berserk rage. One that lets them use multiple activated disciplines at once (if that's even possible..probably not). You get the idea...there are lots of possibilities to make warriors the killing machines they ought to be. <br />
<br />
I've always looked at the classes this way; there are the true classes, and then the rest of us. The true classes are warrior, cleric, rogue, and wizard. Those four should be the most powerful always because they do one thing well, and only one thing (fight, heal, nuke, and...uh..stay alive).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry Soulstorm, but your opinion is hideously blind.<br />
<br />
Watch the misery of a pure melee in a typical PoP boss mob encounter.  At least in Velious and Luclin, encounters like Ventani, Cursed and Seru were the exception, in pop, they are the norm.<br />
<br />
Warriors and there dependance on Enraging blow items is a pathetic state of affairs, no other class in the game is so utterly dependant on 1 specific hard to obtain type item to perform there role well.<br />
<br />
A torpor/maloless shaman just has to be more cautious and efficient, a warrior without EB simply has the hope that the random number generator is going to be kind to them when they loose agro and need to taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A maloless shaman must rely on the RNG to be kind to allow Malosini to land.  We're all slaves to the RNG!<br />
<br />
But yes, I feel sorry for warriors, they need some upgrades.  Taunt needs to be fixed.  Really.  And remember, any changes that increase melee power, increase your guild's power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When SOE finally breaks down and says that a certain class or group of classes is gimpy, you know there's some pretty ****ing great evidence to back up that point of view.  CMON folks, this is VI, SOE, The Great Satan, and all the other names we've called them over the years.  When THEY admit a class is broken, it's HIDEOUSLY broken!<br />
<br />
They did say &quot;At the very high end&quot; which I would take to mean at 65 with all spells and equipment and focus items and FT15 casters vs. a similarly equipped melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If we fizzled a spell as often as my warrior misses a mob, we'd all be screaming bloody murder.<br />
<br />
Melee damage needs to scale up post 60, and not just with superuber nodrop nontwinkable weapons.<br />
<br />
The melee classes themselves need to have better level-appropriate attack &amp; damage tables, which should scale well with them from 1 through 65.<br />
<br />
They currently scale to 40, stall out for 10 levels, try to pack a lot of catch-up into each point past that, then stall out again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warriors need to be fixed plain and simple.<br />
<br />
In fantasy terms warriors were good at dishing out as well as taking damage.  In EQ terms their role is simliar but at the same way different.  Instead of dishing out damage a warriors role is to absorb damage, and taunt.  However because of the way taunt works they cant even do that at the high level.  More and more often, i am seeing warriors passed up for groups in favor of Sk or pallys because they can taunt like no other class can, and with a few hp buffs can absorb damage as well.  There was one group for example in which a sk 5 levels below the warrior who had to fd for half the fight just so the lvl 60 warrior could taunt enough to gain aggro.  As a shaman I have to be extra careful to wait before i slow in a warrior group because my slow out taunts their natural ability.  There is something wrong when you slow at 80% health and the mob turns toward you to smack you, meanwhile the warrior is mashing is taunt button trying to get aggro back onto himself<br />
<br />
Quite simply warriors need to have their taunt skill to at least the level of a hybrid.  Items like the blade of carnage off AoW are rare as hell and should not a necessity in order to tank in everyday xp groups.  I also think that their damage should be increased and maybe give them some new and unique AA abilities so they can do their job in a raid and an xp group enviroment.  Once that happens then maybe warriors can do the job they were ment to be doing all along</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kusai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I feel they need to work on the warriors Taunt and damage absorption.  But I feel they shouldnt be upgraded to much on the DPS.  The Monk for example is supposed to be the Best Any Angle Damage Dealer in EQ (Per Sony), but Paladins, SK's, Rangers, and Warriors are equal if not better then monks with the same tier of armor and weapons.   I also feel for the melees, only the Rogue while in backstabbing position should have more DPS then the monk.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents worth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A melee without backup is pretty pitiful.<br />
<br />
A melee with the right backup becomes a juggernaught of tanking or a dps frenzyfest, depending what melee you are looking at. Given the right backup, this is what the game revolves around.<br />
<br />
Does that make the melee overpowered, the backup overpowered, or the combination thereof overpowered?  If your answer is the combination thereof, you don't really have a valid complaint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree <br />
<br />
Even keeping weapons in mind, <br />
<br />
-- Monks need to be top melee DPS &quot;from any angle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rogues should be able to out damage monks, but only thru backstab.<br />
<br />
Warriors should be able to hit hard enough to keep agro with minimal or timely use of taunt, without having to rely on rare or difficult to obtain weapons.  DPS should be near sufficient in most cases. Taunt and agro procs should be able to turn things back immediately.<br />
<br />
Rangers should have damage output (not just arrows) just slightly superior to the Warriors; Paladins and SKs.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is the case, it's just that the damage doesn't scale up properly -- and taunt needs to work better.  There are a lot of warriors who'd go for a longer (even doubled) taunt refresh if they could have it work much more reliably.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
According to SoE, Rangers are supposed to be the masters of Duel Weld.  But continual parsing of Ranger Melee DPS show that DW always falls behind 2hs.  As to Archery, no other class needs to spend 27aa points in 1 area to become a effective damage dealer.  Rogues at lvl65 with zero AA will out damage Rangers w/ 45 aa.  Add in that we have no skill based method to remove aggro (monks have FD, rogues evade/escape), our only means of dumping aggro is a spell with a short range and is easy to resist.  On top of that we have to deal w/ our arrows either poofing into thin air, poofing cause LoS, or poofing cause one small part of a mob was in a wall/tree/etc. To make it even worse, we cant chat while fighting because we have to hit a button on the keyboard every 2-3 seconds, and get carpal tunnel from it. And dont tell me that we get spells.  We get a few spells that 1 ranger can buff a raid w/ easily and a few good DD spells at 63/64 finally.  Oh yea, we get SoW also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Warriors really do need an upgrade, taunt and otherwise. Other pure melees as well, but warriors are the ones hurting the most atm.  Disciplines that are either ridiculously short lived making them useless or obscenely long to refresh making them gimmicks need a revamp. A serious look at where the diferent melees should be in terms of damage both in relation to one another AND in relation to caster damage and how the itemisation and availability of said items reflects this is long overdue.<br />
<br />
If they take the time to do it right, I see nothing but good here. There's nothing sadder than parsing a 62 monk with 52 aa and good weaponry and seeing him rate second to a mage or necro pet who's caster also enjoys the pleasure of dotting/nuking in addition to jabober's considerable damage. <br />
<br />
Sure a melee &quot;might&quot; do more damage than we do but Shamans are still one of the most fun, balanced classes out there. No amount of whineplay will change my opinion in that regards. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Looks like most folks here have missed the point I was trying to make.  I'm not arguing that melees are necessarily overpowered, although some classes are clearly more powerful than others.  And I agree with the statements made about warriors.  Other melee classes may need some tweaking as well at the high level game.<br />
<br />
My concern is that in all of this power increase, shamans have been left out of the equation.  Shaman effective DPS is way below any other class.  Sure, a shaman can theoretically generate a fair amount of DPS by stacking DoTs, but this is only effective on long lived mobs where the DoTs don't get applied until after a good deal of hate has been built up by other PCs.  <br />
<br />
Every other caster class has some form of spell and/or ability that allows them to rack up DPS that exceeds what a shaman can do by a large margin.  The possible exception is a cleric.  Cleric DPS may be comparable to that of a shaman, but a cleric has a very solid role in any group or raid that a shaman can't even begin to come close to.<br />
<br />
In terms of class balancing, the shaman class is probably as broken as the warrior class, if not more so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In terms of DPS in exp groups and raids, shamans are down the bottom of the list along with clerics and enchanters (if they're not charming).<br />
<br />
But, a shaman has a very solid role on raids, and exp groups. That of slower/buffer. There are a lot of things that just aren't feasible to do without a shaman. We're not too bad as backup healers either.<br />
<br />
Granted, you only need one shaman to buff and slow, 2 if you want to be safe, but the role is there, and is a strong one.<br />
<br />
I do agree that dots could use some looking at - for us and necros also. They do generate a lot of agro in exp groups and raids, which makes them awkward to use, particularly if you're slowing.<br />
<br />
Shamans and warriors both maybe could use some tweaking, but I wouldn't say either were broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Give the warriors some lovin', they work damn hard and their gameplay really has no real change from level 1 to level 65.  No super scaling damage, no really game-changing AA ('cept AOE taunt which I value).  Warriors are out-gunned by sk's and Pally's in DPS and taunt in many cases.<br />
<br />
More on point, the loot in Planes for the most part (other than Elem. armors) has been mostly priest/caster with few exceptions.  <br />
<br />
Every class should have some adjustments in gameplay as they progress in levels past 59.  A warrior SHOULD have an inherent advantage against magic users that scales quickly from 61-65.  Should a 65 warrior be less powerful than an Ice Burrower of the same level? I think not.   Should it be easier to kill a level 60 warrior than a level 58 golem? Doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
Perhaps summon SHOULD be a third-level AA for Warriors..it'd be the best taunt ever and it'd make sense in the whole EQ milleu.<br />
<br />
some random warrior-oriented thoughts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sorry, but a ranger crying gets zero sympathy from me =P<br />
<br />
The ranger has shaped into an incredibly capable class, against a non walled non insane ac mob, rangers with the correct gear and AA's can easily be the highest sustained damage dealers in the game.  Against pinned mobs rangers tend to average out around the same as monks, tending to be slightly better in melee against high ac stuff, and slightly worse against low ac.<br />
<br />
To make it even worse, we cant chat while fighting because we have to hit a button on the keyboard every 2-3 seconds<br />
<br />
You mean like bards and shaman?<br />
<br />
The worst is by far the balance between warriors and knights though.</div></div><hr />

The issue is that melee are suffering and it's no secret that WARRIORS are the most boned. Why? Bacause I will take a pally/SK main tank over a warrior anyday of the week, becasue I don't like getting slugged after slowing, and I like slowing early.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I see it, there are two factors that should determine if a class needs an upgrade.<br />
<br />
1.  Their ability to get groups<br />
2.  Their ability to solo if they can't get groups<br />
<br />
NOW.........LETS FORGET ABOUT AA POINTS FOR THE TIME BEING.  ASSUME WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LEVEL 60 PLAYER WITH 6AA (very common).<br />
<br />
There are only 4 classes which satisy the above requirements.<br />
<br />
1. Ranger <br />
2. Mage<br />
3. Wizard<br />
4. Necro<br />
<br />
These are my observations from playing in pickup groups for 3 years.  These are the classes that don't fill group roles and can't solo either (60+).  These are the classes that need upgrades.  <br />
<br />
Why Verant feels the need to rebalance the upper level player (65 with 100 AA points) is beyond me, they only make up a small percentage of the server population.  Is this more uber-guild catering?<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Just because warrior taunt is broken doesn't mean they can't get groups.  Most 60+ warriors in my guild get groups in less than 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe what they should do is add a class skill(not AA) to warriors that is kinda like taunt maybe &quot;enraging tuant&quot; it will be on a longer timer then taunt but stack with tuant so in effect youd have 2 taunt buttons to press (i know the name sounds ghey but i think the ideas good) maybe make the second taunt add the same or a little more agro on the tank than normal taunt but be a lvl 40 skill. also making a warriors primary hand hits rarely stun(maybe linked with crit) which will gain agro and will also give a little more skill and functionality to wars(and wars only)<br />
also im for giving each class a skill or two that you buy with ability points at higher lvls<br />
im a 46 shammy and i noticed i had like 45 skill points so i split them between hand to hand and 2hb just for ****s and giggles(skills i dont use)<br />
maybe add that skill to wars at 35 or 40 and add a lvl 45 skill to all classes<br />
even if its a preexsiting skill like parry for shammys and maybe a low capped fd for ranger and an improved bash for sks and pallys<br />
just something to put a bit more life into the game<br />
well im rambeling so ill just leave it at that<br />

<br />
Are you trying to say that the 4 classes you listed are the ones that can neither solo nor fill a role in a group, or are you saying that they are the 4 that can do those things while the rest can not?<br />
<br />
Regardless, some classes are designed to be better solo classes than others.  Typically/ideally, the better a class is at soloing the less specialized they are and thus less desireable for some groups.  I.e. shaman is a very versatile class and solos quite well, but if you have a cleric and enchanter in a group already, the shaman isn't necessarily needed.  The real problem comes when classes like warriors are vital for raiding, but their desirability in an xp group is low due to a flaw in class design (inability to reliably taunt) and they have next to no solo ability.<br />
<br />
Overall, most would agree that of all the melee classes out there the warrior class is probably the most in need of help.  Melee in general has become very underpowered in PoP on the high end due to very nasty AEs that are essentially unresistable forcing everyone to use range attacks.  When you have **** for archery ability and no way to deal damage from a distance, then you are utterly gimped on many raid encounters and I am guessing that is more the issue they are looking to address.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So..... what you're saying is that in addition to the 2nd best buffs in the game, 3rd best healing, sow, best slow, and competent soloing ability, we should also have highly ranked DPS?<br />
<br />
Next time you feel the need to complain that shaman DPS is gimpy, head on over to http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/ and find a thread (there's bound to be one going) about how mages feel they need slow.<br />
<br />
Now.  Do you feel like they're being unreasonable in their expectation of how many benefits a single class should really have?  If so, my point is made.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know how many 60+ warriors are out there rotting away unused on the accounts of people who decided to make a toon to PLAY, and just trot out the warrior for raids.  They're just no fun to play.  A warrior excels at nothing unless you're talking about that brief burst of low-damage they enjoy while defensive, though of course they're going to lose aggro during that time, making things even more difficult.<br />
<br />
There are some pretty popular threads over at http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/ calling for the DISSOLUTION of their entire class.  In EQ reality, the warrior is next to useless (particularly without an EB item), and they know it... well, nobody knows it better than they do, of course.  A lot of warriors at this point would settle for having the class removed from the game, and their old warriors turned into some other melee class, even with 10 levels stripped away.  All because they're tired of being so gimpy.  And who couldn't agree?  Why would you want to play a class that's gone from being the best damage-taker, the primary meat shield -- to a class that can't hold aggro, can't do decent damage, can't cast spells, can't solo, can't get a group, and isn't self-sufficent in any way.  Kinda like this:<br />

<br />
I'm saying those 4 classes can't do either.  They don't bring much to a group, and PoP is a really tough place for those classes to solo 60+.  Piles of AA will help, but that shouldn't be a requirement.<br />
<br />

The possible exception is a cleric.  Cleric DPS may be comparable to that of a shaman, but a cleric has a very solid role in any group or raid that a shaman can't even begin to come close to.<br />

In terms of class balancing, the shaman class is probably as broken as the warrior class, if not more so.<br />

I don't think shaman are at all overpowered but I certainly don't see them as &quot;broken.&quot;  I think shaman is about the only class they got right.  Only possible broken thing is the availability of certain class spells.<br />
<br />
More groups break up due to lack of slower than to lack of healers.  A druid can replace a cleric and there are a lot of clerics and druids running around.  Shaman or enchanter can slow but both classes are also good or at least decent soloers so they can be hard to find.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yah I gotta admit, shaman's group desirability is well up there, I'd say third in line behind clerics and enchanters.  And sometimes above enchanters depending on the group.  <br />
And our soloability is reasonable.  We can solo for exp in PoP, sometimes with efficiency.  Given that is boring as snot, but I guess we fit the requirements.  <br />
<br />
As a hat tip to Gard, there ARE some groups in some situations that would not want a shaman over, say, a beastlord, simply because:<br />
1) They gotta chanter to slow<br />
2) They got a shaman already<br />
3) They're not in need of a slower because the area is so gimpy (who cares, we're talkin PoP here and that's not gimpy).<br />
<br />
I think our only place of discrepancy comes on raids, where our heals should be a bit stronger or our DPS mode should be stronger to compensate for lack of need of our slowing role . . beyond a couple shamans to do that job.  <br />
<br />
The one thing about shamans that I would like to see the MOST is to upgrade the viability of stats, especially strength, and the effect it has on melee damage.  With Fo7 and Talisman of Daiku I can buff a melee 112 points higher in str, in permanent buffs, and FA adds a lot more of course.  If that actually MEANT something, I think there would be no doubt that shaman buffs mattered.</div></div><hr />

I find that rude and ignorant. He has a 56 shaman, and a level 65 of another class (cleric), so has likely experienced being a shaman in PoP, albeit tier 1, and has experienced the level 65 game.<br />

It's not hard to form a viable opinion from a combination of your own experience, from talking to other people, from reading these boards, and from common sense.<br />

Let me rephrase. Somebody who plays a 56 shaman has no idea whatsoever about how well balanced the shaman class is. If you are 65 and agree with the opinion of a pre PoP Shaman, you might want to log on and play some.<br />
Gard is correct. The shaman class is broken. Too many people are posting here, who don't see all the aspects of the game, thus are not entitled to a valid opinion regarding class balance.<br />

What is left of the shaman ?<br />

We used to be all about mana regen and slow. Slow was nerfed hard.<br />
The mana regen is still there, but we have all other classes catching up to us, while cannibalize never received an upgrade. Cannibalize itself takes time to cast and takes HPs off you. <br />
Take the average Valor group to a tier 3 zone and play main healer. Not only will you have a hard time keeping your group alive, but you will not be able to do anything else.<br />
The DoT's are resisted like hell and do 50% damage of what they should for the mana cost.<br />

I Solo'd well pre- and post-PoP.  I don't have much trouble finding a group if I really want to.  I find that even though our guild is very shaman heavy (4-5+ on many raids) we still keep pretty busy with a little thought and coordination.  So, what is there that's so broken about shaman again?  We can solo, we are quite desireable for xp groups, we have a very vital function in raids and with some creativity shaman can stack on raids as well.  Where's the big gaping hole that makes us so broken?<br />
<br />
&quot;We used to be all about mana regen and slow. Slow was nerfed hard.&quot;<br />
-Some mobs mitigate slow sure...  But the need for slow in an xp group or raid is still there.  Shaman are still desired for our superior slowing abilities as well as our survivability.  Mitigation makes us less of an absolutely required class, but we're still a highly desireable class.<br />
<br />
&quot;The mana regen is still there, but we have all other classes catching up to us, while cannibalize never received an upgrade. Cannibalize itself takes time to cast and takes HPs off you.&quot;<br />
-Are you on drugs?  With the exception of necros, no class comes even remotely close to a shaman's mana regen ability.  Hit canni5 each time it goes off and don't even bother with canni4, you effectively gain FT30 something.  Necros get an effective FT of 50 with their best lich, but a shaman can still easily beat that with a few Canni4s.  As far as short term massive mana recovery in a pinch, a Canni5+Q means ~800mana in about 8 seconds for a few hitpoints.  That's a lifesaver of an ability there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take the average Valor group to a tier 3 zone and play main healer. Not only will you have a hard time keeping your group alive, but you will not be able to do anything else.&quot;<br />
-Take a druid to a Tier3 zone as main healer without a slower and see how well he does.  Take a cleric to a Tier3 zone without a slower and while he may get by, he sure as hell won't be doing anything other than healing.  Class interdependancy, it's part of the game design.<br />
<br />
&quot;The DoT's are resisted like hell and do 50% damage of what they should for the mana cost.&quot;<br />
-OK, here I won't argue with you.  I think DoTs are underpowered considering their resist rates and duration.  IMO adding a -30 resist check to Ultor and Blood similar to Necros Blood would go a long way towards fixing that though.<br />
<br />
&quot;The shaman on raids is a buffer. That's the role. Drop some patch heals on the MT and you are done for the night. Group heals are for paladins.&quot;<br />
-Malos and Turgur's never get used by your raid shaman?!?!  I dunno how your guild raids or where, but we typically have anywhere from 2-5 mobs on a pull on our raids and with multiple shaman coordinating we have them all malos/slowed within seconds.  That makes a huge difference for the split tanks and mezzers.  When we have smaller pulls, that's we start breaking out the Velium Strikes and Tears to have some fun seeing who can get the biggest crit or just tally up the most damage overall on bosses.  With the pace of our raids, we keep 4 shaman busy pretty much fulltime and a break here and there to cast our 'weak' nukes is a welcome one. ;)</div></div><hr />

you stuck your finger on the wound , sadly SoE made an announcement some time ago where they said they had no intention of fixing stat importance though they were aware of it not working as intended , i think they can't /won't do it because they'd have to modifiy every creatures , as npcs uses stats as well and changing the impact of stats on pcs would impact mobs . <br />
<br />
reguarding warriors , i think it is about time they get a big bone , they worked hard but have stayed in the dark for a long time , they really could use an upgrading . their taunt needs a big upgrade , they need something interesting at high end ( warrior is soooo boring ) like a few tweaked abilities ( i'd like berzerker rage (crit frenzy 2 ), push back (pushes mob back ), stunning blow (low duration unresistable ), summon , sword mastery ( where you'd have to select a weapon spe ) , athletics ( run 4-5-6 ) , acute vision ( infravision for those poor blind tanks ! ) , precise attack disc ( would make sure most of the hits actually hit the target for 30 secs ) ....<br />
<br />
as for bitching now while everyone add something, nerf chanters/druids/mages/necros  charm soloing , i am ****ing tired of a charm class taking all the mobs and nameds in zones like BoT or PoTactics while your group is miserably at bay looking for a place to fight ( and view that a whole group spot is camed by one single charming idiot.. )<br />

When you are 65 and in the elemental planes, it's not *some* mobs mitigating slow, it's *some* mobs NOT mitigating slow. The need for Slow might be there to make things easier, but there's no need whatsoever for shaman slows. If you are honestly saying that shamans are desireable for our superior slow, then you have to check some numbers. Shaman slow is overrated at this point. Our buffs are more important than the slow. Tell me the game hasn't changed.<br />

Canni V is a luclin ability. Check out the spell lists and you will see that every caster class got an upgrade to their mana regen ability with PoP, while the shaman class did not. What was it you didn't understand ?<br />

&quot;Class interdependancy&quot; is a nice term. Make sure you know what it means. Add a chanter to to the group of the shaman, the druid and the cleric being the respective main healers of their group and tell me the shaman class isn't broken.  <br />

Malos and Turgur's are a given. Most trash mobs die so fast though, that i dont waste the mana on it and nuke instead. The damage mitigated through the damage i do is compareable and i get less aggro.<br />

On a side note:<br />
It takes 3 Enchanters less to lock down 5 mobs than 5 Shamans to malos and slow them...and they are going to live even without a heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fine. I'll take elemental charm.<br />
<br />
Laughingwoman: &quot;There are some pretty popular threads over at http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/ calling for the DISSOLUTION of their entire class. In EQ reality, the warrior is next to useless (particularly without an EB item), and they know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
My ass. Raids still use warriors and main tanks -- tho only for /disc defensive. And far as weapons, XTC, AoW, and Xanamech all drop EB/TB items. The first is a 3-group raid easy. BoCs are dropable.<br />
<br />
Anyway, all that said, no class is worse off than warriors. A guild needs like 2-3 but most larger ones have like 10. In exp groups, I'll take a pally every time in PoP for aggro-control. Tho, it takes a well-equipped pally with some AA to really do well. Still, we're at a point where there are many of those.<br />

<br />
The thread Skiec linked will show you, we aren't having mana issues. We didn't get a PoP upgrade to manaregen because we didnt NEED one. Even a shammy as greedy as myself will concede, we don't need any improvment there. Of course, we pay for it with lousy DPS, but we are still kings there. <br />
<br />
As for lvl 65 shm with 100+ aa's being the minority...I beg to differ. 65 here, full spellbook and 120aa and there are shaman on my server who make me look gimp. Still only 5k raidbuffed here and nowhere near al the abilities I would like. <br />
<br />
Now, back to the thread, I think we all agree that warriors are pretty fed up with being last in line and so gear (BoC) dependant. When you see a 65 Overlord with 8khp die in the Hole because he couldn't take 2 elemental greenies, you know that class is indeed &quot;broken&quot;. <br />

<br />
I personally think the flaw in your logic is that shamans aren't supposed to be the main healer.  So, for those listed groups, you obviously don't add a slower with no healing ability to the shaman's group, you add another healer.  Different classes are going to be dependent on different other classes, depending on where their overall strengths and weaknesses lie.  While we can often serve as the main healer for a group, that's not where our strength lies, thank god.  I'd go insane if my only job was cheal, cheal, cheal - no offense to the clerics.  ;)<br />
<br />
But back to the original subject...  Melees, particularly warriors do need an upgrade of some sort.  My shaman and my warrior are both 63 atm, and while the duo is quite powerful, there are a lot of shortcomings to the warrior.  Area taunt has helped somewhat with the aggro issues, but that's not usable often enough to make it super useful in an average exp group.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I know, I'm only 63 and not in the elemental planes, so I don't know *** I'm talking about, but /shrug...  It's a pretty safe bet that once things are hitting for 500+, you need a decent slower and a decent healer, or you're either going to die or have insane downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">On the original topic - anyone who doesn't know what this change is about hasn't reached the part of the game it refers to (a comment I mena no offense by - some people just aren't playing that part of the game at the moment).  This isn't about experience groups - its about mobs like Tallon Zek, or Emmerick (in the Agnarr event).  For these mobs, we put one - yes, one - melee on the mob.  Everyone else shoots it.  Hopefully, most of the melees pull out bows and shoot, too (/cheer warrior bow damage? erm ...).  What do you do if you are a melee class with no archery?  Well, its sort of a pretty place where the fight happens .... and it is funny to see that one tank fighting Emmerick.<br />
<br />
Now, there are places before where this happened (Ventani - when he existed, Cursed, old school strategy for Hoshkar and Zlexak), but its frequent now.  And that's bad.  To add insult to injury, for several other encounters - Vallon Zek at the least, but arguably also Saryrn and a few others - its better to use a knight as the primary combattant that a warrior.  This is a problem that continues, and worsens, in Tier 4.<br />

Melee roles at the high-end need evaluation.  Whether shaman need evaluation, too, doesn't matter.  These problems are bigger than the problems other people might have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Arell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Melees need something to assist in the old DPS category.  My main is a paladin and I consistenly see how warriors have issues outtaunting a knight if the knight is half ass taunting.  SKs get decent DPS with pet and right AA's.  Paladin DPS is blah but as the clerics and chnaters repeatedly tell me that in pure xp groups the paladin ability to stun and backup heal helps a ton.  Outside of raids where you need a warrior for defensive or just more hp absorption they are not needed.  And that sucks cause they are crucial for raids but basically are second class for xp.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see improved damage discs for all melee (friggin pet classes are sick damage) to make up some ground and warriors need a major boost to make them fun and a more group desirable class.</div></div><hr />

Before they officially announced that they were going to do something with melee, the general consensus I'd seen across multiple class boards was that the pure melee (warrior/rogue/monk) were hands down the most in need of lovin. <br />
<br />
Though there is a reference to 'high end', I don't think they just mean endgame raids....Any pure melee hunting in PoP at all has a lot of legitimate issues to bring to the table right now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">What is left of the shaman ?<br />
<br />
We used to be all about mana regen and slow. Slow was nerfed hard.<br />
The mana regen is still there, but we have all other classes catching up to us, while cannibalize never received an upgrade. Cannibalize itself takes time to cast and takes HPs off you. <br />
Take the average Valor group to a tier 3 zone and play main healer. Not only will you have a hard time keeping your group alive, but you will not be able to do anything else.<br />
The DoT's are resisted like hell and do 50% damage of what they should for the mana cost.<br />
The shaman on raids is a buffer. That's the role. Drop some patch heals on the MT and you are done for the night. Group heals are for paladins.<br />
<br />
But yes, shamans are fine.<br />
<br />
Do you even play a shaman or are you basing your opinion off the whine posts you read occassionally on this site?<br />
<br />
Put your money where your mouth is. Tell me how a 61 Ranger or 61 Mage with 6AA points is going to solo in PoP<br />
<br />
While it would be more difficult for the ranger to solo with just 6 aa, there are PLENTY of non-summoning snarable mobs for a ranger to kite (almost all of PoD, much of storms, almost all of valor - that would be slow though, etc).  Magicians have found some nice spots and mobs too, particularly high level caster mobs that chain cast while the mage nukes and their insane 61+ pets deal damage.<br />
<br />
Necros have it even easier than mages due to snare.  A necro with a CoD key, goodnight!  Even after the charm changes they can still rake in xp if they want to.<br />
<br />
Wizards I imagine, just like the other classes, solo the *exact* same way that they did at levels under 61.  There are wizards and druids that quad in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Last night in NToV clearing named mobs we had 8 shaman (I don't know why but every shaman on the damn server seems to be pledging our guild and officers won't tell them no).

Warriors need better taunting, I agree.  Better melee?  Uhm... I'm sure it could be smoothed out but I don't know if it needs to be raised much.<br />

This challenge was not meant for Viscerator, but since you decided to take up the cause I will address your post.<br />
<br />
1.  What exactly is a ranger supposed to kite with?  Good gracious please don't say arrows.<br />
<br />
2.  Mages.  They found some nice solo spots?  Huh?  Would you care to elaborate?  I've never seen a mage soloing ANYWHERE in Tier1.   <br />
<br />
3.  Have you ever tried to pull the entrance to CoD?  I have, it's very easy to get adds.  Of all the times I've zoned into CoD I've never seen a single Necro soloing there.  Necros are dead in about 1 round of melee in CoD.<br />
<br />
3.  Wizards.   Ok they can quad-kite.  We already knew that, but this isn't wyverns in cobalt scar with 3200 hp's, this is PoP where mobs have 13,000 hit points.  Yes a wizard can quad.  Is it efficient?  No.  Also most stuff in Tier1 goes light blue at 63.</div></div><hr />

A curse dot ( one that checks vs magic like epic, epic is WAAAAY outdated now as far as damage goes )<br />
<br />
25% Lure slow that effects mobs previously immune to slow by any other class. Make it an AA ability, last 4 minutes and a 10-15 min refresh<br />

Group-wise pure melee are also at the bottom of the wanted list in most every situation.  Yes people may take them, but usually only as a last resort (in PoP).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Froglegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Waaaaaait a minute, shamen are complaining about dps?  Ask a cleric what their DPS is in a group.  DPS is not the measure of a group member's usefulness.  When you sit LFG for 3 hours like many monks do, then we'll talk about you being an underpowered class.  <br />
<br />
Desirablility in groups is the true measure of your class's usefulness and power.  You slow, buff, and heal...probably in that order of importance and that's damn near enough.  Doing some DPS is a side benifit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I posted it previously and a few others have hit on it as well.  I'm guessing here, but I THINK the specific areas they are looking at for upgrading melees in some way are those boss fights in PoP where it's suicide for a melee to actually get within melee range other than the MT.  If you haven't seen them yet, you will and you will understand that some of these encounters are just ridiculous.  I know for a fact that I outdamage most of our melee other than rangers on these fights.  <br />
<br />
The AEs they've added to certain mobs with -400 or worse resist checks make it suicide to send in melee and so everyone is forced to sit back and used range attacks other than a single tank and perhaps some charmed pets.<br />
<br />
In general range attacks have become very vital in PoP and normal melee classes have suffered.  Check your local uber guild and see whether they're heavily recruiting Wizards/Rangers or Rogues.  I'd be willing to bet that in all but a few cases you'll find a Ranger/Wizard or even a druid/mage/necro is more needed in PoP than any normal melee class.  <br />
<br />
Warriors, as has been said here and everywhere else, are in need of some major help.  Not only do they suffer from the same issues as other melee, they have major problems filling their primary role as tank outside of the raid environment where defensive/evasive and AET are their saving graces.<br />

My ---52--- necro with ---0--- AA can solo in PoN and PoD.  I was doing it last night for kicks, pretty good exp.  My 61 monk with 3aa gets owned in about 30 seconds.  And no 3 more aa would make no difference.  As I said before, thank you, pull through.<br />
<br />
Oh and PS edit - Many necros used to solo in CoD until they nerfed charm resist rate.  One necro aquantance of mine got 300 AA in about a month charming there.  Now that resist rates are up and necros can't lower MR it's pretty much out for them.  Regardless they can solo in PoV and PoS without any trouble to 65 and aa beyond.  Hell you can even get 65 in PoD doing the mobs inside the castle. (Yes you can get past all the casters solo, yes there's room to both root rot or aggro kite if you're uber and daring).</div></div><hr />

More groups break up due to lack of slower than to lack of healers. A druid can replace a cleric and there are a lot of clerics and druids running around. Shaman or enchanter can slow but both classes are also good or at least decent soloers so they can be hard to find.<br />

You're kidding right?  Necros solo the crap out of CoD, in fact when I want to take  a group there the necros in my guild whine and say stay away its a necro playground. <br />

As for pulling, its called FD.  Add in the 65 undead charm and necros are racking in aa's. Granted not as fast as before the charm changes, where I think one necro in my guilds fastest aa was something like 14 minutes.  <br />

Melees suck in pop, they need upgrades badly.  We do not. <br />

Is it efficient compared to grouping at that level?  No, but then again at level 61 only a few classes can solo xp faster than they can group for xp and that's been pretty much the case since before PoP.  Some classes simply aren't designed to solo effectively, that's by design.  Some classes gain the ability to solo effectively later in their lives with specific abilities/spells, but regardless every class in EQ isn't meant to solo nor should it be.<br />
<br />
If you want to play solo, pick a class that's designed with that in mind.  Some people seem to forget that EQ is DESIGNED to be a game played by groups of people.  The ability to solo is a bonus certain classes get, usually at the cost of group effectiveness.  Now, if you want to complain that certain classes have become too powerful in group/raid settings considering their ability to solo... that's another topic entirely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Warriors definately need some fixing in the taunt department, and perhaps with dps through improved discliplines or abilities.   Despite the silly situation where rangers can't hit mobs with their bow when a mob is along a wall, I just don't see where melee's need improvement.  Lower dps (through whiffing mostly) from top-end PoP boss defenses, then were made too high with nothing to counter it.   It shouldn't necessarily mean melees need more innate power.<br />
<br />
What I'm afraid is going to happen is, there will be a trickle down effect, trivializing lesser PoP or non-PoP boss encounters.  Not saying an elemental plane capable guild, is going to storm through NToV.   But, if all melees are going to be upgraded damage wise, it's going to affect every melee regardless of stature on the totem pole.  AoW has become a 3-group encounter, where just a year ago, it was a full-size raid encounter.   Naturally, AA's and gear is a major part of it, but stronger innate dps will trivialize it (or any similar expansion encounter) even further.<br />
<br />
There are other some measures to fixing this:<br />
<br />
1. Armor/Weapons with focus effects improving class abilities/AA/disciplines.  This can be done with appropriate level of power slapped on the item (no drop), depending what stage the player is in, so that lower-end players can't obtain them.<br />
<br />
2. They can look at the shaman and chanter.  <br />
<br />
They could easily improve Cripple once or even twice.  Would prefer it be something just shamans can do.  <br />
<br />
For some reason Sony is so secretive about stats.  Once, they briefly listed what stats do, but it was still vague.  I have not come across an RPG, online or not, that is so secretive. <br />
<br />
-Int or Wis can have an improvement in taunt.  Perhaps even charisma could take part.<br />
-Strength can increase chances of critical blows with non-projectile weapons.<br />
-Dexterity would work with Atk, to increase chances of hitting, including backstabs and critical bow hits.<br />
-Agility increase defenses, including discs or alternate abilities.<br />
-Stamina can increase the chance of landing max damage.<br />
<br />
Because we still only have 15 buff slots available, players will have to choose what's more appropriate for them, especially when it comes to Int/Wis/Cha and agility buffs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my take on it.<br />
<br />
And Sciek hits it on the head about the soloing.  Soloing is a whole different world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Take the average Valor group to a tier 3 zone and play main healer. Not only will you have a hard time keeping your group alive, but you will not be able to do anything else.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand how you think this means you are broken?  What do you think clerics are doing?  We certainly don't have a lot of mana to do anything else.  Although in some situations a shaman can be the main group healer, the group healer by definition heals.  When I'm in PoV, I can play with my hammer toy or nuke once a fight.  When I'm in a harder zone I sit on my butt and med between heals and never think of trying to do anything else except possibly some emergency crowd control.  And I won't even do a PoV group much less a harder zone without a shaman (preferred) or enchanter to slow.  I would be calling med breaks after every other fight if we tried to kill with no slow.<br />
<br />
Seeing as your shaman is an alt and not even close to 65, what makes you think your opinion matters ?<br />
<br />
My shaman was my main for a long time but when it got time to raid I was in a guild with 5 higher shaman and no clerics so I switched mains.  All of my high end game experience is on my cleric.  I will admit that I don't know the shaman class as well as I should...which is why I'm here reading and trying to learn.  And I really doubt that this board would thrive as it has if posters really felt that no one under 65 had an opinion that mattered so I'll continue to post when I think I have something to say. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't mean to get so off topic.  I think it has been obvious a long time that warriors need help.  I'd pick a paladin or SK over a warrior for an xp group any time...specially if I have an enchanter slowing.  When I have an enchanter slower with a warrior tank I heal the enchanter a lot more often then I heal the warrior.  Warriors need to be able to hold agro.  I liked the idea in this thread about adding agro to kick.  I also agree that something needs to be changed to give melee something to do in PoP raids.  I don't have a lot of faith that whatever they do to &quot;fix&quot; things will be right but at least they realized something needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

Some people seem to forget that EQ is DESIGNED to be a game played by groups of people.  The ability to solo is a bonus certain classes get, usually at the cost of group effectiveness.  Now, if you want to complain that certain classes have become too powerful in group/raid settings considering their ability to solo... that's another topic entirely.<br />
<br />
Exactly...god we are so broke as a class in the group/raid setting simply because all we ever read on this board is &quot;I solo here, I solo there, I solo'd -insert name-, whats the best place to solo?&quot; Solo-ing is fine but damn people stop dumbing down our class cause you want to solo better.<br />
<br />
  I will admit that I don't know the shaman class as well as I should...which is why I'm here reading and trying to learn.<br />

This isnt exactly a great place to learn the class unless all you aspire to do is solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Froglegs has a good point about 50 something Necros and Wizards being able to solo in Tier1.  What he doesn't mention is that each kill they use nearly 100% mana, and the experience for these mobs drops WAY off when you hit 61.  Experience is much better in an efficient group, but the point that I'm trying to make is they can't GET groups.<br />
<br />
As far as 60-61 Necros soloing in CoD, that may have been the case in days past, but certainly not anymore, unless I am zoning into the wrong zone or something.  I don't see them doing it at all.<br />
<br />
The only true soloing in PoP for a level 61 with 6AA (this is a helluva large percentage of the server population) is done by druids, chanters and bards, after that there is a huge dropoff in terms of reward and risk for the other classes that can manage it.<br />
<br />
As far as pure melee not being able to solo, no kidding they were never meant to solo, that's why they're so good at what they do (absorbing damage or dishing it out).  The fact that you even ask that question shows me you are not familiar with the class balancing that Verant has been tinkering with since the game was introduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Froglegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Gooshemz....You really don't know necros...saying necro and OOM in the same sentence is like saying warrior and no ac, or shaman and no buffs, or druid and no snare.

<br />
My 52 necro ends a kite of a blood raven nearly FoM...You really don't understand what you're talking about...<br />
<br />
At level 60 a necro with ---0--- AA can solo the CYs in PoD with ease.  At 62 with the new root spell they can solo inside the castle with ease.  At 61 you can do it but you have to aggro kite so you have to be good at being a necro rather than just be any old necro.  Necros do NOT need AA.  PoV and PoS are soloable at 61 as well.<br />
<br />
As I noted about CoD - since they changed Charm it doesnt happen as much anymore.  It used to be sick AA.  At lvl 65 one acquantance got 300 AA in one month.</div></div><hr />

You proved nothing. Wanna take this a bit deeper? Explain to me what it is your seeing that so many others are not. <br />
<br />
DoTS are useless, my nuke takes so long to cast that by the time I malos and slow the mob is half dead. In Valor I can cover heals pretty well, but i have AA's and elemental armor so I heal better than the average shaman, but this isnt about me its about US, the shamana class as a whole. I will admit, i dont stoop to PoValor groups i would log before I go there. I do not enjoy playing with players who have less than great gear. No, i am not saying they are bad players, but IF i even bother to log on for exps now, I prefer to make the most of my time. <br />
I've played a shaman 3 years, before that a warrior. I was level 60 and skipped the medoicre guilds and went straight for the best my server had to offer. Ever do Coirnav Froglegs? Ever go to PoFire and realize that your slow is the only reason your there? Ever notice that mobs in PoP die so fast the piss poor 2.2k DoTS spell that seemed so cool on paper is nothing compered to the back to back 1.5k DD nukes the druid just cast? And in less time it took your DoTS to run? <br />
<br />
Lets be honest, of all hybrid caster style classes, we are the weakest of em all. If your happy just casting Malos and slow, congrats, im glad you found your niche but I for one strive to make more of my self but feel so inadequate when compaired to every other caster. <br />

 Hmm sorry, but slowing is no longer a &quot;niche&quot;. From Absor: &quot;[mitigation] is not a &quot;slow cap&quot;, when it is working properly&quot;  He goes on to say thay slow mitigation is not working properly right now. That means guess what, a Beastlord's slow, and even weapon slow proc, does the same job on the more mitigated mobs as your slow.<br />

Then there's your problem.  You're measuring your class against soemthing that SOE isn't trying to achieve.  Desiirability in groups is one of the only things that gets any sort of change out of them and thus it can be quite easily inferred that it is how they balance classes.<br />
<br />
Your elitism is the source of your problem with your class.  You do a few things really well but evidently they aren't the things you WANT to do well.  If you want to nuke well play a wizard or mage.  If you want to DoT well play a necro or druid.  You're playing a shaman.  You slow, malo, heal, and buff well.</div></div><hr />

When did shaman get SoW? When did druids get it? Druids get SoE did we? All the way up to Luclin Shaman and druids got the exact same heal, then the retuned heals got introduced and the got a huge upgrade to ours...why? Slow. PoP introduces mitigating slow and did we get our heals retuned to compensate for negating our supposed advantage over druids? Nope. <br />
<br />
Clerics nuke better than I do, should I go play a cleric so i can nuke like them. <br />
<br />
Get a clue dude, you simply lack the history of the classes to hold a legitimate argument cause you are stuck in this &quot;one class for each job&quot; mode and fail to realize its supposed to be balanced. <br />
<br />
Oh, if you ever make it to the tier four zones you will quickly notice that PoE, PoW and PoA your cold and poison nukes are resited so much that its pointless to cast em. Damn near every mob gets the best mitigation and the yard trash mobs hit for 1.1k or more, so that pathetic heal you have is usless.<br />

<br />
Exactly. (now beside your utter rubbish that necros and wizzys can't solo, and lets not forget ANY soloing is better then NO soloing at all - and that's the first time I've even heard quadding called inefficent experience)<br />
But melee DO NOT dish out great damage or indeed absorb damage signcificantly better than certain hybrids, at least enough to out weight the advantage of hybrid tanking with their instant agro control.<br />
<br />
So basically pure melee are NOT great at dishing out damage (compared to many casters, some hybrids, and pet casters) in PoP, and their damage absorbtion in the case of monks and rogues is subpar to hybrids (and in very extreme cases some pets), and in the case of warriors is better, but NOT enough to offset their lack of agro control.<br />
<br />
<br />
Therefore warriors especially, but also monks and rogues, and pure melee in general, both deserve and need upgrades in PoP/past L60.<br />
<br />
So as we've established that as pure melee are NOT fine, and have dropped FAR behind their intended placing with PoP and levels 61-65, you now agree that pure melee do need and deserve any upgrades forthcoming?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And similarly you're comparing the end game to the standard game.  What percent of people are in the elemental planes dealing with your resist issues?  Not terribly many.  If SOE balances you to fit the high end it'll make all the lower end shammies (who are alraedy horribly powerful for their level by comparison) even more disgusting.<br />
<br />
The majority of shamans are in PoV or less.  The majority of shamans are definitly in balance if not well above balance.  Ubers have a mistaken assumption that SOE cares about them more than 90% of their player base...SOE cares about money and keeping those 90% happy.  90% of the money gets 99.5% of the attention and that's how it has to be in any business model.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Frog--<br />
<br />
It could unbalance but the balance comes back in with the gear. I have 5500 mana 6900 hps buffed, the average PoV shaman does not. The mana cost and the risk of death compensates for the advantage. I have all my spells but there are a lot of PoV shaman who dont even have Malos yet so the risk of slow getting resisted is very real. So, slow is resisted then you cast it a second time and gain agro. Now, lets say your slow lands and fully buffed you have 4500 hps. Can the cleric or druid heal you fast enough to keep you alive? Can the MT steal agro off fast enough to save the healers mana? <br />
 Why do Wizards get concusion? To reduce agro from that 4k crit nuke. Why do good clerics and druids root the mob at the tank? To force agro on the tank so that first heal doesnt steal agro. All Int casters get spell casting subetly to further reduce the agro risk of powerfu nukes. Enchanters got a 1500 point self rune AA skill to compensate for mez and tash agro. Shaman got mitigated slows for one of the highest agro spells in EQ. Its up to the main healer to try and keep you alive.<br />
<br />
I know all to well what its like to be the average shaman. PoFire mobs bridge that gap nicely so it makes you feel the same amount of threat that you do in Valor.<br />
<br />
In closing, shaman are a priest class yet we are more necro than priest. IF you have Elemental chain arms and AHA3 you might heal just well enough to help keep your MT alive but from what I see in PoP, Tnarggs barely helps a cleric out. <br />
Like I said, after 3 years of being completly identical to druids in healing, they got a huge upgrade due to slow effectiveness. Slow is now mitigated so where is the advantage now? Clerics had some DD spells but mainly undead was the focus, now they have a 1100 dd nuke that is faster cast than my ice nuke that does 175 points less. So why does a cleric out nuke me? Is it my DoTS? Unless soloing, do you really use DoTS in a Valor group? If you had BoS, would you use it? and if so would it be effective, would it run its course or would 2 or 3 ticks get shaved off due to the low hit point mobs die so fast? I hope by now you see where i am going. We are woefully inadequat in PoP due to low hit point mobs, DDs take to long to cast and heals cant even heal one melee round in a tier 2 zone. Would I be to powerful then?</div></div><hr />

The original vision had warriors as 3rd for damage, 5th if you counted spells.<br />

2 Monk (any side)<br />
3/4 Knights with spells<br />
5 Warrior<br />
6/7 Knights without spells<br />
<br />
I'll assume SK was supposed to be before pally as they have better dmg spells for the pally heals.  Warriors sacrificed DPS for hp and ac which was a viable balance.<br />
<br />
I've left out ranger because in the start we all know rangers couldn't do crap for dmg...or really crap for anything.  Now that they have archery they're almost in a sort of &quot;wizard&quot; role.  They're too hard to call.<br />
<br />
There used to be a whole ratio set as well...I cant remember it...it was something like 1.6/1.4/1.2/1.0 and supposed to represent the damage capabilities of the various melee'ers.  SOE designers had leaked it and the monk boards were always testing it to make sure it was still good...stopped working long ago.  As it is now warriors are definitely outdamaging many monks though they still can't come close to rogues.<br />

<br />
By and large, the 3 pure-melee classes are all 'one-trick-ponies'. Each basically only brings one major thing to the table, but there are a large number of situations where other classes can do that same thing anywhere from almost-as-well, to as-well, to better--and those other classes also bring their other abilities on top of that. (not saying that there aren't other classes that are generally wanted for just one thing at times)<br />
<br />
I think this pretty much sums up the basic complaint for all 3. Even if the majority of the time it falls in the 'almost-as-well' category above, those other abilities that are brought to the table by other folks quite often cause the pure-melee classes to get pushed aside. Granted, not everyone you run into is min/maxing, and granted you make friends and have guildies to group with that don't think about things like that....but the problem still exists. <br />
<br />
We're (my main is a monk btw) dependent on groups, but there are other classes that can do our job and add quite a bit more on top of it. The soloing thing gets brought up quite often, but the context I usually see it in is more that they'd rather be able to have the option to get 'some' xp while they're lfg or don't have much time that day versus not being able to do anything at all. I think expanding the level range of xp giving mobs post 60 will alleviate that a bit for some--will have to see how that goes.<br />
<br />
These are just the general feelings I pick up from reading the other class boards, with a bit of my own experience mixed in. Naturally everyone in every class wants to feel like the bring something powerful to the table. Right now the pure melee classes don't seem to be standing out in the crowd enough for the one thing they each do well (for my own class, I'm not quite sure what our 'one-thing' is supposed to be anymore--I think we're still waiting for SOE to figure that out.)<br />
<br />
That being said, there's no easy fix to any of this....SOE seems to be focusing on damage increases. I'll have to reserve judgement on that as well.<br />

I think you might be suffering from a case a necro-uberitess or possibly just some simple arrogance.  I assume you're talking about charming deathbone magus.  While this is possible the risk/reward ratio for soloing at the PoD is skewed in the wrong direction.  When your charm breaks during a fight you will have two mobs (1 is not snared!) ready to kill you, and pray they don't start nuking when you FD.

I'll agree that druid healing compared to shaman healing, taking slow mitigation into account, is BS.  At first I was inclined to think, &quot;well we can solo pretty well still, so our healing suffers in that respect&quot; then I woke the hell up and remembered Druids can solo quite effectively as well heh.<br />

Umm I need to move to your server, becouse there is more then a few shaman and enchanters on my server. to the point i can not find a single group most times i even try logging on. and yes i can solo, in only about one places curently ( untill thay do something about spots you can solo per lvl ) and well its quite the crowded camp.<br />
<br />
I just want to know one thing:<br />
<br />
where is our upgrade to melee, we have not ever had one that i can recall. ( the nerfing of the rage line could not be counted as a upgrade in my opinion. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Warriors:<br />
They can't buff up warrior taunt significantly because they have already FUBARed things with the game-breakingly overpowered defensive discipline.  /defensive + EZAggro = /yawn on raids.  This sucks hard for non-raiding warriors though.  My money is on them jacking up warrior DPS so that they are well ahead of knights.<br />
<br />
Necros:<br />
The claim that necros cannot solo in PoP is, well, insane.  Root-dot, charm, aggro kite, W T F are you thinking, really?  Necros OWN non summoning mobs (and fare pretty well against summoners).  *I* was getting good xp root dotting in the PoD CY at 61, and a necro is better at that, with more options to boot.  They can solo very well at all levels of PoP advancement.  Nightmare, Disease, Valor, Storms, Decay, Honor (keep in mind they are taking out the summons, and necros can deal with unroot/snareables much better than we can), Fire....you can't get from 61-65 soloing in those zones?  Necros are the only class I know of that can solo quickly to 65 without even passing a Justice trial (because they have access to some higher level camps in PoD that other classes cannot do).<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
What bones shaman in PoP is mitigation.  Mitigation on xp mobs is flat-out moronic.  Mitigation should be bosses only.  Slow is our meal ticket.  Slowing the same as a beastlord or a freaking ranger is outrageous.<br />

Melees:<br />
There are some fights where melees are useless.  Just like we were on, say, Tormax raids a ways back.  That sucked for us, and I don't want it to suck that way for my melee friends now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Well as my main is a Rogue I suppose I should chime in on this discussion.<br />
<br />
To give you some background my Rogue is 65th, wields Ifir (Fennin Ro dagger) and Gold Runed Mithril Knife (Sol Ro dagger) in offhand, is largely in elemental gear with the rest VT eqipment, has 7.5k HP raid buffed 305 in all melee stats unbuffed and 210 in + attack gear before avatar, so I have a reasonable handle on the issues of pure melee since PoP.<br />
<br />
Rogues are neutered in PoP pure and simple. With AE rampages, AE DD's and DoTs with neg 400 resists as a pure melee it is impossible to get into close melee combat to do ANY dps on a significant number of PoP named. Add to that Rogues are tied to dual wield and just about every PoP mob while it has almost no AC has a practically infinate riposte skill even IF I have the support of a dedicated healer if the mob turns I have a better than fair chance of taking 4k in ripostes before I can even hit attack off, if spun on enrage then its insta death with 5 hits in a round.<br />
Add to that Plane of Water is a complete farce with my DPS plunging to zero with constant &quot;You cannot see your Target&quot; &quot;Your Target is too far away&quot; it plain is not funny. Plus of course it is not possible to even engage sneak in water at all and if you go into the water sneaking you move at roughly the pace of a snail in treacle. Yes I can use invis items like a GVD, but with zero channeling skill the odds on getting a spell off that isnt insta cast are practically none.<br />
Add to that there are now a distressingly large number of mobs that see through Shroud of Stealth  so I can't even do the job of dragging people around without a fair chance of blowing escape (72 min reuse 36 mins with max AA).<br />
<br />
Couple of mobs that as a rogue I can do no damage at all on  (Rogue archery damage is so pathetic that it is in effect zero and no throwing weapons have useful range) are:-<br />
<br />
Solusek Ro<br />
Fennin Ro<br />
Xegony<br />
Blazzax the Overfiend<br />
Mighty<br />
Wise<br />
Offassa<br />
Corinav<br />
<br />
Now when you consider that the single thing that a rogue brings to the table in raid terms is DPS you can see the problem.<br />
<br />
Parsed DPS in exp groups geared as one of the top 1% rogues in the game I am ALWAYS outdamaged by a ranger with an OK bow, almost always by a mage with very ordinary gear and 65th spells, ALWAYS by any half way decent Wizard and frequently by well geared monks with a good 2hander.<br />
<br />
When I can I play Pumyr my 65th shaman as frankly I can actually do stuff to benefit my guild on raids and thats with only Canni 5 AA and SCR 1. My rogue has all offensive AA maxed even Ingenuity to make the 2 DD proccing weapons I wield crit (6 aa's for that and I crit nuke maybe twice an hour).<br />
<br />
Shamen are NOT a damage dealing class, that being said I can lay down a lot of damage or heal pretty well and on shaman I am rarely LFG past the 5 minute mark.<br />
I can also solo in Plane of Fire, Plane of Earth, HoH, PoV, Tactics and anywhere in the zones pre PoP and LoY, where as on my rogue with full raid buffs I cannot solo a Plane of Disease GREEN mob even using slow proc weapons, lifetap weapons and snare weapons.<br />
<br />
To the people that are bleating that pure melee do not have issues I say this....<br />
<br />
Make your own top of the range geared 65th melee with maxed out AA's and prove to me that you are fine and dandy, cos on all the evidence I have pure melee are broken since PoP release. Hell when I make exp groups and am looking for DPS I don't even look for rogues for the slot and I am biased towards rogue for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">The AEs they've added to certain mobs with -400 or worse resist checks make it suicide to send in melee and so everyone is forced to sit back and used range attacks other than a single tank and perhaps some charmed pets.<br />
I know people are having fun picking on that other guy but this should be repeated. This is why high end Rogues are pissed off and why they're so desparate as to ask for improved damage/upgraded range through AAs on their throwing skill. Forget that dual wield vs. 2h damage might be a bit out of whack or how much damage uber Ranger is doing, Rogues are being relegated to dragging in the late comers. For a class that is all about DPS it is seriously disheartening to know that other than bringing in range_damage_dealer_26 you're going to be sitting back and watching the show. <br />
<br />
And Warriors, please, someone help them. I understand gear dependency for melee but the level at which that applies to Warriors is just sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">In closing, shaman are a priest class yet we are more necro than priest. IF you have Elemental chain arms and AHA3 you might heal just well enough to help keep your MT alive but from what I see in PoP, Tnarggs barely helps a cleric out.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure we're in the same elemental planes, I can and have been an effective healer in plane of fire.  The combination of mana regen, slow and buffs that increase the efficency of other group members (avatar, haste, bih li, focus)  This is not just on zone in trash, but in 3 man groups at the first castle on the lvl 65 mobs, and full groups in the second castle (near fennin ring 66+ mobs).  A ranger in our castle 2 group last time when I was healing, said &quot;Boz is a great cleric, the more we pull the higher her mana gets.&quot;  And slow, even though mitigated DOES MATTER, my second character is a cleric, and I cry when there is no slower.  Oh and I only have elemental arms, healing gift 1 and healing adept 1.  So I'm keeping up just fine without the uber aa's.  Don't understimate the power of quiescence, keep that up at all times on your tank, along with regen, and tnargs is more than even enough to keep my tanks at 70 health or higher the entire fight. <br />
<br />
The problem I'm seeing in this thread, is that everyone is trying to classify the shaman class as one thing.  I don't know about every shaman, but I'm anything I want to be, and that's why I LOVE the class and have stuck with it for over 2 years.  Granted I'll always cast malos and slow and focus, those are givens.  However, need me to be a healer?  No problem, in xp groups, hell I'm often main healer in groups in raids as well, not for the main tank of course, but I have been in healing rotation when we were short clerics and druids. Need dps?  I may not personally dish it all out, but I'm sure as hell making the groups dps increase through attack buffs, such as avatar and bih li, and haste.  Nukes aren't resisted as bad as Cantiz is implying.  Velium strike always lands in fire, with the occasional resist and partial resist on the mini bosses (has gotten worse since they beefed them up a few patches ago, but its not still terrible), but have yet to see a resist on an xp mob, or any mob in the fennin ring and on fennin himself.  And that's 5 months of 2-3 raids a week in fire, and just as many xp groups there.  Spear is RARELY resisted in water.  Air and earth just suck as a rule and resists are spotty, poison wont land in earth, cold does the majority of the time, and both land the majority of the time in Poair.  Need crowd control?  If I cant root it, I can piss it off more than anyone else and aggro kite it. Hell last night in  CoD rats group at one time  I had 6 bubonians rooted and rotting away for the group to pick off one at a time (hug ornate legs).  <br />
<br />
The bottom line is, the shaman class is what YOU make it.  If you can't think outside the box, I'd say you chose the wrong class.  If you want a single role, you chose the wrong class.  <br />
<br />
Do I want upgrades?  You betcha I do.  Do I need upgrades?  Not really, I can make the most of what I have.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for our melees, they just dont have much of an option. Do they need upgrades? Desperately.<br />
<br />
If you start whining and thinking the shaman class is being left behind, ask yourself these questions:<br />
<br />
1) Am I desireable in a group?<br />
2) Am I desireable on  a raid?<br />
3) Can I solo?<br />
<br />
I can answer yes to all 3 questions, that means I'm balanced.  If you cant, maybe you need to re-evaluate your playing style.  Blunty, if you can't find a way to adapt to your situation, you most likely suck at eq.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand the mentality of if joe blow is getting an upgrade and I'm not, its a slap in the face to me.  I rejoice when my partners in this game get an upgrade, I benefit from it in that it makes my groups and raids more effective.  I don't have class envy, if I did I'd just play that class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Gooshemez, your entire opinion is invalid, because you are basing it on a level 61 character with 6aas in POP.<br />
<br />
What you have just described is a character who is at the late velious, early luclin stage of the game.  Why should they be able to do ANYTHING in pop?<br />
<br />
Everquest is not 100% linear, but individual character progression is.  The game was designed to go from 1 ----&gt;60-----&gt;Untilmited AA points-------&gt;65----&gt;unlimited AA points.  Now, you don't have to uphold to that pattern if you don't want to, but that is the way the game was made, and as such, the encounters are tuned around that.  Someone who went from 1 to 65 and didint' get any AA points is severly under the NORMAL power curve.  They game was not desgined around those people.  AA points are a required part of character progression. <br />
<br />
Just as a level 40 should not be successfull in sebilis, a level 61 with 6aa points should not be successful in any pop zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">It could unbalance but the balance comes back in with the gear. I have 5500 mana 6900 hps buffed, the average PoV shaman does not. The mana cost and the risk of death compensates for the advantage. I have all my spells but there are a lot of PoV shaman who dont even have Malos yet so the risk of slow getting resisted is very real. So, slow is resisted then you cast it a second time and gain agro. Now, lets say your slow lands and fully buffed you have 4500 hps. Can the cleric or druid heal you fast enough to keep you alive? Can the MT steal agro off fast enough to save the healers mana? <br />
<br />
In closing, shaman are a priest class yet we are more necro than priest. IF you have Elemental chain arms and AHA3 you might heal just well enough to help keep your MT alive but from what I see in PoP, Tnarggs barely helps a cleric out.<br />
<br />
In the first case you do not need a cleric or druid.  A shaman can keep themselves alive and their group no problem with two and even three resits.  Pre torpor\Q helps.  Others have to do stuff like melee switch agro at times.  Best exp groups for shaman are with five damage dealers.  Sure agro might bounce around but nobody dies.  No need for cleric buffs.<br />
<br />
Shaman are more priest then a cleric in almost every case except a CH cycles.  Shaman can be the solo healer without problems in the elemental planes easy with elemental chain arms and AHA3.  They will not kill as fast as with a cleric but it is very doable.</div></div><hr />

But they are successful in most Tier 1 and 2 zones. AA progression is definitely not required for early PoP content at all, hell I was level 53 and successful in PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I said that instead of SOE catering to uber-guild players killing Fennin Ro or whoever, they should be addressing the needs of players who continously shout LFG for hours in Tier1 and 2 then log off in frustration.  Players in uber guilds DO NOT have this problem.  Some of them might have a problem dealing with their new role but they won't be logging off because of it, nor will they be complaining when they are awarded the uber loot these gods drop.  The 60 ranger or mage shouting LFG doesn't have any options, because they can't get any group anywhere, nor can they solo in PoP.  I included wizards and Necro's with rangers and mages, because they have the same problem getting groups...and it's NOT easy for them to solo, contrary to what the Necro worshippers keep spouting.  Just because they CAN solo doesn't mean they can do it effeciently or safely like druids, chanters and bards.<br />
<br />
Colal, if you want to present some data showing that the majority of players in EQ have 50+ AA points then go right ahead because I don't believe it.<br />
<br />
As far as you stating that a level 61 player with 6AA points has no place being in PoP...I'm not even going to comment on that because it doesn't deserve one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Shaman are one of the most powerful classes in the game.<br />

   I solo IZ of earth with a frog pally.  Some mobs hit for 996.  They mitigate slow (partial).<br />
<br />
   The pally used a windblade and CoF.   I debuffed the mobs and healed the pally with my and his help.   Yes I have good gear.   But c'mon... duoing mobs that hit for 996 with a frog pally w/40aa...<br />
<br />
   When PoP first came out I did 62-65 in the cave in valor.  At times I was the only slower AND healer.  My tank was some ranger.  That worked too.  Yes, I had good gear then as well.<br />
<br />
   But... most shaman of 61+ can do such things if they have skill, gear or not.   You might have to call a short med break if things get tight but heh, it's not hard to get mana back given a short breather as a shaman.<br />
<br />
   I have 500+ aa now.  I started life on a server on it's first day.  I've seen the game the whole way from then to now.   Shaman ARE NOT BROKEN.   If anything, we're overpowered.   <br />

   And DEFINITELY don't whine about melee class improvements, they can use 'em.<br />

And as bad as they may have it (and I still utterly disagree with wizzys and necros) pure melees currently have it WORSE.<br />
<br />
Although SoE seems to think this is a very top end issue, where as in reality it's probably a mid-level through to top end issue for pure melees (the problems start in the mid-high 50's [with PoP] and just get worse from there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Froglegs,<br />
<br />
Yeah, Shaman are wanted in every group in Pop, 'cause, hey, Slow? Buffs? You bet! This is exactly why every second account on Saryrn seems to have at least one level 50+ PL'd twink shammy dressed like a halfling druid. <br />
<br />
Our &quot;desirability in groups&quot;, combined with the few number of our class at higher levels, has led to a situation where Shaman can't get groups, because those spots are filled by Shambots in their shiny GEB's and Testaments of Vanear's. So, we solo an awful lot as a result of being wanted in groups so much. How ironic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">I just wanted to give my two cents about shaman.  My shaman is only 61 but I agree with Mudcrush, they are not broken.  Their desirabilty in groups is so high that LFG is never an issue.  The loot table for shaman in PoP is fantastic, compared to that of melee classes.  They never run out of mana.  Their ability to cripple a mob's damage output and also heal themselves and other group members makes them invaluable.  Their buffs turn rogues, monks and rangers into blenders.  Can they get boring just casting slow all day?  Yes, but your group members will appreciate it, and it's nice knowing you are the difference between killing Xanamech and being killed by Xanamech.<br />
<br />
When I need to farm stuff for my ranger I break out my shaman.  It's too easy.  <br />

The only thing I wish for shaman is to increase the drop rate for Malo, Pox, Torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From current trends it would appear that the dev. teams intention is to slowly remove the shaman's ability to fight mobs IN TEH FACE completely.  That's sad because it reduces the variety of caster classes, making us all gimps.  But its probably good policy on SOE's side because it would take a great deal more ability to correctly balance things (if you have a genuine range of class types) than their dev. team is currently showing.<br />
<br />
It is ironic though because SOE claim to be expanding the game - adding 'new' races and classes.  In practise a new race simply means the same old thing but with different graphics.  Variety of classes is being lost as they simply polarise us into melee and 'soft skinned' casters.</div></div><hr />

   Well hmm.<br />
<br />
   There are sharks that hit for 1k in plane of water.  You get partial slows landing on them.   Assuming I got malos and slow off (and this is not at all impossible) I could duo one with a cleric via melee and self heal on my part.   (You stick your ass in a corner to keep from being unable to cast when hit in water).   <br />
<br />
   Rabid bear is the key here.  You wouldn't want to do this every time, but if the tank goes dead or LD or we get a roamer while the tank is afk a shaman can have this option, even in PoP, if they have the aa and gear to back it up (and a cleric that realizes what you are doing).</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hi, I'm a 52 necro, would it be faster to get to level 65 soloing in PoP or grouping? I heard it's really hard for us to solo in PoP efficiently and safely.&quot;<br />
<br />
You'll end up with a slew of replies stating that it's quite simple and that groups are really horrible exp.  Go ahead.  I dare you.  You are wrong on so many counts it's silly.</div></div><hr />

The issue is that melee are suffering and it's no secret that WARRIORS are the most boned. Why? Bacause I will take a pally/SK main tank over a warrior anyday of the week, becasue I don't like getting slugged after slowing, and I like slowing early.<br />
<br />
After only grouping with paladins and sks for a while, even our good tank seemed to be crappy at not getting the crap beat out of me. Then I stood right next to the warrior, I would maloini/slow and the mob would look at me, then by the time the swing would come, he'd be taunted back.. so try it. I have not gotten hit since.</div></div><hr />

But....keep in mind when I say &quot;hard to solo&quot; I don't mean that you CAN'T solo, I mean that compared to Druids, Chanters and Bards you have a rough time and  can't possibly hope to approach their exp. rate by doting and pet kiting.<br />
<br />
For instance, druids and chanters can charm swamp rats in PoD which are 75% hasted and can double for 285.  Your gimpy 56 skele pet hits for 55, even with your dots you can't possibly hope to keep up with them.  Bards just aoe everything in sight.<br />

2nd best buffs? I'd rank virtue and voq &gt; shaman buffs. 3rd best healer? I think paladins are better and I think at least a few would agree =] sow? only time I cast it is billy and in groups.. if I didn't have a clicky i would use run3.. most high end ppl have 100k+ horses.. best slow I agree is good but not enough to compensate it's like a crutch, best slow, you get not much else. Soloing pop pre 65 sucks. I think that swinging for more than 5dps? dunno I never had it parsed.. dog is at about 13dps I KNOW he does more than me :) 20dps would be nice, because at least in 1 min I could dish out 1200 damage, not over powered but worth walking up to the mob and doing something.<br />
<br />
I'm blessed with being in a great guild.. (I got in because I'm just likable =) and our warriors nearly never loose aggro NEVER while defensive from what I've seen and when it counts.. in ssra we killed maybe 100+ mobs and the whole time I was spamming malosini/slow at level 56? and I only got summoned once and never got hit.

How can anybody try to make this into a Shaman rant? Yes, we severely lack in dps, our heals lag behind so far that we cant provide sufficient (meaning efficient) healing for unslowable mobs. We stack poorly on raids.<br />

They don't bring much to a group, and PoP is a really tough place for those classes to solo 60+.  Piles of AA will help, but that shouldn't be a requirement.<br />
<br />
The classes that are often LFG are the ones that need help.  People log on to have fun, not go LFG for an hour then log off in frustration.<br />
<br />
(referring to rangers, mages, wizards and necros). I don't know what you look for, I usually try to get a paladin, rogue and 4 other damage dealers, rangers, necros, mages and wizards included. Maybe it's just that a shaman can pick up a tank and get 4 other people really quick and get a group going while those 4 need a shaman or other friend to get a group just as fast? IMO for every shaman there are 5 other jobs available.. so no one should be groupless. If your ranger etc is in a not so well known guild or in the mid 50s.. then yes he won't get a group, last time I grouped with a 55 ranger he wasn't even pulling and he CALLED EVAC! (RUN!!!) before mob was at camp.. needless to say shaman tried to tank / kill while tank and ranger ran.. (cleric/mage gated once I told them to go)..</div></div><hr />

Mine is a main in a high level guild so I hope mine matters a bit. First of all you are rude by even saying that, if it doesn't matter skip it or correct the person. 2nd, I agree with everything Jenina Icemyst said. Most xp groups cannot exist w/o a slower. Sure with hard work a ranger can epic slow etc.. but for the most part a shaman or enchanter is needed.</div></div><hr />

The one thing about shamans that I would like to see the MOST is to upgrade the viability of stats, especially strength, and the effect it has on melee damage.  With Fo7 and Talisman of Daiku I can buff a melee 112 points higher in str, in permanent buffs, and FA adds a lot more of course.  If that actually MEANT something, I think there would be no doubt that shaman buffs mattered.<br />
<br />
Landragoran Heronwing is a god on these boards so I rarely disagree. I think chanter + cleric + tank is a group, cleric + tank is not (no slowing), enchanter + tank is not (no healing). Shaman + Tank is a group so in that regards we should be #1 on the ease factor. <br />
<br />
2nd on raids usually clerics are all on ch lines and shaman/druids do the group healing. Also shaman split off into groups of 2 1 to malos 1 to slow and sometimes 3-6 mobs need to be slowed at once. (lol my guild loves shaman). Also FA does MEAN something!!! pling pet classes :) FA on a bl pet and watch it go..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Rjey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">Ok, I'm a level 65 monk probably in the &quot;top 1%&quot; of all monks server wide.  And I have a problem with a lot of this post.  Don't get me wrong, I feel useless my fair share of the time but some of what Pumyr posted it flat out misleading.<br />
<br />
SolRo, Fennin Ro, Omni, Mighty, the Wise, and Ofassa are all mobs a pure melee can and do (at least in my guild) somewhat respectable melee damage to.  Not ranged damage, melee damage.<br />
<br />
Also, I have parsed many rogues with Ifir and less of an offhand weapon than Pumyr has in exp groups and I don't come close to them.  I have most offensive AA's, Zha's, Runed Etched Bamboo, and Xegony fist wraps and none of the combos I have can touch a rogue.  I do 150-170DPS in Fire in an exp group while the Ifir rogues are cranking out 200+ consistently.<br />
<br />
Pure melee do get the short end of the stick most of the time in PoP.  Some encounters, whole zones (water) and the lack of any decent &quot;burst&quot; DPS discs/aa's means we are the bottom of the food chain these days.<br />
<br />
And in answer to the original poster of this thread.  Melees are over powered?  That's pretty funny stuff.<br />
<br />
Couple of mobs that as a rogue I can do no damage at all on  (Rogue archery damage is so pathetic that it is in effect zero and no throwing weapons have useful range) are:-<br />
<br />
Solusek Ro<br />
Fennin Ro<br />
Xegony<br />
Blazzax the Overfiend<br />
Mighty<br />
Wise<br />
Offassa<br />
Corinav<br />
<br />
Now when you consider that the single thing that a rogue brings to the table in raid terms is DPS you can see the problem.<br />
<br />
Parsed DPS in exp groups geared as one of the top 1% rogues in the game I am ALWAYS outdamaged by a ranger with an OK bow, almost always by a mage with very ordinary gear and 65th spells, ALWAYS by any half way decent Wizard and frequently by well geared monks with a good 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Froglegs, if it makes you feel any better you can take off Necros off my list ok?<br />
<br />
But....keep in mind when I say &quot;hard to solo&quot; I don't mean that you CAN'T solo, I mean that compared to Druids, Chanters and Bards you have a rough time and  can't possibly hope to approach their exp. rate by doting and pet kiting.<br />
<br />
For instance, druids and chanters can charm swamp rats in PoD which are 75% hasted and can double for 285.  Your gimpy 56 skele pet hits for 55, even with your dots you can't possibly hope to keep up with them.  Bards just aoe everything in sight.<br />
<br />
If soloing is so important to you might want to dump the Necro and start a druid.<br />
<br />
I am relatively new poster to the boards (long time lurker) and some of what I find in this thread is astonishing.<br />
<br />
I have a 58 Necro with 0 AA and without DemiLich and I solo in the PoD CY's...ANY OF THEM.  No charm needed.  I solo PoN Stalkers also.  And I don't have to beg my pimp for a shot of KEI.  Druids can kill faster with Charm, but the necro will get more exp per kill.  <br />
<br />
Wizards.  I see them quadding Stalkers in PoN all the time.  Did you see the post where a high end wizard (FT15..the works) was getting over 80% AA PER QUAD in the Elemental Planes?  Yeah, they suck at soloing.  <br />
<br />
My friend soloed his ranger to 62 and 55 AA.  Granted, he didn't do it in PoP, he did it in other zones, but how many Warriors can do that?  How many Rogues can do that?  If Rangers really wanted to solo, they could.  I'll tell you one thing though, people will always take a Ranger over a monk.  They have decent ATK buffs, can Snare, and even without AM3 are about equal with Monk DPS.  AM3 is gravy and isn't even worth trying to compare against a monk.  Now we are talking about outdamaging Rogues as well.<br />
<br />
Out of the 4 you listed, Mages are the least that I know about.  They may not be able to solo (I have no idea), but their DPS is just SICK in groups (if they have KEI of course) and are taken in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
You sir, have no idea what you are talking about.  Are you sure you are playing EverQuest?<br />
<br />
Very rarely do you ever find a group without a Slower.  Shamans and Enchanters have cornered the market on that, and no one even remembers that Beastlords can slow because there aren't that many around.  <br />
<br />
I NEVER see a Shaman lfg for more than 5 minutes in Tier1 or Tier2.  Period.<br />
<br />
Shamans bring TONS to a group and can solo.  Everyone has gripes about their own class.  It makes sense because they know their class in and out.  But to sit there and say melee are overpowered... you are blind.<br />
<br />
The problem comes in when a group-oriented class decides to solo.  With Shaman, Enchanters, and Beastlords soloing all the time, there are less options for groups.  Now all of those melee you were talking about who aren't SUPPOSED to solo, have one less option for getting a group and are sitting around LFG.  Can you imagine what would happen if Clerics could solo full time like Shamans can?  You'd have even MORE melee just sitting LFG.<br />
<br />
If Shamans were to get an upgrade to DPS, they would be even more unstoppable and you would NEVER find them in an exp group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Daishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">He's not actually kidding about that. Ranger vs monk is becoming much more of a topic of conversation these days as old perceptions are fading away. Not everyone and their brother min/max's or reads class boards all the time, but the argument of 'why take a monk when a ranger is available' is steadily growing. (there's quite a few classes that have actually been thrown into that phrase instead of 'ranger' as well).<br />
<br />
Daishan/Daishar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">This challenge was not meant for Viscerator, but since you decided to take up the cause I will address your post.<br />
<br />
1.  What exactly is a ranger supposed to kite with?  Good gracious please don't say arrows.<br />
<br />
Last I checked any ranger can purchase one of those godly compound bows, forget the name.  I didn't say it would be fast experience, but you bet that 61 rangers with 6aa are arrow kiting in PoP all day long.  Others have already stated, all it takes is a little room and a non-summoning mob.<br />
<br />
2.  Mages.  They found some nice solo spots?  Huh?  Would you care to elaborate?  I've never seen a mage soloing ANYWHERE in Tier1.<br />
<br />
To make this easier, Mages Tower 61-65 Forum (http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewforum.php?f=32&amp;sid=f5251fadf6d84f37e3a49f5530114a7e).  Browse around there for a quick reference, or ask a few mage friends if they would like to duo.  Most of the good mage spots work even better with a shaman (61+ shm and mage are AWESOME together).<br />
<br />
Again though, many non-summoning PoP tier1 and tier2 mobs (lots of PoStorms).  The non-casting mobs in PoP tier2+ aren't really doable solo for a mage though, too much healing, unless they are charming.<br />
<br />
3.  Have you ever tried to pull the entrance to CoD?  I have, it's very easy to get adds.  Of all the times I've zoned into CoD I've never seen a single Necro soloing there.  Necros are dead in about 1 round of melee in CoD.<br />
<br />
True it is and always has been pretty risky for necros to solo CoD.  As to your pulls, since when are you a necro?  Do you know how they pull?  Do you have undead charm?  It's actually one of the most exciting things to watch, although my observation was two 65 necros with lots of AA, but still quite busy :)  It would be difficult for a 61 with 6 aa to do, but surely possible.<br />
<br />
3.  Wizards.   Ok they can quad-kite.  We already knew that, but this isn't wyverns in cobalt scar with 3200 hp's, this is PoP where mobs have 13,000 hit points.  Yes a wizard can quad.  Is it efficient?  No.  Also most stuff in Tier1 goes light blue at 63.<br />
<br />
Again, for simplicity, Graffe's Quad Kiting Forum (http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19).  It *is* difficult for a 61 wizard with just 6 aa to quad in more than tier1 I think, but cake in tier1.  Druids also.  So the mobs have more hitpoints?  Guess what, quadders have upgraded spells too!<br />
<br />
As for monks, they need help like warriors do.  Most PoP zones you don't need or even want split pulling, just isn't worth the time.  Why a ranger?  Snare, archery, good melee, buffs, harmony, etc.  A monk?  FD...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Froglegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">But....keep in mind when I say &quot;hard to solo&quot; I don't mean that you CAN'T solo, I mean that compared to Druids, Chanters and Bards you have a rough time and  can't possibly hope to approach their exp. rate by doting and pet kiting.<br />
<br />
For instance, druids and chanters can charm swamp rats in PoD which are 75% hasted and can double for 285.  Your gimpy 56 skele pet hits for 55, even with your dots you can't possibly hope to keep up with them.  Bards just aoe everything in sight.<br />
<br />
If soloing is so important to you might want to dump the Necro and start a druid.<br />
<br />
See the other necro who replied.  It's slower but you get a HELL of a lot more exp per kill.  See new charm rules.  A druid's pet otudamages them by a load.  Especially in the 61 6aa field you're talking about.<br />
<br />
In the past, yes, speed was all that mattered and a druid charming got just as much per mob as a necro fearing and dotting.  Now we get the same tons of exp, they get much less.  They kill faster so it balances out a bit.  They also have something necros don't generally have: downtime regaining mana.<br />
<br />
Now you're also talking 61 6aa so you're NOT talking about DC or any really uber charms so their world is MUCH harder as they are on a constant mana drain recharming and if they get a resist string they could be dead pretty quick.  Necro fear spells are very hard to resist but even if they do you can fall back on FD or just LT-tank until fear works or your pet taunts off.  Unless you're a boss-level mob (or maybe boss-guard level) you don't resist life tap.  If you're a complete wuss levant = evac or use ither of your TWO damage absorb spells (similar to cleric DAs).  Again though, those are for wusses.<br />
<br />
Bards do take the win though because they can swarm kite.  If you think bards are AOEing to get their exp you need to seriously learn something about bards as well as necros.  The strategy is simple: charm one mob, have 8 mobs hit it, invis just before it dies to break charm, hit it with dmg song, get exp.  Charm next one and have the 7 remaninng hit it...etc.  If one of the charmed ones happens to kill an already damaged other mob...damn...you get less exp since your charmy did it with new charm rules but it's still ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">I find I have to comment on some of the questionable things posted here.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer - For some of you, completely ignore anything else I have to say since I have only been playing the game since June of 2002 and could not possibly know anything or have a clue about the game since anyone who has not been playing since beta needs to **** since he/she is a complete moron and must be a gibbering idiot incapable of logic or reasoning about a game system. Plus I also have the the handicap of having only a few posts on this board so I must really be beyond clueless.<br />
<br />
1. If melee classes were over-powered, everyone would play one. And if you disagree and think shamans are broken, then why aren't you playing a warrior, monk or rogue instead?<br />
<br />
2. EQ is a game. Games are meant to be fun. Every class in the game should be fun to play. Warriors are not fun to play. Few players choose to play warriors. Warriors are broken. <br />
<br />
3. The uber min/max power-gamers make it next to impossible for SOE to balance the classes. As soon as one class gets a cool ability, power-gamers figure out a way to abuse it and everyone else whines about it. SOE responds by either nerfing the ability or giving every other class some ability as consolation. The latter usually results in more abuses of abilities.<br />
<br />
4. Raids were never a part of the Original Vision(tm) but seem to have become the focal point of players to the point of obsession. SOE has responded by adding content that is solely for raiding. They even added a tool for it. But raiding is still an add-on to the game and should not be the sole focus.<br />
<br />
5. Do some of you ever play games for fun? Not playing unless you can achieve efficiency in gaining xp sounds too much like work and not fun to me. If 5 of your real life friends starting playing EQ and they all really wanted to play shamans, would you tell them, &quot;No! We can't have a group of 6 shamans. It's not efficient!&quot; Is the game about grouping with the right classes or the friends you have?<br />
<br />
6. The game is called Everquest not I must do the Max my DPS or I am suxor. <br />
<br />
7. STOP WITH THE CLASS ENVY,OI, IT HURTS. FLAMES SHOOTING THROUGH MY BRAIN.<br />
<br />
It would not be fair to point out all of this out without offering some suggestions that address the original topic of the thread.<br />
<br />
For Warriors - And some of these are very radical<br />
A - Allow warriors the ability to direct agro to one group member by engaging in melee. Think of it as the warriors working in concert to keep one at the fore of the fight.<br />
<br />
B - Give warriors an ability to increase the ATK of the entire group, one that would stack with all other ATK buffs.<br />
<br />
C - Give warriors a lesser version of mend. It is not a class defining ability for monks and they should be willing to share it with warriors.<br />
<br />
D - Add new lines of offensive/defensive abilities at lower levels that mirror existing AA's while upgrading the AA's to make them more powerful. Ex: Defensive Spin: Reduce attack rate but increases defense (Should still generate agro!) or Whirlwind Attack (Rampage) that would start out at 1 extra critter attacked and increase as the warrior increases in level.<br />
<br />
E - Give All melee classes new physical movements in the game. Rogues and Monks should be able to jump further and higher than other classes and climb walls. Melee classes could have the ability to vault over mobs Rogues could get a slide or roll that puts them in perfect position for a backstab. Monks could get the ability to run on water. I'm sure some of you creative types could come up with some other physical movements that would both be fun and useful in game.<br />
<br />
F - Warriors should have a special skill that allows them to upgrade or improve certain items. Improved weapons might need to be tagged as No Drop after the upgrade. Higher level warriors would be able to improve better items than the lower level ones.<br />
<br />
G - Allow weapon specialization: Delay would decrease and a damage bonus would be applied with the chosen weapon class.<br />
<br />
H - Add a flags that would make a certain class required to get the quest, spawn the mob, enter the zone, or whatever. The rewards should be for a different class however.....talk about class interdependency. (Not like the Vah Shir Progressive Quests but ones that result in an immediate reward.) Ungrouping the required class kicks everyone else out of the quest, zone, plane, etc.<br />
<br />
I - If SOE really wants to encourage grouping with certain classes, give a bonus to exp when grouped with that class. ie: Groups with warriors get a +10% bonus to exp earned.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time. The opinions expressed here may be flawed or ill-conceived in your eyes but they are mine, damnit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Rjey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">Concerning warriors, they already attain monk level damage with max AA's and using a Blade of War.<br />
<br />
Now you can say 2H damage is broken or you can say warriors have too good of a 2H weapon with the BoW (but the 2H off the rathe will do as much or more damage as well) or you can say monks DPS is broken.<br />
<br />
Regardless, upping Warriors DPS is not the answer because they can already beat monk DPS and that's just wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">Quinner, first off while some of the ideas you have are great and others...interesting... :), if you are seriously going to discuss melee issues you don't need to resort to this:<br />
<br />
1. If melee classes were over-powered, everyone would play one. And if you disagree and think shamans are broken, then why aren't you playing a warrior, monk or rogue instead?<br />
<br />
2. EQ is a game. Games are meant to be fun. Every class in the game should be fun to play. Warriors are not fun to play. Few players choose to play warriors. Warriors are broken.<br />
<br />
I have only ever played two classes above level 25, one of them (a mage) is currently a whopping level 29.  My Shaman is and always will be my main.  I play a Shaman because I don't really have much time to play and, despite playing many many friends' characters, I just haven't been as nearly interested in them as I am Shaman.  This isn't nor has ever been because they are broken or overpowered.<br />
<br />
Also, I disagree with your unfounded generalization about how many players choose to play warriors and that they aren't fun to play.  You may not like them, but plenty of others do, despite their limited abilities.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you have a very good point about how powergamers still have a huge effect on SoE's &quot;balancing&quot;.  It's really too bad and is just a simple case of the few that ruin it for everyone else sometimes.<br />
<br />
The ideas about pure melee having additional natural abilities is great!  The classifications should probably be more related to armor type than class specific, but that's not to say there can't be other class specific abilities added.  There is so much potential in weapon specialization, disciplines, and AA it's unreal.  Warriors, monks, and rogues really should naturally have more weapon tricks than hybrids because while hybrids concentrate on spells, it would be natural that pure melees spend their time concentrating on weapon skills (NOT the weapon skills that are currently in game, but more like AA development).  EQ (and any future MMORPG really) could benefit a LOT from implementing a few more aspects of the tabletop rpg's.  If I played a warrior in EQ, I would like to know that when I used a whip instead of a short sword, it was for other reasons than just the proc or stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Froglegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">Quoted from above<br />

1. If melee classes were over-powered, everyone would play one. And if you disagree and think shamans are broken, then why aren't you playing a warrior, monk or rogue instead?<br />

Agreed.<br />
<br />
2. EQ is a game. Games are meant to be fun. Every class in the game should be fun to play. Warriors are not fun to play. Few players choose to play warriors. Warriors are broken. <br />
<br />
Disagree, do a /who all warrior.  You'll get just as much spam as any other class.  Even if you break it into ranges you'll get a whole lot of players.  <br />
<br />
3. The uber min/max power-gamers make it next to impossible for SOE to balance the classes. As soon as one class gets a cool ability, power-gamers figure out a way to abuse it and everyone else whines about it. SOE responds by either nerfing the ability or giving every other class some ability as consolation. The latter usually results in more abuses of abilities. <br />
<br />
Nerfing is the way to go with all of these type of games.  I used to admin for a MUD for years, the long lost predicesor to all of these precious MMORPGs.   The only viable method for balance is the nerf.  Increasing everyone's power just adds to yet more MUDflation which makes it that much harder to stop the next balance issue.<br />
<br />
4. Raids were never a part of the Original Vision(tm) but seem to have become the focal point of players to the point of obsession. SOE has responded by adding content that is solely for raiding. They even added a tool for it. But raiding is still an add-on to the game and should not be the sole focus.<br />
<br />
Agreed however only partially.  It may not have been a huge vision in the original but it was a vision.  Naggy and Vox had to be zergged and raided and the bigger dungeons needed a couple parties to be safe in the early game.  Raids beingthe sole focus of a guild or toher group of players entire play is, however, not part of the original vision.  The last few expansions (Vel+ really) have made this officially part of the vision as all of the larger encounters have been tailored to raids.  SOE has accepted and built toward raids being a sole focus and thus it stands as a viable focus to be balanced.<br />
<br />
It's like saying ebcause BLs werent in the original release they shouldn't be balanced...no...it's been built to be this way now so it's now a viable part of the game.<br />
<br />
5. Do some of you ever play games for fun? Not playing unless you can achieve efficiency in gaining xp sounds too much like work and not fun to me. If 5 of your real life friends starting playing EQ and they all really wanted to play shamans, would you tell them, &quot;No! We can't have a group of 6 shamans. It's not efficient!&quot; Is the game about grouping with the right classes or the friends you have?<br />
<br />
I always do personally and often group with my necro knowing I'm going to take an exp-rate hit in the -ss just because it's fun or it's friends or whatever.  Hell my monk goes around lower end dungeons just to explore even though none of the loot has any merit whatsoever.<br />
<br />
This doesnt mean that everyone enjoys this sort of thing, however.  The game is large enough to cater to many play styles.  Of course it's up to SOE to decide which play styles they care to balance and code for.<br />
<br />
6. The game is called Everquest not I must do the Max my DPS or I am suxor. <br />
<br />
Agreed there as well.<br />
<br />
7. STOP WITH THE CLASS ENVY,OI, IT HURTS. FLAMES SHOOTING THROUGH MY BRAIN.<br />
<br />
Heh.<br />
<br />
It would not be fair to point out all of this out without offering some suggestions that address the original topic of the thread.<br />
<br />
For Warriors - And some of these are very radical<br />
A - Allow warriors the ability to direct agro to one group member by engaging in melee. Think of it as the warriors working in concert to keep one at the fore of the fight.<br />
<br />
I agree here but with one change.  Instead you should allow any melee to direct aggro to a warrior (or any warrior to pull from any melee).  If you do less then monk/sk/pally/rogue/ranger will be passed up for 2 warriors because with 2 you don't lose aggro control...Basically you want to create a space for a warrior in a group, not for 3 and thus screw the other melee.<br />
<br />
B - Give warriors an ability to increase the ATK of the entire group, one that would stack with all other ATK buffs.<br />
<br />
That's fine, though rangers already do that and they'll be annoyed.<br />
<br />
C - Give warriors a lesser version of mend. It is not a class defining ability for monks and they should be willing to share it with warriors.<br />
<br />
Completely disagree.  This is one of the monks class defining skills.  They only have two you know, mend and FD.  I wouldnt call FK a class definer since warriors ahve a kick that stuns even if it doesnt do as much damage and many classes have bash that can interupt spells.  Don't steal from the other two hurting classes: rogue and monk.  Make something new.<br />
<br />
D - Add new lines of offensive/defensive abilities at lower levels that mirror existing AA's while upgrading the AA's to make them more powerful. Ex: Defensive Spin: Reduce attack rate but increases defense (Should still generate agro!) or Whirlwind Attack (Rampage) that would start out at 1 extra critter attacked and increase as the warrior increases in level.<br />
<br />
They are looking into disc changes already.<br />
<br />
E - Give All melee classes new physical movements in the game. Rogues and Monks should be able to jump further and higher than other classes and climb walls. Melee classes could have the ability to vault over mobs Rogues could get a slide or roll that puts them in perfect position for a backstab. Monks could get the ability to run on water. I'm sure some of you creative types could come up with some other physical movements that would both be fun and useful in game.<br />
<br />
This will never happen.  All the dungeons were designed with certain restrictions on player movement assumed.  If you allow jumping high you'll open a wolrd of dungeon bugs and exploits and falling through the world and a million other things.  Yes they could all be redesigned to take into account these new abilities.  Believe me, this is not something you want to do.  <br />
<br />
When I worked on my last MUD I undertook what the other coders and I called &quot;Herculean Tasks&quot; that were similar to this.  They were aptly named.  Digging through code 20 other people wrote (some badly) and trying to make sure you don't miss anything is really really nasty.<br />
<br />
F - Warriors should have a special skill that allows them to upgrade or improve certain items. Improved weapons might need to be tagged as No Drop after the upgrade. Higher level warriors would be able to improve better items than the lower level ones.<br />
<br />
Perhaps to improve AC or HP I could see this and then get a nodrop tag.  The monk boards have a post like this going as well under a topic about how to remove items from the marketplace adn recover some of the economy.  <br />
<br />
In the end this would hurt more warriors as good equipment could not be resold and would stay expensive.  More people would have less good items.<br />
<br />
G - Allow weapon specialization: Delay would decrease and a damage bonus would be applied with the chosen weapon class.<br />
<br />
Completely disagree unless monks and rogues get it to.  Warriors in the original vision were to always be behind monk and rogue DPS.  They currently are on par or past many monks and moving toward rogue.  This is alaready unacceptable.<br />
<br />
H - Add a flags that would make a certain class required to get the quest, spawn the mob, enter the zone, or whatever. The rewards should be for a different class however.....talk about class interdependency. (Not like the Vah Shir Progressive Quests but ones that result in an immediate reward.) Ungrouping the required class kicks everyone else out of the quest, zone, plane, etc.<br />
<br />
Possible but messy to impliment because of that very thing.  Ungrouping, LD, etc.  In the end it wouldn't gain what is needed most: balance in the regular exp group and mini one group raid.<br />
<br />
I - If SOE really wants to encourage grouping with certain classes, give a bonus to exp when grouped with that class. ie: Groups with warriors get a +10% bonus to exp earned.<br />
<br />
Then you once again screw every other class since no group will ever not ahv a warrior from that point forward.  You underestimate the greed of EQ players in pickup exp groups.<br />

<br />
The Agro direct idea could be expanded to include other melee but then each raid would only need one warrior. Warriors should still be the only valid target for the agro redirection. The point would be to give warriors a reason to melee mobs during a raid.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some of the physical movements would be better left to future games but there are some that could be added without creating problems for the physical environment. Some could be restricted to outdoor zones only.<br />

Spells just offer too big an advantage over pure melee. <br />
<br />
My lvl 65 monk friend, with &quot;uber&quot; equip (Caens staff, VT loots, higher PoP stuff) and 160'ish AA's can solo a typical PoI zonein mob. He has to use mend and now and then stonestance (this is after the monk defense &quot;boost&quot;).<br />
I can solo that same mob at lvl 53, without any AA's and reasonable gear, only self buffed, no kei, and be about as efficient as he is. It drains a couple of mana bubs, I wouldn't be able to take a 2nd one without a med break.<br />
<br />
Now what's wrong with this picture?<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for a caster nerf, I'm asking for a pure melee upgrade. A wizard is pure nuking, a monk is pure hitting (not much defense, just offense). Still the wizard is easily outdamaging him. The argument that casters are limited by their mana pool doesn't count when he has enough mana to solo that xp mob and is able to regen it again to kill another one efficiently.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I don't want casters to get nerfed. I'm just pointing out the huge difference in power between pure melee and spell using classes (including hybrids).</div></div><hr />

My friend can solo mobs pretty easy he's only a level 60 Human monk with I think aa in the 80s.. he's got nothing special and in a mid level guild. After he kills he bandages up to 100%.. (when soloing but rarely solos). I was 53 maybe 2 months ago max and there is no way I would have been able to solo **** in pon. right now at 63 I think I would have a hard time with only my buffs soloing something in pon (I don't have malo, torpor or malosinia, 3 xp sessions from 65 when I get my good stuff). <br />
<br />
In other words if your 65 friend is fighting in pon he has 160aa and VT gear then something DOES sound wrong and I don't think it's serverside.</div></div><hr />

This is about the only case where I'll agree that a nerf isn't the right solution.  Normally a nerf is always the best way to handle a balance issue.  Until you've been in SOE's shoes (and I have, admining a MUD for years) you have no idea what you're talking about if you think nerfs are a bad way to balance.<br />
<br />
In truth the best thing for the long term of the game would be to nerf casters but unfortunatly that would affect such a large scale of the game population that it can't happen.  You can't piss off 80% of your players and expect it to go over well.  A class here, a class there is fine over time but not 80% all at once.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly the solution has to be yet MORE MUDflation.  It only hurts the game in the end.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly it.  Nerfing all casters would be entirely too large of a change and would inevitably cause so many other imbalances that it would effectively negate the nerfing.  The problem is that pure melee classes have been left behind for so long now that the only way to catch them up is to upgrade them.  Hopefully, SoE realizes that the pure melee's can really be helped by a few specific upgrades that need not affect hybrids or casters at all.  *hopefully* :)<br />
<br />
MUDflation is just a fact of an online game, whether an old fashioned MUD or the very newest MMORPG.  It creeps up on the game and its players, so at that point large scale nerfing is noticed by the players (as you stated, pissing off 80% at once).  SoE probably could have done a much better job at keeping the small nerf frequency up, but they fell behind and MUDflation has changed the game dramatically.<br />
<br />
I would still really like to see weapon specialization and even reasons to use different types of weapons.  I can't let go of the D&amp;D roots :)  I can totally see a warrior being the one with a myriad of weapons to choose from (there really needs to be more WAR specific weapons also), having huge HP &amp; AC, doing decent damage (behind ranger, rog, monk) and having an assortment of potions / special attacks.  The rog should have lots more unique thief like abilities to supplement their lack of special attacks and weapon choices.  I can picture monks using all sorts of special attacks, especially in particular combinations versus certain types of monsters.  They too should have unique abilities like the rog.<br />
<br />
Oh well.  I'm sure that any changes made to pure melee will just make use of the already existing properties of the classes.  SoE's only thoughts on an upgrade to rog would probably be a 5% modifier to backstab damage for all rogues 61+... /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">&quot;Take the average Valor group to a tier 3 zone and play main healer. Not only will you have a hard time keeping your group alive, but you will not be able to do anything else.&quot;<br />
-Take a druid to a Tier3 zone as main healer without a slower and see how well he does. Take a cleric to a Tier3 zone without a slower and while he may get by, he sure as hell won't be doing anything other than healing. Class interdependancy, it's part of the game design.<br />
<br />
You mean like BoT?  Haster, slower, and only healer, with, hmm... sk, mage, ranger &amp; wizzie.  I actually needed a med break, with the way the mage was pulling. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the warrior bit - here's an idea.  Make stats give a bonus to Taunt.  It helps them out, and it gives us a reason to buff stats other than sta.  Even if they would make it Agility. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">First I'd like to talk about two things:  I am a mage with moderately good gear/aa's (FT 10, Shield of Auras, MC3, Maxed Crits and Mastery) and yes, I feel melees deservedly need an upgrade, expecially rogues and monks.<br />
<br />
My dps, much much higher than rogues or monks who are very good friends in the biggest guild of the server, full of elemental armor and with insane weapons.<br />
<br />
I think the proper way to balance this would be to ax horses with mana regen - a change that would horribly hurt intelligence casters but would restore a sort of parity between melee and caster damage that right now is oh-so-horribly out of wack.<br />
<br />
About warriors holding aggro - we are lucky in that we are the only remaining server with a sleeping Sleeper, so all our warriors are lucky to own one or two SoD's... while when I am grouped with a Hybrid I can be lazy and chain nuke to my heart's content, with a warrior I can just pace myself and still keep myself well below FM regenning mana the entire duration of the group, so the end result is the same it just means I cannot slack off and chain nuke one fight then sit out the next fight.<br />
<br />
Second part, about how useful shamans are.  For the longest time, my guild had one amazing active shaman, but whenever he wasn't around we were forced to box him for MGB buffs...  Let me tell you, IT IS possible to do NToV without a shaman, but it is a horrible horrible thing, and I would never want to do it again; now we have 3 high play time shamans, 2 level 65 with most of their spells, one 64 and levelling fast and the difference is staggering - mobs get slowed that much faster, poor shamans don't get strapped for rebuffs in the middle of a flurry drake pull (/tell Karelan Acumen and Agility plz!).<br />
<br />
Shamans are awesome utility - when we did our first cursed kill a week ago, we had 2 mages, one of which was boxing a cleric (me) 1 wizard recruit, 0 rangers, and 3 shamans for damage - the shamans did A TON of damage while keeping him slowed.  I don't have the exact numbers, but I believe the top damage dealer that fight was by far and away a shaman who alternated BoN and BoS.<br />
<br />
True, shamans might not be as game breaking in mobs like AoW or Tormax, but unless you have clerics coming out of your ears, shamans spam healings on trank transitions are what make the encounter possible for small guilds - never mind shamans healing melees against AE's - a shaman with quiescence is by far the best healer against AE'ing mobs up there with level 65 paladins with both waves, although the shaman lasts much much longer.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but you need to learn other classes better, and stop thinking in the kunark era...<br />
<br />
I'm a 65 necro.. and I can tell you ... we do NOT need a boost in power of any kind. ther are some tweaks I would like, but we are very very very powerful... we can solo with ease, maintain 200+ dps forever, and have good utility.<br />
<br />
mage and necro are the top DPS classes in that situation (assumeing all other characters in the group are about the same level/aa/gear)<br />
<br />
Necros: very very very good at soloing. (good luck finding one willing to take the xp loss that grouping causes)<br />
Wizards: very good at soloing.<br />
Mage:good at soloing<br />
<br />
the only class you listed that MIGHT fit the catagory your talking about the ranger, and they become great at damage after a few more AA.<br />
<br />
i'm ignoreing your &quot;pop requirement&quot; because thats just stupid... any of these classes (other than the ranger) would get better xp soloing anywhere than they could get in a group in pop.<br />
<br />
before pop  I was getting 1aa every 90 min soloing... yet you list me as a weak class.<br />
<br />
Pet classes rock for xp groups in general btw.<br />
<br />
Melee are broken..<br />
<br />
People still grab rogue/monk for damage more out of habit than because they are that good at damage... <br />
<br />
I'm not uber, but I have higher DPS than any but the most uber rogues/monks..<br />
<br />
And I can maintain it as long as they can.<br />
<br />
even rangers are not as good as most people think... most ranger parses you see have the bow DPS doubled because of a very common parseing error... a AM3/EQ ranger with good gear/aa and is level 65 is only going to actually be hitting aroung 150dps withn not useing trueshot.<br />
<br />
only the very very very top end rangers get true 250+DPS... and thats raid buffed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">Warriors have needed a fix for a while now. While I sympathise that tanking is not stackable, really thanks to a few spells every level for knights now the gap has widened to the point where wars are a one trick class  (defensive). Warriors get about 40-50 hp per level from 61-65, Thats all they get. No new skills, no new disciplines, only a shiny new title at 65 like everyone else. I am sure this is the same for monks and rogues. Warriors can be fairly powerful mind you, with level 65, a lot of good gear, eblow weapons and 150+ aa (and this does still not help too much with snap agrro or silly 100-150hp all/all items all over pop and luclin). Bar none the most screwed up class as far as risk and effort versus reward goes IMO.<br />
<br />
Defensive makes a few percent of warriors get to tank high end encounters over any other class (few because tanking does not stack, its not just a knight issue heh its a tank issue period) and it can be a useful skill when things get a little hairy. However I am sure most warriors would not even complain if it was entirely removed and a permanent 15-25% migitation increase was added. Too long have people used it as a crutch argument to say that warriors are balanced because of disc defensive. I would rather it just go away.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as dps goes I have a suggestion (not a new suggestion mind you) that I am sure warriors, rogues. monks and even rangers will agree upon.<br />
<br />
For God's sake fix 1handed dps. The difference between 2handed and 1 handed dps right now is just too big. Couple that with the fact that warriors are also going to take a ton more damage with dw toe to toe thanks to POP mob insane riposte rates and really their is not much bonus for having a dual wield skill anymore in POP, except for the fact that 1handed eblow weapons are easier to get compared to 2handed eblow weapons (the carrot dangling effect once again, sigh). War 2handed dps is fine right now (maybe even a little overboard with offensive aa). I am not sure if the other mellee need a dps fix overall but I think most will agree 1handers really need to be looked at.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I started a warrior back in 99 I wanted to be a skilled pure fighter class (as I am sure monks and rogues did too) as I always am in these types of games. I did expect to rely somewhat heavily on gear as most pure melee do. I never imagined my class would turn into needing to rely 99% on the procs off of weapons just to do my job and a three minute discipline every 10 minutes being 95% of the reason I am seperated from knights. <br />
<br />
I also want the class to be more relaint on skill and not that God damn RNG. Don't get me wrong there is still a difference between a warrior who does absolutely everything in his power to do his job and a lazy one, but the difference is once again probably the most marginal of the classes because of the reliance of luck with certain vital abilities of ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Ayriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">Shamans have none of these abilities. Our role in the high end game has erroded to providing marginal buffs and barely needed debuffs in high end encounters.  <br />

I really don't know where you come up with this from.  Try being a monk in PoS &amp; sitting around for over an hour LFG because Furor whined &amp; cried that monks could tank as good as warriors so Sony nerfed the f*** out of monks.  My experience has shown that in PoP, groups are centered around the SLOWER, &amp; who is the best slower in game? DUH :mad:</div></div><hr />

Some people watch TV or read a book while playing EQ. I play EQ. Period. Unfortunately the game is 99% of the time too slow and, for the lack of a better word, 'easy' to keep me interested. So I spend those boring moments figuring out how to make the playing routines more efficient and then implementing those ideas.<br />
<br />
Being a shaman allows me alot of freedom in doing that. As a warrior I would be severely limited in that capacity.</div></div><hr />
