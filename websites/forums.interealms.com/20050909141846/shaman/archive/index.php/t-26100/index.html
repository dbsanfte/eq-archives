<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have only had internet connection with the computers from my job which wont allow me to download ANYTHING from the web.   Not even updates from Windows XP.  But I just bought a Get D-way Dish off of ebay, and its on its way to me, now I expect to be on the web once more from my home with SCREAMING speed.<br />
<br />
I have been gone from EQ for almost 4 months.  I have left my EQ accounts open however so I can use them when the time comes.<br />
<br />
Has anything changed while I have been gone that is of any huge consiquense to me or my 2 char that are linked below?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No idea what a Get D way dish is but if its a satelitte connection then good luck trying to play EQ with that from what ive heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a satilite connection its not that bad. just dont try and Pvp with one, or play any FPS games or well any other games for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ledas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was considering getting a satelite connection soon because all I can get here is dail-up.  Are there issues with using a satelite connection and EQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just playing EQ its fine, Never had a problem with the few raids I have been on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problem with a satelite connection is distance.  The satelite is in a 36,000 km orbit.  Which puts it about 1/10 of a light second away.  Your signal has to go that distance 2 - 4 times (depending on if you're using phone uplink/satelite downlink or satelite up/down), adding 200 - 400 ms to your ping time for pure distance travelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Satelite and gaming do not mix.<br />
<br />
Good luck with it and I mean that.  Hope it works out for you but for my friend who lives out in the middle of nowhere... he was NOT happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interesting, I was told that Satelite was suppose to be faster then broadband.   This doesn't sound good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ping time is different than the &quot;speed&quot; that you use to d/l music &amp; movies.  What someone talks about when they're selling satelite is how much data they can move in a given time (which IS high).  What they don't talk about is the small delay in responsiveness that only matters when you're doing something like online gaming.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't play any shooters, or even many RTS games, so it wouldn't effect me so much.  If it were the only option, I'd take it and be very happy.</div></div><hr />
