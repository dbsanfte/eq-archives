<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the patch, Spirit Veil has failed on me twice, both times in NC.<br />
<br />
the second time today, i cast it at the bank in pok, ran up, zoned into NC, and before i got to the first mob, i got the message <br />
'Your Spirit Veil Fades'<br />
<br />
I took a SS. <br />
<br />

Spirit veil info on the live servers.<br />
<br />
It *claims* to not have been tampered with.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last night was the buggiest night I've seen on EQ in years, people were having all sorts of problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed.  I got KEI/Conviction in POK, zoned to DS and when I zoned in, my new buffs were gone.  Just a strange evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There has been all kinds of problems like this since the 26th patch.  Ive had the same problems with the improved invis.  I have had buffs bounce on me when I was buffless (Steeloak and Balikor bouncing 5 secs after I was rezzed as if I had conviction on, but was buff naked save for rez effects), and laggier performance from most zones than Ive seen since Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep popped on me while walking through a Sewer c expedition in RCoD.<br />
I know there was still 5 mins left when it popped as we had rogue in front of us disarming traps and was taking forever to get to camp.<br />
<br />
Only time its happened though so maybe mini patch got rid of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Certain zones seem highly unstable, 15 mins of lag then *poof* gone. Have a guildmember who has 1 character that can't zone. 4 corpses and any res or attempt to move from zone warps her back to her original zone. Other characters are fine. Occasional buginess with Raid forming reminiscent from when they first implemented that feature. Etc.<br />
<br />
Nothing too serious, though I am glad it's not my toon unable to zone at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another freakin server down....ugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was fun doing the Mshas in Qvic, only to have the zone completely hang for about twenty minutes. Chat channels worked fine. Tells worked. I could run around the zone and see all the creatures there, but couldn't target or /con them. When the zone finally booted us, EQ crashed and my PC completely restarted. Come back to find I'm dead.<br />
<br />
Hooray.<br />
<br />
Or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We had three members last night that lost approx 1 - 2 items each.  Each one seemed to have the haste earring from inktu'tu, and it just disappeared on them.  Some of them also lost their pop charm as well.  It seemed to happen if the person died and then upon gettin rezzed, they immediately crashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Spirit Veil dropped on me the other night too, hopefully just a bug since it worked fine on 3 CR's last night =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We had several people die and pop - fully buffed and eqipped - at zone in.  Both in WoS and KT.<br />
Oh, and Ikkinz4 is still bugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We did some mini-epic stuff on Sat and this happened in RCoD.  Out of 20ish people, all but 3 disappeared but everyone could see those 3.  Zoning was broke completely.<br />
<br />
How is Ikk4 broke?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The piles of bones despawn after 30 sec, so unless you have your whole raidforce made looters no chance to get your slivers.  We got slivers from GM - they didn't work on the turn in NPC.  But naturally the lockout timer works, so we have to wait another week to finish Qvic backflagging. If it's fixed.</div></div><hr />
