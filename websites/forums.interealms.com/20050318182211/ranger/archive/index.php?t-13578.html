<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katalaeia</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hunted in PoD for 75% of level 58. 95% of this time was spent in castle groups, either gate or right/left, with occasional pulls from inside. Exp flew. I did half of 58 in one session. The one time we did a rat/goo group the exp stunk, so we moved to the castle to kick it back into gear.<br />
<br />
So far, upon dinging 59, I can only seem to get groups in PoN, killing yard trash around the cemetary..treants, birds, small spiders. The exp sucks badly. Last night over 3 1/2 - 4 hours I got 1 1/2 blue. We had a few slow spots but when we pulled they were constant pulls. This just seems to be really crappy exp.<br />
<br />
Is this due to what I'm fighting, or is this &quot;good&quot; exp at 59? Keep in mind I don't have a pet group I can carry around with me to exp. I join pickup groups.<br />
<br />
Would I be getting better exp if I returned to the castle in PoD? What about PoI?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. I want 60, damn it :)</div></div><hr />

Only decent xp I've seen there is at the castle pulling gargoyles and the like.... and the creepers, but those are almost always camped by guild groups since parchments are approx a 30min drop.</div></div><hr />

I really hate mobs that hit this hard, but it's managable when slow procs.  But if I get one of the unslowable ones, that really hurts.  My cleric can keep up with the heals no problem, unless I get an unslowable one or a fight where slow doesn't proc until late.  <br />
<br />
As for exp, with just a 2 man group, both of me have the exp set to 50/50 and I'm getting VERY close to 1% AA per kill.</div></div><hr />

At one of the Hobgoblin camps I get around one yellow AAxp per hour.  Just have to get there.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vash</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the reason the castle rocks for EXP is that the mobs are higher lvls<br />
<br />
the rats and goo's are about the lowest mobs you can find in the zone with the exception of the flies which started light blue at 60...<br />
<br />
<br />
the giant spiders (the cleric healers) in PoD are pretty nice too they tend to run about lvl 56-57ish (someone told me consistantly 59 but doesn't seem that way)<br />
<br />
the diseased malarians are pretty good too seem to run 56-57ish also, but kind of a pain to pull with all the rats around, and there is only about 6 or 7 of em to pull, was great exp in a 4 person group, not so hot in a 6 b/c we had to pull a lot of rats and stuff<br />
<br />
<br />
I havn't steped foot in PoI since the 2nd day for exp, some of them have gone light blue at 62... so not all of them are really high lvls, but the first night i had a killer group and the EXP seemed very good, we pretty much just pushed as far in as we could (junk beast was down so was no competition for mobs)<br />
<br />
<br />
so the castle/courtyards in PoD seem to be the best in my experience... but if you have 4 groups pulling the mobs it really hurts... so it all balances out</div></div><hr />

The &quot;further in&quot; groups are usually guild groups, and when they take more, its usually clerics/shamen/enchanters. (GRRR!)<br />
<br />
Back to try PoD castle for me it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're nice xp provided you have the firepower/stunerpower to prevent the cleric CH.  Once had one CH itself 7 times in succession :)</div></div><hr />

I have never had a resist on Ensnare or fear.  The only problem is all the druids busy charming the ravens to attack other things with.

PoD exp does not suck, especially at 59.<br />
<br />
Went back there last night and got 12 blue in like 10 hours. Talk about a grind session. Only one parchment though and my paladin husband won it.</div></div><hr />

Diseased Malarians are 58 - 60, and are pretty good exp in PoD.  PoI = the suck, as far as I'm concerned...I'm sorry, but its one of those zones that makes you *feel* the grind too much.  Got my flag for PoV/PoS last night, so we'll see whats up there tonight after work =D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katalaeia</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Leafstalker, thank you for your advice and for staying on topic. It is appreciated :)<br />
<br />
Talios, the only complaint I even think I made in my original post was comparing yard-trash exp in one zone to castle exp in another (which obviously is a bigger comparison than I thought it would be, or I wouldn't have made a post about it). It wasn't a knock on PoP exp at all. I'm sorry you seemed to take it that way. The &quot;Be happy....&quot; attitude doesn't feel like it belongs here. I work for my levels as much as the next guy. Just because the new zones have some insane exp mods doesn't mean I'm less of a Ranger for choosing to go there over old-world places.<br />
<br />
I don't care about PoV because  at this point, I have no flag. I will not have one until I am &quot;allowed&quot; to tag along with another group, because there is no one group in my guild that has enough DPS to succeed. It's not really that important to me at the present anyhow.  As far as soloing in PoV, the info makes for good trivia, but it's not gonna happen for a good long time :) Sure, I'd like to see it, but I am taking my time and enjoying the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaliosTerangrea</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I didn't mean to come off like that.  It is just I have heard a lot of peeps complain about similar situations and complaining about exp in general in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeneran Orcreaver</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep an eye out for more adventurous groups I guess then.  The Hobgoblin camp I was referring to isnt all that hard to get to, mostly following the zone wall.  Should bring a mostly 60 or close to it group though and a mezzer as they cant be rooted.  With the graveyards, no reason not to go further into zones.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Katalaeia,<br />
<br />
PON. Enter zone. From graveyard go north along the wall, being careful to not aggro some of the random spawns along the wall. If any are there it is usually best to leave them to a group or even offer to pull it to a group. Once you get a clear path, follow the wall around but stop well short of the river.<br />
<br />
Now turn and face along the river but stay on that plateau. Moving parallel to the river you will eventually find a spot where you can single pull up to 4 ravens.<br />
<br />
Pull these back towards the wall, snare, and fear. Be sure to never get too close to the river or you will get hobgoblin aggro and that is just plain ugly. With C3 you can probably kill the 4th raven before the first respawns.</div></div><hr />
