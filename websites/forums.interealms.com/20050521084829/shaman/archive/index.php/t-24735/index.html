' You are not allowed to access this site  <br />

We're sorry, but you have been banned from using this site. '<br />
<br />
<br />
I didnt think i have broken any rules when posting , may have been slightly antagonistic in the past , but valid reasons , and last post i made on their site was about a month ago . I have been reading posts there and not posting till yesterday . Are the board nazi's THAT bad over there that they feel the need to ban me ? Or is there an ulterior motive for banning me i.e shoddy programming at their end?!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">maybe it is your improper use of the term &quot;nazi&quot;  (like sadly many use it).<br />
<br />
in case you are none of those who think that &quot;nazi&quot; is a trendword and you are cool when using it in your argument, nm me and my tip is sloppy programming  ;)</div></div><hr />

Maybe you and they disagree on minor things like the validity of your reasons, and how much antagonism you put in your posts. Little things, but if they actively banned you I would consider looking there for your answers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There was a lot of one-starring last weekend. Perhaps they got a bit zealous in their reaction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I work in a service oriented job, when people approach me for help with an antagonistic manner, I shut my ears and go on the defensive...regardless of thier reasons.<br />
<br />
If your post here is an example of your calm posting (can only assume as you use a smile) then use of the words nazi and shoddy coupled with the obvious feeling that you have been targetted personally then I would hate to see your 'antagonistic' posts.<br />
<br />
Not that I think there is anything wrong with flaming etc, ,to each thier own and we all have the choice to read or not, but they are Sony's boards.<br />
<br />
If a guest shat on your doorstep, would you invite them back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">interesting selection of responses . I shall visit their boards at work tomorrow and see if its an IP ban , or a more selective form of 'moderating' .<br />
<br />
As for using slang in my posts , am sure they have had and let harsher things slip by .. like their boards are there to to refine our language to grammatical purity, and to clear it from colloquial barbarisms, licentious idioms, and irregular combinations!!!<br />
<br />
My version of antagonism may vary wildy with others ( u guys make it sound like im hunting for a brawl). I would like a response from the company i pay for a service , not to be blanked in a childish way . My questions are thought out and reasoned , and I demand answers in return (which is my consumer right even if im in the wrong , i need to be told) , anything else is unprofessional , and anyone who carries out unprofessional responses in service oriented job , no matter if you feel antagonized or not isnt worth employing IMHO , as you are isolating your only means of profit .i.e the customer.<br />
<br />
On a side note , does sony one star subjects to get less readership samanna ? that would be the pits , bigtime , and reinforce my belief that they are board NAZI's(tinternet slang , we all know what it means in this enviroment) and are only happy with monopolization and corrupting freedom of speech ..<br />
<br />
Anyway hope i dont get flamed . Am a nice guy *cough* female troll really !<br />
<br />
P.s. Grimbear , am amazed the success u are having , perhaps the correspondent thingy is there to alieviate the non stop flaming that is on their boards .. You DO get a thumbs up from me , even though I was negative towards Brenlo and Kyth when they announced that a new rep was needed :) solid job m8</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, Sony has perma-one-starred some of Chutoi's posts, actually. <br />
<br />
But I'm referring to the &quot;One Star Bandit&quot;, who systematically one-starred many posters down to Newbie (no edit, no avatar, no sig, no html) status this weekend. I was online, and while I had over 100,000 pageviews (Philosopher), I watched my rating got from Journeyman to Newbie between 0930 and 0940.<br />
<br />
The moderators gave most of us our custom title back; I am able to pick a custom avatar and use html again, but I can no longer edit my posts or my signature... /boggle</div></div><hr />

Woot , am ubah shaman then  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had various posts deleted, edited, locked, and perma-one starred by the moderators.<br />
<br />
I just haven't been banned yet.  :p<br />

This isn't the approach to take when posting on the Sony forums.  They've said it many times, that's their house.  If someone 'poops' on the carpets in your house, you throw them out.  And make no mistake, they have a liberal definition of pooping.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Like it or not, posting on somebody else's forums is a privelege, not a right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ill admit, it was me that 1 starred you for 5 hours.  I have no life ~  Now 1 star me! I wanna go red.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You killed my ability to edit posts! You bastard!</div></div><hr />

<br />
well if thats the case , their forums aint worth posting on anyway :D and i should be grateful that they are like that .<br />
btw when my dog was younger it used to 'poop' on carpet . I never threw it out , i trained it to do better . I am their dog and i need to be trained , but throwing me out dont do much good . I am asking for enlightenment not negliegence .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>StormCrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This may very easily be wrong, but maybe somebody has hacked you EQ account and you've been suspended while they investigate it.<br />
<br />
Last night there was someone in PoK spamming and randomly spewing curses for no reason other than to get the account banned, because the person said they had hacked the account and would continue until that account was banned and then would hack another.<br />
Most likely it was somebody that wasleaving the game anyway so there was no reason not to raise hell since they would be gone anyway.<br />
But there is a chance that maybe somebody has done the same thing on the forums, gotten your password and sending rude/vulgar PM's tp moderator's.<br />
<br />
Like I said, very slight chance of that but it is possible, and seeing that you haven't really posted anything that bad I wouldnt rule out that possibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You could start on the path to enlightenment by using proper grammar.  Maybe the slang you use made their eyes bleed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Why did i get a positive rep bump for my post ? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have no idea what my rep is on the SOE boards.  If I want to learn about shamans, I come here - the level of discourse is higher.  Not to mention that diverse opinions may not be respected, but they are not deleted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aye, we enjoy a nice level of freedom of speech on the crucible. Possibly because the crucible's crew is built out of people who love shaman and choose to do this work, as opposed to quirky, phantasmagoricaly inclined paid-to-hear-us-out people on the EQ boards?<br />

<br />
Well, they got plenty of good puppies in the house ATM.  Doesn't take too many bad puppies and EVERYBODY'S gonna have a carpet pooping party!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">repeated use of the word &quot;poop&quot; should be bannable.</div></div><hr />
