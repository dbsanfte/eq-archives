<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All,<br />
<br />
I am a 55 Shaman and a bit burned out on level grinding, so I decided to try to complete the cudgel quests in Cabilis.  I really enjoyed getting Whistling Fists for my monk, so this seems like a great diversion from grinding.<br />
<br />
I went to LOIO and started killing explorers, then went to check my Trooper faction, Glare/Threat, np went back to killing explorers/gobos/sarnaks until I got to dubious.  Once dubious I turned in about 44 knives, and then con'd the Trooper, and to my shock I was Kindly!  I went and got 12 more knives turned them in and now I am Warmly with the Troopers.  I was under the impression Indifferent was the highest I could possibly get?  Am I reading the faction guides wrong, can I get to Ally with Troopers but only max Indifferent to Mystics?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a barbarian (I suspect the same for frogs and cats), the best I can get to is indifferent. If you worship CT, your faction will be much higher than I can get to without an iksar illusion.<br />
<br />
I suspect the faction adjustments are something like:<br />
-1000 for failing to worship CT.<br />
-1000 for being a softskin.<br />
+500 for worshipping Bertox, Inny or RZ.<br />
<br />
In barb form, I con indifferent to the troopers and scaled mystics. My faction cannot get better with them. In illusion iksar, I am ally to the  scaled mystics (I forget what it is with the troopers, but I think warmly).<br />
<br />
The scale of faction is something like:<br />
below -750, scowls,<br />
-750 to -500, threatening,<br />
-500 to -100, dubious,<br />
-100 to -1, apprehensive,<br />
0 to 100, indifferent,<br />
100 to 500, amiable,<br />
500 to 750 kindly,<br />
750 to 1100 warmly<br />
1100 and above, ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gundy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a Troll shaman of CT. My faction maxed at Ally for the troopers and mystics.<br />
<br />
Now back to lurking.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what knives is it that you turn in and to who? Only querst i knew of for faction was handing in bone chips..after getting to dubious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What religion are you?  Inno trolls are supposedly able to hit ally just like CT trolls with Scaled Mystics.  Trooper faction capped at warmly for me and that happened eons ago from hunting in Old Sebilis.<br />
<br />
If for some reason you are getting a message that says you can't advance your faction past indiff with the mystics specifically, then it is probably a bug.  SOE may have monkeyed with the faction since LoY potions came out as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am an Innoruuk Troll Shaman.  I spent a good deal of the weekend factioning and my Trooper faction maxed out at Warmly, my current Scaled Mystic faction is amiable which is enough to complete the first two cudgels at least.<br />
<br />
I was killed once in Cabilis, some of the Crusaders con dubious to me, and not sure why but one of them let me have it.  So I now make it a point to walk around invis and just do my business that way.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some of the Crusaders are on Shaman faction, the rest have there own which is why you might see different con's. Not sure what quest is out there that will raise Shaman and not Crusader at the same time tho. I was also under the impression (from working on faction with a bristlebane WE bard) that shaman was slower to raise then crusader. I found that when I was dubious to one crusader I would still be KoS to shaman and their crusaders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have taken some Cabilis faction hits from killing mobs such as the Librarian in Kaesoara and Gandan Talonfists in HS.  The only quests I have done up to this point are Explorer Knives (about 200) and Bone Chips (about 500), Cursed Wafers, and the first Cudgel.<br />
<br />
I have killed about 200 Iksar outcasts/brigands but I am probably still KoS to the necros.  I am thinking I got aggro from a mob on necro faciton which passed to the Crusader that killed me, not sure though since I reconned that particular crusader as Dubious.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cabilis is friendlier to trolls. Is your religion Innoruuk or Cazic-Thule?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>schuleta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a Innoruuk worshipping Troll Shaman. Here are my findings on faction work:<br />
<br />
56 Explorer Knives (14 faction hits)<br />
    Legion of Cabilis - from threatening to kindly<br />
    Scaled Mystics - scowls to threatening<br />
    Crusaders - scowls to scowls<br />
    Swifttails - scowls to threatening<br />
    Residents - scowls to scowls<br />
<br />
900 Bone chips (225 faction hits)<br />
    Legion of Cabilis - kindly to warmly<br />
    Scaled Mystics - threatening to dubious<br />
    Crusaders -  scowls to threatening<br />
    Swifttails - threatening to dubious<br />
    Residents - scowls to scowls<br />
<br />
32 Explorer Knives (8 faction hits)<br />
    Legion of Cabilis - warmly to warmly (max)<br />
    Scaled Mystics - dubious to dubious<br />
    Crusaders -  threatening to dubious<br />
    Swifttails - dubious to dubious<br />
    Residents - scowls to scowls<br />
<br />
208 Scaled Curskins (28 faction hits with Residents)<br />
    Residents - scowls to scowls<br />
<br />
1 Penance Quest and 4 Cudgel Quests<br />
    Scaled Mystics - dubious to apprehensive<br />
<br />
I did the knives first. It took only a couple of bone chip turn-ins to get to warmly with the Legion. Another interesting thing was that I hit dubious with the mystics after ~520 bone chips (130 faction hits), yet I was still scowls with the crusaders. I didn't get to threatening with the crusaders till ~800 bone chips.<br />
<br />
Residents which include the bankers are a pain in the rear. <br />
<br />
I went to apprehensive with the Mystics after the Penance quest before I had done any Cudgel quest turn-ins.<br />
<br />
So far I have attained my Iron Cudge of the Prophet. I have had to use Essence of Iksar Potions three times. The first time I had the skulls for the first two quests and the doll from the hextracer for the third quest before starting the turn in.<br />
