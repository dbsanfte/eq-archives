<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is an interesting page, makes you think about what you feel is important in gear.  <br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soteq.to/profile_comparer/&quot;&gt;Profile Comparer&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
It is a page that ranks eq profiles.  You can limit the players you are ranking by selecting level, server, and what not.  Then you can assign value to different attributes.  What attributes do you rank the highest?  Modifiers I selected were (I use HP as a base):<br />
<br />
HP: 1<br />
HP Regen: 10 <br />
Mana Regen: 35 (I would give up 35 hp for 1 tick mana regen)<br />
AC: .75<br />
Poison: .2<br />
Magic: .2<br />
Disease: .2<br />
Fire: .2<br />
Cold: .2<br />
<br />
Those are my modifiers, what are yours?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">modifiers?<br />
<br />
I was curious as to HP and AC.  2 different lists, 1 for each.<br />
<br />
This is a slick tool, but on Bristlebane I got over a dozen profiles for the same person.  Kinda nice to see what the few higher BB shaman that post open Magelo are wearing.<br />
<br />
And before somebody points out the &quot;profile type&quot; button... yes, it was set to &quot;normal&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like the beforementioned post, get a ton of fake profiles when doing this sort of search.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah When I tried it on CT I had to skim half a dozen or so profiles off the top that where just suits of vulak drops or had tons VT stuff in them.<br />
<br />
I forget what exactly I tried for values on items but they weren't quite used exactly like I would have thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Someone in my guild did this page so if you have any profiles you think should be excluded, email me (sour_milk@excite.com).  Include the mag numbers with what you think they should be clasified as (Resist, Dream, or Other), and I'll pass it to the admin.....although I cannot promise anything.<br />
<br />
Hard to programatically classify some of the profiles if they are labeled &quot;Normal&quot; with full VT loot. :)<br />
<br />
HPS&gt;AC&gt;FT&gt;MANAPOOL&gt;REGEN&gt;RESISTS <br />
Yeah but does that mean that you would not take a FT 5 item if you only lost 10 HPs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very nice tool!  :)<br />
<br />
I think the coefficient weightings will vary by circumstance (e.g.  For me at level 52, they'll be different than an end-game shammy like Bini.)<br />
<br />
Things I'd love to see:<br />
<br />
Ability to select between levels (from level 51 to 54, for instance)<br />
<br />
Add focus effects as modifiers (I know I swapped out gear for some focus effects)<br />
<br />
Have a way to get back to the first screen with your choices intact (annoying to have to put them in over and over when I want to change one little thing- a two frame thing might help here.)<br />
<br />
Multi-select of certain fields (class, server, etc.)<br />
<br />
A way to narrow searches by attribute (e.g. End game shammies generally have more than 2000 HP, so I might want to search only those profiles with more than that.)  Since you won't want to add another selection section for each attribute, you might want to add a few &quot;open&quot; selections:   <br />
{Dropdown with attribute names}  {Dropdown with Greater/Equal/Less than} {Text box where value is entered}<br />
<br />
On the result screen, show filter selections at the top instead of giving them their own column (e.g. I don't need to see the &quot;Server&quot; column if I selected Karana, just put Karana in the header at the top of the table.)<br />
<br />
Lose the &quot;Profile_Type&quot; and &quot;Magelo_ID&quot; columns (if it's hyperlinked anyway, you don't need the magelo ID as a separate column.)<br />
<br />
Pretty up the selection screen- don't use the database column names (ATTRIB_CHA) - this one is obviously less important.<br />
<br />
