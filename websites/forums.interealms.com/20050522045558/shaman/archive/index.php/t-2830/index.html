<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there!<br />
<br />
Now that SZ@War is banned and all... is there any other board out there? ...or are we all left out in the void?<br />
<br />
Hope you know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ha, they actually got their board totally revoked?<br />
<br />
I went there a couple of times when I tried to play there.<br />
<br />
Never seen so many &quot;dewds&quot; in one place.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the EzOP of the board (can't remember his name) would have his little cronies attack and flood other EQ messageboards.<br />
<br />
Biggest bunch of asses I've ever seen in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh, I am glad that board is gone too, and I play on sullon zek..<br />
<br />
<br />
the fools that got @War shut down promptly made a new board tho, its .. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I browsed one thread and felt genuinely stupider for reading it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Holy disturbing scrolling sigs batman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank God for PvP servers, or those guys might play someplace else.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sssithmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The best part of having &quot;them&quot; ( the people who got sz@war banned ) play on SZ is that you can kill them, repeatedly, and then come back later and kill them some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just ignore the morons *shrugs* You learn pretty fast who they are and no need to read their posts... Tips is to make scrolling into an art ;) <br />
<br />
I kinda liked the board, there was a pretty nice list over guilds and stuff... and since I am in no guild on the server, I have no way else to know what's going on. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the link :)<br />
<br />
<br />
...and btw... morons you can find alot of on every server. Don't fool yourself thinking you're safe from them anywhere. The big difference is you are allowed to punish them yourself on SZ instead of running to a GM as only way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SZ@War, while annoying at times, is part of what makes the server great. SZ is a pretty tight community despite all the flaming that goes on. <br />
<br />
P.S.: Hello to all my fellow SZers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grishnaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">on the topic of SZ  =)<br />
<br />
Does any one know any links to good team guild sites?<br />
<br />
I have a baby shaman on that server that is currently guildless.<br />
<br />
