<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have searched and I have been unable to find an answer to my specific question.<br />
<br />
I am not interested in soloing for exp per se<br />
<br />
I am not interested in tanking mobs per se<br />
<br />
I feel the shaman class and the beastlord class group wery well.<br />
<br />
What I would like to be able to do, once in a while is FEEL my classes power.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to start at the top of a dungeon, ie: guk, seb, solb, veksar, velks, etc... and kill my way thru the dungeon. This includes of course getting adds once and a while, 2,3,4 at a time.<br />
<br />
I would like to also once and a while take on named mobs, boss mobs and the odd dragon.<br />
<br />
Which class would suit me better shaman or beastlord?<br />
<br />
Or are they about the same?<br />
<br />
What does a beastlord do when he gets 2 adds? run and zone or pet cleric?<br />
<br />
I am a lvl 55 shaman and after I buff and slow I'm running out of mana even with kei and pot9 - and its getting frustrating. So of course I'm wondering if I can even do what it is what I want with a shaman, without a ton of downtime.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping canni 4 or 5 improve things a whole bunch for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I haven't actually played a beastlord at all, and my shaman is still sub-L60, but I can partly answer your questions, I think, having been around a long time...<br />
<br />
I think there's very little a beastlord can do with multiple mobs. They can slow, but slowing the add will probably pull aggro off their pet. I think it would be hard for a beastlord to keep 2, much less 3 or 4, mobs all on their pet, while healing it enough to keep it alive. And a beastlord lacks CC beyond slow, so those adds would end up beating on him, and often killing him, I'd think. <br />
<br />
My L 56 shaman, on the other hand, can take 3 or sometimes even 4 dark blue cons at once, if he's either outside (can use horse) or has KEI. Root is a powerful CC tool, and can let you split mobs up that a beastlord would have to tank all at once (or have his pet tank). I can also kill many yellow cons solo, even without malo/torpor/all the uberstuff a higher level shaman has. Haven't tried any reds yet though. ;)  Shaman is one of the strongest classes if you want to kill a powerful mob solo, especially if you want to be manly about it and not kite. ;)<br />
<br />
I dont' know what gear your shaman has, but, in my mind, the holy foursome (what's &quot;four&quot; for trinity? hehe) for a leveling shaman is a horse, a regen BP, a JBB, and the epic. You're already starting to surpass the levels where the JBB makes a BIG difference, although it's still very useful. So if you're iksar don't worry about not being able to use one. If you're troll or iksar, the regen BP is less important, also. But all of those items really help, because they give you faster mana regeneration or mana-free damage. Try to get any of those that you don't have, and it'll really help. I have accumulated all 4 on my shaman, and I just don't have mana problems. Sure, I can run out, but unless it's a really big pull, I always have more mana than I need. I recover it much faster than almost any other class, so the group is rarely or never waiting on me. <br />
<br />
If you're having mana problems due to buffing, not sure what to tell you. It's easy to run out of mana buffing a group, but it should come back fast. Best general advice I can give is to space out the buffs. Do Kragg on whoever needs it. Five minutes later, do Infusion of Spirit. Only give them to people who might actually need them.  And so on. If you try to do all your buffs on everyone at once, you will be very oom. Without knowing more about how you play it's hard to suggest anything specific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a pre-60 shaman you do NEED downtime to buff.  Well, most of the time. Everything is single target and a pain in the ass.  Keep grinding, once you hit 60+ things will get a bit easier for you.   You shouldnt be running out of mana with those buffs, if the group is stopping to give you a second.<br />
<br />
Like above poster said: Try spacing your buffs out while still using single targets.  Just buff yourself first so you know when to refresh them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or tell the group you're playing the shaman, and not them.  Use your judgement on who should get what buffs.  Agility?  Can it, don't need it.  Does that wizard REALLY need buffs if mana is tight?  Not really, get to him when you get a chance.   The tank, yourself, chanter or offtanker should be your concern as far as HP buffs go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry followed tutorial and never could get magelo to work.<br />
<br />
I have jbb<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Tunic<br />
<br />
Soulstripper<br />
<br />
wis of 160<br />
ac of 920<br />
good hp<br />
<br />
overall I think I play the shaman class well. After buffing, slowing and debuffing as required, I have mana for one good dot (evenomed bolt)<br />
<br />
then I am jbbing and casting canni to get mana back.</div></div><hr />

Shaman. Did you really need to ask - you just described shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I could solo pretty much anything on the top floor in Seb at 60 (this was with crap for gear) but it did take a while, and multiples got a little tricky. About the only mobs that gave me trouble were Ilis Wizards while soloing Discos, but my resists were crap back then.  You can probably solo pretty much any pre-POP zone outside of 4c in Cazic, Deeper in the hole (lol that doesnt sound right), And stuff where DPS is very important (King Camp in Droga, for instance). Pretty much anything else is yours for the picking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've played a beastlord to 62 and Shaman to 65.<br />
<br />
If you want to do all the stuff you described, play a shaman.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are great soloers, no doubt about it.  But getting pummeled by a 50% slowed mob pre-62 is rough.  At 62 the BST pet gains tremendous HP and power, plus we get some better buffs (Infusion of Spirit at 61 or 62, I forget), but you won't be soloing a dragon with them anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>serbaniaotic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I started duo boxing about 2 years ago,<br />
<br />
I started a shm / sk duo, then dropped the sk at 30.  Then I pl a monk to 50.  Didn't like it either, so I made a ranger.  Got the rng to 57 and shm to 58 when I got bored to zoning on 3 mob pulls, and lack of mana regen on ranger.  So I pl my bst, and have never looked back.<br />
<br />
They are both 65 now with 102/103 aa each.<br />
<br />
Since, I've pl the bst, I opted to play split tanking.  The key I found is to slow 1 mob, seek warder on it.  Pull others away from pet, via sit aggro.  Slow another add [should aggro shm at this point].  Root the mob that aggro the shm, this should bring 3rd mob with bst.  Root that one.  So bst is tanking 2, while dog and warder is chewing away from 1st mob.  This might sound tough or easy, but it's rather trivial for me now when I duo.<br />
<br />
Equipment wise for this duo, I went after anything that has 5+ ac, 30+ hp, some resists, and focus item.  And the way I do this is to converse mana.  Don't over do dots, nukes.  Bst needs mana to heal pet, and nuke to gain aggro, and shm need mana to root and debuff.<br />
<br />
Up to level 60, it was rough.  Just pick your targets wisely.  1-5 newbie, 6-24 PC, 24-35 DSP, 36-52 EC [Task Master], 53-55 DSP [Rockhoppers], 56-58 ME [nice exp and good upgrades], 58-62 PoD flies, 62-65 PoJ [MH].<br />
<br />
Now that my shm has Q, FA.  Bst with Sha's Revenge and Ferocity.  Things are much easier.  Paragon + Ext. Buff = Uber, Pet Hold is crucial for pulling casters and manage pet aggro.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've played a beastlord to 62 and (obviously) a shaman to 65. <br />
<br />
I like the beastlord alot, but he will not be able to do the things you described.  A beastlord is a good soloing class, for sure, but only 1 on 1.  As soon as you get two mobs, you have a very awkward situation indeed!  You can have your pet change target and get agro on the second mob, but that doesnt always work (sometimes the pet will just immediately switch back to the first mob).  You can run around like a girl while your pet solos the mob by himself (which he can often do, though not in any pop zones) but that only works outdoors.  Or you can suck it up, and just fight both at once (in teh faces, so to speak).  Its really quite funny, actually, in a sad and pathetic sort of way. <br />
<br />
Crowd control is definitely not the beastlord's forte.  That being said, though, they can certainly put down the damage and do almost as good a job buffing as the average shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thks for all your responses guys.<br />
<br />
I actually like playing the shaman in groups because of my ability to &quot;see&quot; the bigger picture and root park, spot heal etc... as required.<br />
<br />
I think once I get my new dot at 56 - Bane of Nife I'll feel a little more useful. After I slow I usually rebuff as required (haste mostly) and canni to get FM for next pull...<br />
<br />
I know doing the canni dance is starting to get tiresome and maybe the true reason behind my post. I think I'll focus on getting some focus items to reduce my mana consumption when I use dots.<br />
<br />
Twilight Band seems good and attainable at 10-12k<br />
Affliction Afficiency 3<br />
<br />
Anything else I should consider?</div></div><hr />

Mana preservation is always good.  So is an item with spell haste.  I know some extended enhancement items work very well because they add extra ticks to some of our key spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Coldain military wristguard is cake to get, thats an extended affliction 3 item, or I guess burning affliction its called now.  New dots come later in the 60's, so it'll last you a while.  Wicked Bone at..whatever.. is nice, spell haste for everything beneficial, gates, heals, etc.  <br />
<br />
Group Sta and Group Focus, along with Can IV and torpor make life alot easier.  If you don't have malo or torpor banked, start lookign for the pieces to make it in the Baz.  They pop up rarely, but they do pop up.  I've been able to make both spells for under 5k in pieces, although I had a failure on malo once.  The early 50's sucked, but 58-62 has been pertty fun.  I've had to laugh a couple times in the past week or two at some of the messes that Slow/Can/root/Torpor have got me out of.  And the fun thing is, if youre low enough on mana and the main healer, you can torpor your groupmates, which I find quite humorous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can solo dragons easily...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The power you feel you're lacking will definately come with levels, aa, and spells.  Canni4 is big, Torpor/Quiesence is -huge-, and there are other mighty mighty upgrades, like 61 dog and superdots.  Once you're spelled-up, and get Canni AA &amp; LR5, you'll be able to take on the world.<br />
<br />
Dragons you could technically start on now, I've heard of a 54 doing Yeldema... just not sure why. Can go back to West Wastes at 65 with Malos and Quiescence and clear all the dragons you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thks Brohg,<br />
<br />
I feel inspired!<br />
<br />
Bring it on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one can solo just about all of Seb/Vellks/Veksar/Chardok etc.... I think learning agro management is the key. At level 65 your pet can take one hell of a beaten. And the proc that you cast on  him only has to proc once for him to take total agro. So on adds i usually try to get them all slowed then spam /pet back off and pet attack untill my pet has proced on all the mobs. BUT most every time i can just stay in the mix and tank it out with him. Sometimes on adds i try to keep agro and let my pet pluck them off one at a time while i chain cast Chloroblast on myself. It all really depends on the situation. AA's will also help you out as a BST. With SCR3 and Paragon i can heal about 1600hp and 640 mana over 48 sec every 15 min. I think it all come down to your play style and methods, but both classes are VERY powerfull in the long run.</div></div><hr />
