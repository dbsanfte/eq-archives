I wouldn't touch another thing he's made.  He's still the same old Brad, who was in charge of the same old everquest.<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh, most of the changes were already started when I was there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he steps through the changes 1 by 1 and explains why he wouldn't have allowed it.<br />
<br />
He doesn't like Soulbinders, the new classes, the fact you don't no longer have to stare at a book before 35, the 1-10 no corpse/XP loss, etc.<br />
<br />
The only thing he was in favor of was the price increase.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember the days of Abashi and his BS answers and Verant's refusal to fix anything from hybrids to class bugs to whatever?  That was Brad.<br />
<br />
Balancing the game only toward the uberest crowd has no place in the more competitive MMORPG marketplace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rather than remembering the negative things you posted, I tend to remember when not a game on earth touched EQ;  when Brad took his project to an extreme at that time not touched.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, I like the guy, and share a lot of his views/opinions.<br />
<br />
I actually liked having hell levels in the game.  They added some flavor the normal blah levelling scheme.  People would ding to 30 and instead of the one or two usual &quot;grats&quot; or unethusiastic &quot;WTG&quot;, you'd have lots of people saying things like &quot;Woo! welcome to hell, haha&quot; and so on.  Now there's only spell levels, maybe level 50, and each lengthy 51+ level that even warrant any notice.  All others are just there to be trudged through.<br />
<br />
I have a warrior in level 40 now, and still wouldn't mind at all going through 2 more hell levels with him.  Of course, I don't mind that much that I'll be level 50 with him a couple weeks earlier than I would have been before, either. ;)<br />
<br />
At one time I actually thought that VI had the incredible foresight to plan on having super hell levels 51 - 60 in a later expansion and thought to gradually introduce the player into what it'd be like with increasingly more hellish levels 30,35,40 and 45.<br />
<br />
Obviously not. :p<br />
<br />
I do like all the changes that went in however, and though I think I share views in general with Brad's, I felt almost opposite to every point of his from the link above (Mobhunter).<br />
<br />
I'm excited to find out what they have in store for us.</div></div><hr />

Guess what, I don't like them either.  I've played EQ for almost 3 years now and I think they have done nothing useful to the game by making it too freaking easy to get to a high level.  I see too many jerks, idiots, and complete tools make it to 60 now.  The game is way too easy for 95% of the content, its a joke.  Being high level used to be an achievement, getting your epic was something to drool over, now its getting to be a joke.  More and more players are being handed things way too easy in an order to please them.  The more they get the more they want.  It will continue on and on till the game is destroyed, as predicted.   Brad had the balls to stand up to all the whiners so that he could keep the game from going in that direction.  Sure he made some mistakes, but a lot of whats gone on lately hasn't done anything but push EQ towards the end of its life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grazar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&gt;Guess what, I don't like them either.<br />
<br />
You really don't like that melees don't have to beg for a bind in cities, or that you don't have to stare at a 640x480 screen while meditating?<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think that added to the game, or are  you just being elite now that you're above all of that?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that to flame or anything, i'm just saying you should look at it carefully.<br />
<br />
Besides, the influx of higher level stuff with each expansion is what is causing the easier leveling.  Even with no twinking, the &quot;newbie&quot; now has 11/29 icetooth claws, and not a 5/30 combine weapon.  That stuff only gets rid of the tedium.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if that's true, I think what we're seeing is a change-over to a different type of player. In the beginning (yes, I was there too) you had many more role-playing types, those of us weaned on the Ultima's, Wizardry's, MUD's , MOO's, and Zork's of the computer world and had a different attitude about EQ, Brad could be put into that class too. Today the Diablo and FPS crowd is in the majority, that is not a bad thing, just a changed thing. These different styles of play and thinking about a game require a different set of rules. <br />
<br />
Simply put the old timers were there for the world and less for the loot and levels, the new players want the loot and the levels.<br />
<br />
EQ is changing along with it's player base, it leaves some of us cold but that's business and the nature of the beast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've never figured out why people call it &quot;begging for binds&quot;.  Not once in the 3+ years I've played have I not been able to find a bind within 5-10 minutes of initially asking for one.<br />
<br />
As far as the book goes, that's kinda up in the air for me right now; I liked it just fine when it was 35+, but I also like the idea of my twinks not having to use it.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Jaradis and Borgax had some good things to say, and I agree with most of it.  It does seem that a lot of the fundamental things from the &quot;old&quot; EQ were done away with when McQuaid left.  It's only a matter of time until the game loses most of its old playerbase, the ones from &quot;back in the day&quot;.<br />
<br />
All of that being said, I am a big proponent of having tedium removed from the game, but not at the cost of severe hampering on either side of the coin, whether that be class-interdependance, or class-INdependance.<br />
<br />
And Im still pissed about my fungi staff.  That's another thing McQuad was usually against:  retroactive nerfs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ever tried to get a bind in cabilis?  do /who all iksar shaman, and /who all iksar necro.  Probably can fit both combined on 1 screen.  That's what all iksars have a chance of getting a bind from.  Trolls and ogres are just as bad, except dark elves can sometimes wander in.<br />
<br />
Some changes are good, some bad.  You can't please all the people all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cayen, consider yourself lucky that you don't play at &quot;odd hours&quot;.<br />
I live in the great Midwest and work the evening shift, which means I'm often playing the game when the vast majority of players are asleep. My SK once sat for 4 hours in Qeynos begging for a bind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's &quot;freaking easy&quot; because of mudflation. You don't need a lot of skill to level to 60; if you play long enough and regularly over time, you will get 60 eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The soulbinders I don't think are that bad.  I'm kinda indifferent on them.  They are reasonably placed to make it a fair trade off.<br />
<br />
What I don't like is how trivial they made the first 50 levels of the game, especially the first 30.    They removed almost all of the penalties and gave a bunch more benefits, so what you get is people blowing to level 30 with ease and learning no skills at all.  The item trickle down is bad enough as it is to make leveling easy, I remember having banded till level 20 and being damn proud of it.  Now I see level 10s in rygorr/totemic and gear we would have died for.   That alone made the lower levels easier, but to take out all the penalties (corpse runs, spell book, giving an xp bonus for under 30 in dungeons, no hell levels, etc) just makes it too easy.<br />
<br />
/shrug,  yes thats my opinion, its nothing about being Elite, its liking the game the way it was for the first 2 years.  Zurabo said it perfectly.  I can't wait for EQ2,  hopefully they made it the way EQ was originally, where things were difficult.  Sorry, call it Elitist if you like, but I find it hard to be proud of accomplishments that take no effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The game was much harder at lower levels in the early days. I had a warrior on Innoruuk and he made 25 in about 6 months. I left for over a year and came back in December of 2000 and made 50 with my Shaman in about 3 months and did another Warrior to 49 in 12 days played. Neither of these are fast today but considering my playtime it wasn't bad.<br />
<br />
My skills didn't improve during the lay-off but the items sure did with the introduction of Kunark and Velious but the biggest thing that sped up leveling was zones like OT, DL, BW and Eastern Wastes.<br />
<br />
Instead of fighting it out with other players for Aviaks or CT lizards we have unlimited hunting and a leveling train. The biggest hurdle in the early days was finding something to kill where you wouldn't get killed fast and not downtime. The Kunark and Velious zones mentioned have prey in abundance and leveling to 50 is now almost trivial.</div></div><hr />

Too right.<br />
<br />
I for one cant wait for Sigils releases, that group will have some idea of creativity and 'vision'. <br />
All those things people hated and bitched about (binders, easy ports, CR removal etc) are the things that made the game special, as it it now its just one dull as hell timesink with very little challenge or achievement whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mmmm....Gospel truth, Jaradis!<br />
<br />
I really can't wait for Sigil's first release!  I'm so friggin' tired of EQ right now.  I log in out of habbit, and to talk to friends.  The second Sigil releases a game, I can leave, and make new friends, and start a new habbit!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmmm...I dont really think the game as a whole is too easy. Sure if you really want to get to 50 fast thats not extremely difficult with some help. But when you get into the 50s you start facing one of the biggest problems - high level people from the topend guilds are everywhere remotely interesting. And the topend content is primarily being adjusted towards the best equipped guilds. This means that they got the drops while they were easy/resonable to get. But now the mobs are much more contested and in some instances like ST warders/Vulak they are not even in the game anymore. So if you are not among the select few that are &quot;ahead&quot; of the game you are fighting an uphill battle.<br />
<br />
I dont think EQ is too easy but it is easily ruined by competition for spawns / ultra rare drops / extremely boring long quests / exploits / bugs. Another messed up thing in EQ is the Velious factions - you can kill King Tormax one week and the next week waltz in and get a shiny new piece of armor from the quest npcs. Thats just messed up.<br />
<br />
If people think it is a &quot;dull as hell timesink with very little challenge or achievement&quot; then maybe it is time to think about cancelling that account?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Great combo: MrArrogantRangerWithFieryAvenger who had no clue about his game + The Monopolistic Empire of Evil. Even though a great many things in his &quot;Vision&quot; were flawed, Brad never listened to his customers and was nothing more than a hidden dictator. I hope he fails, fails miserably.<br />
<br />
Being high level used to be an achievement, getting your epic was something to drool over, now its getting to be a joke.<br />
<br />
- Getting high level was camping guards because the &quot;Vision&quot; didn't allow better XP gain. <br />
- Getting high level was being crammed into Guk with 120+ players, again nice &quot;Vision&quot;. <br />
- Getting high level was staring like a retard at the spellbook, vive la &quot;Vision&quot;!. <br />
- Getting high level was living with a 2 year old XP curve bug, WTG &quot;Vision&quot;! <br />
- Getting high level was dealing with retarded 60% XP penalty because you were an Ogre SK yet you were totally underpowered compared to other classes, chalk one up for the &quot;Vision&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Getting epic was camping mindless ultra boring camps that required a guild force, thanks &quot;Vision&quot; again.  Necro epic anyone? Mage epic?<br />
- Getting epic was stemrolling, KSing, being as-sholes to others, thanks &quot;Vision&quot; again. Ragefire chapter 3452. Severilious?<br />
- Getting epic was killing a never spawn green con mob and competing with every farming/KSing as-shole on the planet, again thanks to the all mightly &quot;Vision&quot;. Quilmane?<br />
- Getting epic was the super toughness and rarity of Rogue, Shaman and Monk epics, grats &quot;Vision&quot;? Shaman epic by faction! Rogue epic by ... ugh 2 min of work. Monk epic in one day.<br />
<br />
How about other parts of his &quot;Vision&quot;?<br />
- Banning roleplayers for uhm ... roleplaying?<br />
- Hating the customer with a passion? The nice incident with SOE's british head chick who basically said &quot;We know what's best for customers&quot;.<br />
- You get &quot;hacked&quot; or hacked then you are banned? Oh wait, as soon as Brad got hacked this suddenly changed ...<br />
- How about all the LIES and DECEPTION? Alchemy works fine. Really. Pets take no XP, really. Stealth changes? What changes? We are to incompetent to handle ShowEQ so we are scanning your PC now!<br />
<br />
All hail the great &quot;Vision&quot;! The one greatest thing that happend to EQ is that &quot;visionaires&quot; like Buttler and Brad no longer work for VI. The game has been at least ten times better since they left. Is it perfect? Hell no, is it better? Hell yes. Good ridance, they make the perfect incompetent couple with Micro$haft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many jerks, idiots, and &quot;complete tools&quot; do you estimate have reached lvl 60 due to the removal of the spellbook?<br />
<br />
Due to the addition of soulbinders?<br />
<br />
Due to the lack of CRs below level *10*?  Who dies before level 10 except complete and utter first-timers in their first few days of play?  And don't they deserve a little hand-holding in the first week?  I know that after my first toon, I never died before level 10 again.<br />
<br />
The mudflation factor is real, and that and pure TIME are what are allowing idiots, jerks, and &quot;tools&quot; to reach lvl 60.  These minor changes to the interface/game mechanics are GOOD changes, long overdue.  Just because you had to hand-crank your car doesn't mean electric starters are a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Come up with a generic fix for the ever-escalating power of the average weapon, for the wide availability of previously uber armor, or for the inappropriate difficulty factor of Kunark-era epics in the face of a server with a huge overpopulation of high-levels available, and I'll be impressed.   Blame it on the lack of a spellbook pre-35 and you just make yourself look &quot;toolish&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Uh, maybe I'm just a n00b, but I fail to understand how Soulbinders and other such conveniences cause the game to be trivial. I was thinking it had more to do with the easy exp zones in Kunark and the twinking that allows melees to solo to 50+.<br />
<br />
Please share your wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've played since release, started a wood elf bard on day 1.<br />
<br />
It took me forever to level up to 10.  There were no mobs to kill, the level curve was pretty tight back then so everyone was pretty much fighting for the same mobs.  There were no ports really, no rez's, no uber equipment to help you level fast.  Those days are gone, not because of soul binders, no book medding, but because of mudflation.<br />
<br />
The whole fast exp to level 10, no corpse recovery thing isn't a big deal to anyone that isn't a newbie to the game.  Actually its quite a great asset to the CS dept as you don't have stupid idiots who twink their below level 5's, die, and have their corpse disappear after 30 minutes and loose their fungi, or whatever.<br />
<br />
Brad had a great vision for a game, Brad's biggest fault is he couldn't see outside of the vision ever.  He had no concept of what playing his game really was at high levels other then what he thought it was.  <br />
<br />
I think part of the reason everyone is bitter is because new people today don't have to go through the same hell they did 3 years ago.  Guess what, 3 years ago, a mino ax was uber, bronze was godly, and Rubi was the thing to wear.  <br />
<br />
Now, you can get a Centi Short Sword (12/25) which is way better then the 8/24 of the uber Yak of old days, for like 250pp.  Most Bronze is deleted or left to rot, Rubi is a thing of the past.  <br />
<br />
The game has evolved because of mudflation.  Of course, its the one thing that keeps alot of people playing too.  You take away the ability to replay the game and have it be easier, you take awayalot of long time subcribers.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
&quot;Adding Erudite Heretics made sense when we added Paineel as a new, free zone&quot;<br />
<br />
This quote just goes to show how much Brad really knew about his game anyways.  Erudite Necros were in from day 1, but nobody played them because it sucked ass in Odus.  They weren't added with Paineel.  Erudite SK's were, but well, that just goes to show how much he really knows about the game he made.</div></div><hr />

The fact that this makes me want to say the harshest thing I think I've ever said on a message board &quot;Screw you Brad McQuaid and that dang horse you rode in on&quot; Just goes to show it too. <br />

You automatically assume that I come home from work, and lay into the game at 5:30 EST?  No, actually....I play most of the time at the 2:00 am till 5:00 am time slot, EST.  <br />
<br />
I've played several Iksar melees...never had a problem getting a bind;  moreso, it was the lack of reasoning to GET a bind anywhere else than Cab from level 1 that struck me...Ive even seen people on here say that they've made 50 without ever changing bind points from Cab.<br />
<br />
Ogres and Trolls have it easier than you make it sound.  Trot the ogre/troll over to Freeport, grab a bind in the yard.  That run could be made by a braindead monkey at the keyboard from 6 on up.  <br />
<br />
Actually, I always thought that being *EVIL* was supposed to have a certain portent of difficulty.  Now, its almost an advantage...actually, forget &quot;almost&quot;....it IS an advantage.<br />
<br />
Most every reason that Zorlac used there, instead of being chalked up to the vision, should be chalked up to impatience.  I remember those days too, and they weren't that damned bad.  <br />
<br />
The problem with most players is really the fact that they think everyone should have the immediate easy route to an epic, or x item, or x level, or what have you.  To hell with silver platters.  <br />
<br />
Sure, they messed up quite a bit, but I would find it very hard to believe, Zor, that you speak for the masses...as bad as you make those old times seem, 250k + played in those days, and from what I gather, so did you.  If you didnt, your point is moot anyway.   Brad made a hell of a game, you can't deny him that.<br />

But, to each his own, and I digress....I'll just maintain my opinion.<br />

These different styles of play and thinking about a game require a different set of rules. &quot;<br />
<br />
Dead on accurrate. Its going to get worse too as every single game moves to the online subscription model. Get ready for the console players. <br />
<br />
And every game outfit will have to move to online subscription model for two reasons: no pirating, and steady revenue streams. <br />
<br />
That said, I have played since beta and I have  seen too many friends leave the game because of Verants pigheadedness. I say good riddance to Brad and Co.</div></div><hr />

Being extremely, extremely hard<br />
<br />
I would agree with this statement, however, the problem with epics is really now, a vast majority of them aren't even worth doing.  Plus, the mage epic isn't all that &quot;hard&quot; is sitting on your ass camping greens for hours on end trying to get stuff.<br />
<br />
Ask any mage who's sat in SK for days at a time trying to get that stupid cloak only to be KS'd by some druid who then tries to sell it to you.  Sitting in Najena or (well use to be) CT trying to get the other components.  Killing Phinny and the guy in hate to try and get the staff drops.  DRAGGING your guild to the 7th isle in order to get a crown (there is no reason for any guild to go to 7th isle other then that and it take 2-3 days to do it.)<br />
<br />
As I pointed out earlier, the game evolves.  If the game didn't evolve, there would be no point to play at all.  The stupid book was dumb, shoot, they just picked 35 as an number when they changed it the first time.  Should have been made no spell book, but Brad's vision wouldn't allow it.  Did melees have to sit and stare at anything when they sat down to heal up?<br />
<br />
The only one that really effects people leveling is the increase in exp to level in dungeons rather then outside.  For most, that's actually a good thing rather then having newbies that have no idea what a dungeon is cause they went and leveled in the outside zones.  Shoot,  PC is by far one of the best places I've found to level to low 20's now.  EXP there is awesome, bank close, and most stuff isn't too hard at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Originally posted by Cayen <br />
Most every reason that Zorlac used there, instead of being chalked up to the vision, should be chalked up to impatience. <br />
- Walk in one day into Guk. LFG, 45 min later, still no group. Walk into Guk another day, another 45 min waiting, no luck. Rinse repeat a few times and you will see a pattern. The fact that people endured this indicates PATIENCE and not the contrary. And also hope that one day Verant wakes up and fixes it.<br />
<br />
The problem with most players is really the fact that they think everyone should have the immediate easy route to an epic, <br />
- My hypocrit senses are tingling. You speak for the masses?<br />
<br />
Sure, they messed up quite a bit, but I would find it very hard to believe, Zor, that you speak for the masses...<br />
- I speak for 3 people: me, myself and I.<br />
<br />
as bad as you make those old times seem, 250k + played in those days, and from what I gather, so did you.  <br />
- Hope, patience, friends, no competition, crack.<br />
<br />
 Brad made a hell of a game, you can't deny him that.<br />
- *cough* DikuMUD *cough*. He did make a groundbreaking and historic game. But he had 0 people skills, he never listened to customers he never cared for the casual player plus he was arrogant. His &quot;Vision&quot; is still, despite the changes, geared towards people who put in 40+ hours in the game.<br />
<br />
And many people forget that a great majority of the EQ playerbase are not in uberguilds. Many play a few times a week and for those the game has been made friendlier, easier and more fun. Why did UO implement the &quot;power hour&quot; and ease skill gain? Why did  DAoC concentrate to make casual players happy with faster XP, better quests and so on? Why did EQ finally ease the leveling below 50? All this is simple: good buisness, a concept Brad and Co. never understood.  <br />
<br />
Do people want instant gratification? I am sure not. Play any game in godmode and very fast it becomes deleted. People want normal progress. Hell levels, KS, steamrolling and lame camps are not that.<br />
<br />
And the people who blame the growing retarted level 60 population on the soulbinders and removal of hell levels pre 50 need to check a very basic and easy to understand MMOG game concept called MUDFlation. When a level 1 warrior is running around in full Cobalt with weapons from level 60+ mobs, the problem is definitely NOT a souldinder or lack of hell levels. Oh and make sure put a few blame points on eBay too.<br />
<br />
You can start blaming the &quot;Vision&quot; for lack of equipement control, at least the new crew is trying to control the damage with &quot;recommended level&quot;, something Brad and Co. loathed.<br />
<br />
Again, very good ridance.</div></div><hr />

Being extremely, extremely hard.<br />
- Right. What strategy is really required to get epic? What skill is required? The skill is called TIME. TIME to sit on your arse camping green stuff, TIME to kill the same mob that requires 2-3 people OVER and OVER and OVER. This is not hard, it's time consuming. Nothing in EQ is HARD, it's not rocket science. The people with most time will end up the most succesful. Epics with major bottlenecks are not hard, they take time and nerves of steel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The only problem is that &quot;hard&quot; in EQ invariably means time-consuming. The mage epic is difficult, but only because of the sheer boredom. And it's not very well designed. Why should a MAGE have to compete with rangers and druids for an epic item? Does Verant think mages have tracking? The quest essentially puts the mage at the mercy of those who can find Quillmane just by clicking a button. That's neither thematic nor fair.<br />
<br />
Epics should be long. They should span the entire life of a character (to a point). They should have good stories. But most of all, they should be more about individual achievement than guild effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Zor, time = money;  these people (being Verant, whether now or in the past) are NOT here to make a game where you can blast through it all.  The longer you go at some goal....the more it costs you (monthly fees and whatnot), and thus the more it benefits the company.  Yet you still play, do you not?<br />
<br />
HARD ISNT WORKING RIGHT NOW.  Nothing, unless made invulnerable to ALL attacks, is unable to be defeated at this point, and that has been duly proven (time and time and time again) They have to find a way to raise the difficulty bar....ta daaa....tedium.<br />
<br />
Tedium can be a bad thing, or a good thing;  I saw &quot;having to find a bind&quot; as a good kind of tedium;  and I'm sure that some people would find it hypcritical that I think taking my 15k stick and making it suck ass is a *bad* kind of tedium.<br />
<br />
Whatever the case may be, tedium now takes the place of &quot;hard&quot;, being just another form of difficulty.  <br />
<br />
Either way, Verant loses:  They make an encounter extremely &quot;game-mechanics&quot; hard, requiring a guild-force hit to finish, or...<br />
<br />
They make it a long ass camp.<br />
<br />
Doesnt matter which one it is...some person that doesnt know any better about game designing is gonna nail them on it, bitching from here till next Sunday.<br />
<br />
So I ask those that complain:  What is your solution to this problem of either 1) tedium, or 2) numbers en masse?<br />
<br />

<br />
What makes it tough?  Let me rephrase...what makes it tough when you imagine said encounter?<br />
<br />
Now ask...<br />
<br />
How do I implement this into 3+ year old game architecture?<br />

Zor, time = money;  these people (being Verant, whether now or in the past) are NOT here to make a game where you can blast through it all.  <br />
- Again, I find it hardly to beleive that people will enjoy any game in Godmode. <br />
<br />
HARD ISNT WORKING RIGHT NOW.  <br />
- Never worked. No PvE games are hard.<br />
<br />
So I ask those that complain:  What is your solution to this problem of either 1) tedium, <br />
-Make every single goddamn quest triggered, period. Make sure quest NPCs have maximum 4 hour spawn time. Instead of having the same quest take Item A then B then C, make it random out of a pool of items. Add more than 1 step to a quest: a la &quot;Bring me his head!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Make sure while player is working to obtain a quest item he/she/it will gain XP and other items. For instance if you have to get the left ball of Venril, while you wait for Venril to pop, you got to kill his guards constantly, guards can drop some loot and they give XP. Or, have the left ball of Venril as a random drop in a zone where the player can get XP and progress the character. Link many more mobs toghether like Aary and pets.<br />
<br />
By multiplying steps in a quest, and easing the boredom it can be made long to limit the number of items entering the game. One step quests are really an excuse for a timesink to walk over to NPC X and hand in the item. In multi step quests, players will see progression, it won't be over night quest item, it will be randomized and player will get XP. Doing this you can also ease the difficulty of the mob THUS not needing a raidforce to kill it.<br />
<br />
Other option is make quest items require a caller type quest clone, fight through  waves with a maximum of one group needed and at the end a &quot;boss&quot; type mob drops rewards for a quest. Again, timesink (good for buisness), XP and loot good for FUN.<br />
<br />
Implement puzzles like in the Might and Magic series, make them random, player will have to sit down and actually *gasp* THINK. Get ported solo into a random generated maze with some clues, find way to chest, loot item. Or gate out if you get bored. <br />
<br />
Plenty of options available. Mix them, make sure quests are varied. Not hard. One of the better designed quests are the ringwars. Fun. Takes time for sure, but fun. Make quests have thinking part and kill part and gather part.<br />
<br />
Key to eliminate tedium: variety and more than one step in a quest. Also, once you got max KoS in a faction, too bad, you can't raise it. Live with it. No more see saw faction work, you hate giants, fine, kill them all. Again, add variety to a game. Some people will be giant killers, others dragon killers, other both.<br />
<br />
or 2) numbers en masse?<br />
- Random generated dungeons for a certain number of people present in the same channel. Tune reward and difficulty accordingly, limit the maximum number of people to X, take a page out of Anarchy Online's book. Also if players die, corpse getting ported to dungeon entrance. No CoH/summon corpse in this zone. For instance, get a chat channel, talk to a NPC, NPC ports you to a random dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
How do I implement this into 3+ year old game architecture?<br />
- The way they fixed a core problem with XP curve, the way VI put in scripted quest (Durf ring), rings, Nexus and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Why do you still play?  Crack, you say?<br />
<br />
Sorry excuse, I say.<br />
- Crack, friends, no competition (DAoC doesn't count). And despite it's flaws, the game is still good.</div></div><hr />

Not many true newbs are getting gifted with full sets of good armor and weapons but you can bet that Cobalt newb has one or two level 60's on the same credit card.<br />
<br />
I'm not making a judgement on this but I would like to see how a server turned out with one character per account and one account per address with everything but the basics no-drop and level limits on the higher-end stuff. You get it, it's yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">And by &quot;hard&quot; I do include time consuming.<br />
- Maybe I am stupid but I don't understand how something &quot;time consuming&quot; in EQ is hard. Playing chess vs Deep Blue is HARD. However there is NOTHING hard about EQ. Everyone with his/her own definition of &quot;hard&quot;, I guess.<br />
<br />
If it was true MUDflation then everybody would be running around in Cobalt level stuff. <br />
- When a level 20 newbie pays 50pp for a level 40+ mob dropped item it is &quot;true&quot; MUDFlation. And this is happening every day. Just beacuse not everyone is running around in Cobalt+ gear it doesn't mean there is MUDFlation. Every single character has it's own level of MUDFlation, some low, some very high. There is no item decay so there is no economy, sooner or later that Poking Sword of Pokingness is going to be dirt cheap. Verant only recently started to fight MUDFlation with recommended levels. But it's too little, to late.</div></div><hr />

The whole point is, you played his game for 3 years.  How can you say you don't agree with the Vision?  You followed the Vision for 3 years, and you liked it.  You say friends are why you stay?  That's bull ****.  You have e-mail, AIM, messenger, other games, and a f**king phone!  All are cheaper than EQ.  You loved the vision, hence why you payed 120 dollars a year (144 for Canadians) to play his game.  You love Brad.<br />

<br />
First we have to determine whether we mean MUD price Inflation-prices high-(too much money chasing too few goods) or MUD price Deflation of the type where an oversupply exists in any money condition.<br />
<br />
But I think you know what I meant, :D the real good stuff seen on apparant newbs isn't seen on true newbies YET but only on twinks and multi-characters. <br />
<br />
EQ still presents a challange to those starting fresh although not as much as before. Heck if MUD-deflation was rampant I wouldn't be walking around in the junk I have.<br />
<br />
When my Shaman started back in Dec of 2000 the Orc Fang and Cougar Claw Earrings were selling for around 2kp a pair now I guess they're under 100pp for a pair, the same for froot loops. Is this MUD de-flation or just true market value?<br />
<br />
When I played my first Warrior back in the spring and summer of 1999 bronze plate and fine steel weapons had selling value, now you can't give the stuff away, people move right from banded to their quest armor and some low level Kunark or Velious weapon. I remember paying 10gp for a pair of Derv rings when that 10 gold was more valuable than 10pp today. This stuff is junk hence no value today. Even the Totemic Helm has held some value. The more I think of it the more I think the economy does work to a point in EQ where maybe prices and value are commensurate or if anything things are priced too high (i.e. the spell gougers).<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to make a point, just some general ramblings about the game.</div></div><hr />

Me too.  I always felt epics should have started much earlier in the shamans career and spanned most of their life with many many more steps, but without each step requiring hours and hours of camping one super rare spawn with a overly rare chance of dropping a certain item.  I also think that they should code in various paths so the npc may give you a slightly different route to your epic than your friend had.  A couple of puzzles and stuff in there that arent necessarily overly hard but that at least make you think a bit would be cool as well - and not the exact same puzzle/solution each time so that spoiler sites cant give you the answer.  Lets hope some of these ideas get picked up for SWG (not playing EQ2 - I just cant face starting over).</div></div><hr />

And someone who here said &quot;During &quot;Brad time&quot; there was no stealth-nerfs&quot; or any nerfs - let me say this about that statement: HA HA HA!<br />

If it was his leaving of the company, which changed the &quot;Vision&quot; (which still sucks), then all the better, they should have booted him long time ago. And if any products of the Sigil company thing will ever have anything, resembling even closely to Brad's &quot;Vision&quot;, like it was in EQ, then I know what company products I will not buy. One thing is vision, another thing is twisted vision. Only thing which kept me going on were my friends, who are cool people (same for them), if not for them, I'd have left EQ long time ago.

Guess what, I don't like them either.  I've played EQ for almost 3 years now and I think they have done nothing useful to the game by making it too freaking easy to get to a high level.  I see too many jerks, idiots, and complete tools make it to 60 now.<br />
<br />
Those tools you refer to were racing to 60 way before these changes came out. These small changes don't help you race to 60 faster. They just help you race to lvl 10 faster. <br />
<br />
People are racing to 60 faster cause the uber twink gear is setting at EC. It is so cheap and easy to twink now a days. That's why you get the tools who don't know their class at lvl 60.<br />
<br />
I know a Shaman who stood in EC at lvl 10 buying full set JB armor. Think he will cause a problem at level 60? I do.<br />
