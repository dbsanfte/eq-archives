<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Woooo!  Rytan is in fine fettle, finally making it back to the shaman spells.  Some of them now have names!<br />
<br />
Same ****ty healing, same ****ty dps, and druids are still getting our + damage mods sooner, for longer duration, faster casting time, and less mana, but . . . SOME OF OUR SPELLS NOW HAVE NAMES!<br />
<br />
Gosh, but I'm thrilled.<br />
<br />
Couple of substantive changes.  Not sure how new these are--I haven't paid enough attention.  However, we now have a proposed PBAE slow for 50% at level 70.  Let's see.  I think we have a +5% damage modifier built into haste now, if I'm reading it correctly.  Might be nice if it stacks with our str buff.  (btw, does anyone know if str stacks with focus?)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how the enchanters will feel about that, unless it stacks with their haste.  Chanter's haste currently looks to increase chance to crit, so parses will be needed to see which is more effective.<br />
<br />
*** can't they fire that worthless piece of crap, Rytan?<br />

<br />
Either that or the 'Peter Principle.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">but the PBAE slow has a recourse that gives us a 50% rune that absorbs up to 1600 damage! o_O<br />
<br />
Well, if it has a negative resist mod on the slow, it would be handy for  when waves of adds pop during P1 in time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It has a -100 resist check too!  Only lasts 3 tics though.  I don't think that's enough to have a buff extension item (assuming they worked worth a **** at 70 anyway).<br />
<br />
Also changed--Champion is a group avatar (for 1500 mana!)<br />
<br />
Hmmm.  I should have read more before posting.  Looks like focus was reduced on hp by about 30ish hp.<br />

<br />
Many spells had their names changed, others changed levels, but here are others with some other changes:<br />
<br />
Yoppa's Mending <br />
Date Change <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Mana cost from 562 to 558 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Name from Obkin's Mending to Yoppa's Mending <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Shaman level from 67 to 68 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase Hitpoints by 1690&quot; to &quot;Increase Hitpoints by 1785&quot; <br />
<br />
Ok upgrade, step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Wunshi's Focusing and Talisman of Wunshi<br />
Date Change <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Name from Wanvu's Focusing to Wunshi's Focusing <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Slot 2 from &quot;Increase HP when cast by 707&quot; to &quot;Increase HP when cast by 680&quot; <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase Max Hitpoints by 707&quot; to &quot;Increase Max Hitpoints by 680&quot; <br />
<br />
Yes, they ****ing nerfed it.  It needed an increase not a DECREASE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vindictive Spirit<br />
Date Change <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Resistadj from 0 to -100 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Casting Time from 8.0 seconds to 3.0 seconds <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Resist from Unresistable to Magic <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Durationtext from 1.3 mins @L1 to 16.0 mins @L50 to 3 ticks <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Recast Time from 2.2 seconds to 30.0 seconds <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Deletable from 1 to 0 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Target Type from Single to PB AE <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Unknown183 from 160 to 3 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Mana cost from 250 to 500 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed AE Range from 0 to 50 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Name from Omen-Shaman-PH to Vindictive Spirit <br />
08-31 19:33 Added 'Wears off' message: The vindictive spirits fade away. <br />
08-31 19:33 Added 'Cast on other' message: is enveloped in vindictive spirits. <br />
08-31 19:33 Added 'Cast on you' message: Vindictive spirits envelope your body. <br />
08-31 19:33 Added SHM/70 to Classes <br />
08-31 19:33 Added Slot 8: Decrease Attack Speed by 50% <br />
<br />
PB AE slow, 50% with a -100 MR resist, but it only lasts 3 Ticks and has a 30 second recast?!?!?   Lose the recast or increase the duration.  3 Ticks is worthless, its a start but its pointless when its only 50% and it barely lasts long enough.  Kick it up to at least 10 ticks.  Definately a great spell if they change either the duration or recast.<br />
<br />
Champion<br />
Date Change <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Base2_4 from 99 to 0 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Target Type from Single to Group v1 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Mana cost from 437 to 1500 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed AE Range from 0 to 60 <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Slot 7 from &quot;Increase DEX by 160&quot; to &quot;Increase DEX by 140&quot; <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Slot 6 from &quot;Increase STR by 160&quot; to &quot;Increase STR by 140&quot; <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Slot 5 from &quot;Increase AGI by 160&quot; to &quot;Increase AGI by 140&quot; <br />
08-31 19:33 Removed Slot 4: Increase Damage Modifier by 10% <br />
08-31 19:33 Changed Slot 3 from &quot;Increase ATK by 160&quot; to &quot;Increase ATK by 140&quot; <br />
<br />
ATK reduced, stats reduced, and DMG mod removed... but made group version.  Stupid change, yes we wanted a group version but this is stupid.  Most groups are only going to have 2-3 melee, making this spell not mana efficient, with the DMG mod removed and ATK reduced, I'd rather just have the single target.  Add the Damage Modifier back.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just noticed that this is MGB'able, so at least its better on a raid setting, but still worthless for a group imo.  Even with it being MGB'able doesn't help it that much as the duration is still only 6.5 mins so you can't even refresh it on people cause your MGB will be down.  Add the DMG Mod back or increase the duration.  As it stands now I'd just use the single target.</div></div><hr />

It's not MGB-able. I tried it, no dice.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you look at Vindictive Spirit again...<br />
<br />
Spell Type: Beneficial, Category: Haste [Single]<br />
<br />
... so it wouldn't slow anyway<br />
<br />
Well... it WOULD slow... but would slow everyone around you by half. Yup, that works great. Guess since slow is growing useless on mobs, let's throw it on players while we're at it.</div></div><hr />

If the spell had a 50% mitigation recourse and -100 check, I wouldn't mind the 3 ticks at all and be happy with the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I personally feel Rytan has moved beyond the &quot;Peter Principle&quot; realm and is more than ready for the &quot;Dilbert Principle&quot;. <br />
<br />
The Dilbert Principle refers to the 1990s theory that companies should promote their worst employees to management. This would prevent them from directly affecting the consumer's experience of the company. <br />
<br />
The term was coined and explained by Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, in a 1994 Wall Street Journal article. Adams expanded his study of the Dilbert Principle in a satirical 1996 book of the same name, which is now required reading at some management and business programs.<br />

<br />
This is exactly what kills me.  They &quot;improve&quot; it by lowering mana by FOUR POINTS and upping the heals by NINETY-FIVE POINTS and somehow they actually think that's a change.  Are they using Thott's spreadsheets or something?<br />

OK, now I just dead.  Worrying that +160 DEX is too powerful compared to +140 dex when, maybe if we're lucky, 10 of it will actually stack with the player's gear shows absolute and complete non-comprehension of the game they pretend to work on.<br />
<br />
Hey Rytan, take all the stats out of it.  We don't care at all, Buddy.  Stats DO NOTHING.  We'd trade all the str, dex, and agi for 1 more point of attack or a muffin or something.<br />
<br />
What the heck is going on?<br />
Why do druids get better melee buffs?<br />
Why do beastlords get better group buffs?<br />
Why can't I buff endurance?<br />
Why is my healing kept in the velious era?<br />
Why am I buffing stats on people with 300+ in everything?<br />
Why is my attack buff a pain in the ass compared to everyone else?<br />
Why don't my buffs last as long as other priests?<br />
Why do I spend mana trying to slightly slow something that would have done less damage if I spammed burst of flame instead?<br />
Why do you hate us, Rytan?<br />
Did a shaman run over your dog?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This just reinforces my opinion that the people in charge of making changes and allowing them need to be removed from their positions and replaced by fresh, competent hires who can add a renewed vigor to the game.<br />
<br />
I took some time to think about these spells before responding, and I cannot fathom any logical or rational thinking behind these changes. They give us a little, but take away just as much. Are they honestly thinking this kind of an illusion works anymore? &quot;Oh, look!&quot; they expect we shall say, &quot;They made FA group castable, and gave us this new PBAE slow that is unresistable!&quot;<br />
<br />
Or, let me put it this way. (Replace 'I' with 'We' where you feel applicable.)<br />
<br />
I am not &quot;Sofa King We Todd Did&quot; that I won't notice what they're doing. <br />
<br />
I'm not so complacent that I'll stand for their making illogical and irrational changes to our spell lines. (Especially when, in the instance of our STR buff, Druids get it earlier, for less mana, and with less restrictions.)<br />
<br />
I'm not happy with these changes, although I will admit they are a (mis)step in the right direction. <br />
<br />
I am bone weary of the sheer ineptitude and incompetence of the spell designers.<br />
<br />
I want real changes, and I want to see that progress is being made to bring these to me ... instead of a Top Ten Ruse used to placate me like a Dum-Dum Lollipop to a five year old. (P.S.: SonyOE? You're insulting my intelligence.)<br />
<br />
I want someone in charge who cares enough about the game as a whole to stop pinching their sphincter and do whatever it takes to balance the game against itself, players against the game and classes against each other and their environment. I understand the delicacy of working with a 7-year old engine, but using it as an excuse limits your potential and frustrates the hell out of me. If you can't handle an archaic engine, should you really be working in the position you're in?<br />
<br />
And just to add to my relevance in this particular thread, I want someone to explain to me why these changes were made to our spells and just WHY it is we continue to be penalized every time we're given something to upgrade us. As it stands, I just feel left out in the cold wearing naught but my skin and a picket sign.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Things that look good.<br />

1. Agility is 7% avoidance<br />
2. Strength has % dmg modifier<br />
3. Focus has % dmg modifier<br />
4. FA is group castable<br />
5. Poison dot at 420 per tick.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
What looks bad is this.<br />
<br />
1. Heal is too weak, still.<br />
2. Sta buff is just stamina still. will never be used.<br />
3. Rain is still too weak.  <br />
4. Poison nuke is still too weak.<br />
5. Curse is WAY weak.<br />
6.  Group FA got the dmg bonus removed and atk lowered...<br />
7. Our group haste got turned into a PBAE slow? uhm... ***.  Case A) we have to buy an expansion to get a group version of our single target haste.  Case B)  we don't get a good group haste and get a pbae slow?  Either isn't very compelling.  Maybe if the pbae slow as at least bst lord strength (65%) with a neg check. Not to mention, our AE slow is already 50%.  Totally confused by this one.</div></div><hr />

Chill out folks.  We've seen this time and time again.  Spells are tested, spells are adjusted, spells are added and removed during the beta of an expansion.

<br />
I doubt that the top management at SOE is in a good position to judge what is or is not a design/implementation mistake or how serious these mistakes are. Considering that even long time players are divided on many game mechanics, content and class balance issues, how would the suits know that their development team is not up to the task? Or that the middle management is not catching mice?<br />
<br />
Corporate suits normally look at the bottom line, financial, organizational and other high level issues. They try to put a management structure in place that would hire and babysit good development and operations teams. Operations are easy to monitor, just look at the server uptime, unscheduled downtime due to operations issues, etc. But how can they judge their developers' competency?<br />
<br />
Customer complaints are not necessarily a good indication of problems in a competitive game like EQ. Check the message board - almost every class thinks that it is behind the power curve. Half the players are complaining that the most recent expansion is too hard (it started in Kunark, which is now remembered as the golden age of the game) and the other one is complaining that the game has been dumbed down beyond recognition (level 65 in a few months, BoT, PoK books, GYs, etc).<br />
<br />
As long as EQ is profitable and has more subscribers than its direct competitors, I doubt the suits will risk making major changes, although the GoD fiasco (our subscriber base shrinking! argh!) appears to have made them sit up and take notice. If and when OoW proves disappointing from the $$ and/or subscriber retention POV, or if and when WoW is so successful that it starts eating into the EQ subscriber base, well, then it will be a whole different story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Next, I am plenty happy with the new group FA which takes care of the annoyance factor IMHO.  Sony (Rytan) never ceases to amaze me though, saying absolutely that they will not give a group version but will think about extending duration of single buff. Then they giving us a slightly watered down group version as their &quot;compromise&quot; position.  Whatever, you can scratch off one of the big 10 for me with this change.<br />
<br />
Other changes I would like:<br />
<br />
Single target haste being better but less duration than group haste.  Just do like FA and water down the haste but make it group.<br />
<br />
Add some agility to the avoidance in our Agility Buff.  Maybe 40ish? No need to cast 2 agility buffs (you know melee will ask for it).<br />
<br />
REDUCE CASTING TIME ON OUR NUKES!!!!!!!<br />
REDUCE RECAST TIME ON MALOS!!!<br />
PETS!!!!INNATE DUEL WIELD and PET FOCUS ITEMS USABLE<br />
NEGATIVE RESIST MODIFIER ON VP and NEW VP RECAST REDUCER AA<br />
<br />
We really are not that far off if RYTAN or whomever would tune us with the above - which are more gameplay issues than balance issues.<br />

Heal 95 hp when druids get 140 hp we should get closer not lose more to druids in healing.<br />

Chill out folks. We've seen this time and time again. Spells are tested, spells are adjusted, spells are added and removed during the beta of an expansion. Hell...since EQ beta testing is pretty piss poor anyway we have seen these changes come after the expansion is out. Just try to contain yourself until the spells are LIVE, then form an opinion. Thank you.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Yeah, and we have also seen Po S spells on previous expansions that people said wait till the spells are LIVE, then form an opinion.....................<br />
<br />
We waited, they didn't get changed, and they were still a Po S when they went LIVE<br />
<br />
So that approach doesn't work either :)</div></div><hr />

A ranger can buff an entire (assume 72 people) raid for 80 minutes with +90 atk for 750 mana. The shaman, assuming 30 melee, would have to spend 161,000 mana to keep a 160 atk buff up for 80 minutes - this is frigging insane.<br />

Yah, no kidding. I do remember when pop when live with all our super useless specs. Most shaman didn't even want to turn specs in when others got much more useful spells outta em. Only took what, like 6 months of constants complaining to get them changed after pop went live? Then we still got one useful spell out of the 4 they changed and thats a silly group shrink. <br />

Single target haste being better but less duration than group haste. Just do like FA and water down the haste but make it group.<br />

Do you like Carpal Tunnel??<br />

<br />
Why should we have to have our group haste be worse than our single target?  Makes absolutely zero sense to me.  If we can buff someone by 60%, we should have a group form.  These single target, small duration buffs are nothing but annoyances.  I can still keep everyone FA'd, single target hasted, and dot, slow, and heal.  The only thing at the end of the night thats much different is my hand is more tired.  <br />
<br />
The only reason I bring this up is that this is the first time, ever, that I've read these boards and seen a shaman actually propose what SOE has obviously decided is a good idea for our class.  Enc's don't suffer from it, why should we?<br />
<br />
Does soe think we'll intrude into the domain of &quot;the hasting class&quot; by being able to group cast our 10% less haste??  For the love of Inny, I was thinking the whole time that alacrity was just bugged.</div></div><hr />

Rangers have exactly 2 spell lines worth MGBing.  Strenght of Tunare,  which not even rangers use due to the lack of HP compared to Brells.  And the Spirit of the Predator line (of which Hunter is a extension of).  In raids where ranger DPS has become roughly half of that of a rogue and equal to that of a warrior (if thats since warriors get triple attack) this is the extent of a rangers utility on a raid.  <br />
<br />
There are three classes that are currently in the crapper as far as neglect goes.  Shaman, Rangers, and Mages all have serious issues that need to be resolved, attacking them for marginal upgrade in  a spell line they have had since there 50's wont help shaman in the least.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt worry about the new group FA (assuming that we can get the new spell).  Just keep it memmed and cast it when it blinks on your buff row every 9 minutes. Easy as pie compared to the way it currently is.  As I mentioned above, I'm satisfied with the change myself.  Please do the same with our Omens haste spell.<br />
<br />
Purdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">If they correct the new slow to work on mobs, but leave the rest as is, its a spell I will use often on raids, So many raids have either large pulls to be melee locked, and AOE blasted, or have Add Spawns on a Mobs Death (P1 of Time) as a true PBAOE, and not a targeted AE, it A: will not hit yourself, and B: Hit more than 4 mobs. If it has the recourse, Great, if not still will use it, just will have to warn a cleric first. (or get a Rez after, lol)<br />
Oh YEah, and the Group FA, would be better with longer base, and would prefer the Higher Stats, and damage bonus, but as a Group spell, this rocks, We try to group the DPS Melee into groups of 1 Druid, 1 Shaman, 4 Melee to try to FA them easier, this will help bunchs. It will be more mana useage, but I rarely run low, much less out of mana anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">We know from dogdog parses that fa is a good buff for pets, and presumably each pet class will eventually get the pet AA for the group spell to work.<br />
Because single fa is such a pita to cast, it is more often than not the pets that miss out, as well as &quot;non melee&quot; classes who may occasionaly take a swing or 2.<br />
This spell allows us to guarantee that each group member and each pet will always have the buff, simpifying the management to 1 cast every 10 mins or so.<br />
I love the concept, but we seriously need to fight for the correct implementation here. <br />
Sure, make us pay the extra mana, but why oh why make the end result worse than the single target version.<br />
We shouldn't have to feel like we are being lazy because we choose to cast a &quot;lesser&quot; group buff  instead of watching the friggin clock for each 60 seconds to tick over in order to ensure we are giving the best to our group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Tickmunki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I doubt that the top management at SOE is in a good position to judge what is or is not a design/implementation mistake or how serious these mistakes are. Considering that even long time players are divided on many game mechanics, content and class balance issues, how would the suits know that their development team is not up to the task? Or that the middle management is not catching mice?<br />
<br />
Corporate suits normally look at the bottom line, financial, organizational and other high level issues. They try to put a management structure in place that would hire and babysit good development and operations teams. Operations are easy to monitor, just look at the server uptime, unscheduled downtime due to operations issues, etc. But how can they judge their developers' competency?<br />
<br />
Customer complaints are not necessarily a good indication of problems in a competitive game like EQ. Check the message board - almost every class thinks that it is behind the power curve. Half the players are complaining that the most recent expansion is too hard (it started in Kunark, which is now remembered as the golden age of the game) and the other one is complaining that the game has been dumbed down beyond recognition (level 65 in a few months, BoT, PoK books, GYs, etc).<br />
<br />
As long as EQ is profitable and has more subscribers than its direct competitors, I doubt the suits will risk making major changes, although the GoD fiasco (our subscriber base shrinking! argh!) appears to have made them sit up and take notice. If and when OoW proves disappointing from the $$ and/or subscriber retention POV, or if and when WoW is so successful that it starts eating into the EQ subscriber base, well, then it will be a whole different story.<br />

Agree - the ONLY difference between a single spell and its later group version should be appropriate higher mana costs, period. We are not talking rocket science here :).<br />
<br />
There is simply no need to change other variables between those two spell types in almost all cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Heh, I can't believe Feradach meant what he wrote seriously, or he's been playing something else then a shaman for a long time. We've been waiting since VELIOUS to actually get something useful, some utility, we've been waiting quietly and we've been ignored each and every time, while those who &quot;bitch&quot; in someone's eyes (&quot;complain about real issues&quot; in the eyes of those who actually understand things) get things changed, i.e. druids.<br />
<br />
Back when game started, we were the 'kings of buffs', nevermind that the stats didn't do anything (still don't). We had nukes which were comparable with others - we didn't nuke as hard as pure nukers, but our nukes didn't make anyone laugh either. And absolutely everyone recongnized our DoT's, because we were THE DoT'ing class. Heck, even our pets meant something.<br />
<br />
Then came Kunark. We did get some new spells, some older were upgraded, all in all it was not bad. We did lose some edge in some areas due to other classes raising in power, but we still were OK. And stats still meant nothing. We were best slowers all around, our slow being 80% slow. And after that? Slow got toned down, making the difference only marginal, new expansions came which brought to us nothing new, and the so-called upgrades could barely be called that, because the effects were increased only marginally, duration times in most cases were shorter then older versions and mana cost was increased significally. Time moved on and each time we were ignored more and more. Even our &quot;edge&quot; in getting mana back is nothing anymore, because while we get the mana back, we can NOT do anything else, while other classes have passive good regen with current spells available, not to mention have self only or self castable buffs, which all also ADD to mana regen. We didn't get anything like this, we still have the same stinkin' Canni line, which prevents us from doing anything else while getting the mana back, while the rest can do ANYTHING while getting mana back. Our only &quot;edge&quot; in mana regen now is that we can get to FM after being ressed before others do, not that we have much useful to do with it in general.<br />
<br />
We used to be comparable healers. Clerics were naturally way above us and it's normal. But we were still good and equal to druids in healing. We got regen spell before others and we got SoW before others. Now what? All other classes who can cast regen have much better copies of it now, which also include mana regen component. Regen more, have AA regen skills what they can even MGB. What do we have? A little stinkin' group regen spell. We were first to get it, and now we're last in this line, even our 'red headed stepchild' BST beats us in that area with much more useful skills/spells. We first got SoW and later Billy and that's that. At the same time, druids get increased speed version of SoW with Levi and See invis component. Now, I don't care about Levi component and even about the See Invis part, but dammit, they could have given to shamans in the form of Billy better, faster SoW. We're first to get it and, literally, on last spot with it. We get finally the group version of a resist spell against poison and disease, similar to druids fire and cold resist buff, yet it gives less bonus and lasts literally twice shorter time. And our frikkin' wolf spirit pet still doesn't have innate SoW, what it really should have... Not to mention our pet, which is lvl 58 WARRIOR pet and hits barely better then my almost level 30 twink BST. I'm not asking here to give to shamans some mage pet type mean tank or necro/BST DPS pets, but bloody hell, what we have is a trash.<br />
<br />
And now, OoW comes out and still SOE doesn't give a damn about shamans. We, the so-called &quot;kings of buffing&quot; get our buffs later then other classes, our buffs last less, cost more mana and take 3 times longer to cast. You know, only shaman frankly should get buffs, which can ALL go over the stat cap, which add bonuses like % to defense and damage and so on, and NO ONE else. That would actually turn shamans back into &quot;kings of buffing&quot; and actually turn those buffs into something USEFUL, but no, SOE screws it up again. Or, rather, doesn't give a damn. And what else? Our other spells can't be even called 'upgrades' seriously, because yet again this so-called 'upgrade' is marginal, only real upgrade is in mana cost and casting time, while the effects suck and duration sucks even more. And so on and so on.<br />
<br />
You know, I don't think SOE will &quot;come around and fix shaman issues&quot; or our spells/AA's. They haven't done it since Velious, what makes you think that they suddenly now wake up and say &quot;Oops, we messed up shaman spells, let's fix it!&quot;? Do you REALLY believe that they'll suddenly come around and fix it, while we here quietly wait? If you really do, then you really should stop taking in whatever you are taking now, because it sure as hell is giving you some helluva hallucinations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Got a question, you guys ever thought that since we can buff above cap that MAYBE just MAYBE there might be a bonus for stats about cap. That would be a good way to make us unique. For example current STA maxes at 305, just pulling number out of the air here say each STA point gives you say 3 hp per point, with our new STA buff it will go 40 points over cap maybe those 40 points will be 5 or 6 hp points for STA points. We won't know until it goes live though.<br />
<br />
Actually I think it's been shone that the opposite is the case. Sta above the soft caps, 200, 255, and 285 I think, shows diminishing returns to the point where 1 sta &lt; 1hp.<br />

Remember IH4 will be reduced in effectiveness by 30% since it's a level 68 spell, because the foci deal.<br />

I'll be avoiding Champion at all costs unless the mana is reduced to compare to rangers and the duration is increased significantly.  I just can't fathom some people will be happiliy casting this mana hog spell every several minutes for a group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">We're getting closer. The bump in the heal is nearly acceptable. The reduciton in HPs on the new Focus was something that was done across the board on all HP buffs. We actually have a few buffs that MATTER now. <br />
<br />
And no one can say for sure what affect stats above the cap will have. I could care less about the curent model, or the model in the OoW beta, I think its still being evaluated. I am willing to wager that a couple months into OoW, if the buffing stats stay the same (as far as the diminishing return over certain plataeus), and no one cares about the new buffs, there COULD be a change. <br />

EQ is an evolving thing. I think SOE is scared. Scared they are gonna lose people in droves again. Scared to mudflate much more (which, IMHO, is the reason behind the low increases we see in the spells), scared they are running out of game. I am willing to give them a chance, at least until something better comes along.</div></div><hr />

God I hope so.<br />

The only reason I'm staying in EQ is a) friends and b) my computer isn't up to running the newer MMORPGs.<br />

Friends are all talking about WoW and EQ2, and just last week my desktop system had a primary hard disk failure...Woo woo new system for me!<br />

they should be running scared, but strangely they not? why? who knows but if they where really that bothered they would have done alot more work on spells , gameplay etc for OOW, as it stand it is a fairly average expansion content wise, and extremely poor spell wise due to the fact they really need to correct alot of stuff for the expansion before? all i can hope, and it is a very faint hope, is that they`ll release it and then completely revamp the spell system, least for shaman.</div></div><hr />

I agree. The Gates heal should be 1750 and the OoW heal should be 1950, at LEAST, but again, they DID bump it some. <br />
<br />
/shrug,  I am looking forward to OoW. New stuff is usually fun (even Gaets now has some fun moments) and, if nothing else, it will give me something to do for teh next few months. EQ2 doesnt look that appealing to me, and WoW is probably another 6+ months from going gold. I am weary of the bitching and the moaning about EVERY TINY DETAIL of the game. Maybe thats why we cant get anything done, cause we bitch and moan about EVERYTHING.</div></div><hr />

Why do people complain?  Because they aren't having fun.  People didn't complain too much when EQ started, we were all having too much dam fun.  Who cared if your corpse rotted with your whole life savings 7gp.  Now everything is a race.  Who has the biggest Everquest Wang.  Who will make level 70 first.  Who has the most AA's.  Who can kill the biggest mob.  We can't get anything done cuz we are friggin human beings trying to LIVE inside of a computer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Why do people complain?  Because they aren't having fun.  <br />
I think there is a HELLUVA lot more to it than this, honestly. I think there are a lot of people who just complain, no matter what, when, where, they whine and moan. I can't put my finger on anything specific, but it just seems that even when they give us a boost, we STILL bitch. <br />
<br />
Yeah, our spells are blah. ALL the spells for all the classes are. Lets face it, SOE is TRYING to scale this game back some, to dial-down the mudflation, and the obscene stats and numbers. I see OoW as an attempt to even this game out, to STOP the rampantly bloated spells and gear. I am betting OoW gear wont be much better than Gates, if at all. Probably focus effects, and other attractive goodies like +stun resist, +spell shielding, etc, but I dont think we will see 300+ hp items in OoW or encounters that require them. <br />
<br />
But honestly, every day I come here and read threads full of people bitching about things in an expansion thats not even released yet. Yeah, we have issues with some of our spells. I agree that the past few expansions have left the Shaman class in the dust. But I am not expecting some kind of miraculous 180 degree turn. Bits and pieces, here and there. The upped the HoTs. They upped the Gates and now the OoW heals. It looks like we are getting a rez and an MGBable HoT for raids. It looks like we have some other cute upgrades. No one knows what Epic 2.0 is gonna bring. <br />
<br />
Pessimism seems to be the rule, not the exception. I am 100% behind the &quot;Voice of One&quot; thing and fully understand and appriciate the &quot;Nerf By Ommission&quot; that we have gone through as a class. But must EVERYTHING be so negative? I think OoW is gonna be a blast. But you know what. I am gonna wait for it to come out and play the REAL version some before I sit here and say &quot;It sucks&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then correct your thinking, i have seen 280hp gear already. you have to come to terms with the fact that the pople who are doing eq now are not the same as the orignal or the first few expansions, there is a reason why cut and paste spells are so popular. its cos all thats left are the talentless ones, that couldnt get a job somewhere else as noone wanted them. All the good poeple have been poached by the ex verant guys, or other games. Even eq 2 only has 1 guy from &quot;orignal&quot; eq and he was a low levle guy for that.  think about how coul a person son obivously deviod of the skills required get to be lead designer spell guy? ryan only got to where he his because everyone esle left above him, so he got promoted. unfortunately this happens alot in big business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">In raids where ranger DPS has become roughly half of that of a rogue and equal to that of a warrior (if thats since warriors get triple attack) this is the extent of a rangers utility on a raid.<br />
<br />
Not to nitpick, but the rangers on the glade have already refuted this statement.  IF warriors used the same dps setup they did, then they might put out similar dps, but good warriors choose their weapons based on agro production, not dps.  That's not to say that rangers are where they should be, they obviously aren't - I just hate when people keep the wrong myths alive.<br />
<br />
On the point though, some of these spells have potential, but they really need more work.  Developers,<br />
<br />
-The new FA is a slap in the face.  Stick ferocity 2, a 10% damage modifier, and a 10 endurance/tick effect on it, all of which should stack with similar effects on gear and other spells, and call it a night.<br />
-The next day, pull up Focus, slap shielding 2 and a 5% damage modifier on it, and then up the stats cap to 100.<br />
-Delete Ancestral Bulwark on the 3rd day and create an upgrade for bih'li, in which run speed is increased to 63% and attack is now in the 35-50 range.<br />
<br />
-Unlike god, you can rest on the 4th day, because I know that was just a huge step for all of you.  But the next morning, you're going to get your asses into gear and recode dots so that they generate the same agro as nukes dealing similar damage.  Do this and I'll apologize for each and every curse I've directed at you for the past 4 years, which is considerable.<br />
<br />
-But don't worry, you're almost done now.  On the sixth day, you're going to recode Rabid bear to make it relevant by adding useful combat effects to it and creating a second AA which reduces the recast time on it and increases the duration.  Then you're going to code critical affliction to mirror fury of magic.  And if you haven't been fired yet for disobeying the prime directive that all chain classes but rogues should be stomped on, then you need to slap a cleave affect onto Ancestral Aid so that we too have a mgb'able heal over time that has an awesome affect on it.  It's a minor thing, but one that will endear us to you for showing us some love.<br />
<br />
-On the seventh day, you fix all the annoying **** that makes us hate  each and every one of you.  Lose the recast on malos, make puppy dual wield, drop the cast on velium strike, let us shrink other groups, and give us different AA titles than druids and beastlords.  You'll be working overtime that night so bring munchies and pizza money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey look, I just planned out your week.  Hop to it chaps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Except for level 67, which only gets 3 spells, the rest of the spell levels have a decent distribution of spells.  I haven't been looking closely at every spell of the other classes, so I do not know how our spells compare to theirs.  I do know that our healing has been neglected for so long it isn't even hardly worth casting anymore.  It's a big chunk of mana for what, 3/4 of a bubble of health on a tank?<br />
<br />
Now we do have our heal over times and slows to compensate for some of that lack of healing, and I understand that.  I understood that when we received a weaker version percentage heal than what druids received.  I did not understand why we never got an upgrade to our percentage heal when druids received their upgrade, and I really don't understand why we still are not receiving a percentage heal upgrade by level 70 that is even equivalent to the level 58 druid heal.<br />
<br />
Another thing that has bothered me and alot of other people is the strength of our hybrid class.  They are more useful in groups and raids than us, and they solo better than...well is there anyone that out solo's them?   My friend's level 61 druid even felt like a chump when he saw a beastlord pet that was red to him.  There is something not right about a level 65 having a level 64 pet.  Not to mention the same character has a MGB HoT+Super mana regen, the best attack buff in the game, mana regen+hp regen spells, etc... <br />
<br />
So far I have managed to refrain from becoming beastlord #1,230,569 ...but it hasn't been easy.  I will probably quit the game again before changing classes.  At least Sony saved me the money of buying Gates of Discord by showing how they feel about balance and how it relates to the Shaman class.  <br />
<br />
Off-topic: I bet druids are scratching their heads about this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5349&amp;source=Test) as much as we are about our 3 tick AE slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">i have seen 280hp gear already. <br />
My point is I think that this 280-300 (maybe 320) stuff will also be the max we see in OoW. I THINK they are trying to scale it back, overall, honestly. 5 levels and spells etc will help even average players get into KT. 5 levels and spells will help mediocre guilds beat RZ and the EP gods and get into Time. Its my personal belief that they are basically taking Gates, and extending the levels, and keeping the gear relatively equal in certain aspects like +hps and mana. I DO think that the OoW upgrades wille be attrative enough to strive for with the additional things on them, like the +modifiers we see on most Gates gear now, and new focus effects to replace the &quot;scaled down&quot; versions. <br />
<br />
If they continue the pattern they have fallen into so far, top-end OoW gear will be 360+ hps a slot. Again I ask, to what end? <br />
<br />
I duno, honestly. I am trying to be optomistic here. Maybe I am just full of ****, who can tell at this point. But that is part of my point, overall, WHO can tell? Beta is just candy. They will REALLY start the beta the day they release it, like they have every otehr expansion in this game, even the &quot;non-purchased&quot; expansions like Plane of Sky, and Hate, etc. We'll see what happens around Christmas, when OoW has been out a few months, and people start finding nits to pick, and balancing REALLY begins ('cause they sure arent doing any now, obviously).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Hurrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">PBAE Slow.  Now that's too funny.<br />
<br />
Bard LVL 54  Selo's Assonant Strane  27% slow<br />
Bard LVL 62  Melody of Mischief   45% slow    -30 resist adjust<br />
<br />
And they can stand there and sing forever and ever.  Non stop, so the three tick limit they also have is meaningless.  Course, they could be interrupted.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, that PBAE slow they are lookin at for us, I am so jazzed.  Someone find me a rope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">All of these spells and AA's in general are crap. Come too late, do too little, are worse in general then the spells of other classes and even less effective in some areas (i.e. 3 times longer casting time, shorter duration, etc). Basically, if they're going to release this for real, this will be certainly last expansion and last months I am playing EQ. I'll keep account active until something else is out, WoW or EQ2 or whatever, since I have fun being together with friends and guildies and enjoy the time being spend with them (only reason I am in EQ for last 3 years), as do friends. I don't know if SOE is like Blazz said, afraid of losing customers or no, but so far nothing really shows that they care about it.<br />
<br />
There's still 1.5 weeks in general left before OoW is out, but I don't have much faith in SOE.. Let's see what will happen during this time.</div></div><hr />
