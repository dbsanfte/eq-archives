<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hrm, had something I've never run across happen last night on a chardok royals raid.  And it's got me wondering.<br />
<br />
Just exactly how many traps are on the bridge leading to the royals area.  I've always thought just 1.  Someone mentioned there was 2.  I don't think that's the case, but I thought I'd ask to be sure.<br />
<br />
I know the trap I'm familiar with is an ae dd spell.  If there is a second trap, what does it do?<br />
<br />
The skeletons under bridge....they are static spawned, correct?  The person who said there were 2 traps suggested the skeletons were spawned by the second trap.  Something else I don't believe, but I've been wrong before.<br />
<br />
I've never seen more than 8 (or so) skeletons come out of that pit before.  Last night we had 21 +.  I'm not sure exactly how many it was.  A druid who cast an ae dd spell counted and said he hit 21.  He didnt' think he got them all though.<br />
<br />
My theory is the spawn was bugged, and double, or mebbe even triple spawned.  But, I'm not knowledgeable enough to actually argue that point.<br />
<br />
Anyone straighten me out on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Damn, 21 mobs pad?<br />
<br />
I'll tell sallah she wouldnt have been bored if she had gone to the raid.  But she sure would have been dead.  (im assuming it was a wipeout?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh yeah, quite the wipeout.  Never, ever expected anything like that.<br />
<br />
At least the cr was easy, with a sarnak friendly druid.  Just wish we had time for a second attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We usually do AOE style break in, until we get to the library.  Might've saved you from a wipeout, who knows.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ive only found one ae ice trap on the way to king and queen.. triggered just after the end of the bridge<br />
<br />
we were trying to get to the queen (2non kos and 1kos rogue)<br />
poor sucker died like 8 times .. to open doors for us<br />
then we realized we were not in tov and could drag kos corpses all over the place ..<br />
just dragged his 8x dead as to the first locked door rezzed him there, and we were in .. had to fall in the hole above king to see the queeen .. every thing past first locked door saw thur sneak hide invis and whatever else rogues do<br />
corner camping got our little rogue friend back to zone in<br />
<br />
<br />
oops big side track <br />
<br />
ya 1 trap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sindaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And now, here is a nice SS our MT posted, after the nice pull our monk did in Chardok, just before the bridge to Castle area:<br />

<br />
AE taunt is kinda good in these situations. Too bad our chanters and wizards were LOM.<br />
Stupid monks :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hrm, ok, so one trap.  Skellies are spawned, and not triggered.<br />
<br />
And there appears to be more than 20 skellies from the pit.<br />
<br />
Blech.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild encountered the bridge skeleton trap a few months back for the first time.  No sarnak friendly guildie, so it was a long summon CR.   Nobody ever knew it was there, but none of us were Chardok veterans.<br />
<br />
I'm not positive it's always the same trap (since in my experience some traps are variable), but when we've gone since we make damn sure the bridge is disarmed and kept that way.  Sometimes we have to clean up the skeletons that somebody triggered and left up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glarfel01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As an ally to chardok, i have run across the bridge several times to drag corpses there, and while im not KOS, i have tripped a trap several times if i stand too long at the area by the door.  Usually, i end up in some whirlwind thing that keeps me levitating and does a hefty bit of damage to me, though i can gate out.  I have also experienced a stun sorta trap, which i was also able to escape by gating.  Just my thoughts</div></div><hr />
