<br />
It's random per tick up to a maximum of 20 % more per tick.<br />
It does not always do 20 % more per tick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All damage increasing items are random. 20% is the max they can do additional per tic so average is 10.5% (1% min increase) which this pretty much shows as being dead on.</div></div><hr />

oh and btw BA 4 does not work on items so i did not use epic dot in these since it would not be affected<br />
<br />
edit: didnt want to mislead anyone, the chances of those dots doing the above figures are so incredibly miniscule, it's possible on poison dots but consider you have a 5% chance to get max and there are 8 tics on poison, thats pretty low chances, heh, on something like Ultor or Pox it would just not happen heh.</div></div><hr />

thanks for the parses however.<br />
<br />
yeah, i gotta agree.<br />
There are three items in the game with this focus atm.<br />
Earring from Saryrn (which is what I have, and a rare drop at that)<br />
Elemental SK arms (which we can't use obviously)<br />
Ceramic thing of Torment, which requires a rare drop from the event that keys you for Saryrn's castle, no one does this event more then once.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's not as big of a deal with mage summoned items coming out next, but it's still very rare for a small increase.<br />
10 % to dot damage sounds a lot better on paper then it is in practice, and it usually does even out to only 10 percent.<br />
Considering the fact that there are nuke focus that have a set, non random percentage HIGHER then 10, I wouldn't mind if this got an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

You can still get your extension to DoTs from the shoulders off Coirnav as well, since it is 'detrimental' extension and meant for slows etc as well as DoTs. <br />
<br />
These effects do stack.<br />
<br />
Xeb's parses show what my initial clumsy estimates did...that BA increases DoT DPS by approximately 10%.<br />

BA4 items are definately too rare, but basically any item that used to increase dot duration has been changed to have an increased damage effect (staff of lost rituals and some EP stuff, basically).<br />

It's not good at all.  No one is going to switch out a better item for a 8 ac 20 hp 20 mana item with BA4 on it just so they can do 10 more dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would if Im soloing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">statistically speaking...assuming there is an equal chance of getting 0% increase as there is 20% increase per tick with every number in between being equally likely.  The overall damage increase is going to be 10% give or take a little, but in the long run you are going to be darn close to 10%.  That said what was the point of your parse? <br />
<br />
The only point to parse is whether each percent increase from 0-20% is equally likely, and you will get an overall increase of ~10%, if you get a number that is lesser or greater that would be a good start to see if its worth it as a focus.<br />
<br />
Second..averaging all your data like this will make numbers off..so if you decide to parse this to any degree use the real numbers, not dps &quot;trials&quot; per cast of a spell.....use damage per tick.<br />
<br />
Since you did nothing with your data...i typed it into my calculator and came up with the following (for breath of ultor, i dont want to bother doing them all)<br />
<br />
average of the hits: 144.8<br />
standard deviation: 7.91<br />
sample size: 98<br />
min: 132<br />
max: 157<br />
<br />
since i dont have breath of ultor i'm not sure what damage per tick should be, but assuming since 0% should be a relevant increase with burning affliction, i've assumed it is the min of the sample (132)<br />
<br />
therefore damage was increased by 9.8% which is close enough to 10% for this SMALL sample..someone correct me if i'm wrong about the normal damage per tick as this would lower our percent increase and justify an outcry about the uselessness of burning affliction :)<br />
<br />
So in conclusion..why did you parse this? to show us that burning affliction increases DoT dps?<br />
<br />
oh and upon further looking into the data, either 20% isnt a possible increase in DoT damage (with this item maybe?) or the sample was simply too small and resulted in no true max hits...the increase in damage was (assumed)0%- 18.9% for those not wanting to do the simple math :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I parsed it for the interest factor.<br />
A lot of people didn't understand how it varies per tick, so it is there as information. Of course you can deduce the average is going to be 10 percent, but it's still interesting, at least to me.<br />
It also shows it's relative increase in your overall DPS.<br />
For someone taking down Saryrn, in a DKP guild, for instance, it might be the deciding point between spending the DKP for this earring or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">oh, and it does between 1 and 20 percent it can't do 0, therefore ultor does 131 just for informations sake</div></div><hr />

Isn't it a good thing that the DoT wears off before a mob dies?  That means you aren't wasting extra ticks.  I fail to see how we got nerfed.  DoTs do 10% more damage now instead of the broken extension that didnt even work most of the time and didn't increase our dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a good thing where the dots are fading when the mob is at 40%.  I just personally feel the extension was more valuable to us in the long run then the supposedly extra damage.  Before the nerf, I only had to cast a dot once, now, I can cast it twice if I want to waste mana.  And the mobs still die in about the same amount of time.</div></div><hr />

As the extension had the same random 1%-20% I fail to see where the nerf lies.<br />
Actually with the poison dot line this is an improvemtn because the lower % on the extended dots would not give you a full extra tick while the lower % extra damage are always calculated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">BA4 increases DPS, EA4 did not increase DPS.<br />
<br />
For me, this is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Btw, how much % of an increase in duratio did EA4 yield?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Someone posted while i was writing, that the extension was random 1-20% as well.<br />
<br />
So lets sum this up:<br />
<br />
BA4 allows you to do the same amount of damage with a dot as EA4 did, but in a shorter period of time.<br />
<br />
Lets say, your mana regeneration allowed you to just recast your dots when they faded with EA4.<br />
This means, with BA4 you won't be able to keep dots up, you have to spend some time between dotting to get the mana.<br />
But since the dots do the same total damage, whether beeing extended or damage increased, you don't lose any dps in this specific scenario.<br />
<br />
But if your mana regeneration allows a faster recast of dots, and you can keep up those BA4 dots, your DPS raises.<br />
<br />
Its not a nerf to anyone, or am i wrong?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say a lot of people, the same ones that ask for mage ID bracers because ID4 items are rare. My wife gets a lot of requests for those bracers from the nuking classes and when this goes live she'll most likely be getting a lot of requests for it as well from the dotting classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">AFAIK, the extension foci were NOT random. However, DoTs still do more damage with BA than EA. Plus, now they stand a much lower chance of wasting ticks by still being active when the mob dies.<br />
<br />
This would be a more decent focus if the focus was actually available. I still stand by the fact that dots suck ass and need an across-the-board improvement. Foci are not the solution. Make the spells themselves better too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why are you going to parse? this guy parsed it for 100 ticks...the law of averages would lead us to believe 1-20% random is roughly 10% increase..i did the math for everyone and it is 10% roughly increased.  Math wins, yay.  If you want to waste your time parsing, whatever floats your boat i guess...<br />

<br />
??? NO ONE has said its a 10% minimum increase its a ~10% AVERAGE (as in if you did it 100 times you would increase 10% OVERALL).  the MINIMUM increase was 1%..so if your DOT lasted one tick you would increase the damage by 1% at the very least, up to 19.8% (20% rounded down in t his case) increase in damage for 157.  I dont know about improved healing lessening amount you can heal..thats probably some lousy bug or something..although i've never heard of it...<br />
<br />
anyway its NOT a minimum increase of 10%..its AVERAGE AVERAGE! i've never ever said it was a minimum increase, in fact if you read it says 1% was the minimum increase and, surprisingly to me, there isnt a 0% increase in damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using your own logic, affliction extension could have lowered the length of a DOT as well..therefore it must also have been worthless...  <br />
<br />
Games have lots of lines of code..errors happen.  Assuming you had a tnargs heal under 1300..i'm guessing it maybe happened once in all your casts of the spell.<br />
<br />
For people that dont solo (excluding raids from this as well)...BA is a bigger help because DoTs have the fun part of taking time to work and exp groups dont usually take 3 minutes to kill a mob for a disease DoT to get anything out of extension...and even psn DoTs were on shakey ground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a Coldain Military Wristband, this had Extended Affliction3 and now has Burning Affliction3, so shortly after this was changed I parsed the DoT damage to satisfy my own curiosity.<br />
<br />
I found that with EA3 each Bane of Nife lasted for 9 ticks and did 214 points per tick, with 150 points DD when it landed, which gives a grand total of 2076 points of damage, I checked 5 BoNs which each ran for full length, and they all gave 2076 damage.<br />

I found that with BA3 each BoN lasted 8 ticks, and did varying amounts of dammage from 216 to 256 damage per tick, with Dd damage of between 151 and 180.  The total damage for ten BoNs were 2119,2123,2054,2026,2054,2122,2063,2070,2036 and 2008, which adds up to 20755 damage from ten dots, which is an average of 2075.5 per BoN.<br />
<br />
So From this I concluded that I was doing the exact same amount of damage, on average, but one tick quicker, so I figured that this change IS a bonus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Improved Healing adds a random amount from 1 to 20%, just like Burning Affliction.<br />
<br />
Personally I would prefer a fixed 10 or 11%, but it's all the same in the long run either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">It's all good as far as I'm concerned. Extended dots helped efficiency but did jack for dps. If a mob happened to die before your dot ran out then your focus helped by exactly 0 %. Nuke focus items are random as well so we have nothing to complain about here, and adding the new BA effect to mage summoned items puts them in the same category as nuke foci as regards to availability. Add to this the fact that you can still extend dots with certain named effects this was definitely not a nerf, it's an upgrade.  <br />
<br />
People who whine about our damage output need to stop looking at parses from overpowered (read broken) classes and feeling sorry for themselves. Try playing a monk or a warrior, then talk to me about how hard it is to get decent dps.</div></div><hr />

I usually have the CMW and swap out a Bracer of Fortitude or my JBB.  Well, one shot from the JBB is equivelant to the effect I get from BAIII when I use Bane of Nife.  Sorry, BAIII is total junk IMO at 10.5%.  It needs to be 20% minimum for it to have any use at all.</div></div><hr />

they replaced something that always did 20% more damage, with something that has a chance to do up to 20% damage in a shorter time?<br />
<br />
i liked it just the way it was, the heck with this random bs.  its a nurf in my eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>HaggySB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I agree that you probably did just heal someone with less than 1300HP's left to heal.  I have done this myself many times.</div></div><hr />

Ok what the hell did you think was going to happen a 50% to already very mana efficient way of dealing damage.<br />
<br />
Grow up and take the 10% boost and like it<br />
<br />
it sodding free without having all your DoT efficacy nurfed.<br />
<br />
One of the main reasons DoT where so good is that you had very little way of increasing the damage they did bar possibly getting a tick or two more out of them now you have your bitching about it.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I solo ... a lot ... because i like it and this BA crap BLOWS I liked EA they shoulda just added BA and said they wont stack you can use one or the other and if you had both on BA took precedence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Bazza,<br />
<br />
I think we were expecting to get an equivalent focus effect to EA . . . which didn't happen.  Pretty simple concept if you ask me.  We had 20% now we have 10.5% . . . maybe it's just my accounting degree that allows me to see the difference. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Nuke focus items are random as well so we have nothing to complain about here, and adding the new BA effect to mage summoned items puts them in the same category as nuke foci as regards to availability <br />
Hardly, there is a plethora of DD damage items out there, plus ones that specialize in a specific magic...aka cold, fire, etc....<br />
<br />
Where is our super enhanced Poison or Disease only BA like items.<br />
Not to mention ones that ramp up above and beyond the 20% max...DD's have many of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">nuke foci go up to 35 % and nukes crit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">normal spell = x damage/tick over y ticks<br />
EA = x damage/tick over y+EA bonus<br />
BA = x+BA damage/tick over y ticks.<br />
<br />
with EA or BA, the assumption is you do the same amount of damage. with EA that damage is spread out over time, with BA the damage is increased to fit within the regular duration of the spell.<br />
<br />
the nerf is viewed as this. for example Bane of nife does 214/tick base, over 7 ticks, that's 1490 damage. with my coldain wristgaurd (EA3, now BA3), it added another tick to the damage for a total of 1712 damage, that's a 14% increase in damage. with BA now my spell does 214+~10% for 235 damage over 7 ticks that's 1647 damage on average,  <br />
<br />
yes, they did nerf total damage of the spell to raise the DPS of the spell when they changed EA to DA on the short duration dot spells mainly in our poision line.<br />
<br />
the longer the duration of the spell the less of an effect in total damage that EA would provide, and the closer it would be to the average bonus of 10% that was intended. ie the Disease line dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I would guess your under 1300 heal was healing somone who was 1100 and change down from full. as for BA, its a definite improvement over EA, Ea was essentialy the same thing as EE, where as BA increases dps, even at a lowly 10% thats still one extra dead mob in 10. not bad when you solo for your exp most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">ok that didnt make sense, read the Ea's as Affliction Efficency not Extended Affliction...sorry just woke up a few ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">are you sure you didnt just heal someone with only 1100 and some change hp to heal?<br />
<br />
edit: not doubting you, just find this curious and trying to figure it out<br />
<br />
Another possibility is that Tnarg's will only heal up to 75% of the characters life.  So if he only had a max of 1600hp, then the heal would NEVER heal for more than 1200.  <br />

right there i know this guy is smoking herbage.<br />

they cost almost 600 mana a shot. (i can cast two velium strikes for 750 mana and do more damage with FoM alone and have less aggro)<br />
