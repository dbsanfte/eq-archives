<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not an uba equiped shammy and in a very small guild so went to farm in arena last night with 2 guildies and a friend.<br />
<br />
Spent about 3 to 4 hours there and had 4, yes 4 PLATE, 2 leather and 1 silk drop and NO CHAIN!!! Argh! Needless to say the monk, cleric and Sk walked away very happy leaving a highly aggrivated troll fuming lol<br />
<br />
Btw, anyone know of a good spot where the chance for chain to drop is higher? We were doing the left side of Arena but I guess we pulled the whole area.<br />
<br />
Or alternatively, is it better to shift focus and do CT and try to get some Tae Ew blood to make the BP and shield instead of doing Kael?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats the way it is in Kael.  My old guild farmed there for 2 months straight and we say 5 chain drop the entire time.  Of course it was the chain no one wanted.  Never say a chain BP drop..was all bracers and boots.<br />
<br />
CT is not a grind zone if you are lower than 55.  Even at 55 to 58ish its a tough spot to be.  Blood does drop at the zone in though, which is much easier than the tunnels or CT main areas.  Enterance is good exp at 55..but its slow because repops arent really fast.<br />
<br />
At least thats  how I found it to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tae ew legs, chest, and shield are pretty good - you can click my magelo link to see all three if you like :p  Velious bp and legs are decent, but the rest of the pieces aren't very good.  You didn't say what level you are, but IMO it'd be better to farm for what you want.  You could farm CT for the blood and ask a smith to combine for donation; you could also farm money zones like seb, pog, etc. and just buy what you need.  Buyable gear is nearly always better than the velious quested gear, and a lot less of a hassle to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kael and HoT chain drop rates are normally REALLY bad.<br />
Plate drops like rain in comparison.<br />
<br />
WToV didn't seem soooo bad (from memory), but you need to be on giant faction for that.<br />
<br />
I would take a couple of guildies down to CT entrance and get some bloods and get a Tunic/Legs/Shield.<br />
<br />
Maybe take a monk so you can pull deeper than the courtyard and not make a big train :)<br />
<br />
For the rest of your armor slots, perhaps check into Ogre Cultural chain (yes trolls can use it, just make sure its the correct Deity!). Though prices can be a bit on the high side (5kpp to 15kpp per piece).<br />
<br />
Or post a magelo and ask for other suggestions on upgrades.<br />
<br />
BTW, apart from the BP and Legs, Shaman Thurg armor is pretty craptastic! :( Look around for alternatives!<br />
Legs ARE nice tho. I think they are about 10kpp for a MQ on Torvon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's a sekrit to getting kael armor!<br />
<br />
You know the area behind the ice wall?  The temple, with vindi and such?  Go back there.  Jump down and kill the armor or whatever.  On the right wall where the armors are, there's an invisible wall.  Go through it.  Down the tunnels are more GoZs and such.  You'll pop out on a little ledge overlooking the inside of the arena.  Hop down, kill your way out of the arena, then cycle through the temple again.<br />
<br />
Much bigger faction hits, much more frequent armor drops.  Mobs are tougher, but not that much tougher.</div></div><hr />

Tried to take on the lizards at the entrance with a 55 SK and 58 monk when I was lvl 59 and we were sent running by the 2 casters after the door pulls.<br />
<br />
With my current gear no way can I solo or split the door pulls let alone going further in. Looks like I will bring the group to CT instead of Kael in future.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice and help :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went the CT route after getting ticked off at chain drop rates.<br />
Here's a few tips:<br />
1) take a cleric to pacify! With my GF's 57 cleric pacifying, single pulls are no prob. BUT once the 2 lizards at the door are pacified and pulled, if she gets close enough to open the door BAMMO. 3-4 mobs ...gotta zone. So we had monk sneak/hide up to door, open and she pacified at max range. rinse repeat<br />
<br />
2) another spot if you have a wiz friend is the maze. Have the wiz TL your group into CT. There are no roamers near the spires. Of course pulling is trickier due to getting lost, and more casters. We tried this method a few times but our monk kept getting lost and having to try to FD thru 3 lizards nuking him.<br />
<br />
Ultimately I took a group of me (@ level 58-59), cleric (57), Pally(57), Monk(52), and 1-2 various guildies rotating in and out over the course of 5 nights ( 3-4 hours a night). We stayed at the door for simplicity sake. The drop rate varied widely. One night we got only 1 blood, the next night ( same camp same team) we got 5.<br />
We found a smith that would accept blood for payment ( i.e. give her enough to make a tunic to keep in addition to the one I'm wearing). In that period we farmed enough blood for : One tunic( mine) 2 shields ( cleric and pally). I'm going back for more to upgrade my shield.  :D <br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">KD is tough for drops, and yes, plate is by fat the most common, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense given the faft that there is a specific plate drop cycle elsewhere in Keal Drakkel!<br />
<br />
In fact, I think you were a bit unlucky. In my experience, leather is the rarest drop, then chain and then silk, but that there is not a significant difference between those 3.<br />
<br />
I have the full set of KD drop / Thurgy quest armor, which is a testament to bloody-mindedness and good luck.<br />
<br />
I suggest that you give KD at least 1 more try before you give up on it. Take a tracker class with you - the Veterans have the highest chance of dropping quest armor pieces.<br />
<br />
The tae-ew armor is really nice, but unless you have access to a very high skill armorer (not triv at 255?), it is not gonna be a cheap exercise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok I got me 2 Tae Ew blood so far. I think I need to get a few more to trade with a GM smith to make it for me.<br />
<br />
I can smell that nice BP! :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replys and getting blood to drop is MUCH easier than getting damn coroded chain drops in KAEL! lol<br />
