<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lathyrnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, went on my first Dragon Raid yesterday, took down Naggy.  It' kinda weird how I got on though.  I met a Monk named Thirtysix of all things, on monday, and grouped with him.  Tuesday i saw him again, but he was in a group, so we chatted for awhile and I got in a different group.  This is all in SolB btw.<br />
<br />
Anyways, yesterday i see him again, but he is in a SS group, too far down for my lvl.  That's when the emergency patch message comes up, so then 36 tells me there will be a Naggy raid after patch,a nd tells me I can join in if I want, just log onto chat.  I did that, but like 10 minutes after servers go down chat goes down too.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, i'll get to the point.  Servers come up, we head in after a few false starts, and wouldn't you know it someone aggroes Naggy.  So we all have to camp out and come back.  We then procede to beat his punk a$$, though i did die form his AoE 8(.  However, he drops Hammer of the Scourge, and since I am the only Shaman on the raid, I get it! Yea!!!  No CoF though, poor melees 8).<br />
<br />
So I am quite happy now, not bad for my 1st raid ever.</div></div><hr />
