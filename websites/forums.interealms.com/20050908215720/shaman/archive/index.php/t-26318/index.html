<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/echo Scowls.  The /shielding ability is really strong, and needs to be enhanced, if anything, not removed at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there's nothing wrong with pet shield!<br />
<br />
devs, if you are reading this thread, please ignore it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our pet is a speedbump, nothing more. The shielding is fine and a nice little feature. Just buff him a little bit so that he has a chance of living through a hit or two, always nice to have something go wrong, your pet grab aggro and manage to live the first round of swings with 1% left and then enrage.<br />
<br />
Don't expect him to take hits, just make a new one when he dies, and you'll love him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">he pisses me off a lot of the time :( I might get pushed out of melee range once in a while, and he'll get one rounded. there goes all my panther dps :(<br />
<br />
or if the blasted mage tells his pet to attack a mob that's attacking him, my pet will get one to two rounded from the original mob.<br />
<br />
or if the slack tank doesn't account for pets when positioning enrage (not that he should ^_~) and i'm mid cast, and pet gets one rounded on enrage.<br />
<br />
or if i accidentally habitually hit slow hotkey (with pet attack tied to it) and pet procs panther and gets mowed down on the first hit on pull<br />
<br />
or that time when the ae is just a tad too powerful for him, maybe 50hp/tick to be generous.<br />
<br />
All of these instances combined occur MUCH too frequently, and, just ask my mage friend, i get VERY angry ! Rrr(( &gt;=(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have the AA to burn, pet affinity seems to have drastically effected the lifetime of my pets. Any group beneficial spells hit him now. Group HoTs, group buffs, group CURES, group direct heals! <br />
<br />
Not sure about cleric epic/Div Arb. Doubt those work on him, but our epic does, as well as Ancestral aid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">one word: enrage.<br />
<br />
tossing an HoT on pet at this point will help his life-expectancy, and give you an option to CC or gate. but in general, I'm not worried about my pet's survivability, he's just a temp spellslot and a bit of mana.<br />
<br />
enrage will keep him alive long enough to keep mob's attention and for you to decide exactly what to do.<br />
<br />
besides....he's a ranger.....you'd think that his prone to death would be enough of a hint, he's a ghost-wolf. needn't I point attention to the striking resemblance to the mangled puller's body at statue camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Without buffs the bracket for him enraging is about 240 hp. With wunshi it brings it closer to 300hp. If you have PA it makes it closer to 500! - such a pathetic margin.<br />
<br />
 Aye i do have PA ) but often i forget to summon him before group buffs are cast heh. Noone's fault but my own really. The rant was only half serious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">pet affinity owns, still could use an HP bump for the new pet as he does go down a bit to fast some times. i don't think it is a super crisis though.<br />
<br />
99% of the time the thing that pisses me off most about the pet dieing is that i have to get him rebuffed...<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Panther 650 mana a cast<br />
Farrel's Companion 650 mana a cast...<br />
it is not to hard to resummon the pet when it dies =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Plus the 30 second recast timer during which you have to wait without another buff slot (usualyl panther for me) up. Plus there's wunshi and talisman of alacrity, and a fresh new champion. It's a HUGE mana sink.</div></div><hr />
