<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has had a major dropoff in attendance since the dx9 patch due to people simply nt being able to play/enjoy eq anymore without spending money on their computers.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if this is widespread or not.<br />
<br />
Please no omg just buy a new $1000 upgrade to play a game you were playing last week replies.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping if others are having the same problems that face me and my guild that soe might actually something about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Err...umm...well, if you have been playing MMORPGs for the past 5 years on a P1 with a 32MB graphics card, feel lucky that it's been this long since you have needed to upgrade (Yeah, it's exaggerated...but you get the point).  If people want the game(s) to get better, the hardware needs to get better also.<br />
<br />
My PC is 3.5 years old, and it is plenty (and then some) to run DX9.  The only upgrade I have made was a Video Card, cuz my bot PC got the one in my main :D  The bot PC runs fine on DX9 also, and it's well over 4 years old.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be an ass, but DX9 requirements aren't exactly staggering.  I feel bad for the people who need to allocate some cash to get upgraded, but it was bound to happen sooner or later.  BTW, how did these people survive a trip to the Bazaar on their old PC's?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">people with decent pcs (2gig , late model video card) are having problems.<br />
<br />
It worked last week so it should bloody well work this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only problems I think im having are from updating my Nvidia driver. I am getting _disgusting_ lag in The Feerott, WC, Everfrost... and no-where else. Its like treacle, and nothing works until I spam 'Escape' to close all my windows... then its fine. <br />
<br />
Im a bit sick of it to say the least, along with the Alt+enter crashing so I can no longer check web sites while playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ridgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If are experiencing lagging issues or video related problems since Everquest went to Directx9 then you can disable the calls by adding the following first line to your EQCLIENT.INI file.<br />
<br />
HardwareTnL=FALSE   <br />
<br />
You will loose the nice new stars in the sky as a trade off :-(<br />
<br />
Geforce2 and Geforce4MX seem to be the main cards effected.<br />
<br />
This won't correct all lag problems but helps with some older video cards.<br />

EQW works fine again and is nicer to use than the build in windowing support. eqwindows.com (http://eqwindows.com)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I agree, the crashing on alt enter is really pissing me off.  I'm using EQW now, but I really prefer the full screen thing running, it seems to respond better and it just feels better (plus EQW requires I change the gamma outside of game to be able to see sometimes, I never had that problem in full screen mode).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought pre Luclin graphics were just fine, &amp; I'd gladly trade less eye candy for speed (former competitive QIII player - been playing again some since the patch of doom). I don't expect to be able to play a NEW game on my 5 year old box, but one that worked when I bought it is another story.<br />
<br />
SOE said the updated system requirements would affect about 1% of the customer base - that's a huge number of people though. I wonder with all the noise if it's not more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm afraid I don't have any advice, but I wanted to mention that our guild has seen an ugly drop off in raid attendance as well since the DX9 patch.  Of course, it seems like the hardest hit were the clerics...go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ya, our attendence figures are low as well. I'm not sure it's as simple as some people not being able to play though. There have been a lot of major bugs which have been causing serious problems and affecting the general enjoyment of the game for many people. I think that has simply turned a lot of people off the game, at least for the time being. A fair number of people 2 box when they have a bit of free time, are working on private projects and can't find a group (its been hell in that regard since the patch), and those have also been adversely affected by the issue with older systems. So, under those circumstances many simply dont log on.<br />
<br />
As for upgrading EQ for the future, that is all good and well, but it should at least retain the option of using the old system for previous expansions. After all, these are client side changes, not server side. The server shouldn't be affected by what eye candy option the client has selected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Update!<br />
<br />
Too lazy to link it, but if you look in the tech help section of the SOE boards, they've been trying to fix the problems on Test, &amp; many people with older video card/CPU combos report framerates as good, &amp; sometimes better, than the old engine.<br />
<br />
Didn't work for me though, need a new  video card :/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes my small guild has lost its best warrior due do the new graphics :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The changes may be client side but they do impact the server code, especially the patching code, and they impact the testing and maintenance burden.<br />
<br />
The new engine runs much smoother on my hardware, but there are glitches with interaction with the environment and lockups with ALT-TAB/ALT-ENTER.  I'm hoping they are working feverishly and it's all going to get better in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;it worked last week and should work this week&quot;, there comes a time when the game has to move on or stop being competitive.  If the bottom X% of the machines that used to be able to run EQ can't do so any more, that's a calculated risk on their part.  The calculation is how high X can go before they alienate too many people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just a thought. Is everquest the first game to ever massivly change its system requirements durring its lifespan? I'm not saying that is a problem, people expect EQ expansion to look better and better, and they were reaching the limit with dx8, all this moving to dx9 is for the next expansion imho. But, is this the first game to attemt to deal with the issue of forcing out of game costs on customers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>arfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This is at least the third expansion that has required an upgrade in minimum hardware requirements. I suppose this has to be expected in a game that is 5 years old but hopes to continue to be competative. It is always frustrating for those of us who suddenly fall below the threshold and must change hardware or be out of the game.<br />
<br />
What is particularly frustrating is that this is the second time where an expansion was sold to one set of minimum requirements, only to have the some second update severside that makes them suddenly reaize that the old requirements are not enough and a new set of minimums are published. They are always sorry for any inconvienence. How unsurprising that they have been marketing the one year subscription so hard before publishing the new requirements.<br />
<br />
My desktop is a p2 mx440 and is seems like quite a few people are having framerate problems with similar equipment. As it has been said all too often, worked one day, suxored the next. <br />
<br />
I have a much more powerful laptop so Ican still play, but it is ever so much less fun, and no more 2 boxing.<br />

So you never asked for new content either eh?  I'm afraid thats not a realistic argument when it comes to MMO's over the course of their life span.<br />
<br />
As per poor preformance even with current equipment...lol Karaab that is indeed funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, still reading that thread for &quot;proof&quot; of anything.<br />
<br />
A guy posted that if he hacks the registry to enable some performance monitoring feature, it reads zero.  Meaning either nothing is occuring on the graphics card, the feature doesn't measure what he expected, or the (undocumented and unsupported) feature just plain doesn't work.<br />
<br />
OTOH, I observed the game playing BETTER with the DX9 engine on my ATI 9600, which supports DX9 and T&amp;L in hardware.  I get better framerates in the bazaar and on raids, even with the new models running, than I used to.  This would seem to indicate that something is happening different, eh?<br />
<br />
I'd be interested in seeing what actually does go on on the graphics board if anyone does have instrumented hardware that works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Personally my experience has been that the graphics side of things has definitely improved.<br />
<br />
My main system is an athlon xp 1700 with a radeon 9700 AIW and it's doing better on raids and noticably better in the bazaar. Can actually run around the bazaar pretty easily.<br />
<br />
My second system is an athlon 1200 with a geforce 4 4200 in it and it's substantially better. It used to be really laggy on raids and such but it's now quite playable.<br />
<br />
Both systems have had dx9 installed for a while and run windows 2000. I have started having problems switching between windowed and full screen mode on the second machine since they push out just that graphics update. Otherwise both systems have worked flawlessly from the get go even with out updated drivers.<br />
<br />
It seems like most people that are reporting very slow performace are working with older graphics cards that are only dx7 cards like the geforce 2/4mx and the ati radeo 7500's.<br />
<br />
I'd also guess that attendance might be down not just due to people lagging to badly to play but also to people frustrated with all the other issues. Falling threw the world, ending up on the roof, bouncing off everything like we're rubber, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If the &quot;new engine&quot; only works decently on cards that have DX9 features on them, that means only those who have bought brand new cards in the last year or so will be able to continue playing, which will throw the player base off a lot. Why should I have to fork out another $300 for a video card that works perfectly well and fast in every other game under the sun?<br />
<br />
Sure, in some I might have to turn some of the graphics down, but in general, I want working, fun, content, over &quot;pretty pictures&quot;. You can't judge a book by it's cover, or a game by it's graphics.<br />
<br />
Case in point, Earthbound for Super Nintendo... the graphics were NES-era, but the story and gameplay more than made up for it. Unfortunately, aside from &quot;new graphics&quot; (which more people seem to be having problems with, than those that are having no problems at all), EQ really has no variety of content, at all.<br />
<br />
Don't believe me? When was the last time you were able to progress and gain a decent amount of experience, items, or anything of the sort, without killing a thing? That's what I thought.</div></div><hr />

The game runs a lot smoother that it used to. I do get some glitches now and again. Typically light blue lines flash across my monitor about 3/4 up the screen but they gone almost instantly. They don't appear often and have no effect on my game play. I still use the old models, except Troll (so they are thin) and Ogre (Horse), b/c I think the new ones suck.</div></div><hr />

I've been running DX9 for a year.<br />
<br />
Its not something only new cards support, trying sticking to you old drivers or backtracking, never ever ever ever believe a software vendor knows which video driver you should use, or for that matter any other software/hardware component. Speak to the local geek or play with it yourself.<br />
<br />
Eg. I clicked Cancel etc on every prompt EQ ever gave me about updating drivers etc etc, and I've never had a problem (apart from the ****ty EQ Client code which I of course have no choice about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Barbacus, older cards run DX9 through software - there's a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that runs the routines on the CPU if the card is not capable of doing it in hardware.  Thus, older cards are not &quot;really&quot; running DX9 in the sense that newer ones are.  The newest cards implement most or all of the DX9 graphics pipeline in hardware, so you get better graphics without increasing the CPU burden.<br />

If you're running EQ well, though, no worries, just do what you've been doing :-)</div></div><hr />
