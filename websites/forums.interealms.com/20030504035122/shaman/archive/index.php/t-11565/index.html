<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would it be possible to duo Guardian Wurms with a 58 Shaman and 60 SK?  <br />
<br />
Shaman is only 57 now, but not far from 58.  Most I have done right now is stuff that hits for 330 max and about 32k HP.   GW's hit a little harder, but my concern really is getting slow to land at 58.  Two resists would mean death.  Its tough to slow and heal at same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, they are not too resistant. Land Malosini first if you want assurance. SKs are good at taking and keeping agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're really worried about dying, have the SK aggro kite while you land malosini and then slow... shouldn't be *too* tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, they are slow as dirt so you can kite them around until you get a slow to land if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Targuran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just wanted to confirm what has already been said and add a little.<br />
<br />
I've successfully duoed 4 Gwurms at level 61 with Stoicism (no malo/torpor).<br />
<br />
3 times with 62 SK<br />
1 time with a 60 Pally (I pulled for this fight and yes they are VERY slow)<br />
<br />
Landed malosini either first or second cast every time then slow first cast every time.<br />
<br />
Fight took approx 7-8 minutes (remember to reslow after about 5 and a half).<br />
<br />
I just healed with Kraggs when at 50% with SK and 60% with pally. Used epic dot, and Stoicism + Canni 4 on myself when not healing.<br />
<br />
Never went below 80m the whole time and ended all 4 fights at about 90-95m and full health.<br />
<br />
I would also recommend a fire resist buff for the tank as Gwurms proc a AoE fire DD.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also wanted to add, I never had a problem with gaining agro any of the fights.  I imagine with a warrior as your tank, it may be a problem initially.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I was not able to single pull the elder wyverns at 61 but the SK was able to at 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I was level 57 I would meet the puller and just kite it around until I slowed it.  I don't think it ever took more then 2-3 casts.  Just remember they have a long melee range.  You should have little trouble duo'ing these with a 60 SK as long as you are careful, but take no short cuts when you do this.  A mistake could be deadly very fast :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you pull with dispell you can snag the elder wyverns single every time. The two characters I box are a SK and Shaman so yes you can duo them. Some enrage at the end so be prepared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamaness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my husband (a 60 paladin) and I (60 shaman) did the VP entrance camp relatively easily.  The GW were a little tough but their resists are low and we only had trouble when we got two GW in a row and on the second we got an add.<br />
<br />
My gear included a JBB, horse, epic and had KEI on me.  Did not have torpor.<br />
<br />
Btw - we got Torpor off a GW after about a week of camping - maybe 10-12 hours total.  <br />
<br />
Now all I need is Malo<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I two box a 58 SK and a 60 shammy, and can duo guardian wurms. I was tanking these with my SK at 56. I've actually always pulled with my SK, never tried pulling with my shammy though sounds like a good idea!  Once they're slowed they're cake. My SK has 3k buffed.. so he's not an &quot;uber&quot; tank. the suggestion of pulling with the shammy (and if you have a good taunter, such as an SK to peel it off once you got it slowed, it's easy) is great. The fight is just a matter of casting Kraggs a few times, and letting the tank.. tank. <br />

50+ Guardian wurms, and No Torpor or Malo :-(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mimoza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have duoed GW with a... cleric :p<br />
<br />
60 shm (with torpor) + 59 cleric... initial plan was to let cleric tank with her summoned hammer, but it turned out I was to do the tanking... so be it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a 55/55 shaman monk... was planning on duoing these starting at 58 after Kraggs...sensible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not all the GW have the fire proc, they spawn in different variants.<br />
<br />
Also there is not really a need to kite debuff them all over. You can just root them when you get to the camp spot, back off, debuff, then let the tank do his thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I didnt think about rooting them.  That will be something to try too.  Ya, I have killed a few of the GW's with groups, they dont always have the fire proc.  Kind of suprised us the first one we got that did.<br />
<br />
Monk might take quite the beating from a GW, not sure how well they can tank them.  Guess it really depends on their equipment.  <br />
<br />
My SK is only average, and has tanked them before and did fine.  The only problem we had was once when had a low level slower, and they got eaten by the GW.  We werent really set to do the GW unslowed.  Just used alot more mana, all we had left after slower died was a 60 sk + pet, 55 cleric, and 61 druid.  Long fight, lots of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Smoosher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Myself (60 shaman) and my wife's 56 warrior are able to duo these pretty easily. I've pulled about 15 of these and have not had a Turgur's resisted as of yet. I pull with Turgur's, and when I finally coax him back to our camp spot, I run around like crazy while the warrior gains aggro. At that point, send in the pet, epic dot, pox, and JBB. Reaply dots as needed, med if you need to and continue JBB when you don't. I keep CB and Kragg's loaded for heals and I don't think I'm much below half mana by the end of the fight (I always get kei before trying this). Neither of us are twinked - warrior has around 1125 AC with 4k hit points, and I have a lot less than that :) Warrior is using Frostbringer and Black Acrylia sword of some kind in off hand.<br />
<br />
I've tried casting Bane, but the warrior seems unable to keep taunt, so I use Pox instead which is significantly lower aggro. Once the warrior has aggro, she's never lost it with me casting Pox, epic, and JBB.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, thats why I'd suggest having the slower pull, don't really need to malosini/malo it at 55 I was landing slow first time easily, now at 60 when I get a random resist, my shaman automaticaly dies if my SK pulls, so I intend to start pulling with my shammy, and keep kiting until slow lands, at which point I'd pull back to camp and peel off with my SK (may try root as well). Seems nearly failsafe to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A while back I duo'd one. I was level 60 and the druid was 59. I just slowed, tanked and dotted and druid dotted and healed me. It was a pretty easy fight. and fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh yeah, I just remembered something that could be useful. An easy way to pull your GW to your camp spot without any adds is to pull your GW, then run a distance (or root), then invis yourself, Pull the GW back to your camp while invis, he will follow and no adds will agro. This works at least at level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i duo them with a BL or mage. best thing about it = healing pets is no agro.<br />
enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tensor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I duo them all the time with me (60 shaman) and my 60 monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I finally tried them duo for first time last night.  Wasn't much of a problem at all.  Just kited them around some while malosxxx and slow were landed.  No outside buffs were used like KEI, Aego or anything.  SK had about 4200 HP with buffs from 59 shammy.  So you don't have to be super well equipped to do this.  Very doable, for the non-elite.  Killed 14 so far, no deaths (yet).</div></div><hr />

<br />
well the big question is just what is the minimum level they are duoable????<br />
<br />
I can duo orc pawns but this doesn't exactly give much information... neither do people saying, &quot;I killed a GW with a full group of 65&quot;. OK an exaggeration but you get the drift...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well myself and a 61 Warrior managed to duo them ok.  To my complete and utter surprise, when I looted the first one what was waiting there for me?<br />
<br />
Nothing other than Torpor :D<br />
<br />
/me is one happy shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fayclopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Before the monk nerf to defense, I tried to 2-box a guardian wurm with my shaman and a 56 or 57 monk. I think I was 60 at the time but didn't have torpor. All went well until the enrage...duel wielding monk dies to enrage really fast. So that's a problem with 2-boxing these things with a monk or even if the monk is played by someone else they have to be really careful at the end. The monk wasn't exactly tanking great but Kraggs worked to heal him. <br />
<br />
I don't think I've ever had slow resisted on a guardian wurm. Even at lvl 51 on a Ragefire raid long ago, I was able to slow with 1 try. I still cast malo first though, might as well.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, I sometimes 2-box them with a 61 pally using a windblade. This works much better, and with a slow weapon I have more time to react to enrage. I have malo/torpor now but some shamans in guild would be happy if I happened to get one for them.<br />
<br />
I never tried soloing one, it would be a big risk. I don't have any quick buff AA and I'm notiously bad at channeling spells. Green mobs that hit me for 1dmg have about a 50% chance of interrupting me. If you have some quick buff AA and get casting time of torpor down, you have a good chance at soloing these.<br />
