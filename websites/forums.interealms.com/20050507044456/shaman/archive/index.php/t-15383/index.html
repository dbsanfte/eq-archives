<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There's the 2hb strategy... Corpsegrinder and that 33/30 2hb and that Granite Crush hammer that can deal massive amounts of damage with close to 1-to-1 ratios.<br />
<br />
There's the strong mainstay 1hb strategy... Thundering Mace is a 19/22 that has great stats-- basically an upgrade to the epic, and allows me to still use my shield.<br />
<br />
There's the strong swap-in 1hb strategy... Alendine's Cudgel or whatever is like a 32/30 1hb or something, but it has sucky stats-- basically swap it in whenever you rabid bear.<br />
<br />
There's the proccing 1hb or proccing pierce strategy...  REIF or Copper Hammer of Striking or Soulstripper or Pile Driver come to bind-- basically not depending so much on melee damage but rather procs.<br />
<br />
What's the most effective in your opinion?  My main question is the first three strategies count on me hitting the mob, but the fourth strategy doesn't-- but the melee damage isn't as significant, and the proccing causes a lot of agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saving the 5 points for something else.<br />
<br />
But, if you already have Rabid Bear, I would think the best damage/delay ratio would be your best bet. Since proc damage doesn't require you to hit, having Rabid Bear won't really help you. Swapping a nice weapon in and using Rabid Bear is what I'd do if I had rabid bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I see..  the question is, will I be able to hit anything?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree that it's probably not advisable to get RB.  <br />
<br />
However, if you have RB, probably the best shaman weapon out there, short of the the elemental planes is Bone of Bertoxxulous (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28852).  You need a raid worthy guild though to get it, as it drops off the High Priest in Ssra temple.  Another good weapon, easier to get is Aleje's Ceremonial Cudgel (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28813).  It's easier to get as it's a semi-rare drop off of Va'Dyn in Ahkeva Ruins.  VD can be taken down with 3 or 4 good groups of 60+ folks.  He's a slowable version of Vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">VD can be taken down with 3 or 4 good groups of 60+ folks<br />
<br />
1 group of 65's can do it pretty easy, and I believe he was 1 grouped before PoP even.  Fully slowable mobs = cake in almost all scenarios.<br />
<br />
Back to the original question, you are going to miss - a lot.  Especially if you are using it on higher level PoP mobs, or high ac ssra mobs.  Older mobs (sebilis, chardok, etc) probably would be a little better.  Really depends where you use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From what i understand, the haste with RB means delay doesnt matter, so get the highest damage weapon possible. I have a Shovel of the Harvest sitting in my bags as a 2HB from Gozzremm in WToV. 50 damage 43 delay, max hit ~210. Not overly hard target to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love Rabid Bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">really dont matter to me i usually use my corpsegrinder, pile driver, or my acient 2hb.  i hear that 2hb from fire is very nice to use RB with.  i usualy use my pile driver  since i can keep most of my hp and i double for 126 or near that.  wish i had mroe vengence tho omg  could use the atk most ive ever got was like 1564 buffed with bard , sk , ranger buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm trying to remember what weapons I have again for rabid bear, I have taken a break for a few weeks so can't remember all of them. But I have a Dalnir Great Hammer(too slow even in rabid bear form nice hits of 230 sometimes though), soulstripper, I have mace of dark thought, Granite Crusher, and a Pile Driver(procs like mad but haste kinda reduces proc level..). Ideally I want the copper thing or the 1hb from powater /drool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SOEF is best rabid bear weapon out there, can do 130+ DPS with it during RB but its from Ele so that blocks it for alot of people.  Its one of my goals atm haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah SoEF rocks too(staff of Eternal flames 2hb with 450 dd proc I think) pain is its rare from the birds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My friend is a big fan of his Blam Stick out of PoMischief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rabid Bear and Dark Mace of Thought (Theft of Thought proc) combined with Quiescence and a Tnarg's now and then straight up owns melees in pvp.  Add a potion-based DS to yourself and you'll really be rockin their world.  The manatap proc siphons off life from SK's, Rangers, and Pallys, leaving them only a sub-par warrior without mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Staff of Eternal flame is nice with rabid bear.<br />
Max hit is just under Bone of Bertoxx (210 vs 226) but the proc is a fire lure dd doing 400dmg.<br />
Pretty nice when the staff decide to proc and when you are lucky enough to crit the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hammer of hours looks to be more fun imho =)<br />
<br />
Go go 750dd proc, its ratio isnt as good but its a 1hb.</div></div><hr />
