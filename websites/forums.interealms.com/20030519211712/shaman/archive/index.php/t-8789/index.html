<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Contagion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could anyone point me to a thread with information on multi-questing the Shawl quests?<br />
<br />
That or answer my question....  Is multi-questing the shawl at any point possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">MQing the Coldain Prayer Shawl quests?  I think that the only ones that can be multi-quested are the 3rd (the recipient must already have the 2 shawl) and the 8th (the recipient must already have the 7th shawl).<br />
<br />
MQing the 3rd shawl is pretty easy.  Get someone that has already done the 3rd shawl to give the Seal (recieved earlier in the quest) to the Loremaster, then you give the Loremaster your 2nd shawl.<br />
<br />
MQing the 8th is a PITA!  The person doing the MQ must make all the armor for you, and then start the quest by giving the issue kit to the dwarf in Iceclad.  When the quest is over, you give your 7th shawl to the Avatar of Below.<br />
<br />
I'm writing this from memory.  Check EQTraders.com for more accurate info on the quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Contagion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It seems like it is more of a hassle than anything else to get the MQ.<br />
<br />
Thanks though=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In order to MQ the 8th shawl, you must 1) have your 7th shawl approved and 2) have someone else with their 7th shawl make all the armour, etch the gems, and win the war.<br />
<br />
I doubt you will find anyone to give you #2. It's just too much work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Contagion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The issue for me is that I have a close friend who has already done the majority of his skilling, and who I am 100% sure would be willing to help me with any MQ I could ever need.<br />
<br />
I guess a little more information on my part would have helped.<br />
I haven't done any of the Shawls yet, and I was looking for a convenient (even if expensive) way to snag a better shawl.<br />
<br />
Thank you =)</div></div><hr />
