You must open your eqhost.txt file in your EQ directory (Likely Program Files/Sony) and edit it. <br />
<br />
Where you see &quot;eqlogin1.989studios.com&quot; change the &quot;eqlogin1&quot; to &quot;eqlogin3&quot;. Leave everything else alone. <br />
<br />
I edited mine and got in on the first try.<br />

Copied from EQLive. Supposed to work.<br />

We are currently experiencing issues with our login server.  As this problem is being looked into, logging into EverQuest may be affected for long periods of time.  Please check back here for updated information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Deathadder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Word on the EQ Forums is that changing the 1 to a 3 actually logs you in via the administration servers, which are not designed to handle the capacity of a normal or '1' server.  Chances are the world tried logging in to '3' and crashed that login server as well.  This is also why people were getting warned/banned for using this...<br />

<br />
There once was a time when this kind of incompetency from SoE amazed me but not anymore. They truly do have some of the worst customer care I have ever witnessed and if WoW is just slightly ok I think it will destroy EQ because the last months SoE has constantly been pissing of their customers. The uberguilds because the top zones in the expansion are messed up, the normal people that bought the expansion because there is nothing for them in it and the rest (if there are any left) because they cant log on or because the new graphics &quot;update&quot; made it impossible for them to play.<br />
