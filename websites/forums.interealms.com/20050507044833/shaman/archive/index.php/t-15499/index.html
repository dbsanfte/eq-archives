<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, we're getting a second computer (my wife finally got tired of me hogging the PC all the time playing EQ  :D ) and now I have to decide which character to switch to the new account. I've got 3 'main' characters:<br />
- 55 druid<br />
- 57 warrior<br />
- 49 shaman<br />
<br />
So, which one would you move to the new account to 2 box with the others?<br />
<br />
Note:  I'm usually grouped with friends that have the following, although I do solo a bit occasionally:<br />
#1 - Druid only<br />
#2 - 60 cleric (but he's kinda burnt on this one), 57 mage (preferred), 47 SK and monk<br />
#3 - 59 enchie (and occasionally 2 boxing with 55 druid)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Move the shaman.  If you have a druid to group with from your friend set you can bring in the warrior, otherwise shaman/druid is a nice combo.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that you would never want to play druid/warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Warrior? You can port him around with druid and d<br />
uo him with the shammy.... and have a healer/melee combo either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Split the shaman and druid up. It's up to you which one you would move but I would move the druid personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How about a 3rd account so you can 3-box 'em all?<br />
<br />
ROFL :)<br />
<br />
Note that this advice is coming from a dedicated quad-boxer. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah, I'm sure my wife would love that one... :p ...maybe you could ask her for me??     (I think the reply would be loud enough that most everyone that reads this board could probably hear it  :p )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would move the shaman too but there is something else that I cant get out of my head...<br />
<br />
...before your wife was annoyed that you were always hogging the PC playing EQ and therefore you are getting an extra PC...but now you are going to play EQ on that one too? ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">move the druid.. for the all important times you need to port either the warrior or the shammy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would move the warrior, that way you could use the warrior with the shaman or the druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">EDIT: Scratch that - move the druid. Then you will have a good powerlevel class on each account (druid or shaman), and the druid would be able to port both your other characters. This gives you more freedom should you decide to create a new character down the road, you'll have somebody on the other account to help him level regardless which account you put him on.</div></div><hr />
