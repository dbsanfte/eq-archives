<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's nice to see them actually giving DoT casters some love when it comes to focus items. Now there's one pretty big flaw that needs to be looked at.<br />
<br />
Imagine being a rogue happily meleeing away with your dart of Immobility/Double Edged Stormblade combo when all of a sudden you begin to see:<br />
<br />
You pierce Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra for 55 points of damage.<br />
You pierce Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra for 63 points of damage.<br />
You backstab Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra for 130 points of damage<br />
You backstab Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra for 475 points of damage<br />
You slash Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra for 34 points of damage.<br />
You slash Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra for 62 points of damage<br />
Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra was hit by non-melee for 150 points of damage.<br />
Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra is slashed by flying debris<br />
A Massive force knocks you into the air. You have taken 1 point of damage.<br />
You were hit by non-melee for 22 points of damage.<br />
You were injured by falling<br />
Your target is too far away, get closer!<br />
You pierce Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra for 35 points of damage.<br />
You pierce Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra for 42 points of damage.<br />
Your backstab did not take hold<br />
Your backstab did not take hold<br />
You slash Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra for 58 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Well of course that wouldn't happen, because all melee stacks. The only limit on the number of melees attacking a mob is technical space around it to stick people.  So what is keeping DoTs from working in a similar way? Well, it's because mobs are limited to 30 debuffs.<br />
<br />
I'm sure any of you who've raided along with a couple other shamans/druids/necros can feel my pain, and it's only aggravated by adding weapons like VZ's scimitar (Obsidian Shatter), that fist off Bertoxx (Scourge), or the wicked shank (Heat Blood) Which essentially have cute but otherwise worthless effects that eat up precious debuff slots. Melees can't seem to understand that for every time they proc some useless effect on a mob, they're taking DPS away from the raid, and it's one less Blood of Thule, Funeral Pyre, or Blood of Saryrn that's carving that 950khp monster up nicely.<br />
<br />
After typical Debuffing, a mob will look like this:<br />
<br />
1) Malos -&gt; Malosinia<br />
2) Howl of Tashan<br />
3) Harmony of Sound<br />
4) Aura of Darkness (That SK resists tap)<br />
5) Turgur's Insects (or Grummus)<br />
6) Insidious Malady<br />
7) Cripple<br />
8) Hand of Ro (some dr00d ATk/FR debuff)<br />
9) Ro's Illumination (Another funky dr00d debuff that takes off Atk and FR or something)<br />
10) Aura of Hate<br />
11) E'ci's frosty Breath (AC/Cold Resist Debuff)<br />
12) Mark of Kings<br />
13) Mark of Retribution (whatever the upgrade is called)<br />
<br />
So that's almost half the slots used up without even getting into DoTs and procced Effects yet.<br />
<br />
Assuming you have 2 necros, 2 shamans, and 2 druids on your raid:<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
Breath of Ultor is like 21ish DPS<br />
Blood of Saryrn is 53<br />
Pox is 18<br />
+ Epic (sometimes) or nukes. Let's call it 3 DoTs per shaman<br />
<br />
Necro: Blood of Thule is 55dps<br />
Funeral Pyre is 43<br />
Saryrn's Kiss is 33<br />
Splurt averages to 19dps<br />
Dark Plague is 21.5<br />
<br />
Let's say each necro uses 5 DoTs (though I know some who do more and throw in pyro too, or hell, an epic click)<br />
<br />
Then you have druids, who don't really have very good DoTs...<br />
Swarming Death is 40dps<br />
then there's some fire thing which I really can't see them using<br />
<br />
I'm just gonna say druids use one DoT...<br />
<br />
So right there is around 16-18 slots in damage, which already pushes you at the cap on slots, only including a meager 2 of each class that used damage over time spells...<br />
<br />
I know shadowknights get a couple (bond of Death, Blood of Hate) and bards who aren't doing overhaste or AE resists/Mana are gonna be twisting some chants...<br />
<br />
Essentially, if a spell is not going to take hold because there aren't enough slots to hold it, it should not expend mana, so we can instead spend it on some pathetic nuke and not be completely out of the mana... Or you can just increase the number of slots to something reasonable ceiling that all but the most zergtastic 200 man raids are going to bump thier heads against. 75 would be more than sufficient.<br />
<br />
Again, I'd like to say thank you for at least giving damage over time spells a bit of a nod with the addition of Focii, but don't fumble the ball at the 5 yard line.... go the full mile and actually make these spells a decent DPS factor in raids, rather than a liability<br />

<br />
Damnit nobody else has anything to say about this?  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">had the same thing with DoTs tonite in VT  /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Does it really matter if the mob dies?   Has there been an instance where you failed a raid because you had 30 shaman/necros/druids and they all couldn't stack a dot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It matters yes even if the mob dies. Nukes stack to infinity , melees stack to out of standing room. Also If its taking mana and yet not landing. <br />
   Just seems funny to not be able to cast something on a mob. &lt;gets message&gt; buff slots full get back to me in 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
 Also matters more because of wipes that could be avoided. BUt this all comes back to pop raids and needing a billion people plus the dot stacking change. I suppose its doable without change so guess maybe why no one seems to have much to say? Running out of buff room on group mates drives me nuts too. I dont claim to understand programming though so i dont know what exactly can be made to fix this without screwing up balance somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i never dot on raids. I honestly (not a flame) dont see how you can have time to dot on a raid, especially in PoP. 2 kind of encounters in PoP : Pretty much classic MT mobs : after debuffing you chain tnarg the MT, and gooffy mass adds kind of fight, where you have to CC, heal, slow, whatever. Never been able to launch a dot in any encounter in PoP.<br />
<br />
However, yes, in VT it sucks. But well, if you filled the 15ish debuff slots that are left, your mob has enough DPS on it, stick on healing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Speaking of Breath of Ultor, Griz - what's the damage per tick on that one? <br />
<br />
I dont have a copy yet, but I keep seeing it in the bazaar (overpriced, of course). When you examine the scroll it says 21 per tick for 2:48 or so. I calculate that out to less than 600 total damage. I use Pox of Bertoxxulous and it does 111 per tick. I'm assuming the spell description on the Ultor scroll is just a typo, so what does it actually do? Is it supposed to read 121?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I rarely dot on raids.  While I do see your point, there is still alot of aggro on poison dot.  Even if your tanks have EB items which all of my guilds does, it does not guarantee you can dot till your hearts content.<br />
<br />
I would like to know how many elemental guild shaman regularly dot on raids and doing the named.  Stacking BoS and Ancient:Nife on AM last night got me summoned before either ran out.  Dotting on raids is just not 100% feasible anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ultor is 131 a tick for 26 Ticks. A great &quot;Fire and Forget&quot; sort of spell.<br />
<br />
Usually after malos/malosinia/slow/insidious/Cripple I just demem all debuffing spells aside from slow, and load up ultor, pox, bane, and tears of saryrn. I swap out my mace of confusion for the epic click too.<br />
<br />
And my personal best is 108dps not counting my pet over 13 minutes on an aten blob, but we only had 1 necro and 2 shamans there =)<br />
<br />
I only had FT1 then, no burning affliction, and no Affliction Efficiency though. I don't have blood of saryrn, or ancient scourge either. Now that I have FT11 and should be getting a bracelet of darkness soon, it's gonna be impressive to seee what I can do with that setup + a mage summoned BA4 Bracer :)<br />
<br />
Of course, I wouldn't try stacking 2 poison DoTs unless one of our 2 tanks with a BF/BoC combo was tanking... the rest of our tanks only have 1 EB weapon :/  Removing poison counter agro would be nifty.  I just hope the new curse counters aren't ridiculous agro too.</div></div><hr />
