<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems the advent of the cursed frogs has spurred the ecnomy greatly.  My trader has seen a flurry of activity lately.  Many items that have been on the shelf for weeks have been sold.  Silver Chitlin Hand Wraps are scarce (or were last nite) and usually there are 6 to 8 for sale in Bazaar.  GO FROGGIES!!<br />
<br />
Maybe that's what the US needs to spur our sour economy.   Hrrrrrmmmmmmm...how to start new frogloks in rl??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, every new expansion changes the economy, especially when there is a new race or class.<br />
<br />
Also, the new tradeskill stuff (especially armor dyes) and the new lizard mounts are eating huge chunks of PP out of circulation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That does make since.  I have been pleasantly surprised as of late because of the items that have just been sitting there for so long all sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I forged a few small acrylia plate BP and legs from some almost rotten bank items and the stuff flew off faster than frogs can flick flies.</div></div><hr />
