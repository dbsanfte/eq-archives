<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oberon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I have a budget of about 1,000 pp.  I want to get something nice for my Shaman GF as a christmas present, and was wondering what would be good?<br />
<br />
She has a scattering of decent gear now, and were still low level, so nothing is crucial, but I dont want to spend money on stuff that will never be worth it.<br />
<br />
So far I was looking at the Totemic stuff, but it seems to give a lot of stat bonuses to stuff she really doesnt need, and not a lot of bonuses to wis.  I also looked at the Jaundiced bone stuff, but some of it is really expensive, and I dont think she can use the 'clicky' part of it at all anyhow. (at least not for quite a couple levels).<br />
<br />
Is there any 'clickable' gear with low level reqs?  She is only level 13 atm, so it would have to have some pretty low reqs.   I saw a shaman only ring 'red ceramic ring' or somesuch, that cast burst of flame, would that work for her?  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, any suggestions would be appreciated, I am more aiming for a suit of soemthing, or one really cool item, not nessasarily the most cost/stat efficient, but something useable and neet as a present.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated<br />

It had a nice black chain look and good ac/hp. Finish off the ensemble with drab colored plate (jaundiced bone and totemic) and she wont need an armor upgrade for a while. I'm still tanking IN TEH FACE with it at 32.<br />
