<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering how well shaman tank once they get torpor.<br />
<br />
Monk/shaman duo currently 54 and 6 AA each so need to think about speciality AAXP soon. (yeah-yeah I know I should level to 60 first rather than AA but this was my choice)<br />
<br />
Almost never group so monk is MT/MA now. This has disadvantages (monks fight better from rear) so maybe should think about getting sham to be MT? When he gets aggro he doesn't seem that bad (especially since monk nerf). I could see torpor being brilliant for sham as MT (currently saving even though nobody sells it any more since PooP).<br />
<br />
If monk MT, probably should go for monk defensive AA's, but if sham MT, monk should go for damage dealing AA's.<br />

<br />
But basically, monks should have higher hitpoints than shamans, and it's rogues you should worry about doing damage from the rear.<br />
<br />
If shaman is the healer and he keeps getting hit, especially without torpor, you are going to be in trouble in most places in the world.  Every hitpoint lost is also potential mana lost -- mana you need to heal all those lost hitpoints with!<br />
<br />
Losing hitpoints on a melee is much easier.  Then the shaman will only lose mana, and hitpoints at a much slower rate.  Much better than losing both mana and hitpoints simultaneously, especially with only superior heal and chloroblast to back you up.  <br />
<br />
I've duoed like crazy with my monk/shaman, and it works very well.  But shaman is never the better tank unless the monk has really low hitpoints and the mob is unslowed, or unless you're going against mobs with very high hits so that their riposte on a monk will be brutal.  On some PoP mobs like that, I cast poison DOTs to keep a mob on me full time and I don't melee so I don't get riposte damage.  Meanwhile, dog bites it from so he doesn't have enrage problems when the mob gets low hitpoints, and monk rips into it from behind for the same reason.<br />
<br />
I have torpor, but found this to be the case with and without it.  A lot of your kill rate and survivability will depend on shaman mana regen, so don't give yourself more downtime by eating both hitpoints and mana at once by trying to tank.  Unless you're just wanting to keep aggro off yer dog.</div></div><hr />
