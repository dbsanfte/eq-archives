<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dizell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
To all the shaman that play on Rodecet Nife, I;ve setup a new message board for the players of that server to use at <br />
<br />
http://www.rodcetnife.org <br />
<br />
It's open to all to use and enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rodcet Nife - the server of azzh0lez.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Going to be interesting to see if people use this one.  Rodcet's never really managed to pull off that whole &quot;community&quot; thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I know, I see what other servers are capable of, would be nice to see something positive grow from this... of course it may not be possible. Never know until ya try.<br />
<br />
There used to be a decent discussion forum on ezboards, but when EZBoards upped rates so much, it became popup heaven, and many people quit using it.<br />
<br />
I thought since I had access to the tools, I'd set something up and see what happens. Who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's bound to be more findable anyway, one serious point in its favor.  I have ezboard gold, so popups don't bother me, but I was always losing track of the ezboard - why they couldn't get a board id like &quot;brodcetnife&quot; or something is beyond me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been playing on Rodcet Nife for over 2 years now in the guild Flight of Dragons.  Maybe it's because I've only played on Rodcet Nife that I dont see how it is filled with azzholes.  Sure you have some people on there that act like little kids, but I bet all the servers are like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dizell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep yep, there are good and bad people on all the servers, it's just in some people's natures to be annoying cusses.<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna hitler moderate anything, and in fact at some point I hope it gets to a point I can ask for help from other Rodcet players to be Mods. (IE it actually gets used!)<br />
<br />
The old Ezboards site was used for some time, until the popups hit. I have an EZ Supporter account too, but many don't.<br />
<br />
I just like a good message board in general anyhow. Sunmoon does a great job with the Crucible and Glade. I'm hopin mine gets a little attention from our local server players and gives us a place to hang out and just say hi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you can get the larger guilds to use it, word will spread and it will happen.  <br />
<br />
yea, pretty sure RN has never had a calender or rotation on mobs n such.  I've always just figured it was laid back enough to not need that crap.  Then again I make it a point to stay out of how Uberguild_01 is trying to screw Uberguild_02.<br />
<br />
Isn't Rodcet Nife the god of Peace Love and Healing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ummm... RN never put together a community? Check out VN Boards and www.flamevault.com granted people at flamevault are all old school and retired, but thats still a community they put together.  And as far as azzholes... *** I resemble that remark!! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dizell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ummm... RN never put together a community?

<br />
yeah, but it's 90% flames, and little community, for the people who just want to chat, that's not what I call a healthy community.<br />
<br />
Flamevault is more like 99% flames, as the url suggests.<br />
<br />
I enjoy a good flame fest when I'm feeling cranky, and there's sections to allow that as well on the system I've setup, but there should be flame free sections for real discussions.<br />
<br />
just my opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My message was perhaps misphrased :)<br />
<br />
Rodcet has certainly spawned a fairly active community on flamevault - but since most of the people IN that community have been retired from EQ for 2 years or more, it's not very representative of the current players on the server, and EQ is a very small part of the discussion there.  :)<br />
<br />
It is a hell of a fun read from time to time tho.  I've been on the server since the summer of 99 myself, so flamevault is people I remember.  Most of rodcet these days is level 65 people I've never heard of.</div></div><hr />
