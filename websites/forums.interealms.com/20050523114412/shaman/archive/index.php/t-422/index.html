<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a warning that there is a bug that can cause items to disappear from the trade window when you cancel a trade.<br />
<br />
I got stung by this bug last night and lost 3 bags off my EC mule.<br />
I do not think its common because I have been selling sell off my mule for a few weeks and this is the first time it has happened.<br />
<br />
I was also informed by a guide the Verant policy is they do not reimburse items to character under level 6. :mad: <br />
<br />
Moral of the story:  Pl your mules to level 6 before parking them in EC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check with a GM. A lot of times Guides don't know what they are talking about. If it is a bug they know about they will probably reimburse you. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jallail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heard it from a GM before... don't know the total truth of it since we really don't know squat about the &quot;true&quot; rules for GMs but he said that &quot;We don't keep logs on characters under level 6 so if you lose some item off a char under level 6 we cannot verify its validity and will not replace it as such. Don't twink until level 6.&quot;  That is what he said nearly verbatim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes i've been told the same thing before.<br />
<br />
they have rules<br />
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/reimbursement_policy.jsp<br />
<br />
see rule 11.1<br />
<br />
but i think that's not &quot;no log for them&quot; thing.just PL you mule to lv6 and /petition again durin normal GM working hour.but i forgot the exact time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are quoting the rule out of context Tinysun.  That is strictly for corpse decay.  NOT bugs or other things.  <br />
<br />
And that &quot;We don't keep logs on characters under level 6 so if you lose some item off a char under level 6 we cannot verify its validity and will not replace it as such. Don't twink until level 6.&quot; is a line of crap.  I know for a FACT that they keep logs for every level because I've had my level 1 mule lose an item during a trade and the GM checked the logs, saw it just poofed, and handed it back the next day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jallail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, like I said... don't know the realities.. just want the boner said. Guess I can deem anything he says as false now.  Good thing I'm not on his server any more. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know the exact story about chars under level 6 but a friend of mine has had bags go 'poof' in the trade window several times as you describe and each time, he /petitioned the GM and was reimbursed his items. As stated, I don't know if level matters, but, what the hey, it won't hurt to try. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail All,<br />
<br />
I’d like to believe there is the “Spirit” of the Rules and the “Letter” of the rules, unfortunately with so many dumb ass jerks the GM’s have to resort to the “Letter” so as not to have mass bleeding hearts out there wanting free gear. <br />
<br />
I hope they make an exception in your case, because there are good players out there that get screwed over by others and their bad game play.</div></div><hr />
