<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, someone leaked the draft upcoming patch notes on the WoW forums. The person was suspended from the forums for 3 days and all related threads were deleted. Caydiem then stickied her own thread threathening action against anyone else that did the same.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, your ace reporter has found a site with the notes.<br />
<br />

<br />
Again, these were leaked, and by Blizzard's reaction, deleting vs. locking the thread, I believe they are probably a genuine draft.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a prude, but I hope the new artwork is less obscene for some of the armor and the succubus.  My 9 year old daughter likes to play some.  It's substantially ok, but there's no need for striptease wardobes for some class armors.</div></div><hr />

Yeh boyee! THAT'S protection! :)</div></div><hr />

As you usual, I'm right there with you.  King B will go to the stable and I'll have a Pridewatcher to complement my Polar Bear.  Or, maybe I'll go back to my bengal tiger, I love the orange with black strips, looks way cool.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Some of the wierd things they come up with in a fantasy game. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Krup:<br />
<br />
What was the Windfury bug?  I use it, but my shaman is only 34 so haven't had it a long time.  I did notice that the Windfury weapon buff tooltip mentions 2 extra attacks while the Windfury totem tooltip mentions 1 extra attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That is intended Snap, else why would you bother with the personal weapon buff. What they are saying is that it was generating an extra attack beyond what was stated, like the Thrash Blade, Flurry Axe, and Ironfoe before they were changed. And it said a normal attack was occurring too soon. What I think this means is that the windfury attacks were not figured into delay calc with normal attacks so you could do normal attack, WF sttacks, and normal attacks all with no delay rather than delay last normal attacks from the last WF attack. I think that's what they mean but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wow, the epic mount quests for warlocks and paladins are really stupid.

LOL! I admit that a no talent shaman spamming FS can beat a no talent (insert class here), but anyone with with an ounce of skill can easily beat the FS spamming shaman.  The thing with PvP is if you're predicatable, you should die more than you live and it's pretty easy to predict what an FS spammer is going to do.  There are all sorts of counters.  Mages can blink, rogues can vanish, hunters can snare, any engineer can net, warriors can charge and then hamstring, priests ... well you get the picture.  Any moron that just runs after/from the shaman with their snared asses in a sling might as well just try to position their corpses closer to the GY for faster retrieval.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">They just gave it dimishing returns which doesn't mean much. How many times do you shock one opponent anyway?</div></div><hr />

Usually 2-3 times depending on class and opponent actions.  I use earthshock more frequently.  Last 1-2 shocks if an opponent runs away, first shock If I need a second to back off and heal on melee opponents.  Still, I won't mind so much if the diminishing return is on damage and not the snare effect.  If it's on the snare effect, that's different and I'll wait and see how much it diminishes before going ballistic.  I keep 2 frostshocks and 2 earthshocks up on my flexbar, I keep my rank one and best ranked versions of both shocks.  If the damage diminishes I'll use my rank 1 shock for runners.  If the snare diminishes than the reverb talent becomes more critical (I have 4 ranks of it) and depending of the rate it diminishes they might hose the spell.<br />

The other night I had to spam FS on a retreating 51 pally who decided to group with 2 rogues and form a gank squad.  The pally decided he'd had enough and he was getting away, I used a swiftness pot and started spamming FS to prevent his escape (him and his friends were CCing all the lower level horde at that camp, including yours truly, so I wanted him dead).  It took 3-4 frostshocks to keep him snared while my faction mates beat him down.  We camped him (like he and his rogue friends camped us) for a couple kills, he didn't come back ... lesson learned, due in part to FS.  I'd hate if he'd made it to guards, or went far enough from the camp that the other guys smoking him might have given up chasing him.</div></div><hr />

I've tried :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">rogues beefed? How you figure, hunters, and humans will see us easier now, bah. Seems alot of pro- alliance stuff lately, off considering how much more people play them.<br />
<br />
I think all races also should have decent racial perks, trolls and orcs are completely useless, war stomp ain't that good either, wotf is great, shadowmeld is great, increased perception is gonna hurt the horde as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">We won't lose combo points switching targets. Thats pretty huge. They are also fixing backstab and ambush so they correctly use your power attribute.</div></div><hr />

They will only be removed if a different target is selected.So you will lose those points if you change or &quot;switch&quot; targets.<br />
<br />
Why would you deselect to begin with, if not to select another? Kinda wierd if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

If a rogue is fighting a shaman for instance, he might switch targets to a searing totem which hoses his vanish or a snare totem to smack it quick while he is chasing down the shaman.  Currently, when he switches targets to smack the totem, he loses his combo points.  Same deal when he gets frozen by a mage (or alternatively rooted by a druid) and the rogue wants to swap targets to someone still in melee while he waits for the freeze to wear off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You'll lose target if they run out of range, or if you get feared or something IIRC. Thus, you only lose the points if you manually switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Right, my point was this is kind of a pointless &quot;fix&quot;, but now I see where it might be useful in the root/fear scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Val,<br />
<br />
This is also important for Hunters fighting Rogues, since the way it works now, when a Hunter FD's the Rogue loses his points.  That will no longer be the case.  You win some, improved stealth detection, and you lose some.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think I'll be playing my Hunter for another couple of days to get him to 60 (dinged 59 last night) and then he'll be retired and only used for farming.  The impending change to ranged damage, being based on the mobs damage rating and not level, is going to nerf our dps even more in the late game.  Ya, we will continue to tear up the casters, but we will be missing like crazy against the tougher elite bosses and tanks.  Mark my words.  Another &quot;fix&quot; that is going to hose us.<br />
<br />
I just don't see a need for hunters, and please don't mention MC again, in most post 50 instances.  I'd rather have a mage.<br />
<br />
So, my new main will be the mage alt I've been playing from time to time.  Currently, not as much fun as the hunter, and certainly not as good solo, but should be a lot more fun post 50, getting invites to all of the high level instances, where you need the AoE dps of a mage.   Look for Maggus, human mage, on Hellscream server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">and please don't mention MC again, in most post 50 instances.  I'd rather have a mage.Have I ever? :)<br />
<br />
Sad to see another Hunter bite the dust, but as I've always maintained...play what brings ya the most fun. For me, and for now that's still my Hunter. Though once the wife gets 60 (which should be pretty soon) we've already discussed starting a duo similar to what we had in CoH (I had a Fire/Fire Blaster, she had a Mind/Empathy Controller)...I'll start a Mage and she'll start a Priest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Have I ever? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry Val, I worded my post poorly, did not mean to infer that you had mentioned MC.  It's just that this is the one example always suggested as a reason to take a hunter on a high end instance run.  Sure, in MC rogues are useless and Hunters are Gods, however, this is only one zone, very far down the road for me.  <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just venting?  I'll wait and see what actually happens with the next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">But a rogue switching targets to kill a shaman totem will still lose his combo points because he is manually selecting another target, correct?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  If you select a new target you lose the points.</div></div><hr />

Tonight I was able to build combo points in cat form, pop out and heal, then come back into catform without losing the combo points.</div></div><hr />
