<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm 52 atm, and I can solo at the exit in the PoJ. Self buffed with 2000 hit points I do good with any of the prisoners in the cells or rats. Just pull with slow to the exit, root and rot while me and the dog beats away on em. A few are casters so have resist magic up and you should be good. If not just zone. Also doing that will get you 1% per kill solo or 1% every 3 or 4 kills in a full group. PoD is also a good zone if you stick to the left wall as you zone in. You'll need a group there though cause most mobs hit for around 200+ and fast. Hope this helps. Have fun.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 51 any of the easier tier zones you can slow pretty effectively.. that is you can in a group slow pon/poj/poi.. some things will be really hard like the scraps? by the factory entrance, spiders will be hard.. in pon undead will be bard, hobgolins, mephids will probably kill you.. forget guardians :).. in poj don't remember.. and in pod probably flies and larva you can slow, spiders, rats too, but not diseased malarians... no CY or castle or caves though, you'll die very fast/easily..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tolby Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Malarians can be slowed IF a chanter tash's first, and you malo line them but that was the only way I could do it at lvl 48-52 at 54 though, I debuff myself and slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoJ zone out area on torv usually has the lowest level people in Pop there. I was slowing there at 51 with no problems, and didn't have to debuff first either. The xp was pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hippiefrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I slowed quite well in PoD the other day. I was in a LCY group and had maybe 3 resists in an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 51 I could land slow in the castle as long as I hit them with Malosi first. You might get a resist but its always landed for me by the 3rd time, but usually on the second. PoJ almost never resisted, PoN trees get a resist once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Slowed in pod courtyard the other day at 51.  Only an occasional resist with malosi first.  Worst were the lightcrawler pests.  Most of my bounces occured against these mobs (level 57).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just mem both, and what I do is throw malosi at them on incoming, whether it lands or not, slow next. If malosi lands, I never had a slow resist, if it's resisted, I still land slow about 75% of the time. Because of recast time, if slow is resisted as well, then I try malosi again. The second malosi gets resisted once in a while, but I cant remember the second slow ever getting resisted, regardless of whether the 2nd malosi lands or not. I know at 55, I probably don't need to worry about malosi, as I'd guess the chances of either landing independently is about the same, but if you slow on incoming, and you dont have a SK or pally, they're coming right at you (and even with them in group sometimes they still will). If I lead with malosi and wait a few seconds, I rarely get aggro, and if I do no big deal, we can take a few hits :). Also, I usually have cripple memmed too, rarely use it, maybe if we get an add or 2 and our tanks are getting reamed, but I use it mainly to get agro, for the times when the eager wizzy decides to nuke for like 1500 right away (fortunately this don't happen much...but mobs do like to chew on the clerics if they have to CH early in the fight).<br />

I have only been to tier 2 like a handful of times, most of my time in the planes so far has been spent in PoN, last 4-5 levels or so, plus stopping at 55 to get run3 and regen3, so my advice reflects what has worked there for me. Could be different in tier2, but hey, a lot of the fun in EQ is going to new spots, getting adjusted to it, even dieing a bunch of times finding the right way to work it. Since I been back to leveling, I now go to PoD, better xp, but harder mobs, they're generally a few levels higher than PoN, so slowing is a little harder, get some more resists, only thing I changed is I'm less likely to try a slow unless I do land the malosi, but it's a judgment call really, there's going to be a lot of times your group is getting beat on, and it's critical to at least try to get the slow to stick. Same with adds, if you don't have an enchanter or bard for mezz, I try to slow them all ASAP (root too, but you know how root always breaks at the worst time, you'll need them slowed in case - plus, at least in PoN and PoD, I notice root has an average lasting time of probably 5 seconds) so I don't usually bother with anything but slow (If I only get one mob on me, Ill try to channel off a stoicism, if I get more than one on me, there's no bother really...I'd doubt I'd even get the spell off with 2 unslowed PoP mobs on me, and it's not like 180 a tick will help against 2 hitting for 300+.....I'm praying the cleric is on her toes, or that I can channel the damn slow and/or root :) ). I don't go to PoI, xp is crappy for the difficulty of the mobs IMO and the few times I been there wound up in really pitiful groups.<br />

EDIT: hehe, I just noticed I used the gender &quot;her&quot; for a cleric.....but seriously, doesn't it seem that &quot;real life&quot; stereotypical gender roles play out a little in EQ in the same way? As in, warriors are predominantly male, and clerics female....nah I guess not, probably that I'm just an old-fashioned chauvinist pig :)</div></div><hr />
