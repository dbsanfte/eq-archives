<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't imagine that I suck so bad that I can't pull this off.<br />
<br />
How in the heck do you break the stables in CoM?  I am a 51 level Barb Shaman who is JBB-ly challenged.  I have below average gear, but I am still over 800AC.  <br />
<br />
I have tried 8 or so times to break this area to get the 'student log' and I can't ever get past taking out 1 or 2 mobs before I have more than I can handle and I gate to the entrance.  This can be a real pain in the neck if I have to kill the mobs at the gate again.<br />
<br />
I have tried with dog and without<br />
I have tried both sides of the stables<br />
<br />
I know that I can just hang out by the gate area picking off the light blues and rare dark blue and eventually grab the log from someone who has dropped the mob, but dangit I want to clear out the stables by myself for my own personal satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are two places where Courier can spawn, the real stables or in the area opposite to stables. The area opposite to stables has much lower level mobs so you can pull em either solo or 2. In every of the 4 rooms there, only 2 spawn points exist, no roamers. You should be able to handle 2 of those spawns, once slowed they are very easy.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't suggest trying the real stables, they are a PITA for your level. Hell at 60 when PLing toons there, even I pulled more than one. You don't have lot of space to move so you will get aggroed.<br />
<br />
In the area opposite to stables, pathing is very very very very bad, never fight inside. Always pull to alley. If you fight inside and you move one inch, mob will path all around the area, aggroing 2-3 rooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have to say I think you may be doing something wrong. I camped the stables at 51 for my courier drop with little hassle, and we all know how long it can take :) Where abouts are you parking your butt? I found the area between the two &quot;stables&quot; is best. Just park cuddles there and pull the rooms till the camp is broken. I occasionly got adds, but just rooted them and managed fine. Cuddles can take 2 mobs at a time easy if buffed with haste and HoS, heal as required. If the **** hits I just ran to zone with no problems.<br />
Good luck at it, I got mine after many hours there, but had fun on the way. Worth keeping an eye out for a group doing the Temple too, I ran in and grabbed the icon while there after a group had cleared it, nice :) Another thing to watch for of course is if a reaver raiding party comes through and they drop Ghiosk, grab those books. Just stay well towards the back to avoid getting any adds from anywhere but the stables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or you could just do what I did at 51 and root/rot the mobs without using a pet... I never got multiples. There's just enough room to run around and not get hit without aggroing through the buildings.<br />
<br />
Also - there are THREE spots where the courier spawns. There used to be a map on the old forums... =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a second, and I feel easier, spawn point for the spectral courier.  If you are facing into the stables, do a 180 and you'll be looking into a small courtyard with a door in the far left corner.  Inside are four spawns.  Move slowly and stay away from the right side of the courtyard or you'll get adds.  Once you get inside, the spawn deepest in from the door is the placeholder for the courier (marked with a red star if this map works).  This is where I got him solo at 51.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssabre Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep,<br />
<br />
Got mine from the exact spot marked on Barm's map. . .Took 3 couriers though  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
^%$# Iksar SK scrolls<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, I got mine last weekend from the spot on Barm's map too.  <br />
<br />
To get in, I slowly moved towards the door until I could open it.  This aggro'd the first mob in the room.  Once I killed him, I ran inside and aggro' the 2nd mob and killed him in the corner opposite the red spot on Barm's map.  I had trouble getting a line of sight on the 3rd mob because it was right behind the wall, but I was able to use cancel magic to pull the courier right past the third mob without aggroing it.  I'm pretty sure you can just move in close enough to aggro the 3rd mob without getting the 4th(red spot on map) mob also.<br />
<br />
A month or so ago, I spent a couple hours with a monk friend clearing both sides of the stables, then clearing the courtyard area while waiting for respawns, and never saw the courier.  Last weekend, I went in solo, the courier was up and dropped the log for me, and I was out of there in 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />
