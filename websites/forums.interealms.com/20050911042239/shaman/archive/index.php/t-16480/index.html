<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darngudlukenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">exp getting realy dry im lvl 57 but in about 30mins i will be 58 and i need to know where to go solo or even group but leaning more twards soloing. i have been away from game for awhile and gave my gear away but i still have most of my slots filled with nodrop kael and thurg armor and rest is very vey low lvl stuff but i am able to do pretty well with it. so i need to know where to go to get to lvl 60 the absolute fastest not worrying bout cash till 60 i am not guilded right now and dont have LDoN but all other expansions. i dont realy want to group right now cause with my crappy gear i feel i am a liability to the group heh but if it is fastest i will do it. any advice would be much appericiated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you insist on soloing (as I have in the past), then here's some of the fastest experience I personally have found...and believe me, I've looked long and hard...<br />
<br />
1. The Deep.  Go to the Deep and pull the first 5 or 6 mushrooms.  Spawn time is about 20 minutes.  I get 1% regular experience every 2 kills there, and that was as a Troll with a 20% exp penalty.  So, if you're anything but a troll or iksar, you'll get even better exp. Mobs hit for ~130 max and occasionally (but not always) run on low health.  Keep em rooted.  As far as tactics are concerned, I pull with slow, root them, put the pet on them, and use Epic, Bane, and then JBB them to death.  Even if you have no Epic or JBB, I'm sure you can still do this - just will take a bit more mana.  Just get a KEI before you go.  The spot is safe (right at the zone line), always quiet - as people rarely come here, and is good exp.  Loot is non-existent unless you get a lucky named.  (I saw one named in about a week).<br />
<br />
2. Plane of Justice.  Go to the 2nd cell block and turn left.  Go to the end room and you'll see 2 NPCs - a dark elf (Captain something) and a wood elf.  Sit on the bed in the corner opposite of the wood elf and pull them - they will come single.  Use the same tactic as described above.  Make SURE that you root these, as they will run.  Once you kill those two, go across the hall and pull the 3 Wraiths (I think that's what they are called - anyway, you'll see what i mean).  There are also 2 gnome casters in the room with the Wraiths but I left those alone.  The wraiths do not run.  Make sure before you pull that the hallway is clear of rats or Sentries - it usually is.  After the wraiths, you may try to pull a rat or sentry from the hallway.  Again, pull them into the room where you parked the dog and make sure you root them.  Might want to pull rats with Annul magic to get rid of their SoW.  Experience is 1% every 2 to 3 kills.  Loot is a bit better, with an occasional Diamond or Blue Diamond.  <br />
<br />
Ive looked far and wide for good experience and this is so far the best I've found solo.  The best experience overall of course is going to be grouped in Tier 2 (or even Tier 1) planes.  It's less downtime and less work, but I do understand the desire to solo.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I loved to solo with my shaman, that being said with the new group experience bonuses and PoP ZEMS combined, grouping is the fastest exp to be had 90% of the time.  Dont worry about your gear being subpar, you wouldnt beleive how man lvl 60 + powergamers there are who dont even know what Thurg armor is and just have random Bazaar crap.  A good shaman regardless of gear is ALWAYS an asset to a group.  Te get back to your question, I would suggest gettin a group in either PoN or PoD and grinding out those lvl.  You can even try  PoV, I went there at 56 before they opened the zones and never had any problems slowing things.  Exp there is nutty.</div></div><hr />
