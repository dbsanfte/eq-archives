<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Groans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Want to get from 39-49 as fast as possible. Soloing is good. Most of the time will have KEI, not twinked TO much. Loot is not a concern. Just want to get my butt outta 39 and into mid to high fourties, even low fifties if possible, before I worry about loot. I want to be able to help my guild, because they have been very good to me. Thanks ahead of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Read the threads below. But starting out, your fastest bet would be soloing in OT, Dawnshroud or Tenebrous. Don't bother soloing in Dreadlands, it takes too long to track down continous kills. The spurbone and theif skelies in DL are nice, but are almost always camped. In the three places I mentioned you will get a constant flow of things to kill.<br />
<br />
When you get to 43, you tell me where to go. Other than grouping it's tough going once you get tired of Tenebrous and CoM is a bitch to break the spawns. But you could do Tenebrous till the late 40's (and beyond in a Coterie group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just looked at your equipment. I highly recommend you get better AC and a really good weapon if you plan on PLing up through the levels. With KEI on, you don't need uber HP at our level but you do need as good an AC as you can get for &quot;in the face&quot; action. If you can get it, pick up a Granite Face Grinder for around 800-1000pp or a Hammer of Rage for 300-500pp. Don't worry about maxing out your wisdom until much later (and arguably never). At 43, my AC is about 810 buffed. That's with the same spells as you and only one level advantage in Defense (maxes out at 40).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">44-49 fastest way with KEI i found was plagubone thief camp in DL, its in the lost valley near the wizard spires, theres one building filled with plaguebone thief skeletons u can cast and get a single every tiem they are non social like that.<br />
<br />
My set up :<br />
Pull with slow<br />
Sick pet as they are exiting from the building<br />
Venom of the snake<br />
Evenomed breath<br />
melee and tank for pet<br />
at 20% the skeletons run(not like normal undead)<br />
sit down and med/regen while ure pet chases by the time he's dead ure FM and good to go.<br />
<br />
i use 2 poisons cuz if u kill fast enough u can kill every spawn in the building before repop and its fricking good exp!!!<br />
<br />
great solo'ing spot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go to Velious young shaman!<br />
<br />
Group in Crystal Caverns til 44 then solo there until 47.<br />
<br />
Kill Frost Giant Scouts and Berserkers in GD solo or Frost Giant Elites in group til 50+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just dinged 44 this evening.  Go to Echo cavers and kill hte bugs and fiends, rockhoppers were no too bad just a bit tough to get any magic to stick.  very good solo and duo exp here, fast kills, and fast spawns.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

This is excellent advise, it'll prevent you from having to do long factioning stuff later on in the game. Coldain faction opens up a crapload of good stuff and makes certain highend zones more tollerable.<br />
<br />
before you start, you might want to attemp the coldain military bracer quest first, then fix that faction with you xp grouping against the giants.</div></div><hr />
