<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 44 shaman spell. 180 mana for 160 hitpoints per tick for 4 ticks. Same decrease in attack rate and running speed as torpor.<br />
Same cast time as torpor.<br />

<br />
Edit: doh, read  the spell data too fast,  it's not vendor sold like I thought it was. But this does bring up a new question. If it's not vendor sold, how are we going to get it? Maybe a quest like cann 2 or a drop from kunark / velious?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OMG YES! I ALWAYS wanted a mini-torpor that I could use to learn some tactics with! Wheeee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So 640 hp for 180 mana? 3.56 ratio?<br />
<br />
Compare it to Greater Healing (the only other heal spell you have at the time)... 300 hp for 150 mana for 3.75 seconds or a 2.0 ratio.<br />
<br />
Considering that this is almost twice the heal for only 30 mana more, I wouldn't be surprised if 44 shamans use this as their only group heal. Sure you loose attack speed for 4 seconds, but it beats casting Greater Heal twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">4 ticks, not 4 seconds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From lucy...<br />
<br />
Vendor Sold: No</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WOW!  I'm so looking forward to this.   Currently when I'm LOM I'm constantly canna-ing down as low as I comfortably can and casting the 2k mini-CH to get the most efficiency I can.  This will make me so much more comfortable in PoP when I need to regenerate mana back as fast as I can.<br />
<br />
Died twice over the weekend because I was at GY after getting rezed and drew low hp agro from some yahoo who trained the place without calling train :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey let's make this dro off gorenaire ONLY and make it a rare drop and hell gore is spawning all the tiem let's reduce his spawn rate to once every 2 month.<br />
<br />
What? You shamans are not happy after all we gave you?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ugh<br />
<br />
half a level from 60<br />
<br />
after all this time they finally add a spell I've asked for forever.<br />
<br />
I'm lucky like this,<br />
<br />
when they removed pre 50 hell lvls I was 4/5 through 49<br />
<br />
when they removed post 50 hell lvls I was 3/4 through 54<br />
<br />
Now I'm almost 60 and they finally put in a mini torpor.<br />
<br />
Damn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The spell they have targeted for pallies is a better heal for groups. Light of Life, 410 pt direct heal, 1.5 sec cast time, 7 sec recast, 200 mana.  Arguably makes paladins better healers than druids or shaman from 44 to 51, excluding dubious benefits of mini-torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The vendor sold tag was added the same time they allowed spells to be deleted from your spell book.  That is the only thing that field means.  It doesn't mean that its not goign to be sold at a vendor.  Its just tagged non-deletable.  (Wish Lucy would change the field name).<br />
<br />
On a similar subject, I dont see why they dont just open up Kunark dropped spells to be all vendor bought.  Its 2 expansions old after all.  Kunark isn't a money maker anymore.  They should just give us the spells so they're available.  I wouldn't even care if they sold at a merchant for 20k each and continued to drop.  Just silly...  oh well...</div></div><hr />

Virtually identical thread only a few posts down!<br />
It was started first, has more replies, and is still relatively high on the front page.  Let's please redirect more discussion to the original thread here:  http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=9184<br />

Thank you, :cool:</div></div><hr />
