<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Paid 1500 hard earned PP for this spell.  Found it did NOT hold as well as Paralizing Earth - this was with extensive root casting (keep mob rooted all the time) while I rotted and druid dded.  I thought I read on these forums it was a nice upgrade???  Cost half again as much mana also 150 vs 100.  Forgot to check casting time - but didn't notice that one way or the other.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">....and I was NOT in PoP when I compared the 2.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You mean &quot;root&quot;, not &quot;slow&quot; (or at leat I hope you do).<br />
<br />
The greater immobilize spell holds pretty well on PoP mobs, but like all the roots its pretty iffy.  The advantage of this one is that it wont get outright resisted when you cast it. I've noticed alot of PoP mobs resist regular root 2, 3, or even 4 times in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Petrifying Earth at 64 is aaamazing. With malo and its own -30 resist most mobs go full or near full duration. If you stick to Breath of Ultor (ya im a lucky sob) and epic, Pox you should go almost full duration each time with parked mobs and/or soloing root rots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes yes I meant root - the troll shows through AGAIN!!  Me make with the edit button.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Greater Immobilize the 62nd level root, only has a 1 minute maximum duration.<br />
<br />
Paraylzing Earth, the 56th level root has a 3 minute maximum duration.<br />
<br />
Petrifying Earth, the 64th level root has a 3 minute maximum duration also.<br />
<br />
That is the difference you are seeing.<br />
<br />
The difference between the &lt;60 roots and the &gt;60 roots is that the high level ones have a negative 30 resist modifier which helps alot against higher level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Does the -30 MR penalty apply for the break-early resist checks (obviously it applies to the initial check)?<br />
<br />
That is, given that the root lands, are the -30 MR roots going to last longer?<br />
<br />
I know that a malo/sini is supposed to help with the break-resist checks, of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya my hunch is that it is accounted in the every tick break check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK, another question:<br />
<br />
do the per-tick (or whatever interval) break checks happen more frequently for the shorter duration root?<br />
<br />
that is, does the 3 minute root have a smaller chance of breaking in the first minute than the 1 minute root?<br />
<br />
my guess would be no, but perhaps the resist checks happen 1/3 as often with the 3 minute root?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Greater immobilise is worth every bit of its mana cost over regular roots in PoP, regular ones will bounce lots, Greater immobilise usually goes the full minutes duration without fail and on a debuffed mob its almost annoyingly reliable =)<br />
<br />
Not got petrifying earth yet though.<br />
<br />
Tbh I'm not really sure what the difference is between the 2 if any, other than the cast time, mana cost and duration.</div></div><hr />
