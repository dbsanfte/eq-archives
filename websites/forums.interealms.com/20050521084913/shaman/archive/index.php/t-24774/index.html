<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read a post were someone suggested that they give shm's a buff that will mitigate melee damage to fix the problem we have with slow mitigation and not being as needed in groups as we have been in the past. I thought no way SoE would go for that, am I wrong? Also if they wouldn't go for that what about making it self only, so that even though our dps sucks we can solo some tough mobs in PoP/GoD/OoW? Just like to see what everyone thinks. Also what about a mana buff. For example buff that gives you 400 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember saying something like that in crucible chat I think, but sony would never go for it. It's fun to think they will make us more useful, but it's just wishful thinking that will never come true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>StormCrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5399&amp;source=Live</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is avoidance, not mitigation. Mitigating NPC damage would make them hit you for less each time they connected a hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>StormCrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not exactly what the same, but your missing the point, I should have  put an explination with that.<br />
<br />
The reason for that link is actually two-fold.<br />
One. It is something that was previously thought that SoE would never go for. Proving that while they may disagree now, things can always change.<br />
Two. Even though things can change, with this buff it just gives them another reason to say 'no, combined with your avoidance buff that would be over-powering'.<br />
<br />
So while it is a good idea, I would expect them to absolutely refuse it now then implement it in the future, maybe after a few more expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A mitigation buff is essentially the same as unresistable slow.  No way SOE would go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mitigation buff already exists<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4091&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
plus other versions of it.<br />
<br />
I can't see SoE farming this out but it would be nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If they were going to do this, they would basically need to replace are slow spells to do it. But they could make it non click offable and have it block Complete heal, thus fixing the problem of max slow + CH = trivial. Also if they have the spells do a fixed amount of damage ignored per hit, they can control the power better and maybe even code it such that the level has an effect on the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;No way SOE would go for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
By that I meant, of course, no way SOE would give it to shamans, we are all ready so uber....;)</div></div><hr />
