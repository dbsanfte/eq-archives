<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just want to know if my main will be able to buy the new LDON spells for my alt using the point system.  Anyone know if the spells are no drop, or can they be bought/transfered?  I fear they are no drop due to the point system, but would like to hear from someone who has acquired one.<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Of course there no drop .. why would anyone buy the expansion!  I think Breeze was the last spell that you could get without having the expansion =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yep they are no drop and after i had been saveing money to buy me some spells =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thx guys, I assume you have first hand knowledge that they are no drop.  Although I would assume as much, I hate to make assumptions.  Also, I personally would have bought the expansion for the FUN of playing in new, private zones and the other benefits.  The new spells are simply a bonus to me.  But anyway, thanks again for the info.</div></div><hr />
