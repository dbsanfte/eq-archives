<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice work, but seriously you should try to be a bit more minimalisitic on your own sig here... it takes up half my screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Akyashaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry bout that, I copied it from another message board and didn't realise how massive it was, I changed it, hope this is better now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's still too large according to forum rules, but never mind that now.<br />
<br />
I browsed through them backgrounds and i like your work. Be careful when borrowing artwork though, even thouhg i think its not a problem. I liked the one with the bow where she is aiming through the screen.<br />
<br />
If youre looking for inspirtation, visit www.eqdreams.com, it belongs to an old friend of mine, she made my sig artwork when my char was lvl 14 (i taught her phoroshop), i have kept it since. She has moved away now but i still keep in touch and check in on her artwork now and then...</div></div><hr />
