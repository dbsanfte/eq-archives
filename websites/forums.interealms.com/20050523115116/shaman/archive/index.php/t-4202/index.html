<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Breathable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just bought one and was a little disappointed, i turned off all models and didnt get the mana or health regen (sitting values) while standing=(<br />
turned on models and while i did get mana regen while on horse/casting , i only got 36 regen (usaully get 42 when sitting w/o horse) anyone got any ideas? or am i going to have to live with the 6 less regen?=x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You dont get the sitting regen, but you definately get the sitting mana whilst using a JBB.  There is a bug with the mana display tho so you have to cast something to get an update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can tell ya now that you do get the mana regen even with the new models off (at least if you are a troll). I group almost daily in Cazic Thule zone, and the difference between when I have my horse summoned and I don't have him summoned it very noticeable for mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Breathable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">K think i am getting mana regen with models off, its just not updating until im done casting a spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's correct- the mana bar won't update until it's triggered by a spell.  A Cann, right-click SoW boots, etc. will trigger it.  <br />

Used the horse last night in Hate- was a blast (was 10 times happier when I won a BD then when I was told to loot the craptastic shaman gloves that dropped from a golem- I guess those are 2nd string CR gear, after jarsath.)  :)</div></div><hr />
