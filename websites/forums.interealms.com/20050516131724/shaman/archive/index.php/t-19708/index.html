<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i did some exploring in the first two zones...<br />
from 3 pm till now.<br />
mobs green to 65, moderate resists, resisted slow and dots half the timesi  casted them, they hit 190-220 was what i saw.<br />
lightblue mobs, some have bards speed, summon, hit 250-370's.<br />
darkblues ... are just nasty.<br />
i didn't have any flags to get into the locked zones, but i wen't to the nili somehting zone with the archer mobs.<br />
they hit harder than pop mobs and summon like boss mobs and have HUGE aggro radius's like most other mobs in the zone.<br />
im talking pacify a room to pull one , you are gunna get 3-4.<br />
...<br />
the crag turtle queen is a raid mob in the nitimbi zone, hits 4k ... red to 65 ... HUGE aggro radius.<br />
<br />
all most all mobs are social and will assist each other, some snare you and are bard speeded.<br />
a group from an elemental guild wiped on a pull of 3 lightblues, disheartening. so far i've seen nothing for the casual gamer.<br />
<br />
o' one funny thing though. all the mobs and NPC's look like they were ripped from SWG. the turtles look like soem creature from SWG called a &quot;torton&quot;, and the mobs look like something you see in starwars at the &quot;canteena&quot;<br />
i saw one npc that looked like a jawa ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, crappy aa's, crappy spells and zones that chew up and spit out ubers, all for only $30 a month. no way i'm wasting any money on this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i wanted to be proven wrong, that this expansion would make me eat my words, in harsh reality, it made me regret them.<br />
druids or enchanters with dire charm, can solo almost anything in these zones. i can't even solo a green mob, they have more HP's than most tier 1 mobs.<br />
so, after i get my rez tomorrow, im gunna continue grinding in PoP, or Ldon, and when i hit 200+ aa's i MIGHT be able to solo a lightblue mob.<br />
until im able too, im not gunna set foot back in those zones. no light blue mobs should be able to wipe a group of 65's, let alone 1 lvl 65 character.<br />
for those of you hoping the ancient spell wasn't just for ubers, your **** out of luck.<br />
i heard it drops ONLY from the last 2 god raid zones in /ooc from one of the people in cats in hats(drinal time guild).<br />
and the other crap spells, are not so easily gotten either ...<br />
i'll go back to farming Droga, im gunna need all my mudflated plat to even be able to see my new spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been telling a guildie how much this expansion is going to suck even worse then loy and we won't be getting our only good spell, but he wouldn't listen. Of course he also thinks eq2 is going to kick ass (hahahahahaha). <br />
<br />
Can't wait to see him back in ldon or pop in a day or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">funnily a lot of shaman predicted this. but some will still try and say where fine and GoD is great:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So far i dont see anything exciting. I soloed around for a while which wasnt too hard. I notice the mobs hit hard and have a light DoT proc called cursed claws. Now while the mibs do hit hard, they have very low HP, which is nice. I dont mind a ough fight, but its boring if it takes 20 min to fight 1 mob.<br />
<br />
The loot so far from the 2 first zones seems appropriate for the level its restricted too. I pulled a archer named near the zone in  and would have got him had the people i randomly accepted invite with, had been anywhere near me. He was rootable and slowable and didnt summon and dropped some 30-40 hp/mana deal and was dark blue. Though he hit very hard. I seemed to mitigate him alot or something cause most hits were for 200-400 but once in a while he hit me for 800. honestly i think i could have soloed him.<br />
<br />
Im already bored of running around so im done for tonite. Ill try more tomarrow. Id rather chill offline now ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Strange.  I walked into natimbi, invised and wandered..found a soul type duder who aggrod me...rooted him, slowed and dotted him silly.  Never did debuff him.  He was LB, I q'd myself, hasted and starrted meleeing it.  he got me to about 75% of 4k hp (self buffed) at the end cause i never keep Q up.  HE was cake.  Im not time or elemental flagged..but the light blues seem easy enough.<br />
<br />
However, the Ukun dog things are mean as all hell.  540-600+ procs, snares, dots, not rootable.. ugh.  Just..yeah.  A Ukun fleshhound in Ferubi took me out in 3 seconds flat.  hitting for 200-980 (i had about 1100 ac), plus 3 procs for 640 each.  I get horrible graphical lag with a geforce3 ti-500 and clip to 0.  oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I had a few hours wandering around with some guildies. I'm terrible with zone names, so I ran round first zone from nedria landing with a few rangers killing stuff, then we met with some friends and ran into a temple thing (zone had a globe thing in it). <br />
<br />
That was fairly easy so we moved into feberia? mobs hit for near 1k but fully slow and have gimp resist after tash or malos, 50/50 on just turgurs. pretty low hp too, 15-20k I guess at, similar to hard Ldon I suppose. Went through a lot of sewers here and were just beginning to moan aboutthe boring design when it opened out into hallways (cool giant beserker mob things with massive axes). Cleared a few blue/white (to 65) mobs and poked around a bit. A yellow named popped on one of our rangers, 1300ish melee (wierd sort of half spiky spider sphinx thing mob), dropped a 25hp/mana/endurance type7 all:all aug, pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Anyway, only had a few hours, but enjoyed it...bit of a blur, long day at work heh ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sounds like every group out there is gonna need a shaman to survive.  Bummer  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You mean we can expect to see select classes charm soloing named and cleaning up on drops while the rest struggle to do the same with a full group.

Alot of you are complaining about the newbie zone... go a little deeper in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Travelled through a few zones with a group, and the biggest issue I have with them is the huge reliance on invis, just to get around, since everything attacks you.  It makes it harsh for those who can't cast it themselves (would have to carry many potions or tinkered).  The population of mobs is so dense, there are very very few safe places to reinvis yourself.<br />
<br />
Xp is so-so.  Rather do LDoN.<br />
<br />
Models are good though.  I think it was in Riwwi zone, there is an arena section that looks scripted for something for a raid.  My group was able to stand up to some kos even-conned named, that wouldn't respond to hails, but would say something every few minutes for the zone.<br />
<br />
The ship city is neat.  Another place for tradeskill junkies to do their stuff.</div></div><hr />

Well, started with an F anyway.  Got two on the first pull, was getting hit for up to 1031 a pop.  By the time I found the defensive key, my warrior was dead.  Nasty, nasty place. ;)<br />
<br />
Had better luck in the next zone we found, like Rikki-something.  Mobs were hitting in the 500's.  Exp seemed pretty bad though - I think I got about 30% of an aa in a couple of hours there, but we weren't exactly chain pulling, since there were tons of mobs wandering and we didn't want a train.</div></div><hr />

Zoned into Nimbi and kept getting trained , think peeps would know how to die on bad pull or just learn not to be so stupid.. Well we mover to NW corner pulled a few mobs only 65 pally tanking the whole time rest was mix of clerics casters me on shammy.. Well we find the entrance to next zone sebia or something can't remember.. Same DB mobs easy kill even with 3 adds.. Well we move forward and head down steps and pull 2 cool looking minotar axe weilding dudes easy enough.. Well lo and behold Named wanders to us.. 4 hits pally down.. am in middle of casting malos ??? hits you for 2040, 2800, 2515 loading pls wait.. Now our guild isn't ubah but we working to EP access.. I got about 5800hp buffed so needless to say he pasted me in short order about 2 seconds.. SHe then proceeded to wipe the rest of us.. IT is insane a named mob wandering 200yards from zone in that can beat on ya that mucha nd that fast .. I was seeing even time caplable guilds bodies all over this is insane..

well actually, i do have a helm from an elemental level LDoN raid.<br />
<br />
but the point is, GoD after the 1st day is a great expansion, imo. the expeditions are challenging but not so difficult that it takes the fun out of it.<br />
<br />
and you don't gotta click on anything to zone in and out. atleast with the first 4 or 5 zones i explored briefly. i'm sure there's atleast one zone the requires a mouse click to get into.<br />

seriously, i am enjoying GoD.   :)<br />

<br />
Thanks indeed. I'm glad they finally decided to bring some realistic difficulty to the game instead of pandering to all the whining panzies who want to get 4% AAXP on no risk mobs. I really hope GoD kicks the crap outta people so the only people who get to achieve anything in the expansion are those who are willing to try alternate tactics and not afraid to get their asses kicked.</div></div><hr />

GoD the word you say when you realized you wasted your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ginslunger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Spent about 4 hours in a couple of GoD zones last night, primarily Qinimi and Riwwi. We had BRD, SHD, CLR, BST, NEC, MNK. The BRD, SK and CLR are all elemental equipped, I am partly VT Equipped and the NEC and MNK had no elemental or VT gear. <br />
<br />
Here are some observations: <br />
<br />
The mobs are FAST. Many of them moved at Bard speed. <br />
<br />
The bard made it look easy, but I'm sure it would be difficult to get singles without a good puller. A good puller or good crowd control is important <br />
<br />
You need a snarer, mobs run and run fast. If you don't have them snared or rooted, you going to get a lot of trains. <br />
<br />
Trash mobs occasionally rampaged, flurried and enraged <br />
<br />
Most were hitting in the 400 - 600 range max, but it was very inconsistent. I only had 5500 HP buffed and no defensive AAs and yet was able to tank when we got trained by 5 mobs and the SK went down. Wasn't easy and used a bunch of the cleric's mana, but we made it. <br />
<br />
Exp was on a par with Valor or Storms or less. In 4 hours of hard killing, I got about 1.2 AA with 100% to AA <br />
<br />
We got a couple of drops: A low end VT comparable 20AC Spell Haste 4 chest piece for casters/priest off a trash mob in Riwwi and a BoT towers comparable priest shoulders off a named in the arena in Riwwi. <br />
<br />
I thought it was comparable to BoT main floor mobs, but tougher to pull single and more problems with running. <br />
<br />
I didn't think the exp or rewards were great, but they weren't terrible either. I had a blast exploring new places and seeing new mobs. <br />
<br />
Just my opinion, but it was worth the purchase to me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Seems to me that from current reports, most mobs hit very hard, but have low-mod hp and average resist.  Makes me think that all groups will require a slower and multiple healers.  This actually gives me hope that shaman will shine as main slower, with new slow and Maloxx, and the fact that we can back up heal.  Makes more sense now to take a shammy, for the highest % slow and best chance of landing it, and the healing power.  Definitely puts us a rung above a BST or Chanter slowing.<br />
<br />
Definitely not an LDoN-style environment (lots of light hitting mobs that die in 30 sec).  New environment that seems to depend more on shammy abilities vs. less.  This is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents,<br />

Ahm... either new slow OR or best % slow. But I have to agree that a backup healer will be a nice addition to a group with these mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My girlfriend and I duo'd some mobs for abotu 45 mins or so last night before our guild called a raid. Shes a 65 mage, 70 or so aa, ft 13, I'm 65 shaman, 15 ft, 170 aa, and a  lil over 4k unbuffed. Only had our own buffs, and I tanked the cat men looking things near the zone in to the Hanging Gardens just fine. Resists seemed a bit high. Poison is my suckiest resist at 130 unbuffed, so when I get some more PR, I imagine this would be easier. Exp seemed to suck when I went back later in a full group for a little, but then again, I fall asleep at the tables.<br />
<br />
Seriously want some of the 25hp/mana type 7 augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Only a select few can see through invis, I was able to run around relatively safely as I was exploring the zones. I tried kiting a few and some even when ensnared move at Run Speed, a bit distracting and difficult to land my bigger nukes. Root was resisted a good bit but would hold. <br />
<br />
The little Wolf/Goat (white fur) guys move at run speed when ensnared. Spells didn’t seem to be to resist, I was able to resist most of spell casters stuff. Exp. (AA) is mediocre the PP drops aren’t to bad. The MOBs do seem to hit pretty hard. <br />

I like the Trade Skill system now, very cool!</div></div><hr />

WOW!!! ... impressive use of caps and exclamation marks. YOU MUST REALLY BE UBER!!!!<br />
<br />
Given how many people from Elemental+ Guilds we were rezzing in Ferubi last night, I'd say they weren't handling it all that well either. :D <br />
<br />
Personally, I had a blast once we got used to the fact that the zone trash was hitting for over 1000. It was mainly a non-raiding group of 65s. We didn't make it out of the sewers, just set up camp somewhere down there. Ended up with an 8 person mini-raid so can't judge the exp but betgween roamers (that see invis) and repops, it certainly wasn't boring. I'd hold off on the bitching a bit (shtty spells notwithstanding) until people at least get a chance to check out some of the zones deeper in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Come on people.  If there's one thing that should catch your attention in this thread it's that most mobs do not mitigate slow.  If I have to tell you what this means, you should go reroll as something else.  Maybe SoE does pay attention to our community!<br />
<br />
And of course there are going to be lots of trains and dying.  There's a learning curve.  It wasn't a big deal in the last three expansions because of... well.. many things.  Instanced dungeons (LDoN), flag requirements (PoP), safe zone lines (PoK stones), and for the most part, controlled access.<br />
<br />
The lack of that in GoD is refreshing, if you ask me.  It really does have the feel of Kunark.  We've just gotten spoiled over the years.<br />
<br />
And the fact that many of the mobs run faster than SoW is not the end of the world either.  It makes things more challenging, sure.  We'll need to practice being careful, and more prepared sure.  But there are upsides to it too.  Probably less trains, for starters.  How do you train a mob you can't outrun?<br />
<br />
You don't have to be uber to do well in the new zones.  You just have to be smart.</div></div><hr />

When Beta opened the first night, Quini was a waste land of corpses from all the trains and **** coming into the Natimbi zone line... I died 3 times not from hitting hide sneak but simply from laughing so hard I would forget to do so...:)<br />
<br />
There are two ways to get into the mountians.<br />
The first is to do the Quests from the gnome guy in the city. He tells you go go help 4 other people with what ever they are doing. <br />
The other way is to go to Barindi(hanging gardens) and do the quest for the High Preist there. He will give you a Ldon type event that will give you flags to go into the mountians(aka deeper in).<br />
There are 3 raid level guys in Furbi. I wish I had my maps but I lost it when I nuked the folder with out thinking about them...:(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I only explored the boat city in Abysmal Sea, Natimbi (including underwater), and a little part of Qinimi, but there were mobs that mitigated slow there, and even one named that was immune to slow and root.<br />
<br />
Had one group of guildies exploring with me; 65 shm (me), 62 druid, 65 necro, 64 wiz, 64 mage, 65 enc...yep, no tanks. We're not even close to elemental gear, by the way. We had no trouble killing anything we found in Natimbi - greens, light blues, and dark blues. Only the dark blues gave leadership experience. We swam around under the ocean killing stuff looking for the Cragbeast Queen - she spawned but was either killed or despawned very shortly after because she vanished from tracking. Probably a good thing for us, from the sounds of it.<br />
<br />
In Qinimi, the mobs were all dark blue and hit much harder but we could still handle them. My pet kept getting killed, and so did the necro's, but mage epic pet lived through most fights. We pulled some floating archer-type named that pathed near the entrance right in front of us that was immune to slow and root/snare - killed it too, but it killed all our pets and the wizard. I pulled it with slow (immune) and it blasted me a couple times for around 660 before coming to us. I think it ate my pet on the way to me, but that gave me time to Q myself and spirit call it. It dropped a piece of taelosian rock and some no drop key which I still have. I think I saw one of the archer mobs 'headshot' the necro's pet also (ranger AA to insta-kill with a bow, for those who dont know).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh yeah, loot. We found nothing special other than some no drop things that are probably for the spell quests. The enchanter however was soloing in Natimbi before we all met up there, and he found a neck piece on one of the very first mobs he killed. It was for tank classes only, and had like 13 AC, 5 str, sta, agi, dex, 50 hps/mana/endurance, 7 on all saves, and Aura of Courage. This was on a light blue in Natimbi.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bazlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Did some soloing last night in Natimbi.  Light blues weren't too tough, more hps than I am use to.  *But*, the dark blues were a pain.  Those suckers hit like a brick and are resistant as hell to slows, etc.  A couple of times I thought I was going to have to gate out with the thing rooted.  Had to heal my pet numerous times throughout the fights, and dot the mobs over and over.  Anyway, still had fun, and am looking forward to seeing what else this expansion has to offer.<br />
<br />
I do have to say that I love the spiked turtle mobs that look like Gammera (sp?) from the old monster movies, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hmm cant solo greens as a 65?<br />
<br />
I am soloing alot of mobs nihilia. They can be a pain with their DoTs but nothing too bad. Pull with malos and they are pretty much under control. I did run across one mob that you cant root or snare and that wasnt alot of fun, though he doesnt mitigate slow.<br />
<br />
 I will say the level of slow mitigation i found so far is irratating. Once you pass the &quot;newbie zone&quot; and start moving deepr, it seems like only mobs that dont mitigate slow with a &quot;mostly effective&quot; message are the ones you cant snare/root.<br />
<br />
Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Hyppon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I was soloing dark blues in that zone that starts with a B.. Barindu or whatever...<br />
Exp was alright for solo kills, and fast.. I rank it about the levels of PoTactics group exp.. the mobs had pretty pathetic HP in comparison to PoP mobs... about 2 BoS and 1 Ulthor took em down... they didn't hit very hard either... the orc looking guys (the ones with the long hair that puffed out from the back of their skulls like they were some sort of anime character) hit for up to 500s.. sometimes 800s, and dotted. None of them ran very fast. I'd say about sow speed, perhaps. The archers in the zones like Qinimi hit pretty fast... but they have a pathetic amount of HP in comparison to the other mobs around them. Those Doc dog guys had more HP than them, and they were mobs that are light blue.<br />
<br />
I read that if you take a regular group into Barindu, and do the 'Elite' type mobs, then you'll get some really nice loot and experience.<br />
Also found a key in Riwwi and another key in a zone near it.. not sure what they're for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here. Then again, it's easy to live up to our 65 class title when dealing the predictable buffoons ruin—er, running EQ now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Maybe you guys missed the discussion from the SoE Dev team about GoD.<br />
<br />
GoD was designed for levels 65-70.  The Development Team then retracted the 65-70 levels and basically didn't re-tune the zones.  I think that's why everyone thinks of GoD as &quot;Elemental/Time people only.&quot;  An average person at level 70 is probably going to be comparable to a Time/Elemental equipped level 65.<br />
<br />
I like GoD, but I agree with all the critisims about it being beyond difficult.  (I am technically elemental flag-wise but haven't gotten any gear to support it.)  The graphics are pretty cool, the lore isn't too bad (though I do agree I'd like to see more the world lore than the tales of 5 people) and it's something different.<br />
<br />
Let the flaming begin, as I know that most everyone hates this expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, post started 2/10/04, and this recent bump 6/22/04.<br />
<br />
Not even a welcome to last week, but welcome to 4 months ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Well, it finally happened.  My subscription was due and I opted to get the &quot;free&quot; expansion.  Went to Natambi and played around with some of the mobs.  They go down fast root rotting, but I let various ones hit me to guage difficulty of 2-boxing when second account is due.  Natambi mobs are like fighting Gaolers of Justice with about 2/3 the hitpoints.  Unfortunately, Gaolers are still D Blue to 65 and these mobs aren't :(<br />
<br />
Some did drop minor cash plus a couple quest items, but the Necklace is the only real value here for me.  Not a bad item for green mobs if you have a couple days to camp the area.<br />
