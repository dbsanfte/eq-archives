<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild is doing reavers tonight in CoM and they offered to help me kill Neh' Ashiir. I was wondering how tough she is? You never see her discussed on message boards like the other last few mobs. IE Kirn And Rak. Does she have any special attacks like HT or DT? Can she be slowed easy like Kirn? Is she about as tough as Kirn? I just dont wont to lose my Kirn ring if we fail since it took like 6 months to get all the way to his tower. I know most people wait until they have their tear to do Neh in the same raid as Rak, but I wanted to get it out of the way so I didnt have to run out to the EJ in the middle of the raid to trun in the diary. I also want to feel like Im making progress in the quest since Ive been trying for my Tear for about 9 months! My guild isnt exactley uber but I love the people in it and Im happy there. So I just been getting into as many fear raids I can and watch the tear get awarded to others, lol. Anyway, Im rambling...Neh info please if anyone knows. Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, if this is any indication, I just went into CoM last night with one group: lvl60 rogue, 60 monk, 60 cleric, 58 shadowknight, 56 druid and 52 shaman. Killed all the reavers and all the lords except Rak.  Neh was maybe a little harder than a reaver, but not much. We didnt slow anything or cast spells on any mob but the low level ones ( saved the mana for heals and buffs), just straight up melee and heals.  No close calls and I think the cleric never went below 50mana. If you can kill the reavers you should have no probelm. Even got two jade reavers for our efforts.</div></div><hr />
