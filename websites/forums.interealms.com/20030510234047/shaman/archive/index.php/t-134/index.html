<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been following the discusions on this pretty closely and read of people having to do some portions of the quest over and over again to raise enough faction so I'm curious.<br />
<br />
I have followed the epic quest pretty religiously step by step in the order you are supposed to do it but only once each step. Will I have enough faction to see this through to the end? I don't plan on skipping any steps in my progression.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably the best way to make sure that you have enough faction is too do one of the easier steps over again and if you get the message, your faction can not improve you are set.</div></div><hr />

Grab an extra set of books before the final handin and turn them in, just to make sure you're max ally.<br />
<br />
I believe he also will only tell you about the spear of fate (&quot;what spear of fate?&quot;) if you have appropriate faction.</div></div><hr />
