<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I organized an adventure yesterday with a know it all 65 Chanter, you know the type lol! Anyway he decides (based on lack of info i guess) that he is the slower in the group and starts slowing Mobs. After wasting much of my mana re-slowing mobs after Ive asked him to stop several times, I decided to get mey revenge. <br />
Everytime we would get ready to move in to a different part of the zone I would hit him with a Torpor and snare him as the rest of the group moves on ahead lol, we lost him twice before I said enough was enough but I must say that I laughed out in a evil bellow loudly at that chanter<br />
At split,  he exclaimed he thought that Chanters have a better slow until I assured him the differences in Dis and Magic based slows and and that the shaman has the best slow in the game.<br />
<br />
Ever want to get back at a groupy, we have the power to slow time itself lolD</div></div><hr />

<br />
While Shaman do have the highest percentage slow in the game, what assurance did you give him regarding the difference between disease and magic based slows?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I simply explained to him that not all of our slows are 75% and that some of his slow would out land mine, but ultimately the Shaman's Slow is more effect.<br />
<br />
The assurance you are refering to is that of which you already stated, Shaman have the best slow in the game.<br />
<br />
I simply shared and experience here was funny, dont get all serious with me lol just a game ........</div></div><hr />

I really hope you don't believe that Turgurs and Forlorn deeds, or Tepid Deeds have some kind of seperate resist check.  They are all MR and have no resist modifier, it's all just a matter of RNG.  <br />
As far as slowing undebuffed mobs, we will land ours faster, but when you add in debuffs and multiple mobs, an enchanter has us beat...that is to say, an enchanter who has similar hps and AA's.  Also, enchanters have SCS which gives them a 20% reduction in agro and Innoruuks Sarcasm adds an additional agro reduction to their tash line.  Their slow is a 5% difference, and while some may think that really matters outside of PoP and in LDON groups, it doesn't matter at all on mitigating mobs.<br />

Takes a Shaman 12 seconds to cast two slows, takes an Enchanter 14.25. <br />
This is when neither cast a debuff, now slap on malos/tash to both and you get: Shaman 25.5 seconds, Enchanter 21.5 seconds.<br />
   <br />
The only reason people pick shamans over enchanters is because shamans can heal (and are better dps if Charm is not used), and the misconception that shamans are always better at slowing. Most shamans concentrate on hps and mitigate damage better (on trash mobs), so yes, your average shaman will be able to be beat up more than your average enchanter, but as better gear comes along and tougher mobs encountered that gap becomes nil. And it doesn't matter what gear you have when you don't even get hit to begin with (LR).<br />
<br />
The best thing in LDON to do, if you are forced to group with an enchanter: have them pull with tash.</div></div><hr />
