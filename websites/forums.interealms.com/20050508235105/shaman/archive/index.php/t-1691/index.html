<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>graul_maul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, tired of doing the exp grind lately, so I would like to see if it is possible to fix my faction in neriak.  Let me give you a run down on it.  BTW, I am a troll follower of Innoruk<br />
<br />
I never knew that I had screwed up my faction that bad with neriak until one day, a long time ago, I was running to the bank there, and a guard kills me for no reason.  Imagine my surprise.  Well, I think that I messed it up doing the gatorsmash quest long ago.  Being that I didn't read any spoiler sites, and just did trial and error, I ended up doing this quest quite a few times till I got it right.  Heh, NOOBIE!!!!<br />
<br />
Anyway, that is my guess for it being the way it is.  Also, I think the quest for the reagent symbol of innoruk has cost me a few points in my faction too. <br />
<br />
Any advice on some stuff I could con in neriak relativly safe, that would tell me what factions are OK, and which ones are messed up.  Then perhaps a link or two, that might tell me how to fix them?  Searching the site here, but I guess I am not typing in the correct phrase, or it just doesnt exist.  <br />
<br />
Well, if anyone here has had to do this, and found a best way, I would love to hear of it.  I guess the first thing I need to do, is check all the different factions in neriak.  I know there is more then just one, but I don't know who or what I could con/check to see what my faction is for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you USED to be able to get good Neriak faction by doing the Red Wine quest over &amp; over, but as of last patch, you can't hand items to NPCs while invised. It didn't raise Indigo faction, but it sure made those merchants like you. <br />
<br />
Dread Guard Inner and Outer are different factions than Indigos, but there may be some that are both. You can kill the halflings in the west part of Nektulos to build up Dread Guard faction. You can kill WE rangers in LFay for positive Indigo faction. I was farming them to cook their meat and actually managed to get up to Threatening at one point. Then, a couple of epic raids in Kithicor later, Indigo's in the toilet again.<br />
<br />
IIRC there was only 1 guard on Indigo faction in Foreign Quarter, but he was a 5th level chump. The rest of the Indigos all stayed in their guild hall in Commons. If there's an Indigo wanderer in Commons now, that's bad news.<br />
<br />
Not like I can use the bank in Neriak anyway. Casters hate me.</div></div><hr />
