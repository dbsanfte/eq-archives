<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was helping some guildies get their Torn Robes in Dulak last night and noticed that I kept on getting agro. Now perhaps the problem is our tanks can't keep agro since they where both warriors. But I think there is more to it then that.<br />
<br />
The first problem was that if I sent dogdog in while siting, I'd get agro. What was worse was that landing slow (turgur's) would generate enougth agro to prevent me from siting to med, or in my case, do the can dance. In order to reduce my agro generation, I decided to use my lvl 29 slow (tagar's). <br />
<br />
I still got agro with my lvl 29 spell so I was wondering how much agro do slows generate. Is it based on % reduction in speed or is it based on the spell itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has always bothered me in EQ. Warriors, masters of melee, but nobody wants to attack them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've found that if you cast slow, or send pet in TOO soon, you'll grab agro from whoever is tanking.  I count to about 15, send pet in, cast Slow, count to about 5 or 10, then sit.  No agro.<br />
<br />
Especially if the tanks are warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirkamon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been hunting in Dulak for about a week, now.  I dual box with a Kitty Beastlord and my Kitty Shaman (both level 42).  The scouts and warehouse MOBs do not aggro when slowed after the the Beastlord melee.  I typically pull with the Bst and sick tiger and dogdog on the MOB.  Then I cast Slow and Listless Power.  <br />
<br />
The Armory Guards and Dockhands do aggro if I don't wait 10 or 15 seconds after melee begins.  Of course if there is more than one MOB, as soon as I cast I have an unwelcome visitor.  I have hunted the boats with a 56 Beastlord and I don't seem to have any trouble.  Could just be that the higher level PC generates hate faster because of the higher damage he can product.<br />
<br />
Just my observations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something is REALLY wierd with resists for sure in LoY. Agro is a bit iffy too.<br />
<br />
This is all on greenies btw in dulaks when i was cash farming.<br />
<br />
Every nowand then i'd get a greenie that would literally resists 3 malosinis and 3 slows. in a row. I'd alternate slow, malosini, slow, ect. Since they are green they would literally die (dog dog death!) before i could get them slowed. Logic would tell you to not slow those after the first, but I' kept trying jsut to see if it was luck  or the RNG.<br />
<br />
If its luck or the RNG I need to go to Vegas, cause man im streaky. Certain mobs plain out flat resisted me till they died. its not common but it is there. It doesnt seem to happen anywhere else (green wise) except LoY. Something is definately up. I dont know if its:<br />
<br />
A) My luck is different and totally streaky in LoY<br />
B) RNG works differently in LoY<br />
C) Mobs can spawn in LoY with super high resists.<br />
<br />
I've cash farmed Dulak for 5 sessions of 2 hours each. This has happened at least 5 times each session. I've kept track. It happened once 12 times. The norm is 7ish. <br />
<br />
To get back to the agro thing. Agro seems to work differently.. maybe. Its harder to pin down and these are greens so your milage may vary. Agro isnt nearly as big of a deal as resists though, and it may jsut be contributed to a successful dogdog taunt.. .its not a big deal though. But what happens is on certain types of mobs i can slow, and send dogdog in and they stick to dogdog. Others, Slow, send dogdog in and they stick to me for a while.<br />
<br />
But you say who cares, they are greens and you jsut melee them to death. Yes, but i like to pull one, stick it on dogdog, as dogdog is killing it, i pull another one, bring it back, melee it till dogdog finishes his, sticks on mine, rinse and repeat. It works out to near continuous pulling WHEN ya cna get the mob to stick. The mob does stick most of the time. If not i use root.<br />
<br />
The times it does not stick may well be cause either dogdog doesnt succeed in his taunt, or my soulstripper procs drawing uber agro. I simply dont know and cant say for sure. Like I said before its not nearly as big a deal as the reist thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a 50 Shaman and have been hunting in Dulak for a while and have seen some pretty wierd things.<br />
<br />
1) This happened 3 times now - pulled one of the DE scouts close to the zone using Togar's and aggro'ed everything for miles around - landed up with at least 4 mobs - sometimes 5. Usually can single pull easily.<br />
<br />
2) Ran to a boat - set up a pull spot with two other people, popped invis and aggro'ed the whole boat and dock. Luckily I managed to run fast enough and lived.<br />
<br />
I also seem to be able to get and maintain aggro by using just about any slow, DD or DOT spell - no matter what kind of tank is around and haven't found any satisfactory solution - just another opportunity to show how versitle a shammy is a suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gikran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do not have any dealing with Dulak, but I do with Nadox.  Our guild did a mini-raid there with 2 groups, everyone 50+ with one 46 druid.<br />
Anyways on the undead mobs up there the Necro had huge trouble getting slow to land, he was 56 at the time.  We lacked a shaman so the chanter had to slow regular mobs, and again had a huge problem getting slow to land, he was 56 as well.<br />
<br />
We also had trouble with Aggro as well.  We had a 58 SK pulling, and would give him time to build up aggro, not jumping in till he said assist now.  One spell from anyone and the mob was on them.  Maybe it was poor aggro control by the SK, I do know he was pulling with darkness, lifetap on way in, and the screaming terror and pain.  But still, one spell from Necro, Wizard or Enchanter and the mob never looked at the SK again.<br />
Now this was not a problem, becuase Paladin stuns seem to generate a TON of aggro in there, I was 51 and had the mob on me after just Cease and Stun cast once each, I had not been taunting or casting before that either, so maybe get a Paladin in your group to hold aggro?  Seemed to work for us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't think this is limited to LoY zones, honestly I haven't had too many problems there...all the mobs are pretty slow moving so you just have to wait for the MA to engage before casting.<br />
<br />
I have far more trouble in PoP zones with slow aggro usually.  If I am grouped with a warrior, I will usually throw malosi before I try to slow, it cuts down on resists and usually lets the tank build up some aggro.  I do this occasionally in LoY but only if I am getting resisted tons because most of the mobs don't last too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LoY is the only place I have noticed mobs coming after me when I send in the dog - before I cast anything.<br />
<br />
me 61, war 61 pullling.  He pulls to camp and I hit hotkey for /pet attack and hotkey for slow and the mob is hitting me before the slow is halfway through casting.  lot of interrupts as a result.<br />
<br />
Also in LoY, when solo, have had mobs aggro on me when I BEGIN to cast.  (I have had the dog run out to meet the mob before I got hit or issued an attack command - wierd)<br />
<br />
This is all mostly Nadox.  Did not notice it in Torg, but have not been there much.  Dulak has all bee solo, and casting slow from farther away, as a rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good to know I'm not the only one having trouble in LoY. I've also encoutered those hard to slow mobs that like to resist slow for no good reason. I still find it disturbing that I can end up tanking a mob till it reaches half life or less because I cast one slow on it. I mean come on, all I did was cast ONE and only ONE spell. On the bright side, I found that certain Dark blue mobs in LoY have pathetic amounts of HP compared to Luclin or PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I spent a lot of time in Nadox and there you meet mobs relatively often that resist much more than others. Thank god I duo with my ranger because once he casts snare that usually means I can do whatever I want and not get aggro. I have to try really really hard to pull aggro of a successful snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">my method for dulak is this. shaman pulls with slow, you can get single pulls where if I pull with my warrior shooting arrows I get adds. run shaman back to spot face mob as soon as I see the mobs name, dog attack. with this method I have noticed the following.<br />
<br />
broken skull scouts: low HP, low resist and do not aggro to shaman after slow is cast (that is to say do not sit right away and they will not attack)<br />
<br />
drowsy/drunken/sleeping sailors (whatever): they all act the same as above, and have less HP than the scouts.<br />
<br />
all roamers/treasure/almost all other mobs: high hp compaired to the scouts resist root one out of every 3 casts, resist slow one out of every 5 casts, and will go through dog to hit you, they will also go through the warrior to hit you if you sit too soon after the warrior gains aggro (also unless you have some good damage output don't bother with them in the mid 40s).<br />
<br />
there are a lot more mobs here than I have listed here, but these are the mobs I have experience with.</div></div><hr />
