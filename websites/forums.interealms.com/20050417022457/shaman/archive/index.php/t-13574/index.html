Yea BrianA I installed his UI last week and noticed the same thing on mine. I must say that I dont have any other complaints. I have used in the up words of 10 differnt UI's and Mix and matched but I like this on the best. <br />
<br />
Wasnt really effected in the patch either. rock!<br />

Probably didn't even occur to him to check those.</div></div><hr />

If I put the EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml from the UI was I was using previously into the ZyphunUI directory, it starts working, but then it doesn't match.  I'm almost 90% certain it is a XML error, but my total lack of XML knowledge prevents me from figuring it out.... :(</div></div><hr />

Sorry for the slow reply, actually it was working fine til just a couple patches ago then poof, missing graphics. Like with most things at the moment I am just trying to find time to put in fixing it ^_^ hehe I've been very guilty of some intense leveling, or trying anyway. I am leaving this message and going to directly to fix it, as well as add some things that people have requested. Look for a new update to it soon. ^_^</div></div><hr />
