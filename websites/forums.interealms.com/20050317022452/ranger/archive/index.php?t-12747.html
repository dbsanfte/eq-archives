<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sykane</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">O have a couple questions about POP that i need to know:<br />
<br />
1.Is it possible to get the POP spells if you dont have the expansion? Can you have someone else just bring them to you?or are they no drop?I think it would be pretty stupid if you couldnt since there is nothin for a level 29 to do in POP but it comes with a great spell for that level.<br />
<br />
2.Are there any quests that involve getting stuff outside the planes?I was wondering because then the quests might be able to be done with lower level people<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kensei</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) No, not yet anyway.<br />
<br />
2) Yes, though I can't give you any specifics. I've just seen references to them on boards like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorongil Eless</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new spells are No Drop so it requires you to have the expansion and go there to get them yourself.  The exception being any spell for a hybrid that first belonged to a parent class before the expansion, like Circle of Summer.<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of the new quests that I've seen in Plane of Knowledge involve getting 4 items,  one from each of the previous expansions Original, Kunark, Velious, and Luclin.  These quests seem to be designed for mid-level advendurers. (example quest item:   a minotaur battle axe)<br />
<br />
Many of the new quests involve getting items from the new planes though.  These quests, of course, are designed for higher level adventurers(L 46+)</div></div><hr />

anyone else think it is pretty stupid that a level 30 ranger has to buy a 50+ expansion to get a level 29 spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kensei</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, but that's the way it goes with this expansion. Some of the stuff was well thought out, other stuff wasn't.</div></div><hr />
