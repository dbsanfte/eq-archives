<br />
What would yall think of this for PotW?<br />
<br />
Well, first, move SoT to like 62 or 63. <br />
<br />
Then, make PotW a group buff at 65. Remove the HP. It will never stack with brells, best to just give it up and replace it with something else &quot;rangerly&quot;.<br />
<br />
Remove 80 of the atk. Move the remaining atk to a free atk slot. Stack SoP (Spirt of the Predator) with PotW to make 2 usefull raid group buffs. <br />
<br />
Up the AC to 35. This is in part to make up for the loss of HP from the spell.<br />
<br />
Add 5 stackable HP regen to the spell a la force of nature.<br />
<br />
My feeling behind this suggestion is that it saves the ranger a whole lot of headache, while making us usefull for more than just damage/WS on a raid. As far as I can tell, all of the above would stack with most anything (excepting like MTs who are more heavily DSed). I don't view those spells as overpowering....By level 65 a ranger should be able to use 2 group buffs to contribute his aggregate buffing power to a group, IMO. <br />
<br />
Dunno, wanted to throw the idea out there and see what people thought of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and FYI, you want a second group buff to stack with SoP? Well here it is:<br />
<br />
Strength of Tunare<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase ATK by 60 <br />
4:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 125 <br />
Mana: 250 Skill: Abjuration <br />
Casting Time: 5 Recast Time: 0 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.25 Resist: Magic <br />
Range: 150 Location: Any <br />
Time of Day: Any AE Range 100 <br />
Fizzle Adj 5 Vendor Sold: No <br />
Interruptable: Yes Target Type: Group v2 <br />
Spell Type: Beneficial Source: Test 10/16 <br />
Classes: RNG/62 <br />
Duration: 1 hour  <br />
Cast on you: Tunare's strength flows through your muscles. <br />
Cast on other: Someone 's body is strengthened by Tunare. <br />
Wears off: Tunare's strength ebbs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, PoW is now 34 AC, but the rest of your request isn't realistic. We are already getting 7 more point of regen/tick from new spells, so I don't see us getting more. WP and now PoW is designed as the Warder's catch all CoP, CoE and SoN and it's a great spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know, earlier when I had this idea PotW hadn't even been made public yet at all. I was thinking about this abstractly as an upgrade to Warders.<br />
<br />
IMO, to upgrade Warders, you need to make it targetablle (if not group), and fix the stacking issues on it. That is what I attempted to do.<br />
<br />

<br />
Strength of Tunare <br />
<br />
Yah, the goal was to come up with an ageo of ranger buffs that had little to no stacking issues. Ageo in the true sense of the word, which is a group buff (see focus, BoA, c3, ect ect).<br />
<br />
SoT won't stack with the upgraded brells, so I don't see it being cast very much in a raid environment. Besides, SoT is not an ageo, nor a level 65 spell. <br />
<br />
As far as the regen? /shrug....I don't think 5 more per tick would overpower us....and to fix the brells issue you gotta either remove the HP or make it more than brells (which will never happen)....lately VI seems to be throwing regens of HP and mana around, so I figured it was probably what you would look to replace the HP with.<br />
<br />
I don't know, I'm not even 60 yet, but it seems to be casting 2 group spells on your own group when you are not even using those spells seems silly.....SoP and SoT won't stack with PotW.... I was just looking to throw something out there that simplified the situation with stacking, simplified the rangers buffing role, and also added to the contributions a ranger brings to a raid/group.</div></div><hr />

I love that it's a group spell.  Though some may prefer the BST one with 225hps and 40ATK.  <br />

Not sure what you mean by stacking issues though, they have been fixed, nothing overwrites Warders now.  If you are using Brells instead of WP you and only hurting your dmg output.</div></div><hr />

That is EXACTLY why I want it to be targetable. Strength of Tunare (SoN), Call of the Rathe (CoE), Force of Nature (sometimes Rogues and Monks want FoN). Realize that if given the buff I suggest above, buffing an entire raid would be a matter of 2 group buffs, instead of 2 group buffs, and 1 single target buff that practically everyone wants (CoE/CotR). How does this not make your buffing life more simple?<br />

<br />
Stacking issues as in they don't stack (brells/BST spell). <br />
<br />
If given a group buff ageo, like many other classes are given, I'd at least want it to be useful for more than a few people in a raid situation. The vast majority of high end raiders would take BmB over a targetable WP.</div></div><hr />
