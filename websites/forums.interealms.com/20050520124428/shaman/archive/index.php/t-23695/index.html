<br />
Who would care, honestly. There are enough Shaman BOTs out there to cover the buffs, other classes can cover the de-buffing and slowing adequately. We have nothing special enough to make an impact.</div></div><hr />

you need to get outside more..  Its a game, not a job.  Sony is not your employer.  You can stop paying them anytime you want too.  If you dont like the direction your class is going then:<br />
<br />
a) play another class<br />
<br />
b) play another game<br />
<br />
How many threads do we need whining about how Sony is ass raping you and how it is all some big conspiracy to make a particular class miserable or their customers unhappy on purpose.  <br />
<br />
The only compaining I can condone is releasing buggy unfinished products.  I agree with alot of the complaints though, I am not happy with spells, AA, lots of things but all these shrill complaints and empty threats do nothing.  If you want to send a message that will actually hurt stop giving them your money if your that unhappy.</div></div><hr />
