<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i really liked what this guy had to say.<br />
<br />
the beginning meant nothng to me since i don't play EQ2...<br />
<br />
anyways, i really liked what this dude had to say. if it has already been posted, my bad.<br />
<br />
You've touched on something fairly substantive here, and it's a point that's difficult to get across in a way that people will accept. In fact, some will probably get mad at me for even bringing this up, and I apologize in advance for derailing this thread. <br />
<br />
Crafting is indeed a combination of skill and luck, and we'd definitely like the system to favor skill. Pure random chance would mean that everyone would end up with similar results over time. Clearly, as you point out, this isn't the case. <br />
<br />
It's the same thing with adventuring. Two people can have the same gear, be the same level and class, fighting the same mobs. Yet they report vastly different results, one claiming they are hopelessly broken and the other saying they do just fine. <br />
<br />
So what's the difference? Is it random numbers, or player skill? <br />
<br />
I don't know if I've ever seen anyone on an MMO message board complain about their class and then admit &quot;But then again, I might not be playing my class very well.&quot; On the other hand, you can hardly look at a gameplay-related thread without multiple people blaming the designers, the random number generator, some dark corporate scheme, or any number of factors as to why they can't do what they want to do. Sure, there can be legitimate issues that cause real gameplay problems. But when there isn't, and it's a situation where one person says their class stinks while another person thinks it's great, how do you figure out who's right? <br />
<br />
It wouldn't be logical to assume that everyone plays this type of game with the same level of skill. Certainly not everyone who throws a baseball pitches like Kurt Schilling, and we don't expect them to. Computer games may not make the same physical demands as a sport, but that doesn't mean skill isn't important. <br />
<br />
Ever since the days of the Atari 2600, video games have addressed this fact. In many console games, you get to pick the skill level at which you play. Computer games, too. I personally don't feel any shame if I try out an FPS on &quot;beginner&quot; mode while some 12-year-old kid is playing on &quot;super extreme&quot; setting; I hereby acknowledge that I suck at FPS games. But you shouldn't need to be the best at something--whether it's baseball or Quake--in order to enjoy it. <br />
<br />
MMOs, of course, don't have a difficulty switch that can be changed for different skill levels of players. By the very nature of MMOs, you have to make the playing field as level as possible. While some classes might be more straightforward to play than others, I would venture to guess that the goal of most MMO designers is to make every class have some elements that reward skillful play. <br />
<br />
But as soon as you do that--as soon as you make it so one player can outperform another based on the way they use the tools available to them--you introduce inequality. Because I will tell you this: a poorly played character, regardless of how technically well-designed or well-balanced its class may be, is broken in a fundamental way. And except in the most obvious cases, it usually isn't the player who gets blamed for that: it's the design team. <br />
<br />
Again, I say this not to anger anyone or to escape culpability for bugs or broken features. We certainly have our share of those. But even if every bug is fixed and every ability has some kind of parity, there will be people swearing that their class is utterly broken. So at that point you either have to blame the random number generator or else find another factor that is responsible. <br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry for editorializing, it's just an issue I think about in this job. Please feel free to get back to talking about ways to enhance the crafting process. <br />
