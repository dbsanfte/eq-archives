<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow shaman, I wondered if anyone amongst us has ever solo'd or tried to solo Gorenaire? Is it doable? <br />
<br />
I fancy my chances with Gore, when buffed with PoS and GoD my svc is 400+ and svm 300+ I could add a further + 20 with tribute points, so I think I would be able to withstand the Ae's, when slowed and crippled I think his max malee would be under 300, I currently have 7333hp and 1485ac fully buffed, my mana pool is close to 6k.<br />
<br />
I'd be intrested to hear from anyone who solo'd killed Gore, a log would be nice to check dps needed and damage taken.<br />

You might want to try the GoD slow, but that's your only chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Problem isnt really to tank her i think, but to damage her. When i was 60, i coudnt land any poison or cold nuke. Maybe it is easier now, but not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know a Bard that solo's her fairly regularly.<br />
<br />
Not easy to slow/stick malosinia on tbh. Gore is one of the more resistant dragons even after malos, so I would be a lot of kiting until malosinia/tugurs was on.. could get in there with a tash stick for a few rounds and hope for a lucky proc, it' snot like our amazing melee will beat her down to summon range.<br />
<br />
Probably the way to do it would be sharkspine club. kilvas potions, mage geared alpha pet and use mana to self heal for a long fight ;)<br />
<br />
And as other posters mentioned, even if you slow her, getting dots/nukes to land is a pain ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pallies and warriors have soloed her too. Shamans kinda botched with the lack of -resist spells. Rabid Bear and some proccer as Grogbat says could work, but with the damage output, you would be healing yourself too much to concentrate on that. So its questionable if its doable really. Would need a fair bit of luck and very good gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've duoed Gore, but I wouldn't want to try soloing her, for the reasons stated above. I can get all resists to 400+ with buffs, AC over 1500, HP over 8k, but still, if you can't slow her, your best nuke is cold-based so it doesn't scratch her, and dogdog can only do so much, you are going to end up kiting her in circles and hoping dogdog wears her down, and that your Q is keeping your HP in line with what she's dishing out.<br />
<br />
In the long run, with good prep, the right buffage, and some luck, you can probably do her, but I just don't see it being worth the effort. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is a shaman on my server that has solo'ed Gorenaire.  Tp my knowledge, he is only elemental geared with maybe 1-2 time pieces.   From my understanding he uses some sort of kite method- do damage, get summoned, run, get summoned, heal.  I think once your resists are high enough to resists the aoe's, the dmg output after slow would be almost negligible- hits for 300's are not too bad considering.  After considering time druids being able to kill the likes of Gorenaire/Trakanon I can't see why a shaman couldn't pull it off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In order to solo Gore this is what you will need to do.<br />
<br />
1.  Resists as already mentioned the more the better.<br />
2.  DAMAGE SHIELDS any form you can get potion + gear what-ever<br />
3.  Breath of Trushar<br />
4.  Pet (with daggers)<br />
<br />
(Don't think she is slowable)<br />

The dragon will waste all its mana on you towards the beginning of the fight.<br />
(heal potions never hurt, depends whether you have the money for them.)<br />

DS killing is not all that uncommon on 32K hp Kunark Dragons.  Even against Trak.</div></div><hr />

Bull, shamans are still powerhouses its just other classes are getting up to par or better than them.  And still others classes are weaker than shamans.<br />
<br />
Enchanters and Necros maybe able to work miracles with charm but I still believe our class works just fine in the game.  <br />
<br />
The main concern is just GoD content that is giving almost all the classes a feeling of belittlement.  Not just our class.  I am getting really sick of the whining too.</div></div><hr />

I likely shouldn't reply to this, but your opinion is so blatantly flawed that I had to say something.  I'd hate to see anyone mislead by your statement.<br />
<br />
In your first two paragraphs you make ambiguous class comparrisons.  You say we're still powerhouses and you know what, I'll agree to a point.  In long fights with slowable mobs, we do very well, but this content doesn't exist in recent expansions.  There are no more bunny fights in PoM, no more WW fights, no more long assed solo boss mob beatings in Luclin that equate to new content.  I believe it was Flabbo that put it to the EQ dev team and they said the same damned thing.  Shaman rule at long fights, but SoE isn't planning on putting any more long fights in because people don't like long fights.  <br />
<br />
You say other classes are getting up to par or surpassing par faster than shamans, although this statement alone suggests an imbalance your interpretation of par is what I find questionable.  When the game is moving to a faster, harder hitting, more intense pace how is slow relevant on short fights?  How will our heal stack up when a single hit from a mob does more damage?  How will our dots stack up when the fight is over before we can finish casting them, or on the few longer fights that exist, the dots draw so much aggro we either pull mobs off the MA or do such marginal DPS that we do not earn our spot in our group?  The only role we reasonably have is playing the chanter's/necro's bitch.  We help them with controlling their pets and keeping the main party DPS alive.  Most competant chanters don't really need us in these roles and it isn't a sign that the class is healthy or even competative.  We're not relevant due to content.<br />
<br />
Granted, GoD content is what really points this out, but expect more of the same in the next EQ expansion because the dev team says people don't like long fights.  Most of the deficiencies exist in the high end game, but any 65th lvl shaman with half a brain who does anything from tactics to hard LDON to GoD trials should be able to see where the problems start.  It's been argued with you before (when Giac and many other sensible shaman embarrassed you) and I don't expect you to change your mind, but I don't think your opinion is helpfull to the class.  We should be looking for SoE to bring us up to &quot;par&quot; and offer us a role in the type of content that SoE says they will be shoving down your throat.</div></div><hr />

Tarthug, you seem to be agreeing with me more than anything.<br />
<br />
And as for this comment:<br />

<br />
LDON hard dungeons are joke for me.  Malos, slow, haste, bane and help patch heal.  Invest in IR5 and ID5 then talk to me if you get torn down to hard from agro.  LDON hard dungeons are not hard at all.  And your statement just goes to prove that up growing shamans are willing to just hop on the ban wagon and add their complaints before experiencing the content.  (Normal adventures in LDON are way too boring.)<br />
<br />
Giac is a whiner.  He is morbid and miserable with everything.<br />
He has no realistic ideas and just complains.  Check is past posts for proof.  Stating him just discredits you.<br />
<br />
My opinion is realistic.  Shamans are just fine and quite balanced.<br />
<br />
Just as the devs and OTHER SHAMANS have said if you would READ!!!<br />
The only concern is below:<br />
<br />
GoD content is as much a concern as it is with the shamans as it is with MOST of the other classes right now.  Give SoE a chance to tweak the encounters and trails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Giac is a whiner.  He is morbid and miserable with everything.<br />

<br />
<br />
Do you seriously believe what you say? Are you really that mentally challenged?<br />
Check my post hostory. It's exactly people like you that make me lose it. <br />
I am not putting up with people who are totally clueless, yet refuse to accept *facts* for whatever pathetical reason(I don't want to know it, so spare me with your stories). <br />
<br />
Just because the Devs are trying to make it look like Shaman problems started with GoD, doesn't mean the smart people believe that. Shaman problems started a long time ago and culminated in PoP with the introduction of Slow mitigation. <br />
<br />
How many of us have been complaining about active mana regen, resistability of our DoTs, weak DDs etc.? The answer is very few of us. And do you know why? Because Slow was the one thing that made us overcome all that.<br />
<br />
Everyone that asks himself why Shamans have not been able to find a consensus on what we need, doesn't see the whole picture. <br />
The reason for us to not seem to be able to agree on what is needed for us, is that we have been neglected for so long, so many things about the class have needed tweaks(in some cases relevant fixes), that now that THE single ability that made us ignore all other deficiencies(Slow, hallelujah)for years has been trivialized and become obsolete, we are finding ourselfs in front of wrecked (car)class in need of a total rehaul. <br />
<br />
<br />
My opinion is realistic.  Shamans are just fine and quite balanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your opinion is irrelevant. <br />
<br />
We are the only class that accepts that Kunark dragons(that **** is 4 years old) resist every single spell in our spell book(except for the unresistable debuffs that should allow us to use our other spells, but do NOT) and still have morons like you calling us balanced or even a powerhouse.<br />
<br />
Drive through, newbie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tarthug, you seem to be agreeing with me more than anything.<br />
Even in fiction like yours, you can always find reality.  There were parts that were correct, we do rule in long encounters where you have a slowable mob.<br />
<br />

(Normal adventures in LDON are way too boring.) <br />
/yawn ... LDoN Normal (aka: easy) was a joke for me as well.  LDoN hard would have been simple had I had the correct party composition.  I had no problem from aggro, I had problems getting singles as we had no pullers and I can't function with my typical group with no puller and no CC, especially with mitigating mobs (I played in a set group and never bothered on hard missions with a pick up group).<br />
<br />
Your comment on growing shaman is juvenille and wrong, I don't fit that mold.<br />
<br />
Giac is a whiner.  He is morbid and miserable with everything.<br />
He has no realistic ideas and just complains.  Check is past posts for proof.  Stating him just discredits you.<br />
LOL! Whatever.  While Giac hardly represents the shaman community, he sure as hell does a better job of it than you.  It's more realistic to recognise problems than look at the EQ world through rose coloured glasses.  If you don't believe me, look at your board rep and compare it to Giac's to see who more people seem to believe.  I don't think he's all that and a cup of tea, but at least he's looking for solutions rather than glossing over real class issues.<br />
<br />

SoE has had months to look at GoD encounters, they had a BETA to look at issues and instead they work on releasing a new graphic engine right after a new expansion release.  This is called poor planning.  This is using production for BETA.  I've read the responses from SoE and let me ask you, how do you expect SoE will tweak the encounters and trails?  Will suddenly they rebalance the whole release so more mobs are slowable and have more HPs to drag out the fight?  Will they re-tune exp so that the fewer fights give as much exp?  Will they re-tune drop rates to match the longer fights?  Will they re-time trials to make for slower fights?  Has SoE ever re-tuned a release so completely in the past to suit the needs of a single class?  If you answered no to any of these questions then you don't have a leg to stand on.<br />
<br />
See, I made my point and I didn't even have to use large coloured text.</div></div><hr />

A human discussion would be one thing. When comments start flying, calling each other schoolyard insults, then you all need to take a step back and clear your minds a little.<br />

Once that is done, then try to discuss things like logical rational people. Give that a chance.<br />

The most I can do to contribute is to go in there and melee the mob. NOTHING else. And a 600 hps buff. That is weak. <br />
<br />
Sometimes I can proc 800 dd a few times in a row hit for 210 a few times before the mob is done with. Woah I shaved off 5 seconds from that kill. <br />
<br />
That's ridicilous. <br />
<br />
A named comes I am asked not to bother slowing it, takes too long. &quot;Why don't you anull it&quot; ya thanks my sole contribution was I anulled the named and I hit Radiant Cure. Ya I patch heal but warrior will die if defensive goes down so better contibute to dps instead HA! 1 bane and your ass is friend,.. (read rampage you to low health aggro then kill you) Can nuke from a distance with our powerful nuke which is less than a cleric or go in and melee..  <br />
<br />
It's not a challenge, it's knowing that any other class would have been better than me. ANY other class. <br />
<br />
Used to be 2 clerics in the group and people moan about low dps now the cleric can out dps me. We bring absolutely nothing to the table. All time gods are unslowable.. do a time trial and the warrior is like &quot;is this slowed?&quot; yes it is slowed you just can't notice the difference... the rest of pop is a joke too.. you only need to slow for the rathe council, everything else if your tank was unable to live w/o slow he won't live after slow.. <br />
<br />
Before pop, most of that **** is unslowable or really hard to slow.. if you notice really, the shamans are the only ones concerned about slowing it early.. the rest are in the mode, &quot;If the shaman don't slow it we got to keep him up&quot; translating to, they would have won w/o the slow anyway..</div></div><hr />

I don't think I've cornered the market on knowing what shaman think, we are in opinion as diverse as we are in our skill sets.  What I do know is that board rep indicates more than a single post, from a single shaman.  If my shaman char was still pre-65 prior to me quitting, I'd have thought we were fine too.  One opinion doesn't weigh is as heavily when it's A) unqualified and B) when it takes so many rep hits to nuke a rep as badly as yours.<br />
<br />
I have heard nothing till now of manipulating board reps by members till now, personally, I'm not all that interested.<br />
<br />
[QUOTE='Gagner67']There are lots of us who feel that the shaman class is just fine, we just dont say much because there's more whiners than do'ers on this forum and the flame list just goes on forever. <br />
Yeah, in short, you admit you're in a minority but call yourself a do'er.  What are you doing about the inequities of class balance?  The problem is, your not.  You've proved nada, no statistics, no numbers, no facts, no logs, no theoretical models to back up your point of view.  We're suppossed to say everything is OK and take your word for it?  Sorry, but when some of the most respected shaman in the community come forward, post logs, models and widely supported written positions, you don't close your eyes and bury your head in the sand.  You look at your logs or compare it to your experiences and evaluate the data.  For me, in teir 3 and hard LDoN I started to see what so many prominent shaman had tried to tell me on these boards.  I checked it against my logs and my voice joined theirs.<br />
<br />
Not all shamans think like you -&gt; Gaic &quot;teh MORBID&quot; or like Tarthug. <br />
And with that...THANK GOD!!!!!<br />
I agree, thank God!  While I appreciate different points of view, I also appreciate logic, reason and common sense.  That means if you don't see a problem, fine share, but unless you're prepared to back it up or back up someone else who has provided proof, then don't scream at the top of your lungs that you don't have a clue.  I'll look at anything you have to post that supports your position, but I've yet to see anything other than your interpretation of your personal experiences.  <br />
<br />
And to the shaman that asked me not to quote him I am truely sorry but I am sick or these WHINERS taking over the board.  Please note I did not use your name and I won't post anymore private msg from others with the same concerns.<br />
So, you've done two diservices to the anonomous shaman, first you reposted what was sent in confidence, then you offered rose coloured glasses to blind him to what so many other shaman have proved from multiple perspectives, that the class needs work.<br />
<br />
Oh, I hate whining as well, but to date, I have seen real cause for concern in much of the evidence I've seen posted on these boards.  I think there is a difference between demanding that shaman get a usefull role and the discussion that invokes and complaining mindlessly.  Is there whining on these boards, yes.  Is whining strictly coming from one side of the opinion on the balance question, no.  To qualify yourself as a do'er when you're doing nothing is a little odd.  To qualify all the work and proof from shaman like veeshanMurtak as whining is wrong.<br />
<br />
I don't expect to change your mind, but I hope that if you have a point, you prove it.</div></div><hr />

Summary for Blarg:<br />
1.  I presented a way to kill Gorenaire.<br />
2. T'harkis thought that shamans should not have to resort to a cheap method to killing Gorenaire.  That shamans, basically have gotten weaker.<br />
3.  I retorted we are more balanced with other classes but still powerful.<br />
4.  Tarthug thought my opinion was quote a &quot;blatant flaw&quot; and starts slinging the Pronouns and insults.  Blarg, Tarthug is your beginning quote &quot;attacker.&quot;<br />
5.  Tarthug brings up Gaic in his statement minutes later magically Gaic appears to throw his morbid statements about.  (Yes, I say Morbid because as I have stated you can check Gaic's past posts he is not happy with anything.  Just check and see for yourself.)<br />
6.  I retorted again it escalates posters agree with Gaic and Tarthug then posters agree with me. <br />
<br />
So I guess, you could say T'harkis chimed and Tarthug, Gaic &amp; I followed after.  Sprouting two new subjects.  <br />
<br />
&quot;One how they feel the current shaman is weak&quot; the other &quot;how I and other disclosed shamans are sick of them complaining.&quot; AKA whinning.  <br />
<br />
And hasn't it been whining lately?  Look about Ppl threatening to cancel or have cancelled their accounts but yet are still login to post on the Sony boards O_o!?.  Ppl threatening Devs.  Please, look they are even insulting Devs.  <br />
<br />
Blargx sorry to stand up and tell it how it is, but yes, many are acting like children and fit the term whinning.  <br />
<br />
Sorry, about the term 'children,' but maybe they deserve that pronoun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I seem to recall you using the W word before anyone in this thread, Gagner, and saying it repeatedly.  That latter is definitely true.  At any rate, my post wasn't limited to discussing your love in particular(I didn't even mention your name) for the word, though I don't think you're bringing in anything worthwhile by developing such a crush on it.  Quite the contrary.<br />
<br />
I couldn't give a damn about the rest of it -- the whatever Giac/Tarthug/whoever.  I wasn't talking about that or who was right or wrong or why.<br />
<br />
And I think, yes, that using name calling and &quot;the W word&quot; as if it were: a) an argument in itself, or b) a tool in a good argument, or c) part of a reasonably pleasant, mature discussion likely to lead anywhere at all is a mistake.  <br />
<br />
I also think it's tiring and even somehow a bit discouraging to see thread after thread in board after EQ board constantly(and quickly!) devolving down to the lowest common denominator as so many people try to leap in and accuse anyone who disagrees with them of whining and being a whiner.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I feel like I have to crack a quick 40 or 50 points off my IQ, or revisit my childhood, when I decide to browse EQ-related threads.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some &quot;clever&quot; schmuck could now pat himself on the back and say I've just been whining about whining.  Go for it!  Not that it really applies in this case.  I stated what I perceived as a problem.  And I do wish the ad hominem way of discussing things on EQ boards and slinging idiotic cliches around would be the aberration (sp?) rather than the norm.<br />
<br />
As it stands, whenever I see a post with any variation of the word &quot;whining&quot; or &quot;whiner&quot; in it, it instantly flunks the first test in my mental checklist of what deserves to be read and considered.</div></div><hr />

Can't be bothered to do all the work for you as you've ignored logic to this point and it's unlikely doing any additional work for you will yeild results.<br />
<br />
Tarthug let me thank you for your quote above. <br />
This is a perfect example of a shaman that has not experienced enough.  Not time geared or even has elemental gear.  And is jumping on the band wagon, unsure what upper level shamans are truely concerned about. <br />
<br />
Tarthug your complaining about Teir 3 (for example BoT) and [u]AGAIN Hard LDON dungeons.  <br />
These experience are NOT what shamans are complaining about.  <br />
<br />
I consider BoT as tier 2 (I know it is listed as tier 3, but it's an open zone and there was stuff there that although was challenging, gave me a role to play that was usefull).  I was refering to Tactics mostly (yes, I was able to solo the pit, so was every other tom dick and mary).  I quit before anyone in my guild could buy the expansion for me (as they knew I wasn't going to buy it myself).  Still, I saw the issues in my regular group when doing Tactics and Hard LDoN.  Mobs died so quickly with 2 charmed mobs a decked out ranger, a rogue and an SK MT with a BoTed cleric outside the group.  For LDoN hard we dropped the chanter and the necro and picked up an elemental wizard and elemental cleric.  Really, the only role I played was charmed mob management with malos, slow, and then casting abolish disease to drop slow the second the pet health bar showed up on the necro and the chanter.  Aside from the occaisional root, slow wasn't needed on regular mobs and so I nuked and occaisionally healed pets as the guy 2 boxxing the cleric had a more difficult time targeting pets since he wasn't in the group.  Although my group loved me to death, I couldn't see what difference I made there (other than on occaision making a rare save on the chanter or necro as the chanter was also frequently being 2 boxxed).  DoTs are too slow, my DDs too wimpy, my heals rarely needed, slow wasn't needed (without telling my party one night I stopped slowing, no one noticed) and a mage or druid would have been a significantly better fit in that group, despite how my group protested to the contrary.  LDoN hard was different.  The problem was getting slow to land reliably on pulls where pacify failed (as it most often did) and we ended up with multiples in camp.  Many different tactics were used, but I found that malos and slow took too long to land and when they did, mitigation made them no better than a chanter's slow.  Again, the party would have been better off with another class, preferably a bard or chanter, but my party stuck with me because we are all good friends.  I used to play a solid shaman, but I will not tolerate a mercy group, no matter how much I enjoy the company of my friends.<br />
<br />
I look at the numbers, I look at the arguments and I looked at the logs and experiences I had accumulated and it made sense.  I could see how my strengths were not suited to the evolution of the game and that other classes were better suited to the people I grouped with.  The only time I really felt I had a solid role to play was on the few nights where I duoed or handled trivial content (ie: LDoN normal where i'd be main healer, slowed adds and CCed sometimes) ... oh, and PLing twinks.<br />
<br />
Many classes solo PoF, some better than shamans.  I wanted a group role, the soloing was always secondary.  Even so shamans are no longer in the top 5 for soloing relevant content.  It isn't asking for content to be easier.  I could care less about dying 5 times in a night, I want to end the night knowing that my group could not have done better with another class filling my spot.  I got that feeling less and less.  Trying to get SoE to recognise that content has changed my role, but my skill sets have not changed to match, it isn't whining, it's trying to get recognition for an issue that SoE seems unwilling to address.<br />
<br />
Lastly, your red text didn't impress me the first time and it doesn't do much for me now.  Look back to my second post on this thread to address that statement and come back when you can answer those questions.</div></div><hr />

His post is above just outlines things in the game our class has been base on ever since the game was created.  <br />

Except buffs.  Our stat buffs are the largest. <br />
And Shaman DoTs are not Solid behind necro DoT.  I have a 60 Necro.<br />

http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19248<br />
<br />
The problem I have with the above link is:<br />
A.  Veeshanmurtak states the fights are 50 seconds each.  And each time the druid is using their most powerful DOT.  Yet he does not calc the time factor for the DOT to run its course, to be cast, or whether in that time the druid should be busily trying to cast heals over and over again on **non-slowed** mob hitting for around 800 a hit.  Sorry the stats don't work out.<br />
<br />
B.  Cleric can definately handle the healing part with ease especally with shared health.  But there is an issue as to how many nukes or how much melee they risk to get in during Hard dungeon.  Aggro is not what cleric wants on an **unslowed** Hard LDON mob.  And uncontrolled adds just means the cleric will be busy healing.<br />
<br />
C.  Shaman Malos, Slows, hastes, VPs, patch heals and adds pet damage.  I don't consider us a main healer for a group in LDON HARD dungeons.  We cover both a little of druid and enchanter abilities.  Thats been a class role for a while now.  How ever in certain areas a cleric is definately necessary.  And in some areas a druid and cleric will work for healing.  And some areas shaman, cleric, druid or even necro can handle healing.<br />

The second graph actually makes me happy because many shamans here assumed that we were 33% less effect than a druid.  And from the graph we aren't :)<br />
<br />
Lastly the post and graphs were done before the recent heal changes.  So infact shamans will heal even better in those graphs.<br />

B.  This is before the healing changes and druids from a game stance are suppose to be a little better in healing than shamans.  But in some cases they aren't as you saw in the graphs.<br />
C.  And I don't know why Gardeltron bought up clerics other than a standing base, clerics are suppose to be the best healer.  What do we want to take their class role away?<br />

Chutoi is talking about GoD content again a moot point to bring up since we agree on this subject Targus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't be bothered to do all the work for you as you've ignored logic to this point and it's unlikely doing any additional work for you will yeild results.<br />
<br />
You really aren't thou.  I have yet to see your owns stats.  But your just NOW experiencing Teir 3 and Hard LDON.<br />
<br />
<br />
I consider BoT as tier 2 (I know it is listed as tier 3)<br />
<br />
BoT IS Teir 3 and Tactic IS Teir 3 and HoH IS Teir 3...<br />
Tactics gives you trouble....<br />
<br />
<br />
  The problem was getting slow to land reliably on pulls where pacify failed (as it most often did) and we ended up with multiples in camp. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, pacify does fail on Hard LDON.  That was figured in on purpose.  But even multiples of 3 pulls in a Hard can be handled with ease.  <br />
Invest in IR5 or ID5 or even VP.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Many different tactics were used, but I found that malos and slow took too long to land and when they did, mitigation made them no better than a chanter's slow. <br />
<br />
This is false your slow even mitigated is better.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only time I really felt I had a solid role to play was on the few nights where I duoed or handled trivial content (ie: LDoN normal where i'd be main healer, slowed adds and CCed sometimes) ... oh, and PLing twinks.<br />
<br />
Well its too bad you feel this way.  All I can say is get some more AAs, revise tactics with CC with your shaman, positioning, and look perhaps to Ornate gear if you can't get to the Elemental planes at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many classes solo PoF, some better than shamans. <br />
<br />
This place is a breeze to solo as a shaman!!!<br />
And still more classes can't even solo in PoF.  Consider yourself lucky.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trying to get SoE to recognise that content has changed my role, but my skill sets have not changed to match, it isn't whining, it's trying to get recognition for an issue that SoE seems unwilling to address.<br />
<br />
It is whinning when your complaining about Hard LDON and Teir 3 zones as a problem.  These aren't problems upper level shamans are concerned about at this time.  Many of the problems center around GoD.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, your red text didn't impress me the first time and it doesn't do much for me now.  <br />
<br />
Nope it was ment for you to read it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Hard LDON's never bothered me much, personally.  I do great in them.  I was the puller for one recently, even though in hards I think that can be a little crazy, at least at my level of gear.  No guts, no glory though, eh?<br />
<br />
What I do think is a legitimate complaint about hard LDON's or virtually any place where shamans are wanted these days is not that other people can do our job(the complaint warriors have about knights, who many state openly they wish couldn't tank at all, pretty much anywhere ever), but that they can essentially do it and do much more besides.  When slow is mitigated, the difference between 70 and 75% slows becomes vanishingly small, and the difference between a slow that lands quickly for 65 and a slow that lands slowly, generally needing a debuff first, and hits for 75 is often irrelevant enough that the extra benefits a beastlord brings more than makes up for the small difference of their slows on mitigated mobs.  <br />
<br />
And, of course, on unslowable mobs, who cares how fabulous our extra 5 or 10% is supposed to be?<br />
<br />
And when enchanters can not only slow and give better buffs than we can(KEI is much more valuable than focus), but add more damage than an entire group by charming pets, you have to ask yourself the question, why choose a shaman over a beastlord or an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Now, for the first time since I started my shaman, the answer almost always seems to be:  don't.  <br />
<br />
I can solo if I want to, but it's boring.  I can duo too, but ditto.  Unfortunately, I kind of have to these days.  It used to be I got endless tells from people wanting a shaman in their group -- this went on for years, ever since I started my shaman.  No longer.  It suddenly stopped when people realized, especially since GoD pointed it out and made it painfully clear, that we just don't bring enough to the table anymore.  There's nothing we do that a BL or chanter can't do just as well for all practical purposes -- and they can add a lot more besides.  You can't argue with the numbers.  For smart people, a shaman is not a smart option.  Better just try to get groups with tolerant friends.<br />
<br />
I can get along, but I knew how bad it had gotten when I myself had to honestly admit that when my SK is in a group, I'm relieved if they get a chanter or a BL instead of a shaman, because we will kill things faster and do just fine anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Blargx,<br />
<br />
I still get a lot of tells for groups.  I am usually just interested in GoD.  If anything.<br />
<br />
Its unfortunate that a single group cannot be made of all the classes. Inwhich all the classes have a defining very necessary role to play.<br />
<br />
Many classes are angry that a cleric can't be totally replaced by druid. While Clerics are angry that a druid can possibly at times replace them.<br />
<br />
Now think about this:<br />
In our instance, if a shaman is introduced to a group it gives a cleric some feelings of ease (Not Talking about GoD ;) ).  With us about, now the cleric can melee have fun and not worry about healing all that much.  Plus the shaman could add some CC.  A good mix.  <br />
<br />
If a enchanter is picked over a shaman, then an enchanter offers, better CC, slightly less slow, and a slightly better haste and possibly better damage.  But no healing :( .<br />
<br />
How do you think the BST feels about enchanters?  Enchanters have the ability to out damage them.  BSTs has very little CC control.  And a BSTs slow is less than a enchanter and a shamans.  BSTs have less haste to offer.  And less healing than a shaman.  <br />
<br />
Our position between the choice of these 3 classes is not all that bad for shamans.<br />
And I don't much want to be a BST (or even a Mage) in GoD right now.<br />
<br />
Blargx, Knights have had it pretty good up until GoD.  Some of the content hits way to hard in GoD for knights to mitigate it needs to be tweaked.  But thats been said already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">His post is above just outlines things in the game our class has been base on ever since the game was create.<br />
From the numbers he ran, he came up with the following conclusions:<br />
Shaman feel neglected due to a variety of reasons. We have not gotten the same amount of upgrades to our spell lines as everyone else did. Our existing abilities have been nerfed directly (slow mitigation) and indirectly (fast fights) to a point where many of us feel that we no longer adequately contribute to a group, much less a raid. Our key abilities, slow and mana regeneration are no longer as useful as they once were and we received nothing new to make up for it. Our healing is arguably weaker then a paladin's, our buffing is arguably weaker then a beastlord's, our damage is pathetic.<br />
He outlined the numbers (which you are not really disputing much, good) and drew conclusions, the later your response seems to ignore.<br />
And Shaman DoTs are not Solid behind necro DoT. I have a 60 Necro.<br />
A necros best least resisted spell is splurt (still gets resisted) and (leech line).<br />
Yeah, your 60 necro is being compared to what level shaman?  What part of the game were we talking about here?<br />
<br />
Your necro being 60, clearly he hasn't seen:<br />

<br />
All have resist modifiers and many save vs magic where resist debuffs are more common and powerfull.  Saryn's kiss alone has a -200 resist mod on it.  Shaman can't touch necros, not that it matters as DoTs are no longer really relevant considering the life expectancy of a mob in group settings.<br />
<br />
Hey, Targus did we already go over that GoD trails and encounters need to be tweaked.  Targus we both agree on this subject.<br />
Bringing this up again is Moot.<br />
A) it's Tarthug /shrug, not a big deal really.<br />
B) cool, glad to see we agree, that wasn't apparent from your earlier posts including your assessment of shaman as a powerhouse class.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem I have with the above link is:<br />
A.  Veeshanmurtak states the fights are 50 seconds each.  And each time the druid is using their most powerful DOT.  Yet he does not calc the time factor for the DOT to run its course, to be cast, or whether in that time the druid should be busily trying to cast heals over and over again on **non-slowed** mob hitting for around 800 a hit.  Sorry the stats don't work out.[quote]<br />
not really.  Swarming death is a 6 tick dot.  Lasts only 36 seconds.  It could reasonably run full course by the end of the fight and doesn't require a debuff to land with it's -100 mod.<br />
<br />
Your missing the point.  The model isn't assuming what each class would be doing, but what they COULD do with the given mana regen.  It actually shows off shaman pretty well from a theoretical standpoint and in the end proves that on paper we look a hell of a lot better than we do in practice.  A moving party and the time it takes to cann reduces the practical mana regen of the shaman.<br />
<br />
[QUOTE='Gagner67']B.  Cleric can definately handle the healing part with ease especally with shared health.  But there is an issue as to how many nukes or how much melee they risk to get in during Hard dungeon.  Aggro is not what cleric wants on an **unslowed** Hard LDON mob.  And uncontrolled adds just means the cleric will be busy healing.<br />
again, see my point above, but that said, IN PRACTICE, there is nothing in your statement on clerics that I find fault with.  I can tell you the only time the clerics I played with (even un botted ones) ever drew aggro was when they were were really fighting for it (for fun, not efficiency) and they never won when they fought for aggro with me and concentrating on the same target.<br />
<br />
C.  Shaman Malos, Slows, hastes, VPs, patch heals and adds pet damage.  I don't consider us a main healer for a group in LDON HARD dungeons.  We cover both a little of druid and enchanter abilities.  Thats been a class role for a while now.  How ever in certain areas a cleric is definately necessary.  And in some areas a druid and cleric will work for healing.  And some areas shaman, cleric, druid or even necro can handle healing.<br />
In the right group, a shaman can be the main healer, but that assumes a very specific make up, so I agree we are not meant to be main healers in LDoN hards.  That said, in LDoN hard, with my usual group make up, I could not have handled heals for many pulls (IHG2 and IH4 item).  If the group dropped me for half a dozen classes, they'd be better off.<br />
<br />
yep, I see those graphs.<br />
The first graph shamans are above druids.<br />
The second graph actually makes me happy because many shamans here assumed that we were 33% less effect than a druid.  And from the graph we aren't :)<br />
I guess it's a matter of perspective.  That said, accepting that kind of drop from the next best healing class when in many situations our slows are not mitigating much damage because of resists, time of fights and mob slow mitigation, we'd have to place higher in those graphs to make up mana lost on debuffs and time lost debuffing (with a heal deficit to make up for).  IMHO those values and the graphs that represent them should be a lot closer where MoB DPS exceeds our heal output and thats why I linked them.  The old values do not work anymore now that mitigation and even slow immunity (I admit mitigation is a good thing, but only when it eliminates immune mobs and only when fights last long enough for a slow to make a noticable difference in damage mitigation) has been expanded more.<br />
<br />
Lastly the post and graphs were done before the recent heal changes.  So infact shamans will heal even better in those graphs.<br />
Yup, but the difference isn't enough to make a difference.  Most shaman only see the Q upgrade, hey, I'll take it, but the Q upgrade won't likely make enough of a difference to make a shaman a possible main healer in ideal group situations for GoD like a shaman can do in LDoN hard and teir 3.  In short, the ante has been upped and both druids and especially shaman lost out.<br />
<br />
A. our nukes have always been less than druids (just like our DoT are better).<br />
DoTs, while great for soloing are not useful with groups anymore.  The thing here is that while there is nothing that is inheirantly wrong with the shaman class, content has made us a 3rd string player.  It's not just GoD, although from what so many shamans say it's just more evident there.<br />
<br />
B.  This is before the healing changes and druids from a game stance are suppose to be a little better in healing than shamans.  But in some cases they aren't as you saw in the graphs.<br />
One would expect shaman to kick ass in long term crawls with heals due to our mana regen, but looking at chart 1 where shaman actually do shine slightly (it's a calculated 4 hour crawl with projected heal capacity based on mana regen, no down time) we barely squeak ahead of druids when we have cann and for the most part, similar mana regen buffs.    This doesn't factor in slows and malos being cast every 15-30 seconds based on pull rates.  It isn't a failing of the chart, the chart is good, but in the stated situation we should have performed even better as thats our &quot;ideal&quot; niche.  Druids get stronger in other scenarios as they drift away from the role that we should have tatooed on our collective backsides.  Any situation where there is an acceptable low HPS (in short a role where a cleric isn't required), where the action is fast, there are no breaks, and especially where slows are more potent (charts are not designed for incorporating slow) we should even compete with clerics for the MH role.<br />
C.  And I don't know why Gardeltron bought up clerics other than a standing base, clerics are suppose to be the best healer.  What do we want to take their class role away?<br />
Except in the situation I mentioned above, I tend to agree.  I don't want to put anyone out of work, but I don't want to have a cleric requirement for EXP groups, I do want to have a niche or two that make me a prefered character class to fill in as MH and I do want the ability to back up a cleric effecively as a secondary healer (a role best filled by druids in all GoD content).<br />
<br />
Chutoi is talking about GoD content again a moot point to bring up since we agree on this subject Targus.<br />
Wrong name, but whatever, no biggie.  My point is that the problems pre-date GoD, so while Chutoi is specifically addressing GoD, these issues have been around since the post-pop mitigation fix.<br />
<br />
You really aren't thou.  I have yet to see your owns stats.  But your just NOW experiencing Teir 3 and Hard LDON.<br />
Actually, I quit 2-3 months ago, and I had been in teir 3 for over a year and had been doing LDoN hard since it was still in BETA.  The logs I had before uninstalling EQ were typical of my personal experience, but not good for applied analysis for demonstrating weakness in the class versus the content.  No controls, random variations out the backside, insufficient sample sizes, but night after night the same basic inadaquacies re-appeared.<br />
<br />
BoT IS Teir 3 and Tactic IS Teir 3 and HoH IS Teir 3...<br />
Tactics gives you trouble....<br />
A blatant and juvinille bait.  I never said tier 3 gave me problems, if you read my posts you'd see I questioned my role as I could always think of at least two other classes who could have outperformed me.  Travelling with a high DPS group fights ended far too fast (20-25 seconds per) for slows to be effective and since we had a 2 boxxed cleric outside the group, I had no need to heal anyone but pets (who rarely were in any danger).<br />
Yes, pacify does fail on Hard LDON.  That was figured in on purpose.  But even multiples of 3 pulls in a Hard can be handled with ease.  Invest in IR5 or ID5 or even VP.<br />
I had LR5 and VP.  I retired with over 110 AA.<br />
<br />
This is false your slow even mitigated is better.<br />
A chanter slow at the highest mitigation is something on the lines of .3 of a percent worse than ours.  I defy you to notice the difference.<br />
<br />
Well its too bad you feel this way.  All I can say is get some more AAs, revise tactics with CC with your shaman, positioning, and look perhaps to Ornate gear if you can't get to the Elemental planes at this time.<br />
Did all that.  There were still noticable issues due to the fact that my regular group was a high DPS group.  Only in LDoN was I able to take a role because we were only allowed 6 in the group and no one would be able to 2 box.  Still, in LDoN, the group was still high DPS and every night I could see where at least 2 other classes could have filled my spot better, and would have if I wasn't with friends.  Everything from DPS (Bane was my only usefull DoT due to quick fights, it refreshed too slow), to heals, to resists on slow.  A mezzer (bard, chanter, in MM a necro), a monk, a warrior with AE taunt and a hate weapon, or a druid (with superior BU heals, DPS, and better buffs when combined with the cleric's, plus the DS, BU evac and similar CC) would have brought more to the table than me.  I'm not getting that group for my class, I'm getting that group for my relationship and the fact that they trust me to find a way to make a contribution.  That's not a credit to my class, that's a credit to myself and my friends.<br />
<br />
This place is a breeze to solo as a shaman!!!<br />
And still more classes can't even solo in PoF.  Consider yourself lucky.<br />
Because soloing is so much fun?  I've soloed, sometimes, I enjoy it.  But as a rule, grouping is what it's all about and you can't touch the exp, loot and fun solo that you can when you group.<br />
<br />
It is whinning when your complaining about Hard LDON and Teir 3 zones as a problem.  These aren't problems upper level shamans are concerned about at this time.  Many of the problems center around GoD.<br />
It's a problem when many other classes fill a role better than you do and although you walk in as the best slower, your slows don't last long enough to really make a noticable difference.  While I still have tons of other abilities, I'm not strong enough in those roles that I can reasonably fill to really stand out and earn my spot.<br />
<br />
Read the red text the first time, ignored it the second.  You still haven't addressed the questions I brought up the first time I saw it, I figure it's because it shows the lack of depth of your position.<br />
<br />
I appologise for taking so long to post a reply, I don't post on weekends much and I wanted to get out of work early on Friday so I could see my wife.<br />
<br />
To my fellow shaman, I'm not trying to drag this out, but I am tired of a couple of shaman trying to weaken the class as a whole.  I think the origional question on soloing Gor has been answered though (it's been done, but other classes do it with more ease).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because I do have a necro that is 60th level I can tell you the same thing I told you above that ONLY the Leech and splurt line have their resists modified.  Saryn's kiss is part of the Leech line of spells.  Saryn's kiss is a HUGELY expensive Drain life dot.  Ever since May of 1999 Necro drain life spells have be close to unresistable.  Your complaining about something that had its roots in place even before the Kunark expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) cool, glad to see we agree, that wasn't apparent from your earlier posts including your assessment of shaman as a powerhouse class.<br />
<br />
I still think we are a powerhouse class. And...<br />
GoD trials and encouters JUST need to be tweeked.  Nothing else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup, but the difference isn't enough to make a difference.  Most shaman only see the Q upgrade, hey, I'll take it, but the Q upgrade won't likely make enough of a difference to make a shaman a possible main healer in ideal group situations for GoD like a shaman can do in LDoN hard and teir 3.  In short, the ante has been upped and both druids and especially shaman lost out.<br />
<br />
A. You admitted you haven't been playing long enough to see these recent heal changes.<br />
<br />
B.  Q was not the only shaman heal that was upgraded.  Breath and a new direct heal was given to shamans.<br />
<br />
C.  Shamans definately did not in any respects lose out, they gained more healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not just GoD, although from what so many shamans say it's just more evident there.<br />
<br />
A.  Shamans are no where near a 3rd string because they can infact replace clerics in LDON normal and teir 3 exp groups and far more places.  <br />
<br />
B.  Shamans can possibly replace enchanters and bsts.  Providing haste, CC, slow, damage and healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
One would expect shaman to kick ass in long term crawls with heals due to our mana regen, but looking at chart 1 where shaman actually do shine slightly (it's a calculated 4 hour crawl with projected heal capacity based on mana regen, no down time) we barely squeak ahead of druids <br />
<br />
<br />
Not true.  As stated slow was not figured in.  If the mob is slowable or even migated slowable then shamans do shine over druids in long term healing.  (of course depending on the DPS of the mob.  But this too effects druids especally if the mob is not slowed)<br />
<br />
<br />
  Any situation where there is an acceptable low HPS (in short a role where a cleric isn't required), where the action is fast, there are no breaks, and especially where slows are more potent (charts are not designed for incorporating slow) we should even compete with clerics for the MH role.<br />
<br />
For low HP, like a GoD mob encounter, where a cleric is really necessary due to the DPS the mob.  Low HP is not always a factor.  Sorry but this is flawed a theory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I quit 2-3 months ago, and I had been in teir 3 for over a year and had been doing LDoN hard since it was still in BETA.  The logs I had before uninstalling EQ were typical of my personal experience, but not good for applied analysis for demonstrating weakness in the class versus the content.  No controls, random variations out the backside, insufficient sample sizes, but night after night the same basic inadaquacies re-appeared.<br />
<br />
If you quit 3 months ago.  <br />
<br />
Then, at this point you are agreeing to what shamans are saying about GoD without experiencing it.  <br />
<br />
In fact your jumping on the band wagon, complaining about somethings that you haven't even experienced.  <br />
<br />
(Thou there is some concerns to the trials and encounters in GoD.)  <br />
<br />
I am serverly pissed that without experiencing it for yourself your just agreeing.<br />
<br />
(As for LDON, there has been some updates since you left that have made even Hard Collection LDON dungeons a breeze to complete.)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
A. A cleric can be replaced by a shaman in some Teir 3 areas.  Allowing a shaman to take the healing role, hasting role, slowing role, CC (with VP) allows for more fast DPS classes to be added to the group.   <br />
<br />
B. This was not bait.  You said you could solo there but have problems grouping there.  If you feel horrible about the fact you had 2 clerics outside your group helping you well maybe you had a bit of over kill ingeneral.  Infact maybe other class there also felt useless.  Such as the clerics (thou they were bots).  <br />
<br />
When a class is reduce to being a bot that hurts.  <br />
<br />
<br />
LR5 and VP.  I retired with over 110 AA.<br />
<br />
ID5 is good to have too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess what there is a difference. :)<br />
<br />
[quote]<br />
Still, in LDoN, the group was still high DPS and every night I could see where at least 2 other classes could have filled my spot better, and would have if I wasn't with friends. <br />
<br />
You fail to see that a lot of classes can replace other classes in differenct scenarios.  AKA an Enchanter instead of BST.  Where the Enchanter is doing far more DPS, better CC, haste and slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
You still haven't addressed the questions I brought up the first time I saw it, I figure it's because it shows the lack of depth of your position.<br />
<br />
I have answered a lot of your questions.  As much as I could.<br />
<br />
But when your answers to my questions start to look like the following:<br />
<br />
a. You quit EQ 3 months ago.<br />
<br />
b. Your not Time or Elemental geared.  So you don't know what the elemental planes or Time is like.<br />
<br />
c. You have issues with Hard LDON dungeons.<br />
<br />
d. You have grouping issues in Teir 3 planes.<br />
<br />
e. You have not experienced the heal upgrades for yourself.<br />
<br />
f.  You have no experience with GoD at this time.<br />
<br />

Saryn's kiss is part of the Leech line of spells.  Saryn's kiss is a HUGELY expensive Drain life dot.  Ever since May of 1999 Necro drain life spells have be close to unresistable.  Your complaining about something that had its roots in place even before the Kunark expansion.<br />
All those listed spells had resist modifiers while you say only leech and spurt do.  Even Horror (the LDoN lvl 64 necro DoT) has a -30 resist mod on it.  I'm not complaining, I'm stating a fact.  Necros are the DoT masters.  I also later in my previous post indicate that it really doesn't matter anyway, because DoTs are really only applicable in a few raids and for soloing.<br />
<br />
I still think we are a powerhouse class. And...<br />
GoD trials and encouters JUST need to be tweeked.  Nothing else.<br />
Fine.  You're entitled to your opinion, but your wrong.  Shaman are a solid class, but need to be retuned for all content from post-pop mitigation changes.  Same issues, just it's so glaringly obvious in GoD that it often times can't be glossed over with equipment.  You shouldn't and don't need time gear to do LDoN hard, but it certainly makes it easier and more doable with less conventional party compositions.<br />
<br />
A. You admitted you haven't been playing long enough to see these recent heal changes.<br />
No, I haven't seen the changes as I quit within a week of the release of GoD.  I had not recieved any GoD spells before I quit, but they would not have done much for me and the issues I was experiencing (IE: lack of a needed and valuable role).<br />
<br />
B.  Q was not the only shaman heal that was upgraded.  Breath and a new direct heal was given to shamans.<br />
No kidding, how many shaman have these spells?  I was refering anyway to the situation I was facing, one without Breath or the new direct heal.  Your comment as you so often say is moot.<br />
<br />
C.  Shamans definately did not in any respects lose out, they gained more healing.<br />
Sure, in the upgrade, but not in the GoD expansion which is what I was refering to.  The difference between druid heals and shaman heals was brought to a percentage difference that was established well before PoP (prior to the upgrade it was lower than this archaic standard), yet this percentage standard was not modified with the introduction of slow mitigation which limits our effectiveness as healer.<br />
<br />
A.  Shamans are no where near a 3rd string because they can infact replace clerics in LDON normal and teir 3 exp groups and far more places.  <br />
But like we've both said, LDoN normal is trivial content, so is much in Teir 3 (although, more of a challenge to me personally as my regular group loved pulling multiples).  I've grouped with a paladin in an LDoN normal who played main healer.  If the DPS of the mobs is low, anyone can heal, it means nothing.  In fact, in some LDoN normal groups, a necro is more desired than a cleric.<br />
<br />
B.  Shamans can possibly replace enchanters and bsts.  Providing haste, CC, slow, damage and healing.<br />
Would depend on what is needed, but generally, if one of those requirements is more evident, many more classes can fill that role better than we can.  In more unconventional groups there might be a role in multitasking as we play a diverse class, but in past expansions our multitasking was usually more notable, while these days more abilities have been distributed across more classes.  In almost every tier 3 and LDoN hard group I've ever been in, a BST would have been a better choice because my groupmates focused on DPS.<br />
<br />
Not true.  As stated slow was not figured in.  If the mob is slowable or even migated slowable then shamans do shine over druids in long term healing.  (of course depending on the DPS of the mob.  But this too effects druids especally if the mob is not slowed)<br />
I recognise what your saying here, but the first chart shows low HPS (heal per second) and anywhere where a druid can get away with this kind of healing, so can a shaman get by without slowing.  One would assume this content is older content and that mobs die reasonably quickly, thus limiting the value of slow.  In the quote you offered I was refering that without slow, we should really shine due to superior mana regen.  With slow, where it is usefull, we should stand out more so, this being situational due to mob DPS (influenced my mob slow mitigation).<br />
<br />
Basically, the perception of power our class holds is based around our slow and mana regen.  IF these two factors play out to full effect in a group EXP situation, we SHOULD own every other priest class in the same way a cleric should own shaman and druids in burst HPS (heal per second).<br />
<br />
For low HP, like a GoD mob encounter, where a cleric is really necessary due to the DPS the mob.  Low HP is not always a factor.  Sorry but this is flawed a theory.<br />
That was HPS (heal per second) not HPs (pluralised hit points).  No wonder you didn't understand my point and I appologise for the miscommunication.  Please re-read my previous response when time permits.<br />
<br />
If you quit 3 months ago.  <br />
<br />
Then, at this point you are agreeing to what shamans are saying about GoD without experiencing it.  <br />
<br />
In fact your jumping on the band wagon, complaining about somethings that you haven't even experienced.  <br />
<br />
(Thou there is some concerns to the trials and encounters in GoD.)<br />
If we both agree that there are problems, I don't see why you're pissed that I can see the logic other shaman have posted from my experiences and my understanding that 5 years of playing EQ had brought.  It's the same band wagon you're on.<br />
<br />
I am serverly pissed that without experiencing it for yourself your just agreeing.<br />
Honestly, I could care less, but I'm not sure how.  See my above response.<br />
<br />
(As for LDON, there has been some updates since you left that have made even Hard Collection LDON dungeons a breeze to complete.)<br />
If you are refering to the &quot;fix&quot; of the collection issues (numbers below X, X being the 20 something value I forgot since I quit) that made the distribution of collection items more available even with smaller collections, saw that, always thought it was cheesy.<br />
<br />
A. A cleric can be replaced by a shaman in some Teir 3 areas.  Allowing a shaman to take the healing role, hasting role, slowing role, CC (with VP) allows for more fast DPS classes to be added to the group.   <br />
True, but if I played MH (did it twice when no one felt like botting the cleric and once when we had a second shaman), then I wasn't able to do much else than root in teir 3.  If limited to a specific role, it's better to have the masters of that role than the jack of all trades.  Yes, I could fill out a role in a pinch, but the cleric was a better choice because a well played cleric would also add nukes and stuns, which I could not due to my small heal and constant canning.<br />
<br />
B. This was not bait.  You said you could solo there but have problems grouping there.  If you feel horrible about the fact you had 2 clerics outside your group helping you well maybe you had a bit of over kill ingeneral.  Infact maybe other class there also felt useless.  Such as the clerics (thou they were bots).  <br />
1 cleric outside the group, the ranger or SK would 2 box it.  <br />
<br />
It wasn't problems finding a group, I had a regular group.  It was a problem justifying my spot when other classes could fill it better.<br />
<br />
I don't think the necro and chanter felt useless adding over 500DPS each, Don't think the SK puller was feeling useless, don't think the ranger was either with his AM3/EQ and using the invulnerability disc and BU root to add CC on pulls larger than 4 mobs at a time or when both he and the SK would pull (hell, sometimes as many as 3 of us would be pulling at at time, I'd pull if I was bored).  I was the only class not contributing over 100 DPS (mobs died too fast for DoT stacking, so I nuked), I'd drop an ocaisional pet heal, CC a pet that escaped charm if FD or mez failed or the necro/chanter was interupted.  It was a pretty unremarkable role.<br />
<br />
When a class is reduce to being a bot that hurts.  <br />
Yup, offered my guild my char when I quit, no one wanted it as we already had a shaman bot.<br />
<br />
Guess what there is a difference. :)<br />
Ok, before all the veins in my eyes implode from that statement, do you mean that even a fraction of a percentage of difference from a secondary ability of one class (chanter in this case) is enough to justify choosing the master of that class (shaman) when that master's secondary abilities are significantly inferior to the secondary character's role?  OR, do you mean that a fraction of a difference is significant?  In either case, I'd have to call you delusional.  If it was just sarcasm, then you've done a fine job of sumarising the situation.<br />
<br />
You fail to see that a lot of classes can replace other classes in differenct scenarios.  AKA an Enchanter instead of BST.  Where the Enchanter is doing far more DPS, better CC, haste and slow.<br />
Nope, I see that, but when you take a spot and demolish some content, but you realise that everyone there could have done better almost every night with another class replacing me (assuming that class was played as well as I played my shaman), it's demoralising.<br />
<br />
I have answered a lot of your questions.  As much as I could.<br />
Still haven't responded to my first reply to your red text and you've got some info wrong (ie: name, some of the issues ...), and you've been more selective in what you respond to than I have.<br />
<br />
But when your answers to my questions start to look like the following:<br />
<br />
a. You quit EQ 3 months ago.<br />
and ... so?  I quit for several reasons, one was I was pissed about my class being less and less needed.  The other reasons are irrelevant so I will refrain from listing them.<br />
<br />
b. Your not Time or Elemental geared.  So you don't know what the elemental planes or Time is like.<br />
/yawn  So, does this make my observations on my experiences and how it relates to what other shaman have proved in their posts any less real, no.  My question is with elemental gear, how can you call the class balanced in some older content that you describe as trivial when you admit you can't fill an MH role?<br />
<br />
c. You have issues with Hard LDON dungeons.<br />
LOL! My issue is that my group can't pull singles from a crowd.  The issue would vanish if we swapped out some classes, including mine.  Me for a chanter and the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
d. You have grouping issues in Teir 3 planes.<br />
Again ... I had a regular group.  Getting a group wasn't a problem, finding a role in a high burst DPS group was a problem so I played safety net for charm classes.  Read before you respond.<br />
<br />
e. You have not experienced the heal upgrades for yourself.<br />
Have the upgrades changed your ability to heal at all in GoD trials?  If the cleric goes down, can you pick up where they left off untill they get back?  Do these changes alter your ability to assume a heal role in any other pop or post-pop content?  I don't think so, the changes were not all that dramatic.<br />
<br />
f.  You have no experience with GoD at this time.<br />
I find this hilarious.  We agree on GoD, but you want to discredit my opinion on it.  When sitting in a tree, never hack off the limb your sitting on from the wrong side.<br />
<br />
Tell me what am I suppose to think of all of this????<br />
I don't care.  What I do care about is that you refuse to be objective in that changing content (post-pop mitigation and the resulting change in encounters, more evident, apparently, in GoD) is dictating the group usefullness of the shaman class.  I care that this type of oblivious attitude weakens the class because it sends a mixxed message to SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Tarthug,<br />
<br />
I will be honest, I did not read your above post.  Besides its getting to the point where many other tangent subjects could occur.<br />
<br />
The fact is you quit the game 2 to 3 months ago.<br />
<br />
You haven't seen some LDON adventure changes or healing changes.<br />
<br />
Twice you have brought up spells that you don't know what line their from within the necro spell book.<br />
<br />
You haven't experienced GoD at all.<br />
<br />
You haven't experience any other upper zones beyond Teir 3.<br />
<br />
At this point, your blindly agreeing without experience, (infact you go as far to justify it by saying you can at best relate the feelings of other upper lvl/geared shamans from old game content)....:(<br />
<br />
On top of all that, I am not altogether sure you know what your agreeing about with other upper level/geared shamans... <br />
other than.... <br />
you are....  <br />
just...<br />
<br />
Agreeing<br />
<br />
<br />
(maybe you, yourself, are a perfect example of what the devs need to see.  In order to get the broad range of the different types of gamers that are currently complaining.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>soldieint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">No idea if the new pvp changed Sony working on, is going to have a effect on our dots pve wise aswell or at all. <br />
If they whant to upgrade shm pvp wise, they will need to make our dots lure or give them a 200 resist check. In that case, they should allso work pve wise and maybee then we can land our dots on old Kunark dragons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Tarthug,<br />

That's the response I expected.  If you read more shaman posts, you might realise that the class has been gradually eroded before GoD.  I have yet to see a solid reason posted by you that shows our class to be a &quot;powerhouse&quot;.  I believe it's because you can't.</div></div><hr />
