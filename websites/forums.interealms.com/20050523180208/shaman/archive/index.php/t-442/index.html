<br />
Just thought I would stop by and introduce myself.  Finally after three years of playing EverQuest, I decided to satisify my urge and start a Shaman.  Created him a few days ago.  Currently he is lvl 16 Troll Shaman, Innorruk worshipper, on the Seventh Hammer Server.  Name is Groxb.<br />
<br />
My main is a fifty-five Cleric, and I have played many of the other classes in the fifty range, so I have a very well understanding of the game.  I have always been in awe about shamans.  The fact their slow is extremely good, excellent DoTs, pets, buffs, cannibilize, etc.  When a Shaman joins a group, everything in general is easier.  I have really went all out on twinking my new character (Fungi Tunic, Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, etc), but make no mistake, I'll still love him.  Anyhow, just wanted to stop by and say hi to everyone.  This place has always been a great place to read and I look forward to adding my own input as I grow into my character.  Stay well all!<br />
