<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssabre Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have saved up some plat and have enough to purchase a Ceremonial Iksar BP. . .Now my current BP is a Seb scale coat.  My question is, is the 5HP per tick CIC regen &gt; AC and wis on Seb coat?<br />
<br />
Should I blow my plat on the CIC or say, grab another Dragonhorn Bracer?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">as u are close to 54 and canni 3  i would sugest that u swop your wis gear fro ac hp stuff.  Unless u have a criend who is a enc, havent u noticed when soloing that u cant get ur mana bar past 50%?  Therefore why have 200 wis when its no use to u ?<br />
<br />
Get 2 ac 6  65 hp rings.  Get a goranga idol for range slot (cheap) or perhaps try for a Idol of the thorned if u got the shinies.<br />
<br />
I dunno what your play style is, but i get the feeling ur used to folk makinfg u do lots of healing?<br />
<br />
Personally i think the regen bp is way over priced, much better to get a bp with 28+ ac and sta/wis.  The polished tin mail shirt from poi is reasonable item.  Can u wear the engraved velium bp ??<br />
<br />
If ur poor  try a  4hr pp farming session killing the guards in hhk</div></div><hr />

Regen, yes! See how a regen BP improves your life, if it turns out you don't think much of it you could always sell it on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks you two. . .appreciate the input. . .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had a regen bp up until I got regrowth.  I found that the 5hp/tic didn't make a big difference for me when I was getting nailed for 100+.   I have found a horse to make a bigger difference for me personally.  I would try out the regen bp to see if you like it, and like was said earlier if you don't really like it you could always sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my suggestion would be to forget about the regen BP and grab something like a barbed ringmail, half the price and double as effective (or an engraved royal velium BP, should be an even trade for the regen BP).  At 51 you are probably camping ice giants, or JPF gnolls.  Those hit hard enough that you want to get your AC up asap.  If you can get to 1000 AC self buffed and have about 150 wis you should start looking in getting more wis or HP items again.</div></div><hr />
