<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I am confused.  (Apparently like most of the rest of the server populations).  I'm hoping a few of you guys can offer some further insight.<br />
<br />
Once you get to Kodtaz, there are 3 more single group trials (Trials 7-9) and 3 raid trials (Raid Trials 1-3).<br />
<br />
After (and I think ONLY after) you complete Trials 7-9 you get a quest to make the Icon of the Altar, right?  (Btw, can anyone confirm that you have to complete Trials 7-9 before making the icon?  I haven't heard)<br />
<br />
When you make the icon of the altar, it opens up a 4th raid trial.  Thanks to that rewind bug, we didn't finish this trial, and haven't had time to complete it yet.<br />
<br />
Anyway . . . what next?  Do you get some kind of item or flag out of the 4th raid trial that tells you where to go?  Does everyone in the guild need to complete all of the Icon of the Altar quest?  I know that everyone can go on Kodtaz spawned raids if only 1 person has the Icon, but has there been any confirmation that the whole guild needs to complete it?<br />
<br />
Are we then stuck in the hell that is Uqua?<br />
<br />
So far, I've got to say that GoD is really sucking.  Ridiculously difficult trials (which isn't so bad) that almost require a certain group make up (which is bad), piss-poor lore offering guidance on what to do next (they probably haven't finished coding next zone), etc.  They DESPERATELY need a raid alternative to flagging, because it SUCKS for certain classes who have to repeat trials like 10 times, and also for the classes who feel they have to be carried through the trials because of poor design (like us shaman!).<br />
<br />
We've had six people from our guild retire in the last week because they hate the expansion.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you are stuck in Uqua after you're done with the quest in Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wulf, can you confirm if everyone needs to complete all trials and make the icon of the altar?  Or just maybe 4-5 officers or something.<br />
<br />
I hate to subject my whole guild to that crap if only a few need to complete everything for the guild to advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've heard that EVERYONE needs it Chutoi.  /sigh<br />
<br />
And we've lost a ton too.  This expansion is killing guilds.<br />
<br />
Grats Sony!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You only need one person to do the quest (eventually including the icon) to be able to start up ikkinz raids.  No one is sure if eventually everyone needs to make them.<br />
<br />
Everything starts with Tublik near the Yxxta zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You only need 1 person to do the 3 1 group trials and quest.<br />
Same with the stones for the 4 ikkinz raid/trials, everyone needs to have done the trials for Uqua but they dont need to have finished the quest with the 4 stones. At least I havent done the quest and i've been to uqua... just the expedition creator needs the quests completed I believe.</div></div><hr />
