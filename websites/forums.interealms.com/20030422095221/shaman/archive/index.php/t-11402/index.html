<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been considering buying a horse for a while, but I haven't been able to find exactly what it does.  I understand that on a hrose you med as long as you aren't moving or fighting, but does fighting mean that you are in auto attack or does it mean that a mob is attacking you?  On a horse can you just stand there and get hit, and still get the horse med effect.  Second, do you med through spells on a horse?  For example, do you med through canna casts, med through JBB usage, both or neither?<br />

I am not 100% certain of these answers but will do my best to answer them. <br />
<br />
You med on a horse as long as you do not have auto attack on. If a mob is attacking you and you don't have auto attack on, you get the med. So yes you can just stand there and get hit and get the med effect. <br />
<br />
I am not to certain about the med through casting. I &quot;think&quot; you do. I sit on my horse and chain cast JBB but I never really thought about that before. Anyone have an answer for this?<br />
<br />
Besides the med effect I really like that I don't get sit agro while on a horse. Makes it easier to flip through that spell book to quickly mem a new dot or nuke. Before horses I would have to sit down to do that, which usually drew agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You med as long as you are not moving and dont have auto attack on.  So if you like to swing your weapon inbetween jbb casts you lose that.  <br />
<br />
Another benifit is you can swap spells out on the run.  That can be very usefull when you get suprised.  If you get hit spell book closes.  I also used to close my spell book by standing up.  This doesnt work so you have to click close or use escape to close it and lose your target.</div></div><hr />
