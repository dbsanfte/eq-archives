Have you heard about the bank system in EQ2? Banks dont share your items so you have to drag your items across Norrath to put them in another city's bank.  A merchant cant really defend themselves sooo they will need to hire player mercenaries to protect them as their caravan crosses the lands. thus there will be openings for player mercenaries, and maybe verant will make some npc mercenaries but they will probably be rather weak.<br />
(p.s. im not making up the fact that you can rent wagons etc.to make a caravan. ooooh yea.)</div></div><hr />
