<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have been working on getting all of my trade skills up and am starting to look more and more at  tailoring. I am currently at 82<br />
<br />
I just want to brain storm some here and get ya'll  input on what I'm thinking. <br />
<br />
Ok the next step could be working on quivers which  can trivial at 115. The main problem with this is  getting HQ cat pets. I have been keeping an eye on the vendors in wc and ec and have not been able to find to many. I think there is a rush on people getting tailoring up so these are now in demand. Plus the fact I don't have tracking so seeing a cat running around to kill is not as fast as it could be.<br />
<br />
So I was thinking of exping in velks and just keeping hold of all the stackable crystalin silks I could get and make silk swatches out of them. I have about 30 swatches atm.<br />
<br />
These items trivial at<br />
<br />
gorget, sash 102<br />
mask, wristband 108<br />
cap, slippers 115<br />
cloak 103-109<br />
mantle 118<br />
sleeves, gloves 124<br />
leggings 128<br />
tunic 131<br />
<br />
But in my research I found an idea for non-trackers as these are static pops.<br />
<br />
I have NO clue of the reprecussions for me so need to ask. and these trivial on all pieces &gt;250 so would be good to practice to get upto 200<br />

othmir fur cap <br />
<br />
(2 othmir furs, silver thread, cap pattern, vial of clear mana)<br />
AC 3, DEX 3, WIS 6, AGI 2, HP 7, sv cold 4, wt 0.4, ALL/ALL<br />
<br />
othmir fur moccasins<br />
<br />
(3 othmir furs, silver thread, boot pattern, vial of clear mana)<br />
AC 4, DEX 3, CHA 3, AGI 3, HP 20, mana 5, sv cold 10, wt 0.8, ALL/ALL<br />
<br />
othmir fur cloak<br />
<br />
(4 othmir furs, silver thread, cloak pattern, vial of clear mana)<br />
AC 6, STA 6, CHA 2, WIS 4, mana 5, sv disease 4,  sv magic 2, wt 1.6, ALL/ALL<br />
<br />
Ok I know the silver thread can by purchased in thrug as well as the patterns. I can make clear mana using a poison vial and I THINK an emerald will have to check that. so all the parts will cost no more than 15 or 16pp a try <br />
<br />
Now for the question I think the othmir are those little otter things on the beach otw to SG. If they are how tough of a camp is this? Is this a faction that will hurt me BAD if I kill it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boogahz Dokupuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The faction can be raised by killing the Ulthork and the Walruses I believe.  I had personally hoped to kill enough of those to get in even better with the Othmir in order to test out the faction hits as well, but I have not had the time to do so yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mish,<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing tough about othmir would be breaking the camp, and the only faction hit is with the Othmir.  I don't know of any quests, etc this would block you from, other than the Ulthork tusk quest in EW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I fought the Othmirs for 2 weeks straight. Not too long after people started venturing out that far in Velious I went to CS. Everyone was killing the drakes and using the Othmirs for merchants. Me, being the evil necro that I am decided to slaughter a few of these furry little guys. First kill I got a piece of Crustacean shell armor, was suprised cause I didn't know what they dropped. Spent the next week and farmed a full suit of crusty(on Tankage) and then some. Great exp at the time too. Now for the bad part. I died more there than anywhere else. They are a total pain in the ass to single pull. I found a perfect spot at the end of the beach to single from but there are wanders that go up and down the beach that will agro you when you become KOS or if you are fighting one at the time they pass by. There are Warrior and Shaman class Othmirs. They haste and SoW each other. So they will out run you and beat you down if they get hold of you. Hit for around 120 a pop very fast. Level range is mid to high 40s. I am guessing about 6 to 8k HP's. They severely nerfed the Crusty armor drop, I went a few months ago with a friend to get some and we got 1 piece in a few hours also which he died 3 times and me 1. Let me know if you want to try them, I would be happy to go along and try them again. Hope this helps some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khallim Khallash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What I did to tailor past Cured Silk, to get to where I am (121) and what I plan to do myself:<br />
<br />
1) Get a friend or 2, at least someone to talk to, mabey PL, and go to CC and camp every spider there is.  You can get some decent loot int he Queen room there and mabey even make a profit in all.  The most important thing is the silk though..  make swatches like no tommorow.  Turn the swatches into caps or mantles when you're in the city and sell them back to a merchant (they're worth about 5g each).  I went right up to 118 with mantles.<br />
<br />
2) used the rest of the silks I had that day I hit 118 to try and make some tunics..  only got 1 skill up I think (didn't have any other use for the silk by then though).<br />
<br />
3) Go back to Upper Guk/wherever you get Spider Silks and start camping them again.  Going to need lots to make Wu's Fighting Caps and Shoulders.  Make them till they trivial out, then switch to the more silk-intensive tunics.  They trivial at 158 I think.<br />
<br />
4) past then, pretty much anything's game.  Everything else is super-expensive, super-risky, and &gt;250 trivial.  I myself am going to do Artic Wyvren Hide armor (when I solo, the wyvrens in CS are what I kill, so getting some free hides.. plus I think the Wyvren Hide armor only needs Cod Oil or some easy-to-get brewing component).  I wouldn't go out of my way to do any of the Velious Fur/Ice Silk tailroing myself just for skill..  mabey if I got aggro'd and got a lucky drop &lt;shrug&gt; (Plus, the Orthmir have a bunch of good quest for pple friendly to 'em).  Either way you go at this point, past 158 you generally seem to be screwed :(<br />
<br />
Hope this helps give you an idea of what its like!</div></div><hr />
