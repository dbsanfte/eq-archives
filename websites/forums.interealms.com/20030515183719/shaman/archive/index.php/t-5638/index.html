<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">UP is an awesome solo spot for level 60 shamans with torpor.  I also have horse, JBB, Epic, and decent gear (1850hp 1025ac 202wis unbuffed).  No special AAs, just run3, regen3, and MC3 so far.  Each mob is about level 55-58, the 58 ones enrage, and have about 20-25khp and double for 191-199 depending on level.  They are easy to slow, and each fight need 1 reslow for me.  I have gotten about 1y in 45 minutes if I try hard.  Usually no downtime and 2-4% a kill.  Mobs here all summon as well.<br />
<br />
I summon a pet, focus, and regen myself, and haste pet.  I use my horse when tanking the mob too.  I pull with slow, and keep pox and epic on the mob the whole fight, while pet chews away and I JBB.  I torpor when at about 60% hp left, and have never died due to it not landing in time.<br />
<br />
I usually pull Moktors, or the rare DA or netherbian when I see them.  Moktors are easy mobs, easy to slow, no need to malosini, and easily baned/poxed.  DAs and Netherbians are easy, but are immune to Poison and Disease to make it a bit longer of a fight.  DAs also BS, and proc darkness which is a snare/dot.  Pulls are very easy and I barely get 2.  Pathing is a bit bad in the tunnel near entrance, which is where I pull to.  You need to walk the mob back to your pet, otherwise it will turn around and run away.  This helps when you pull 2.<br />
<br />
There are a few named here, I have soloed A Gantru Raldukan.  He is easier than normal moktors IMO, as he has about 32khp or so and doubles for only 142.  He has dropped the Gantru Charm twice (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8964) and the Helm of Raldukan once (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8985) Some decent cash gems also drop here, which sell for 10-15pp.<br />
<br />
This is some of the easiest, most fun, and best exp U have ever gotten.  Please add any info I missed, or ask questions about here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I soloed 3 mobs here today.  One moktor and one sohiljan and one horse dog looking thing.  I used pet epic and jbb kept rest of mana to torpor and cannie, and throw in a bane on ocassions.  I personally feel the exp is not worth the time.  But the horse dog looking thing did give half a blue in level 60 exp.  But all fights took pretty long.  Maybe i should dot more and regain mana after fight.  1020 ac and bout 2400 hps buffed.  Moktors hit up to 200 and the horse dog thing hit near 170.  Lotsa hps on both.  But it is kinda more fun then fungus shrooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have found that the shaman mobs are not worth the time.  The Shojens Turgur, bane, and use the rain spells which are very lethal to a solo shaman.  When I solo here, I keep pox and epic up, and with horse end with over 80m most of the time.  They are a bit over 5 minute fights as well, but are well worth the exp they give.  The exp % I gave was in level 60 AAEXP.</div></div><hr />

Hello all I have to say I have been soloing here for the fun not really the xp.  Been practicing on these mobs near the zoneline....<br />
Here is what I learned.... <br />
I think for one I am a more of an average shaman not being to uber in gear.  I pulled one of each mob in the zone that con blue and think that to make it worth your time the moktars really are the only things to solo here.  The DA and other mobs like to interupt often.  I would have to torpor at 60 health to ENSURE it landed so I would not die and really had to do that constantly to live.  I could not even cast a dot cause I would end the fight usually OOM even using cana.   I would have to say drops aren't even worth the fight because they take so long.  Some nice spells can drop though.  On average though out of the 7 mobs I killed only 2 dropped something.  The fights are fun for the challenge and you have to be careful pulling out there.   I do think that using JBB and epic still takes way to long.  Also experienced being right in front of the mobs and then being summoned, than not being able to target em grrr.   Oh well that is my two cents.  Oh yeah and I would not attempt this without Aego if you are new to soloing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maximuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Umbral is uber great exp for shaman soloing ... but you need to know range lvl of mob is 53 to 57 ... fighting a lvl 53 is a litlle more esay then a 57, but it s the same technic and about the same time to fight a lvl 53, 54 then a 56 or 57.<br />
<br />
But the problem, when you want make uber exp, is to fight only 55+ ... look, a lvl 51 give 175567, lvl 52 give 182520, 53 give 189607, 54 give 196830, 55 give 398165 and 56 give 440293.<br />
<br />
You see the differance ? 54 give less then half of a  55... at about 4000 point of exp.<br />
<br />
I made the test with 3 DA, (btw DA always 55) i made like 8% exp solo fighting 3 mob ! I tested with random mob at zone line and it s not always the same exp gain ... sometime fighting 3 mob give me 7 or 8% and fighting 3 other give me less then 4% ... but it s always the same with a DA.<br />
<br />
For me to make a good exp, you need to be sure to fight 55+ but 53 and 57 are blue for me ) ... only way for me to make sure is fighting DA. DA slowable but uber resist on Dot spell (bane and pox) so i use Pet+spear+bracer.<br />
<br />
I was also looking to fight guardien near VT zone ... but need to duo or Trio for that, they have a lot of HP and can t be soloed or to long fight ... someone told me they are always 58 ! ... <br />
<br />
PS : i am french and i have bad english i hope you understand me.</div></div><hr />
