<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is looking to knock this guy off but we really aren't that sure what the method is to get him to a manageable state as he summons and does all that nasty stuff.<br />
<br />
Anyone has done him give a few pointers?<br />
<br />
We are just in the data collecting stages you know before we do something dumb and zergling rush his ass or something.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Summoning is the least of your problems. His mana drain which overwrites KEI is kind of a bigger problem. Also his knockback kinda sucks too. Basically put the MT with his back to the gate, keep the gate closed, and kill him with normal tactics if you have the DPS. If your DPS is low, then try and have two cleric rotations and leave the 2nd rotation outside until the first rotation has no mana left from the manadrain. If your DPS is high you will kill him before the clerics run out of mana. Oh yeah, make sure everyone has levitation, the floor is ice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If the fight is still the same it used to be during the Velious era, you should be able to keep KEI if you keep up a charisma buff above it. <br />
The AE mana drain DoT will then overwrite charisma leaving KEI.<br />
<br />
You will just have to refresh charisma when the DoT drops, before he AE's again so it will go into the charisma slot again. Remember, whichever buff(charisma or KEI) will be higher(i.e. be above the other)will be canceled out by the DoT.<br />
<br />
Horse and new mana buffs should provide enough mana regen to keep up with his damage easily. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you lev the casters you can park them to the side of the ramp behind the platform wall and avoid the ae, just have some bored pally call them in after each proc. Knockback is the only thing that can really b0rk the scrap, so see above. Other than AE, he's a pure melee mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If this level 37 is your main, you will be pointless at the fight.  Most of your guild needs to be mid 50s at least to take him out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To counter his knockback, make sure your MT has good aggro. Barring good weapons, your MT can just unload 500 arrows into him while everyone is buffing up. He STILL is leashed, right?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AE goes off every 2 minutes.  Run out and avoid it.  You'll only have to do that 2-3 times until Yelinak is dead, or you are.<br />
<br />
To deal with knockback, have 2 main tanks, and be ready to use either depending on the proc.<br />
<br />
Clerics just have to suck up the AE though.</div></div><hr />
