<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is small, we are about 3 groups total when everyone is online. We raid together about twice a week, and do some pretty neat things with 2-3 groups. We are almost all level 65.<br />
<br />
I just scribed my last Planes of Power spell (which happened to be Malos) yesterday. I now have a complete 61-65 spellbook. I bought only one spell from each type (ethereal/spectral/rune), after collecting the rest from parchment drops.<br />
<br />
We are now keyed for Valor, Storms, Crypt of Decay, Bastion of Thunder, Halls of Honor, Lair of Terris, Torment, and Tactics. We did not use the large 75-100 person raiding methods to acquire access to any of these zones. In all cases we used the single group alternate entry quests to reach zones.<br />
<br />
There is really nothing else for us to do, uness we want to start all over with Grummus and Behemoth and 75+ random other people (we don't want to do that).<br />
<br />
We are not interested in chasing the plane of time. For that matter, we skipped vex thal, sleepers, and veeshan's peak too. Let's just say we have a low tolerance for huge slow moving raids, repetive farming of non-exp zones, and racing for highly contested content. We won't ever see the elemental planes - no problem.<br />
<br />
The only thing that bugs me is that there is one Tier 3 zone that we can't enter. Tower of Solusek Ro. Why not? There ought to be an alternate entry quest for Sol Ro Tower involving drops from Tactics, Torment, and a few other tier 2/3 zones. I don't want access to fight Sol Ro himself, just access to exp in the zone. We would love to try the minibosses there with our 3 groups (for loot and fun).<br />
<br />
So ....... ummmmm .... we finished the expansion ... I guess.<br />
<br />
Here is to hoping that the new Hate and Veksar offer us some useful content.</div></div><hr />

The alternate keys do not get you the flags to progress on towards the elemental planes which hold alot of content / gear / mini events as well as the 4 big ones to get into time.<br />
<br />
You will have to go back to step 1 to get the right flags to get into those zones as a guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ximix appears to have answered the question. Alternate entry doesn't let you progress in the &quot;storyline&quot;, therefore they intend the latter. Reason #87653765426354 that PoP sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't think you would make it to far into PoP with traditional zerg tactics.  You could get 500 of your closest friends to rush behemoth with and not live long. :p  It does take more than 30 people to go far in PoP, but it takes good raid coordination to pull off the major encounters.<br />
<br />
It is dissapointing that the target audience for the release of PoP is a minority of the players who pay for EQ and it just might be that there are some unsolved planar key quests out there.  If a key exists to the Elemental planes and beyond, I would expect it to be at least as difficult to find and finish as the regular encounters are that give you access.</div></div><hr />

Wildaar, I remember when 30 was considered a big raid force.  Now, 70 is normal and 30 is considered an exp group apparently.  <br />
<br />
People used to laugh when you did raid mobs with more than 30.</div></div><hr />

Nice of you to show interest: Serenity's Tears (http://pub18.ezboard.com/bskylarkschallenge) <br />
<br />
We do love to group, and a raid for us is often just 2 groups. We target minibosses and take them down with small numbers. We typically do mobs like Derakor the Vindicator, Xanamech/Maenetic Prototypes in PoI, Vhaksiz the Shade in PoN, Glykus Helmir/Diaku Overseer in PoTactics, Banford Paffa in CoD, Tower Bosses in BoT, Ring of Slime in Cazic, etc. with around 12 to 15 people. We are always looking to add new mobs or events to our list of do-able targets. On nights that we raid, we pursue our target mobs just as aggressively as people in large raiding guilds pursue theirs. The small numbers mean that our raids move very fast, and there is lots of loot to go around.<br />
<br />
We actually have a blast doing the things that we do, and have no interest in becoming a 75+ member uber-goober guild. We understand that there is a limit on the class of items we can obtain by staying small, and we are 100% okay with never having elemental armor or vex thal drops. Like I said, we just wish we could add Sol Ro's Tower to the list of Tier 3 zones with minibosses that are on our hit list.<br />
<br />
We basically have reached the &quot;farming&quot; stage for PoP that the uber-goober types have with Vex Thal. That is why I say my guild finished PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Veeshan's Peak key quest is boring, but worth doing.  Check out Alla's for the complete details on it - about half of the parts are simple ground spawns or quests, and the other half are boring camps, with fast PH's.  If you really camp the spawns, one person could do the key in a couple of weeks (unless you're really unlucky).  Then, it's just a matter of killing Trakanon for the teeth (2-5 per kill).<br />
<br />
Once you have it, your guild should be able to do ok in VP.  We've killed Hoshkar (2nd toughest in zone, arguably the toughest) with as low as 24 people, with most around 60.  It's simply a fast damage fight.  And another great thing about VP - a lot of people skip it, so there's probably not a lot of competition.</div></div><hr />

VP on Rodcet Nife probably hasnt been touched twice in the last year. Considering the toys and spells that drop, I am amazed. It could be a private farming ground for any guild that really wanted it. <br />
<br />
Now that I think of it, VP on our server hasn't been touched since the worthless sh*tstains called the MB crew still held Torpor for 150k ransoms. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The fact is, that PoP is all about large guild action.  Verant was finding that the content theat they had before (NToV, Ssra, VP, VT) wasn't challenging large guilds that had raiding down to a science.  Because of that, they had to make a decision:  do we create content for large raids or do we create content that will be gimp for FoH, Afterlife, etc...<br />
<br />
They came down on the side of the large guilds.  To make sure that the large guilds didn't have to &quot;go back&quot; and redo key raids for one or two people, they created the alternate quests.  These quests bypass the main content, in favor of allowing the person to rejoin their friends at the higher level.<br />
<br />
Verant has defined the endgame as large guild raids with difficult fights.  If you define it differently, then they're not creating the content with you in mind.  Larger raids take more discipline, more planning and more time.  If you don't want to grow or aly yourself with other like-minded guilds to create large raids, then you're right, you've gone as far in PoP as you're gonna.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Up to a certain point, yes.  If you're talking about large guilds, alternate quests do not help them with the reflagging issue since the alternate quests allow zone entry but do not allow continued advancement.  <br />
<br />
In your example, if someone missed the MB fight and got a tactics flag through the Diaku quest, that would be great to a certain point.  The person with the flag via quest could still participate in all tactics events (killing TZ, VZ, RZ) but wouldn't be able to progress into the Elemental planes without it.  <br />
<br />
What assisted large guilds was the % rule for raids.  A number of flagged individuals in a raid will allow a small percentage of non flagged members to zone in and join them.  This is a huge help and allows guild members to receive flags out of order.  For instance, I got my Agnarr flag before I got my BoT flag.<br />
<br />
A large guild would still have to go back and reflag eventually.  Someone attempting to zone into the Elemental planes must have every pre-req flag from the Hedge quest to Bertoxx to the ogre trial in HoH.  The percentage rule does not apply to the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like Ximix's type of guild.  It sounds fun and interactive, with good folks and good times.  It's sad that they can't progress further, but that's just about the limit.  Sad because if they did manage to get sol ro tower flags, they'd be able to get VT quality loot with 2-3 group raids. <br />
It's really too bad that they won't be able to get there, unless they join an assload of open raids or form an alliance somehow with a guild that won't mind flagging them for the tuff ones like<br />
1) HOHb<br />
2)CODb<br />
3)MM<br />
4)Bert<br />
<br />
Saryn is pretty easy, I think an open raid could kill her without too much problem if well organized.  <br />
<br />
I'd suggest that their guildies attend as many open raids as possible and get the real flags.  SolRO Tower would be the PERFECT place for them to do small raids for excellent equipment, if only they could get there. <br />
<br />
They were right to skip VT tho.  A small 2-3 group raid doesn't belong there.  Their progression would take days and days, and be unlikely to kill the boss mobs simply because not enuf DPS.</div></div><hr />

A good point, but it also reinforces my position.  PoP was designed with large guilds and large raids in mind.  Refinements that they've added afterwards are still pointed to the same audience.<br />
<br />
They had this idea even before PoP, though.  No matter how good your people are or how well equipped, a small raid (18-24 peeps) won't take out Ssra Emp (until you got to VT and farmed the armor).  Even back in Vellious, a small raid couldn't take out AoW or Lady N in NToV.  With later enhancements, 18 people can do them, but certainly not when they came out or for long after.<br />
<br />
[I feel a post coming from Land, telling me that he used to do AoW with one group, 2 years ago :) ]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alternate Quests where placed into PoP to allow these small 2-4 Group Guilds or Guildless to gain access to zones so they can GAIN LEVELS! PoP raised the top level but only gave players access to 3 planes. Sure you can do Trials and gain access to PoV/PoS but that doesn't sell an expansion by giving alternate quests more zones became available to the underpowered to explore and play in and handle the overcrowding in the bottom planes.<br />
<br />
I Think that by designing the game to talior to 60+ person raids is a mistake only becuase SoE has not balanced the content to allow for &quot;new&quot; smaller events. AC has recently been revamped - look there for small 2-3 group events? Nope.<br />
<br />
 like Ximix's type of guild. It sounds fun and interactive, with good folks and good times. It's sad that they can't progress further, but that's just about the limit. Sad because if they did manage to get sol ro tower flags, they'd be able to get VT quality loot with 2-3 group raids.  <br />
<br />
Yes sadly that is what is going to happen to his guild and like the title of this post reads they finished... now all they can do is farm, start alts, or Join others in an alliance or Become yet another 60+ raiding Guild. There are 2 types of EQ players the &quot;Raider/PowerGamer&quot; and &quot;all the rest&quot; its 2 bad that there can't be designed a balance between the 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&gt; For that matter, we skipped vex thal, sleepers, and veeshan's peak too. <br />

You skipped two zones you shouldn't have. VP is a fun zone clearable by 12-18 65s easy. ST would give you primal and motg, fa and prog are 2-3 groupable. You could get keyed on zlandicar, klandicar, statue and the occasional vindi drop.<br />
<br />
VT is an excercise in boredom, complete and total. Clearing is far harder than the boss mobs - but both take high dps. I would imagine a low dps group would actually get stuck in areas unable to move forward due to respawns. <br />
<br />
12-18 could definitely take out XTC and maybe AL. Certainly rhag1-2. You could do glyphed but not exiled (unslowable) or cursed. <br />
<br />
Dozekar would be easy.<br />
<br />
wotv rares are unslowable, as are tmax and yeli, but maybe. All those are really damn easy.<br />
<br />
In my mind, take a step back not forward. You missed a lot of areas I remember very fondly that would provide a challenge. The real problem is timing. A guild of 12-18 isn't going to have players dedicated to know when all these mobs die and they camp people there waiting for them to spawn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Verant figured out that they could get more money by dumbing the content down.  It worked.  They have less CS issues because of graveyards, and their content stretches further because now one encounter keeps 100+ people busy instead of just 24 to 30 people, or god forbid 6 to 12 people.<br />
<br />
Kunark was the last good expansion.  They added decent dungeons that took a brain to play in (at least pre-60).<br />
<br />
PoP (and Velious to a lesser extent) is a good example of stretching content for the sake of bringing in more dollars.  Nice outdoor zones for the schmucks to mindlessly xp in, and big massive encounters for them to feel like they are part of something when in fact they are just a cog in the wheel while 5 or 6 people actually figure out the encounter.<br />
<br />
PoP was implemented so the stupid people could play too.  Some of us are just not stupid enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The loot in Veeshan's Peak is almost entirely obsolete. No melee in our guild would use the weapons that drop there. I think only Phara Dar has drops that many of our casters and healers would equip. We really don't need any Kunark spells. While it would be fun to clear just to get the experience, I can't see us asking everyone to farm all of the silly key pieces with hours and hours of camping time.<br />
<br />
In the weeks/months it would take us to key up for VP, we could have been doing much more profitable things elsewhere.<br />
<br />
 ST would give you primal and motg, fa and prog are 2-3 groupable. You could get keyed on zlandicar, klandicar, statue and the occasional vindi drop. <br />
<br />
Primal/Prismatic weapons are obsolete. I can keep Ferine Avatar on every melee in our guild by myself.<br />
<br />
It would be fun go to Sleeper's just to experience the zone (and for some of the other loot), but there is a lot of competition for ST key dropping mobs on our server. We seem to have better luck finding Planes of Power mobs up than finding velious mobs up.<br />
<br />
12-18 could definitely take out XTC and maybe AL. Certainly rhag1-2. You could do glyphed but not exiled (unslowable) or cursed.<br />
<br />
It would be fun to take out a few of the Ssra bosses, but since we are not interested in Emporer keys or Vex Thal we spend almost no time in the zone. Meanwhile, the uber-wannabe guilds on our server are jammed into Ssra every night farming Commander 1 and 2, etc. It is unlikely that we would beat them to a spawn in Ssra because of this.<br />
<br />
The real problem is timing. A guild of 12-18 isn't going to have players dedicated to know when all these mobs die and they camp people there waiting for them to spawn. <br />
<br />
We really don't like wasting our valuable play time waiting for mobs to spawn. We find a mob up that is on our hit list, and we go kill it. Life is too short and play time is too valuable to waste on things like farming green mobs for silly key quests or standing around hoping some mob on a long timer happens to spawn. There is *always* something more fun to do than that.</div></div><hr />

You may have completed a set of self defined goals, but there's no &quot;finish line&quot; or &quot;end&quot; to EverQuest. Likewise, until you've completed every trial or acquired every key to every zone in POP and have physically *been* there, you haven't &quot;finished&quot; it.

Planes of Power was designed with two possible paths follow. The big Planes of Power storyline that the uberguilds follow should ultimately take them to Plane of Time. When they clear Plane of Time, they will declare that they have &quot;finished&quot; PoP.<br />
<br />
The smaller, single group focused path that we followed led us to where we are, and stops (as best as we can tell).<br />
<br />

Will he/they be happy? What if 71 friends and I feel like running through the zone to kill the same mob his guild was being prepared to take on, will he be upset? <br />
<br />
Basically getting the better gear imo is needed not so everyone in your group can be FM and FH while xping.. what does the guild have for goals? To get better gear then? <br />
<br />
One side note for me, I think if everything could be done with 18 ppl that all rocked would be retarded because those 18 ppl would be knowing exactly what to do, when to do it and what to expect. The dynamic parts of the game come when unexpected things occur, and for me the most fun is when unexpected/dynamic things are occuring. If no one died and it wasn't a struggle then it's just like farming..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Zerg is such a fun term since it typically seems to mean doing any encounter you want to name with any more than we have/think we can do it with.<br />
<br />
The problem is with out artificial limits placed on you by the game like the hedge maze or PoJ trials it's almost always easier to do something with x+1 groups than it is with x untill you hit a point of diminision returns. That point is usually in relation to coordination and just simply how many people your computer/connect can handle. Well with additions to the game like chat channels, Raids and such that limit has gone up. With computers getting faster and broad band connections more previlent that limit has also gone up. The result has been reflected in the game.<br />
<br />
Strategies have also improved. Ch chains are now standard and common practice but that was a new idea back in the day. I could list many other things like pinning mobs facing the corner, hiding behind walls etc that are standard practices that where all developed at one point. Being an old timer means you got to see some of these things figured out =)<br />
<br />
Take something simple that I'll assume most of us have done or at least are familier with, PoJ trial. One doesn't even have to leave the board to find posts about how difficult this is, or how hard it is to get into a group to do this etc etc. Yet let 2 groups in and almost everyone would breeze threw on thier first try. 3 groups and you could pretty much f8 and auto attack and still get threw it easily.<br />
<br />
Designing content for 2-3 or even 4 or 5 groups now is difficult since with out the artificial limitations people will simply just use more people to make the encouter easier. Thats how you end up with encounters tuned for 60-72.<br />
<br />
Sure some encounters scale differently depending on the encounter. Agnarr for example I could easily see being done with fairly small number 18-24ish since you just need enough clerics to keep a tank up against agnarr, pretty easy, and you can pretty much take as long as you like to do the event. Would definitely require good gear, proper tactics and probably a bit of luck. On the other end something like Behemoth, AD or Bert would be pretty impossible with those numbers no matter the gear, tactics or luck involved.</div></div><hr />

Ximix: The loot in Veeshan's Peak is almost entirely obsolete. No melee in our guild would use the weapons that drop there. I think only Phara Dar has drops that many of our casters and healers would equip. <br />

I am a relatively new player. I have not yet reached the level required to access any of the planes. I spend too much time playing EQ instead of working on EQ. I work on Tradeskills, explore zones, socialize, farm for Tradeskills, create alts to learn how to play other classes, etc. I guess it is a failing of mine or a lack of ambition but I'm more interested in playing then &quot;winning.&quot; I think that is a question every player must answer. &quot;Why do I play?&quot; If you have reached it, then you must be finished.

Yes PoP is designed for huge raiding guilds.  This is not news.  And a bunch of folks think that's a crummy design focus - it's too narrow.  They need to broaden things out a bit.  <br />

Actually, it is possible to play EQ and JUST SAY NO to excessive timesinks. It is also possible to play EQ and not actively race every other guild for the most contested spawns around.

<br />
If I insist on never grouping and only soloing, I am going to miss out on lots of dungeons, dragons, gods and what not. I might have a lot of fun, but there will be a lot of content that I'm not going to be able to explore.<br />

<br />
I know Gart, but I'm saying tough ****. Those people that are there worked to get there, worked as in leveled, got into a big guild and play a lot. There should be a sliding scale of rewards in EQ -- and in fact, there generally is. Those who spend the most time in game reap the greatest rewards. <br />
<br />
Ximix, the only limitations you face are the ones that you set for yourself. You want 2-3 group targets only. You won't join/form a big guild. You won't form an alliance. You won't time/camp spawns. Yet, you think you should have the same perks/toys and the people who do those things. I'm sorry, but when has EQ ever been like that?<br />
<br />
You could blame the game's structure for your situation. But, it's that same structure which has given more dedicated players something to do, something to work toward, something to focus on. Plus, that &quot;structure&quot; that been the order of the day since vox/naggy/planes, certainly cemented the day Kunark came out with VS + chardok + dragons + VP. Bigger targets, bigger forces, quests for access (hs, os, vp). There's no suprises here. The only difference is that in pop the quests are more difficult -- just as the rewards are greater. Makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
My guild now is only starting pop in earnest while we farm VT, seru, ssra. But, I damn well expect the process to be difficult, something that when I'm done I can say I accomplished something. In the meantime, I continue to enjoy the game even tho I'm not yet flagged for the elemental planes. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">It's one thing to say that those who glom together in packs of 70 should get more loots and content than those who don't like that; it's another thing to define where that line should be drawn.  <br />
<br />
I agree there is a line, and I think Ximix does too.  I don't agree with where the line is drawn in PoP.  <br />
<br />
You say &quot;tough sh*t&quot;, and I say, &quot;no, it's a sh*tty design.&quot;  So far, Sony agrees with you.  Here's hoping their design philosophy will extend more content to those who don't care to spend 50 hours a week raiding with 70 people but who do enjoy something more than PoV.  <br />
<br />
It is possible to design that.  The original design philosophy was let the zone content determine who hunts there.  The paradigm that 70 person raids is the only method of upper end gaming is an artificial one, and while it has it's place, it can clearly be taken too far.  <br />
<br />
PoP is not like other expansions, which limited access to at most ONE zone.  VP, ST and VT. Unless you count Howling Stones and Sebilis, which I don't.  Might as well count Cobalt Scar if you do that.  VP and ST aren't that hard frankly.  <br />
<br />
Sure, you have self-interest in precluding access to certain zones because it makes your gameplay more fun for you.  That's fine, but recognize it's your self-interest that is motivating you, which others may not be so concerned with.  I'm not, I'm concerned with my own gameplay, which I perceive is artificially stagnated through nonsensical (unfun) hurdles.  <br />
<br />
So, either (1) change the way I play (2) accept it (3) advocate for change or (4) quit.  Any are viable options.  You think only (1) and (2) are viable apparently, and probably (4) too.  I don't.  But, (4) is the option I'm essentially doing these days.  <br />
<br />
The line in PoP needs to be adjusted.  Since there's a lot of subjective judgment about how much is reasonable and to what extent, it's obviously difficult to do.  I think they can do better, that's for sure.  <br />
<br />
Big guild raiders weren't squawking they added the non-flagged quest option to raids.  That adjustment was ok, but everything else in PoP is perfectly designed?  <br />
<br />
I don't think PoP is perfectly designed.  I think you are nuts if you do.</div></div><hr />

12-18 could definitely take out XTC and maybe AL. Certainly rhag1-2. You could do glyphed but not exiled (unslowable) or cursed.<br />

<br />
It would be fun to take out a few of the Ssra bosses, but since we are not interested in Emporer keys or Vex Thal we spend almost no time in the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that there are some loots that you would deffinately use off of XTC, AL, Rhags, and the Glyphed.  They are not involved with the keying process either so you may be able to take them.  Even keying for the emp may be nice at a later time when the comanders aren't permacamped.  The ring is nice and the farming is not that hard or time consuming (second floor maybe--third floor you need a raid force which your guild can do).  Gratz though.  I like the idea of your guild and think there is still plenty of stuff to do for you guys.  Good point though.</div></div><hr />

The content you describe tends to be monopolized by larger, uber-wannabe guilds on Quellious. We would love an attempt at NToV, XTC, Rhags, etc. And I am certain we will get to try these at some point. Like I said in a previous post (may want to read them all so I can quit repeating myself), we have better luck finding PoP mobs up than velious/luclin mobs up, for the most part.<br />
<br />
Why should we fight with 10 guilds to get the Velious and Luclin minibosses, when the PoP minibosses are much more available and drop loot of comparable or better quality? I am talking about mobs in Tactics, BoT, CoD, HoH, Torment, etc.<br />
<br />
Sol Ro Tower is sitting empty 90% of the time because every uber-guild that got there did it once and immediately moved on to Rallos Zek and then the elemental planes. Why not let the less uber guilds have a crack at content that is not being utilized any more?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This might be true and it might be used as a way to judge if people do whats needed to deserve a chance at content - BUT - as only Vox and Nagafen so far have been reverse level limited there is nothing that prevents 1 or 2 groups of bored highlevel players to take out lots of mobs just for fun that would otherwise have been valid targets for lower/less uber players to seriously upgrade their equipment.<br />
<br />
This all boils down to whether you think the &quot;multiplayer&quot; aspect in EQ is meant as competition against other people or the ability to form groups and guilds to fight against monsters. I know there are tons of people on my server that I dont know and I couldnt care less what they do to enjoy themselves yet I have to accept that they take out things me and my friends would have had fun fighting too. Apparently this will be changed in EQ2 and I honestly think it sucks like it is implemented in EQ.<br />
<br />
Artificial blocks in a game like this is a very poor design. Thats why I think Ximix's point about Ro's Tower is very valid. And why is the Hole/HS/Hates Fury/VP/ST(maybe) almost always completely empty? Because they are extremely unaccesible zones so people the less-than-uber that could still get upgrades there dont have the time to risk to going there. Its an artificial difficulty :P</div></div><hr />

Well basicly if other guilds got into sol ro as eazy as you want to, ie not going through Agnarr, MM, sarynn, bertoxx.

<br />
The alternate entry quests do not scale up well to larger uber-wannabe guilds. Unless you have farmed Diaku Raiders in Plane of Storms for a bit, you probably won't know what I mean - but suffice it to say that no one is going to key a huge raiding force that way. These guilds would have the pure numbers to go after Grummus, Behemoth, etc. and would ultimately be chasing the ubers in the elementals.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think it should be easy for us to get into Sol Ro Tower. I think it should be a Damn HARD quest, that happens to be doable without large numbers. Make us collect rare drops from tougher mobs in Tactics, BoT Towers, Torment, etc. and combine them all to key a group or something. This would prevent a larger guild from using this method to circumvent Agnarr, MM, et al.<br />
<br />
Besides, if the wannabe ubers move out of velious and luclin, then we will be happy to give NToV and Ssra minibosses a shot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Gart, as always, well stated. But I differ in a few spots.<br />
<br />
Gart: &quot;Sure, you have self-interest in precluding access to certain zones because it makes your gameplay more fun for you. That's fine, but recognize it's your self-interest that is motivating you, which others may not be so concerned with. I'm not, I'm concerned with my own gameplay, which I perceive is artificially stagnated through nonsensical (unfun) hurdles.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could just as easily argue that it is you who are solely concerned with your own character over what is best for overall gameplay and guild matriculation. Those oft-scorned timesinks actually *reduce* guild v. guild and player v. player wars. On Fennin, there are two guild who are fully elemental planes capable, TMO and NoV. Two other guilds have recently moved to advance in PoP, RoA and CoL. They target things like MM, as well as some lower targets down to SSRA. But, in general, CoL is PoP only. My guild is competing generally with only one guild now in VT (RoA) and we're looking to PoP targets. We still do down to SSRA/AoW, but I suspect their days are numbered. There are several guilds and alliances below that, focusing on everything from NTOV to AoW. Note tho, usually there's only a few guilds competing for a target unless an upper guild bottomfeeds. <br />
<br />
THAT'S the real benefit of flags and timesinks -- it spreads people out and reduces competition. If there was a way to gimp into Sol Ro tower, everyone would. And you'd have 10 teams of 12-18 people fighting THE SECOND a miniboss spawned. That would be as ugly as BoT farming pre nerf. Maybe uglier. Plus, those timesinks also follow the basic progression of the game: <br />
<br />
-kael/epics/kunark<br />
-hot/st/UP/vindi<br />
-ntov/ct/tunare/IV/burrower/dain/tmax/yeli<br />
-aow/ssra<br />
-emp<br />
-vt/seru<br />
-pop <br />
<br />
Generally, you need the gear and experience from the lower tier to advance to the next tier. You aren't going to go from thurg armor and epics to killing Emp and HP.<br />
<br />
I know the flags are broken. Hell, I'm not even CoD flagged yet because I play at a fixed time of day. Just because I'm not flagged doesn't mean the whole system is broken tho.<br />
<br />
Gart: &quot;So, either (1) change the way I play (2) accept it (3) advocate for change or (4) quit. Any are viable options. You think only (1) and (2) are viable apparently, and probably (4) too. I don't. But, (4) is the option I'm essentially doing these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those choices rest with you. <br />
<br />
Gart: &quot;Big guild raiders weren't squawking they added the non-flagged quest option to raids. That adjustment was ok, but everything else in PoP is perfectly designed?&quot;<br />
<br />
They did squawk early on but it died fast. So fine, let's give easier access to PoTorment too. Why do the Hedge and kill TT? In fact, let's make it so that 12-18 people can enter PoTime, and then all 3,000 players will be in one zone. There needs to be limits. Where should the line be drawn? I dunno, seems OK where it is. <br />

It's like you all forgot where this game began? Pre Kunark it was solb, lguk or killing sea furbies or npcs to level from 40-50. Two zones. In Kunark, everyone did KC or OS, only later after a revamp Chardok. And that was short-lived. It was that or kill mobs in Skyfire. HS was never used much, nor CoM. SoV comes out, and the world pours into VL for exp. SG was made more exp friendly, but it never catches on. It was VL, stay in OS, or solo in CS etc. SoL comes out, where does everyone exp? FG mainly. UP and ME a bit, a few in the Deep, Grey and SSRA, but mainly FG. CT revamped. Everyone comes here. Everyone. So PoP comes out and we get PoN/PoD/PoI, with easy access to PoV/PoS. BoT/HoHa/CoD/PoNb/PoI factory all very reachable. PoTorment/PoTactics within reason. ALL of these are viable exp zones. 9 to 13 viable zones -- most with minibosses -- to exp in and you're telling me PoP is broken because there aren't enough areas? Even if you say exp in the first three zones isn't as good, there's still more viable exp zones today than at any other time in the history of the game. <br />
<br />
Still, I would agree that a few more exp zones are needed since the player base is generally 50-65. Just why mess with PoP? Revamp a few older dungeons and make the exp early PoP comparable. CT should be more exp than PoV, as holding 4C is twice as a hard as holding PoV Inner Caves.<br />

Gart: &quot;I don't think PoP is perfectly designed. I think you are nuts if you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't. But it generally follows the pattern EQ has been building towards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it doesn't.  In the past, there has been only one high end zone with an &quot;ubers-only&quot; key quest.<br />
<br />
Veeshans Peak<br />
Sleepers Tomb<br />
Vex Thal<br />
<br />
In POP it's completely different from the pattern we are used to, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Having one zone blocked off ot the general public is a slap as it is. Blocking off 50% is a kick in the nads. <br />
<br />
NToV was best, you entered, you tried and you either wiped hard or won. Either way, there wasn't alot to complain about. <br />
<br />
I have all the flags cept elemental, and won't ever see them, I spose. Not with a a family and a job. <br />

I hope Sony sees the light soon, because this next statement is true and weighs TONS. <br />

I haven't recommended Everquest to RL friends in a long, long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The amount of content that is blocked or 'timesunk' in PoP is just rude. Having one more two zones that you need to get keyed/flagged up for I can understand, but having an an entire expansion minus PoT/PoK and the 4 teir 1 zones needing keys/flags is overkill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... not to mention, the same 4 zones come 61+ because the non-planar zones &quot;go green&quot; real fast gets awful dull and boring. Nobody wants to play a game that's dull and boring, especially when you know you'll be getting nowhere fast (or really slow... depending on how you look at it).<br />
<br />
However, having all but 6 zones &quot;closed off&quot; unless you have enough people together is, like, hmmm... Legacy of Ykesha, which only had 5 zones, but had a slew of features to it to make it worth the money spent, but only 6 zones, with only the raid feature, seems a bit, like wasted cash.<br />
<br />
PoP = $30 - 6 zones &quot;open to all&quot; (provided you were 46+), raid feature, PoK stones<br />
LoY = $18-23 - 5 zones &quot;open to all&quot; (provided you wanted to make the run there), guild management, maps, dyes, decent loot - attainable and fairly nice for the intended levels, decent money, extra bank slots, the journal to keep your quests straight and the lowbie Torpor were all well worth the ~$20 (even if Woody (http://gucomics.com/archives/view.php?cdate=20030421) was right about Charms and nobody uses the LFG tool...), I still think LoY was more worth the $20 than PoP was worth the $30, by far.<br />
<br />
That's my 2 cents on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>soru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">You could look at it this way:<br />
<br />
a small guild has just finished the content designed for them in more or less the same time as taken by the mega-guilds to do the content designed for them. Plane of Time is not beaten yet, but I doubt it will take more than a month, unless there is a further holdup with broken scripts. <br />
<br />
This means that this time, SOE got the balance of content more or less right, at least between small and large guilds. If there was less for the large guilds to do, then 3 months ago they would have done it and they'd be disrupting everyone else's game instead of playing their own.  <br />
<br />
If anything, the people who lost out this time were the soloers, as several people 'finished the solo game' (by getting maxed aaxps) a while back. <br />
<br />
Time to move onto the revamped skyshrine, inner acrylia and sleepers temple, and the several small raids in the LoY expansion. <br />
<br />
Also, have you looked into the symbol of ducee (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=6203.topic) quest, which some people think could be the missing quest to enter Sol Ro Tower?<br />
<br />
Soru</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">So fine, let's give easier access to PoTorment too.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to let you know that there IS a key quest for Torment, and I have completed it.  Not that tough of a quest but then again it's not really an exp zone ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I think it's funny that someone finds it worth their time to do the rather painful timesinks that are alternate access quests, but is unwilling to put forth the effort to do any of the key quests or even try to compete with other guilds in prior expansions...<br />
<br />
PoP is a GUILD expansion in large part I think.  What I mean by that is that the biggest difference between PoP and previous expansions is that you and your guild have to all work together to progress instead of people being able to go off and do their own thing and progress at will.  For many guilds PoP ripped them apart due to missing flags and the feeling that some would never be able to catch up to the rest of their guild.  For other guilds, it drew them tighter together than ever before as they worked together to get everyone flagged and progress through the various tiers.<br />
<br />
If a guild is only 12-18 people then what is so different in PoP than any other expansion?  In Luclin was that 12-18 person raid taking down much of any boss type mobs?  IV, Shei, Greig, Ssra other than Rhag1, Doomshade, etc... I don't think so.  In Velious was that 12-18 strong guild raiding HoT, any dragons other than perhaps the weakest of the WW dragons, Dain, Vindi, Velk even???<br />
<br />
You said yourself that your guild is not above farming Vindi even now, so why is it above working on Dozekar, NToV, WToV, ST key droppers and ST itself?  There are a ton of options for a tight 12-18 man raid force nowadays.  Granted you're not going to go far in PoP but I highly doubt you went far in any other expansion before the next came or even possibly second expansion after came out.  So what was the point of this post again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Sol Ro Tower is sitting empty 90% of the time because every uber-guild that got there did it once and immediately moved on to Rallos Zek and then the elemental planes. Why not let the less uber guilds have a crack at content that is not being utilized any more?<br />
<br />
I'm still on the newbie end of things, but my friend in the &quot;best&quot; guild on my server was saying after a raid of the plane of water or similar that they checked EVERY zone including hate/fear! and there were 0 boss mobs up.. So I doubt the tower is empty.<br />
<br />
Also, if there is gear on par with VT that is doable by a group of 18 ppl, do you think that a strong guild is not going to permanantly be there? The reward vs difficulty HAS to be there unless they do something like the ponB hedge trial which would be exclusively for 18 or less ppl. That would keep at least the &quot;zerg&quot; factor out of it but still, 18ppl doable for vt quality gear.. hmm.. the guys clearing vt for 8 hours just to get to good stuff would gladly timesink a box to not letting anyone ever get that gear besides him and his crew.<br />
<br />
In other words, it's just not logically possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Actually, it wouldn't surprise me at all if the minis were left up more often than not in Sol Ro.  Yeah, they can drop some decent stuff, but like everything else in PoP they only seem to drop 1-2 items and one of those could be an Ornate mold.  If you have access to Sol Ro's Tower, chances are you have access to Elemental Planes and those ornate molds are not going to be an upgrade.  It takes a while to clear to each mini, so it's just not worth it unless you're killing them to get flagged for Sol Ro himself.<br />
<br />
Ideally, they'd drop the silly mini-flag requirements for Sol Ro's chamber and open up the tower similar to the other Tier 3 zones.  The way it is now though, opening up the zone would make it a helluva pain in the ass for guilds trying to get their people flagged to take out Sol Ro for access to PoFire.  In short, yeah I can agree that access to Sol Ro's Tower should be similar to the other Tier3 zones, but I also think they need to change the requirements to get into Sol Ro's chambers if they did that.  Just having the portal do a check for the RZ flag would work I guess.</div></div><hr />
