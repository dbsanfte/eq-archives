<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey , <br />
Havent checked back here in a while , started EQ again and was just curious of a few questions. Me and my Cousin , who plays an EP Monk with about 120 AA , are looking for places for both of us to rack up some AA's. Now Im not EP flagged yet , I am only as far as tactics ... so it kind of cuts down some options . But where would the fastest/most efficient place be for us to Duo be at ?<br />

Laugh if you must but I am recovering from a stolen account so My gear is still limited =D<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yea , his girlfriend is moving in with him next month and she has a level 12 cleric that we are going to PL the hell out of , which in turn would also require us Twinking her out. What would be a good place to duo farm some cash so we could gear her up =D<br />
<br />
<br />
any input would help TONS , thanks =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok, hes and ep monk ? can he tank for you ? if so, then these ARE the zones you will hunt in to equip her and yourself (you need some up's no offense)<br />
<br />
<br />
Chardok B (invis or train down)<br />
<br />
Droga or Nurga<br />
<br />
Veksar (one of my favs to solo)<br />
<br />
riwwi is also good (if you can handle it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oh yea , i know I need some up's =D It's not like i can help it I had my account stolen =/<br />
<br />
Now would those spots be just farm spots or AA spots too ? Were kinda going for both at once here but going to one place to AA then another for loots wouldnt be a problem =D...... what about any PoP zones &gt;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoP mobs hit quite hard, old world mobs are much easier. Shaman can root-rot but with the monk that's not an option. The suggestions above are all very good for loot, but dunno about XP. <br />
<br />
For XP, you might get some joy out of Dragon Necropolis, or the easier PoP zones. The factory in PoI if you have access, or the hedge area in PoN (monk will want a gate potion) are good tier one spots, where mobs don't hit too hard but offer decent xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well like I've heard of Shammys soloing in Tactics , like picking off mobs from the pit. Couldnt you just Malo/s , Slow , debuff , DoT ? And let monk gain aggro ? Droga is very easy , we'll probably hit that up. But yea me and my DE warrior friend duo in the entrance area in tactics and kill the trash there before raids I dont why see throwing a monk in its place would make a huge difference</div></div><hr />
