If noone thinks it is worth the time, I will delete both the posts and sorry for bugging you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would like to compile a list of what everyone here at the Crucible thinks is the best droppable gear<br />
<br />
It would need to be divided by level/cost.  There is a huge difference between a JB helm and that nice 65 hitpoint hat that drops in CT, or between a cougar claw earring and a mosquito leg earring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suggest you start making the list first. You've got more than enough data available to you... go through the magelo thread and comb out the droppable stuff on profiles.</div></div><hr />

 I would love to do that but how would you organize something like that. <br />
 <br />
dirtybax <br />
 could you please post a link to that thread so I can compare and see how it is set up?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had thought of that but don't you think that will just start an argument between people on what they think is suitable for what level? Let me get a few more up there and I will see what I can do.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I would love to change the title but I appear to be a gimp in that department, because I can't find out how :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a suggestion, I just don't see a huge dogpile of &quot;best droppable gear&quot; as being anything I would want to wade through.<br />
<br />
PS change the subject with the edit feature</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">okay...guess this was a bad idea :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just had a suggestion based on my own preference.<br />
<br />
If you want to do it, just do it.  Using the magelos (sorted by level) and Allakhazam you could probably do a very thorough list in about 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, I am not thinking it was a bad idea. It is just not what I intended. I wanted something more along the lines of 'The best tradeable Shaman Gear'. Next time I will do it right. I liked the set up for what I was shooting for though. I tried to make it neat and easy to use. The monk forum didn't have links and I think was a bit more full of convoluting content (ie...stats and such on the same page). Perhaps I will get around to setting it up right. <br />
<br />
By the way, I had already tried to change the title, but it didn't change it on the main page. Don't know what I did wrong :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you f'ing cross posted.  h8 that. now the whole thread is worthless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sorry. The only reason I did that is because my equipment post fell into oblivion and I was asking why noone thought it was a good idea. I won't do it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Monkly Business list rocks.  I used it for my twink monk.  Just gotta keep like 6-10 items for each slot.  I think this is a great idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's tougher to come up with a gear upgrade list for shamans than for most other classes due to our versatility and different roles.  Our roles change by level, by hunting type, and by playstyle.<br />
<br />
The upgrade path for a level 25 shaman can be very different (even for the same money) as the upgrade path for a level 55 shaman.<br />
<br />
The upgrade path for a grouping shaman can be very different than the upgrade path for a solo shaman (which can be different than a raid shaman.)<br />
<br />
The upgrade path for a &quot;wisdom&quot; shaman can be very different than the upgrade path from a &quot;AC/HP&quot; shaman.<br />
<br />
Even with all of those things resolved, it's still not always clear (level 60 shaman with a full spellbook and lots of AA will be different than the upgrade path for a newly dinged level 60 shaman missing torpor/malo, etc.)<br />
<br />
Throw in racial and diety differences (snare necklace, etc.), server price differences, price differences over time (the bazaar threw many upgrade plans out of whack), and focus effects in there and you have a mess.  It's a problem that could be tackled, but it would require a bunch of disclaimers (this piece of gear is one of three possible upgrades IF you play this way AND are this level AND are this race, etc.) and a lot of work.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not sure if anyone feels comfortable with their knowledge of gear at every level.  The been-60-for-two-years shamans don't know what's good at level 20 anymore, and I'd probably get the upgrade path wrong once I ventured a couple steps above my current gear.<br />
<br />
I've dabbled with the idea of trying to create such a list a couple times... but creating it would be a big chore, maintaining it would take time, and there would always be philosophical differences.  Instead I just try to answer the equipment posts I have some knowledge of (and time to answer.)  Definitely not an ideal solution for the lurker... but better than nothing.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">All of you are correct. I just wish I had some space on the web that didn't have annoying pop-ups so that I could slowly but surely make a nice shaman equipment list. It would probably be first seperated by race and then level. Religion would probably just be a color coded thing inside the above mentioned format along with the horrible AC/HP or WIS thing. Rollovers and all that jazz would be nice too. I was just tackling something a little bigger than I should of I quess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, here (http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showMessage?topicID=8720.topic) is the Monkly-Business (http://www.monkly-business.com) post on equipment upgrades.  Hope this is helpful, 'cause I sure as hell could use some ideas as far as what to aim for....<br />
<br />
EDIT - Just for grins, this (http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showMessage?topicID=10063.topic) is a list of weapon upgrades.  I don't know if you'd incorporate all of it together, but more information never hurt anyone.</div></div><hr />
