<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bobcats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have aquired, over the past month, 2 Diamonds.  I need the services of a jeweler to make me at least 1 Gold Diamond Mask; if successful at that on first attempt, I'd like an attempt at a Velium Diamond Ring.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can make the mask but not ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm in the same boat.  I have 2 diamonds and a blue diamond laying around and I'd like to try to turn them into some resist gear.<br />
<br />
/auc Looking for jeweler, give tells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have 2 Diamonds too that I would like to make rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Burien has a jewelcraft skill maxxed at 250, and is happy to attempt to make the items for you.  As she is resettling into RL, she isnt on very often atm, but give Cshae a tell in game and make a time for her to bring Burien in.  Velium items are never trivial, and unfortunately these can fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cshae, next time you're on Buri doing JC please make up 4 Velium Fire Opal Rings for me.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our lesson for the day is to parse this clause and figure out what we are supposed to do if we want jewelry made by Burien.  <br />
<br />
The choices are:<br />
<br />
a. Give Cshae a tell in game about it<br />
b. post here<br />
c. Give Rizz a tell in game<br />
d. complain over /gu that you have no resist gear<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer to follow in one week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes Dar I know, but I'd rather not bug someone in game from something like this.  I am asking her to do it at her convenience and at no other time.  If I was in the middle of a group somewhere I'd rather not get 14 tells about jewelcrafting and when I can do it,  just trying to put myself in her shoes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know, Moe.  Just poking fun at you a bit, and making a point at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since i was never very good at following directions.. according to my mother.. <br />
<br />
how bout we have a jewelry nite.. day.. afternoon.. when it is convient to log burien in to make jewelry.. The day and time can be posted.. if someone can not make it then leave a message.. somehow we can work through this.. <br />
<br />
Remember to bring the bars of velium, plat, gold or whatever.  <br />
<br />
Now back to the test.. any more questions??</div></div><hr />

If a east bound train leaves Seattle at 70mph and a west bound train leaves New York at 63mph.  When and where will the two trains meet:rolleyes: ;) :) :p :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ganeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm sure many people need the services of Burien's jewel crafting skills.  I like the idea of a jewelry night or whatever with advance notice so people can gather the stuff they need ahead of time.  I prefer not to bug someone in game without knowing if they are busy or not.<br />
<br />
Either way, resist gear will continue to be a necessary process for all guild members as we level up and newer people join KoE and/or higher raids.<br />
