<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking to compile some feedback regarding the preposed &quot;reinvisionment&quot; of classes and its possible effects on Shamans . I have been asked to gather whatever questions that we as a community may have as well as possible suggestions/feedback .<br />
<br />
Allow me to start with some of my own feelings ...<br />
<br />
I was very happy to see that the guys feel like we need a Healing boost to better allow us to fill the &quot;main healer&quot; role . I also understand the problems that slow creates .<br />
So for my part the feedback is positive im happy with the direction that SoE seems to be taking with our class .<br />
Now as for a suggestion on the &quot;Slow problem&quot; ... In anouther thred it was suggested by anouther shaman Scalia and I quote ..<br />
<br />
&quot;A fairly easy way of &quot;fixing&quot; it (assuming for the moment that we all agree that it needs fixing) would be to introduce a Shaman &quot;stance&quot; just like the Druids will be getting.<br />
<br />
Depending on the stance, you will be either a better slower or a better healer. If you are in the default (&quot;slowing&quot;) stance, then your slows and your heals remain as they are now. If you are in the &quot;healing&quot; stance, then your slows become less efficient (65%?), but your heals improve to make MHing more manageable. The same 5 minute &quot;stance cooldown&quot; would apply as it does (well, &quot;will&quot;) to the Druids' stances.&quot;<br />
<br />
This struck me personaly as an absolutely GREAT idea ! I would be interested to know if the community as a whole likes that idea as much as I do . So please offer your opinions on it as well .<br />
<br />
In short please post all questions/feedback regarding the &quot;Reinvisioning&quot; in this thred . I will watch it closely and pass along questions/feedback .<br />
<br />
Thank you guys in advance for taking your time to post .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd love to see the stance thing like druids:<br />
<br />
Normal: as-is<br />
Healer: 50% reduced slows, 25% increased heals (including HoTs)<br />
Slower: 50% reduced direct heals (HoTs unchanged), slow mitigation reduced one level.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm looking forward to seeing what they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can not see the shaman &quot;stance&quot; idea as the solution for being a better healer.<br />
When I play healer in a group, I can usually only keep the group alive by first slowing the mob, and then healing the group, i.e. I need both slowing and healing to work. The stance idea forces me to choose between healing and slowing, which is very much what I do not want to do.<br />
<br />
The only situations where the stance idea would work is if there is another slower in the group or during a raid where there usually are other slowers.<br />

2) Add Shaman To The List Of Classes That Can Use Pet Focus Items/Augs<br />
<br />
Although some people argue, the shaman IS a pet class, period.  Without our pets we are just a druid who can't heal or port, but can slow.  We depend upon our pets and we need our pets, but our pets are constantly overlooked or ignored when other classes pets are being changed.  Now I am NOT asking that we get given an uber pet, although our pet does need to have more HP (I believe our highest level pet still only has about 2400 hp from our last tests) - Something which would make shaman happy with minimal impact or upset from anyone else who be to let us use pet focus effect like the aug from LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">something not mentioned, not sure if it matters at high end with better tanks, is the poison aggro reduction. Will this boost our DPS by much?  Should this be taken into account when talking about group roles?  Or is our role strictly slower/healer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Stealing what Grizlor posted in the other thread:<br />
<br />
Remove mitigation from all non named mobs and change all existing slows and slow procs to 60% of thier normal value. Scale healing in accordance.<br />
<br />
Mitigation of slow is one of the reasons I bailed.  No one enjoys little yellow text that says &quot;you mostly suck&quot; or &quot;you slightly suck&quot; while trying to contribute in a group.<br />
<br />
Rip out the whole mitigation junk pile and set shaman slows to 60%, enchanters to 50%, and beastlords to 2.45% and everything is peachy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am surprised people like the stance idea. While the Druid stances are going to add a significant boost to Druids while in the appropriate stance, the Shaman stances will not, because they are both part of the same function: healing.<br />
<br />
Example: If the &quot;healing&quot; stance will allow you to heal more effectively than healing + slowing in the slowing stance will, why would you ever want to slow(use the slow mode) again? Basically, this is smelling like a subtle, but significant nerf, instead of boots to Shamans.<br />
<br />
It sounds like they are adding a small boost to healing which will only be superior when a mob is totally immune and in trade make us fall behind in comparison to Druids as we gain no healing for slowable mobs.<br />
<br />
If you think about it, the Druid stances will be really powerful, because no Druid will be nuking while healing anyway, and if their healing mode is going to up their effectivness significantly, who will care about the fact that they can only nuke for half the damage in that time.<br />
<br />
I am sure you do not have the power to change their minds on this, Grimbear, but we shouldn't be too naive and if this was optional, I'd vote NO. It's a trap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you'd vote no instead of just remaining in 'normal' mode, that's your right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to be clear ... the dev's didnt come up with this idea ... it was the Shaman whom I quoted that did . I just personaly liked it so i thought id ask the community how it felt about it .<br />
Im not saying i think this is the only way to handle the &quot;slow issue&quot; that brenlo spoke of ... Im sure there are outher options as well I just thought this one was worth you 'kicking around' .<br />
<br />
Very very good feedback so far guys keep it comming :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like the stance idea BUT....<br />
They need to first give us a new CH spell to be back on par with druids IE 10 sec 4950 heal as an upgrade to the incomplete thought that was our 58 level CH. Second as they said they should upgrade us healing wise to what ever they upgrade to on druids. So in short make us heal the same as druids then let us choose the stance to boost healing and lower slows (you can half slow % if I choose that) or normal where we heal as we do now but on par with a druid in their offensive stance with the same spell. Chances are if we choose healer we will have another slowing class in the group, druids are not balanced because they could *gasp* have a shaman in the group. Let me heal the same as a boosted druid and cripple my slows or let me slow as I do now and have my heals suck. But let me choose with the stance thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Balancing shaman heals against the fact that shaman can slow is a completely false mechanic that will leave the shaman dramatically underpowered in the main healer role.  Attempting to do so will perpetuate the situation of the shaman not being a viable main healer.  <br />
<br />
Against trivial content, pretty much any group makeup will work (i.e. nobles causeway, wall of slaughter), monks can tank those zones vs slowed mobs or you can use chain/plate tanks and no slower.  <br />
<br />
Against the fun and/or more challenging content (i.e. Muramite Proving Grounds, Ruined City of Drannik, Riftseekers) groups require both  a dedicated healer and a dedicated slower.  One person (Shaman) does not have the spell casting time to be both.  Attempting to have a shaman do both makes every fight being a desperate scramble to survive, and in cases of a resisted slow, there is no time to do anything other than spam heal and hope to keep up with the damage.  <br />
<br />
My dedicated slower and healer roles above are expected to bring other things to the groups - depening on their class, I'm not saying that someone just heals or just slows.  <br />
<br />
Each of the priests should be able to heal the content, with somoene else doing the slow, and in addition they should bring something extra to the group.  <br />
<br />
Shaman bring the weakest HP buff, the best melee buffs (a vast array of those to be fair) and Slow.<br />
Druids bring a better HP/AC buffs than shaman - but still lots worse than clerics, mana regen for the group, some melee buffs, tracking, snare  damage shields and some great nukes.  <br />
Clerics bring the best HP/AC buffs, spell haste and more ways of casting heals than is sensible, and XP rezz.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics bring less to the group than the other priests in fairness - but that is because their HP/AC buffs and healing and rezzing so outweights the other two priests, this has been deemed a balacing factor.  Seriously clerics need to get something else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No no and NO.   Stances won't work for us.<br />
<br />
<br />
  First off, as posted, we woud simply parse it out and find out which one provides the better overall health/mana ratio and almost everyone would stick to that mode, swapping out if mitigation changes dramatically in the area.<br />
<br />
<br />
  The most important thing is though, if we limit our slowing ability to enhance our healing, then we become less capable of handling emergencies since there is a TIME LIMIT till you can shift back.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Actually, I think that the mechanic to balance our slowing and healing is MUCH simpler.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Give us a panther spell to cast on the mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If we can make the mob proc a heal spell on anyone it is hitting, then it immediately scales the healing power to the level at which the mob has been slowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
  In many cases, people may decide not to slow AT ALL since the heal procs + HoT keep up with the mob damage.   In other cases we will both slow and use the heal proc, giving us that minor stop-gap we need to get out the heals needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Yes, this may mean we have one more spell to cast per mob, but as long as it is completely UNRESISTABLE and tends to last as long as the mob is alive (while still not costing too much mana) it is a viable solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have an idea what they should do, I think a viable solution to the balance of healing and slowing is to have a healer mode, where healing is boosted 25% or something, slows reduced to 50% max as suggested (or less?) but here's the change: make slow unresistable when that mode is active. That way we can slow asap and not have to worry about needing to land a malos first before turgurs and can easily dedicate time to healing. Also, a new cheal would be lovely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
careful what ya ask for the day i'm stuck in a ch chain will be my last day playing a shaman. if i wanted to heal like a cleric/druid i'd play one! as far as our heals being lesser because we can slow is a joke any high end group will have a slower meaning the cleric/druids heal ver slowed mobs  the fact that they dont cast the slow just means they can cast there heal sooner than we could . as far as changes go i'd be happy with a slight increase in healing power and increased duration in the panther line love the spell hate casting it 3000 times a day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">it is early for me, but i don't like the healing OR slowing idea at all.  <br />
imo without trying to make our class over powering i think we need a minor boost in healing with slow remaining what it is.  such as, in the current content i think our 68 heal should be doing base 2k-2.2k and 70 ancient doing base 2.3k-2.5k.  a 3 second cast time for both spells would be something to think about as well...  i don't really want to see shaman in a main healing roll, but it would be nice to know we can actually land a heal fast enough to matter on a cleric/druid/silkclass when he/she agroes in RS, or maybe have a chance of keeping a mediocre nondisced tank up in RS if the cleric/druid dies.<br />
I am in the top 20 shaman on my server for hp, top 5ish for AA and as it stands now, if the **** hits the fan in RS and i end up healing a mediocre tank without his disc up, he is dead.<br />
could argue mediocre tanks shouldn't be in RS, but i still think being able to a have a base heal close to half a full round of an xp mobs melee damage would be nice compared to currently only being able to only heal just over 1/4th.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit- i don't mean this healing change in some new expansion, i am talking a minor upgrade to our current spells...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The only situations where the stance idea would work is if there is another slower in the group or during a raid where there usually are other slowers.<br />
That's exactly the point.  In easier content, you don't need a slower.  You can rely on healing alone from druids and shaman.  In easier content, you don't need a dedicated healer.  The slower (shaman) can handle both healing and slowing duties.  When you do harder content (like Riftseekers for example) the healer is not the slower.  You can't really function there with a single healer and no slower.  If you had 2 healers without a slower, you could probably function ok just as if you have a slower and a main healer.  The role of slowing is to mitigate as much damage as would probably be healed by a healer.  When you have 2 shaman in a group, you still don't really have enough healing in a group to be able to go to RS to be able to xp.  But, you could bring a cleric+druid, cleric+cleric, druid+druid, cleric+shaman, or druid+shaman.  There are times the shaman is the main healer in a group that already has a slower.  In those cases, the extra slower is a waste of class ability.  Instead, sacrifice the slowing ability from the shaman at that time, and give us the extra healing we need to make up for our inept healing due to slow factor.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of the healing stance.  I don't care for the &quot;slowing&quot; stance at all.<br />
Healing stance:  Give us +50% to our healing.  Mitigate our slows by up to an extra 2 levels (full slows become partials, mostly and everything else becomes slightly).<br />
Other option is give us +75% to our healing, and block all slowing abilities (spells, item clicks, procs, etc).<br />
<br />
This wouldn't be used in every situation.  Nor should it be.  It's meant to be used in the situation where the shaman is the main healer, but his healing is inept, even when mobs are already slowed by another class).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Regael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You folks are a little problematic though, since your healing ability is the function of not just your heals, but your ability to reduce an NPCs damage output through slows.  In a situation where an NPC is fully slowable, you are a superb healer but against an NPC who cannot be slowed, your healing falls behind.  If we were to just improve your heals, you would quickly outshine any other healer when facing NPCs that can be slowed.  So, we are investigating ways to improve your healing ability only in circumstances where an NPC cannot be slowed or you choose not to slow the NPC (for your own strange reasons). <br />
<br />
As long as Sony holds this over our heads our healing will never truly be on par with druids.<br />
<br />
And since according to this...<br />
<br />
We are changing many of the all-or-nothing immune flags so they mitigate the effect instead.  We want you to use your abilities on most NPCs, but where we feel the ability might be problematic the ability will have a lesser effect. <br />
<br />
Mitigation is now across the board. I feel our Slows shouldn't be held against us in determining our Healing abilities.<br />
<br />
I also agree with Veril's statement about our healer and Slower roles.<br />
In the higher end grouping situations we are either one or the other.<br />
<br />
So I feel that if Sony is gonna say our Healing and Slowing are one in the same. Then do what quite a few people on this boards are talking about; change slow - get rid of our 75%, and make our healing capabilities around 70-75% of a clerics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Give us a panther spell to cast on the mobs.<br />
<br />
  If we can make the mob proc a heal spell on anyone it is hitting, then it immediately scales the healing power to the level at which the mob has been slowed.<br />
You know, if you add that proc to a slow, then we are talking. I certainly don't have time to malos, slow, heal proc and then to start healing. But putting it on a slow makes for a nice mechanic. Consider:<br />
 - if it provides slightly less slowage then turgur's/nihil it would not be something to use on raid bosses. A minor loss though, as there is only need for one such slow per raid anyways. You could easily design encounters where you have adds to cast it on. Choices are good. And as a bonus it does not screw over shaman who do not have the spell - they can still use the regular slow.<br />
 - it automatically scales up in usefulness the more the target mitigates.<br />
 - it automatically scales down in usefulness the less the target mitigates.<br />
 - no extra time spent casting<br />
 - no need for an extra spell gem<br />
<br />
Downsides:<br />
 - on low end MOBs shaman may get by without casting a single heal.<br />
 - on high end MOBs an extra 0.1% slow may well be better thena feeble heal proc.<br />
<br />
So basically the spell would end up being strong in weak content - I would not mind that at all. If someone wants to go melee solo in torment, let them. And on the other side it would end up being weak in the high end zones. That is rather more troublesome, but it could be compensated for by letting MOBs hit faster instead of harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids should heal better than Shaman against slowable mobs because otherwise they would require a shaman to slow the mob so they could heal.....<br />
<br />
The idea of class balancing is to make everyone viable for a group, not to make it so that shaman are the strongest option for grouping. If a druid wants to get a group of 5 melee together they should be able to heal in the content of their choice, same for clerics, same for us. For druids that would mean better heals and some form of leg up in another way to close the gap between damage/heals. The mobs should be balanced for clerics so that they can just use their healing capacity against unslowed mobs, then factor in druids with healing stance, finally factor in shaman and the new heal/slow ratio. In there somewhere is balance on a healing/slowing healer/damage ratio..... however, there are other slowing classes.... and other headaches.<br />
<br />
Slow has been the defining (on paper) attribute for Shaman. To get an effective heals/slow ratio across all mobs that would enable a shaman to be an acceptable main healer would be fantastic. I don't want to be a pure healer or I'd have rolled a cleric.</div></div><hr />

Some suggestions...  Healing - increase duration on our HoT's and healing power (no increase in mana or cast time)...  Maybe a decent CH..  other than that I think our heals are good..<br />
DPS I feel I am just fine..  2 dots and my dogdog procin away...<br />
Slow - we need a slow that is unresistable just like Malos have it be 35% or decrease cast time and recast on Malos.  recast a lil on turgurs..<br />

<br />
But for the fact that heals are not commonely resisted.<br />
What I really would like to see is a high resist modifier - high aggro slow for high end raiding AND tanking.  A spell that will require skill to use (since you will need to be able to withstand the aggro or have good healer backup and fast tanks to get it off you) but that will also allow us to get stuff slowed when we need to.  The difference between turgur and balance is just not decisive enough to make a real difference in slowability.</div></div><hr />

There are times I do NOT want my SCS to be active.<br />
I know of multiple necros that think the AA is actually something that HARMS their class.<br />
I know that every sane shadowknight that plays the game knows that SCS hurts their class, as opposed to help them.</div></div><hr />

has a closer thought to mine in what we need <br />
<br />
I dont want to be a MH I want to be the battle priest (that we were supposed to be) Panther was in the right direction on this.  Now we need the skills to back this up.<br />
<br />
I think they should give us the same quick heal that the druid gets but the CH should stay the domain of the Druid and cleric.<br />
<br />
And give us forage I am tired of depending on the Rangers and Druids for foraged components , espicially since they gripe about it soooo much.</div></div><hr />

AWSOME IDEA, sometimes i want that agro...albeit rarely, but still it is there... and a RL SK friend of mine has over 1k AA and still refuses to buy this AA... doesn't that show that there is some sort of problem that needs addressed? does this even work with dot agro?<br />
<br />
i was tired during my last post, but some ideas i was thinking about was to actually bring back some old spell lines...<br />
-upgrade the VoTB spell line. so much that could be done with this...add double attack, take away the 30 second nocast timer, increased weapons skills, more AC/hp, whatever...<br />
-someone talked about upgradeing attack sow, make it indoors too...a lot could be done with this line...<br />
-acumen upgrade with endure breath and some minor endurance regen would ROCK<br />
-upgraded group haste would be nice... especially for the casual players..<br />
-upgraded reduced recast/cast time malos line spell...<br />
-resist mod on putrid decay really needs to be listed as unresistable.... not a big problem, but another little one that adds to the problem heap...<br />
-new pet buff... since the panther line all shaman should be useing pets now. i wouldn't mind to see a major upgrade to spirit quickening spell.<br />
-ffs upgrade and add a new bear form spell.... example- i know a lot of us could use a little extra mana/hp regen while doing 6-7 person panther chains...<br />
<br />
a lot of that stuff is little minor upgrades that wont effect the issue most of us have while healing without major focus stuff like the qvic arm's focus, but every little thing helps.  especially seeing as eq is a game of minor upgrades (generally speaking...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Healing really isn't a problem for shaman.<br />
<br />
I would argue that in areas where slowing is impossible.  Shaman aren't main healers nor should they be.  <br />
<br />
I would also argue that in the areas where I can not be the main healer giving up slows for added healing would NOT allow me to be the main healer.<br />
<br />
The game is balanced that a slower is present.  It doesn't matter WHO the slower, just that one is present.  Go play in riftseekers with unslowed mobs with mes.  See how long your group lasts.  I would never argue that a beastlord or enchanter + shaman as main healer should work down there.<br />
<br />
Lineup.<br />
- Direct heal 2500/5000 (with aas/focus)<br />
- Heals over time 800/1600<br />
- Epic1.5 400*<br />
- Ancestral 300*<br />
- Unlimited mana for 3 minutes (spiritual channelling)*<br />
* can not keep up all the time.<br />
** yes I didnt give exact numbers :P<br />
<br />
If you want to find a nitch where shaman can provide additional healing if they give up slowing consider the notion of defered healing.<br />
<br />
- Direct heals add a 1 tick buff which adds 5% to the max hp of the target (healing for that much).  So you heal on a 10k tank would be 2500/5000 + 500 (5% of 10k).  It wouldn't stack on raids as the shaman spells would simply overwrite eachother every time it landed.<br />
<br />
and/or<br />
<br />
- Add a heal over time which heals ONLY when it fades. 5k heal after 24 seconds for 200 mana.  Look up Clockwork Doom and replace the death touch with a +5k heal.  It wouldn't stack on raids because the spell would be overridden (or block subsequent casts, developer choice).<br />
<br />
and/or<br />
<br />
- Add a spell which causes 20% of the damage the target takes to go to the shaman pet.  Raids will unlikely invest resources keeping shaman pets healed, and the 30 second recast on pets keeps it from being a huge boon.<br />
<br />
I have to hope that shaman don't realistically want to be main healers in a place like riftseekers/the nest.  That our healing in MPG or lower (1k hitting) is sufficent with a ton of gears/aas and perhaps could be made easier for those without these abilities.  And that the best way to do this would be within the theme of a shaman.  Buffing.  It isn't by simply adding 40% to our direct heals and calling it a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">another note if we do the stances..  we should have a slow stance so makes our slows easier to land and a stance for healing..  No reason to have one of our stances be normal and other heal when druid get 2 unique stances damage and heal...<br />
<br />
I do not like the stance idea though not one bit..  maybe just upgrade our healing to be on par with Druid healing right now and let them get the new stances...  I cant afford to lower my usefullness as a slower or healer since I do both at the same time but with the stances one would be lower for 5 minute intervals....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I think stances would work fine if they didn't modify the slow that's cast, but just adjusted the healing based on the cap you accept.  You choose the &quot;Mostly&quot; stance, then your slows are all capped at Mostly Effective, and you heal a tad more than normal.  Choose &quot;Partially&quot; or &quot;Slightly&quot;, then your slows are capped there even on mobs that wouldn't otherwise be, but your heals get much more effective.  With that functionality, if you're playing somewhere that slow works, then you use the base coded healing, which is balanced.  If you're playing somewhere that you know slow will only work to Partial anyhow, then you take the &quot;Partial Stance&quot; and the heal spells adjust.<br />
<br />
As an additional balancing factor, make the stance-enhanced heals cost proportionately more mana, so that we get the additional healing per second we need without changing the healing per mana.<br />
<br />
edit: btw, I'd take my idea as a tiered AA ability, I wouldn't need it as a handout.  Activated on 5min timer 3/6/9/12 Mostly/Partially/Slightly/Immune.  At the final rank A:Wislik would have a base 3360 heal for 1k mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I don't care for the stance idea myself, but if people thinks thats what will work I'm willing to try it.  I am hugely in favor of the pet focus/aug thing though.  Dunno about the melee thing someone posted, I never have the time to melee unless I'm soloing, so personally it wouldn't quite be as much use to me, although its a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I kind've like the idea of stances just because they already have a mechanic in place they can use for implementation without breaking the game, namely the /disc thing.  The normal endurance cost of a stance wouldn't be any more than standing regen, but END-draining ae's would gain relevance to us poncy spellslingers.<br />
<br />
If, with my previous idea, the END cost went up some per level of adjustment, that would put a further limiting factor on how long Shaman could pour out the healing.  Given the size of End pools at the point in the game that the stances would become needed, the slow drain should probably put a capper on about 3-4 hours of enhanced heals.</div></div><hr />

Are enchanters given the choice to be able to mezz/charm more effectively or slow better?

From a design standpoint, they are given that option, Wastrel.  If a beastlord wanted to slow better but deal less personal damage and not buff mana regen, then they could instead be a shaman.</div></div><hr />

because druids are getting heal stances of course. I could care less if beasts or enchanters get a &quot;slow stance&quot; as well, I just do not see them using it much because it is not a class defining aspect for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Short on time, so here's my summary without explanation:)<br />
<br />
1.  Do not like the stance concept<br />
2.  Believe the only way to balance heals is to remove dps reducing debuffs from the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">And my opinion about the possible changes. Copied from another thread mostly.<br />
<br />
The stance approach seems to be the best one in my opinoin. I could imagine a<br />
- Healer stance, which should bring us close to druid healing i their healer stance and a<br />
- Melee stance maybe, for those who enjoy swinging that big hammer. Alternativly, or in addition a<br />
- Nuker stance with initiate spell speed and damage bonus.<br />
<br />
While in either of those stances, all of our slows are reduced by 50% (arbitrary number really, slowing is not our job in that case).<br />
<br />
This way the stackability of shamans on raids could be much improved as well. My guild can still field up to 10 shamans on a 50 person raid and heal and nuke is what most of us try to do in that case.<br />
<br />
In groups, enchanters and beastlords have finally caught up to shamans as slowers. Beasts because of the resist reduced slow and enchanters because the aggro on tash will be reduced. If I am with one of these classes in a group, or even a bard, I would happily assume a different role than slower. Main healer being my favorite choice, because that is what my shaman has been for long time and would like to be again.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to say that I really, really, really like this version of stances, and I dislike the binary slower/healer stances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Why don't they just make the damn beast lord into a shaman and a shaman into a damn cleric? That's all they are doing. Giving a bst an even BETTER slow, while doing nothing to ours? Instead, they are improving our heals so we can be a main healer? If i Wanted to be a silly cleric I would have made one instead of a shaman. <br />
<br />
I think they  should work on our slows, keeping us as the main slower like a shaman is suppose to be instead of making other classes be better slowers than us. A shaman is SUPPOSE TO SLOW, not be main healer in grps and such. Granted it's nice they are fixing our heals, but that is not suppose to be our jobs. This Stance thing, I didn't read it all the way through, but it sounds kinda silly to me from what I did read. As a lvl 70 shaman we should have gotten a new slow with the oow spells, should have a slow that isn't resistant, or at least not as resistant as our best lvl 50 something slow. Even with malos and other resistant buffs, I still get resisted a ton on the higher lvl mobs. The bst already has a good enough slow, like 74% or something like that slow??? Ours should always be better. The GoD one I hear is good, but it doesn't last as long, it's like a pre-slow, just like our other higher slows. Somethings wrong with that.  We been getting all these other slows, but turgurs is still our best and it's only lvl 50 soemthing??? Come on, get real, to me, this class balancing isn't right. They are changing classes rather than making them do what they are meant to do. With this, they might as well (Like I said,) just get rid of the shamans and make them into clerics cuz that's all this is doing imo....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Burrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Any possible groups that do not have access to a cleric-caliber rez will not regularly forego a cleric for a druid or shaman as MH.  Why do we have to homogenize the priests and make them more similar?  I like doing things now as a shaman that most groups turn to a cleric to perform.  In the long run, it is a barometer of how skilled you are playing your class or how well you ahve developed your character with AAs and quests and plain old hard work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I think the &quot;stances&quot; idea sucks for shamans.  I kind of like it for my boxed druid though, so I have nothing particular against stances.  It's just that I always felt that one of the big benefits to being a shaman is our ability to make a difference in an emergency.  Stances like the proposed one reduce that flexibility and make me a lot less capable of turning the tide in an emergency.<br />
<br />
I'd fix our healing by:<br />
 - increase our direct heals by 70% or so (make yoppa's heal 3000 hp)<br />
 - give us a better &quot;big slow 400-mana heal&quot; healing say 5000 hp or so<br />
<br />
Then address their desire that shamans not be able to be both slower and main healer in a group by giving our slow spells a bard-box recourse that reduces our healing by 40% minus 10% per level of slow mitigation.  You'd want the recourse to last for about the expected lifetime of a mob.  A minute or so would probably work.<br />
<br />
Net result:<br />
 - yoppa's mending heals for 3000 base hp<br />
  - if we successfully fully slow a mob, we'd be healing 1800<br />
 - if we successfully mostly slow a mob, we'd be healing 2100<br />
 - if we successfully partially slow a mob, we'd be healing 2400<br />
 - if we successfully slightly slow a mob, we'd be healing 2700<br />
 - with another slower doing the slowing, we'd be healing for 3000<br />
 - on an unslowable mob, we'd be healing for 3000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">As the person who inadvertantly started this discussion with my offhand comments about applying the proposed new Druid stances to Shamanic balancing, I should point that it was just that, an offhand comment. Put two and two (new stances and issues with Shaman stackability) together and look what can of mess it will land you in! :)<br />
<br />
I have little personal attachment to the concept as proposed and I am in no position to advocate it. I am a casual, mostly Bazaar equipped, 65 Shaman who did some raiding in his time, but rarely even logs in now due to RL. Certainly not someone to tell people with 4 times the /played time, twice the buffed HP and ten times the AAs how to change the class at that level. But if it starts a useful discussion, then all for the best :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I have to agree with the sentiment above.  They are making Bst more like Shm used to be, and making shm more like clerics.  <br />
<br />
I also agree that since we don't have rez nor CH, not matter what, we'll still be the third choice to play the healer role.<br />
<br />
And I also agree with some of the comments above about playing the main healer in general (and not liking it).<br />
<br />
A long time ago I posted this:<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20638<br />
<br />
Where I asked for more meaningful buffs, short term damage increasing buffs, and for healing to remain status quo (basically).  <br />
<br />
I like being a class who brings dps and stability to a group.  While I can main heal now in a variety of content, its never something I want to do unless there is no other choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I am strongly opposed to any of the &quot;stance&quot; ideas.  The strength of the shaman class is the ability to bring a vast array of tools to a fight and our flexibility in using them.  Why would I ever want to lock out abilities for 5 minutes or longer when most fights last a minute or less?  To gain healing?  If I wanted to be a main healer I would have rolled a cleric or druid.  If so many have left EQ that another class needs to be bolstered up to provide healing then just give us better healing.  <br />
<br />
Slowing and healing are NOT logically related even though SoE thinks so.  If you think so then I suggest cleric and druid heals should be reduced by the degree a mob is slowed.  Of course that is nonsense but SoE and many shaman have bought into the idea our heals should be less because a mob is slowed.  <br />
<br />
Our main limitation is how many of our tools can be employed and how fast.  There is only so much we can do in one minute.  The fun part of being a shaman is selecting the best tools for the situation and using them effectively.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I see the ones who are in favor of the stances as people who would rather be playing a different class but don't want to reroll their toons and level them up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Maybe I'm a noob, but I'm pretty happy being a shaman.  I don't want to be main healer in zones like MPG or RS.  As it is with my mana pool I can do it in RCoD and WoS if I have to.  <br />
<br />
If i Wanted to be a silly cleric I would have made one instead of a shaman.  <br />
<br />
My feelings exactly.  I have a 22 cleric.  She is now my bazaar mule.  Don't wanna be healer.  Though I like being able to save the day if something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
I think they should work on our slows, keeping us as the maing slower like a shaman is suppose to be instead of making other classes be better slowers than us. A shaman is SUPPOSE TO SLOW<br />
<br />
I've always considered myself a slower and debuffer.  With a few nice DoT's and a pet for a little added dps.  <br />
<br />
I'm not the techincal type, I don't analyze what the spells do in relation to other classes.  I just like to have fun and play with what I have.  <br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I don't wanna get screwed over either.  But I think shaman is a pretty balanced class as it is.  As for the other classes, I can't really give an opinion because I've never leveled one high enough to matter much.  (have a 54 beast that i play with when I'm bored)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Kazim, that's the worst thing I've seen in any of these threads.  You say you want to be better in an emergency, but the change you propose would kneecap you in just such a situation, where you need to heal and slow.  The total effect of the changes in :<br />
I'd fix our healing by:<br />
- increase our direct heals by 100%<br />
- give us a better &quot;big slow 400-mana heal&quot;<br />
<br />
Then address their desire that shamans not be able to be both slower and main healer in a group by giving our slow spells a bard-box recourse that reduces our healing by 75% minus whatever amount the slow is mitigated for.<br />
<br />
Would be that when it matters, we'd heal for half what we do now.  You'd wreck shaman healing in the area where it was (is, I suppose, if you play in Luclin) balanced, for no return when it's unbalanced.  The only situation where your proposal improves things at all is when you don't cast slow on mobs, in which case you trade all your shaman power for less than the healing ability of a level 63 cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I don't like the idea of stances and frankly don't think it will work. The amount of slow mitigation can vary too much too quickly for it to be viable. If it's got a 5 minute reuse like they discussed for druids we wouldn't be able to switch fast enough to deal with differing mobs. Go to someplace like KT where the mobs range from fully slowable to partially slow for regular mobs and slightly slowable for named if memory serves. Tell me how we're gonna handle stances there with out being able to change it frequently. If we can change it frequently enough to deal with contant changes in mitigation by mobs we can change it frequently to min max and be much more effect healer than druids or possibly even clerics.<br />
<br />
Frankly I don't buy the fact that druids should heal significantly better than shaman just because we can slow. I understand that having both can be very powerful but it's also limited by the fact that you can't cast 2 spells at once and it takes time for mobs to get slowed and then start healing. That is also the time when you most need the healing. In hard situations the mob could kill the tank before your done slowing and can get to healing them and even they survive you've instantly got your self into a hole and are having to fire off several heals to catch back up. Slow aggro and heal aggro on top of that and we're left with no da or simular to try and survive aggro. The only place a shaman would end up slowing and healing even if he had the healing abilities would be someplace relatively easy where we can already do that.<br />
<br />
Additionally it's not like shaman are the only one's who can slow. We aren't even significantly better than a chanter or bst. If a group is doing something even remotely difficult they are going to have a healer and a slower. Shaman have no option at all to be the healer in that situation. It has to be a cleric or druid.<br />
<br />
Realistically the only viable way to balance shaman is by decreasing the effectiveness of slow. Easiest way to do this would to just have everything past x point mitigating slow to partially or slightly and adjust shaman healing drastically up at that point. I've always felt that there should be 3 viable healers just like we've got 3 viable tanks and that in order to be viable shaman and druids need to be 80 or 90% of clerics heals on the 3.75 sec heal spells.</div></div><hr />

You say you want to be better in an emergency, but the change you propose would kneecap you in just such a situation, where you need to heal and slow.  The total effect of the changes in :<br />
<br />
 ( my proposal )<br />
<br />
Would be that when it matters, we'd heal for half what we do now.  You'd wreck shaman healing in the area where it was (is, I suppose, if you play in Luclin) balanced, for no return when it's unbalanced.  The only situation where your proposal improves things at all is when you don't cast slow on mobs, in which case you trade all your shaman power for less than the healing ability of a level 63 cleric.<br />
<br />
/agreed<br />
<br />
I noticed that my description didn't match what I intended to propose.  Please take a look at my new proposal in the edited post.<br />
<br />
Under my current proposal, which actually does what I intended, the worse we'd heal is 1800hp with the &quot;fully slowed&quot; recourse going.  Yoppa's currently heals for 1785hp.  Under my proposal, in the absolute worst case, we'd heal for 25hp more than we do now.  In the common case, where mobs mitigate to &quot;partially slowed&quot;, we'd be healing for 2400.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Exin Krup Gutkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">The thing that concerns me most about a &quot;Stance&quot; for Shaman is this.<br />
<br />
Druids with their new stance have decidely two different roles.  They are either in a Heal mode or they are in a Nuke mode perfectly equating to defensive and offensive.<br />
<br />
If Shaman were to get a Heal mode and a Normal (or even Slow) mode we are in defensive and defensive both ways.<br />
<br />
We aren't changing our style at all...infact we are just keeping what we have now but juggling around how you want to do it.  Do you just want to heal or do you want to slow and heal?<br />
<br />
So what real difference is there here?  If you know the situation and mob you could switch to the more beneficial defensive mode.....but why should we have to worry about being in the wrong one when either way we are acting as a damage mitigation specialist.  It isn't like we are trading in damage mitigation ability for lots of offense like the Druid.  Being caught in the wrong defensive mode for a Shaman would be much worse...at least if you invite or know the Druid in group is going Nuke happy they won't be an effective healer, but a Shaman needs to be the defensive guy either way given the proposed stances.<br />
<br />
It is just asking us which way we would like to prevent damage, which in and of itself does nothing to help us.<br />
<br />
As stated before by many.  If a Druid joins the group almost assuredly there will be a slower.  Together then defensive Druid and the slower will mesh excellently.  If a Shaman joins a group they are either playing both, in which case they need help; playing the slower, and things go on as normal given a Druid or Cleric healer; or they are playing the healer with another slower.  Only in the last case can I see the stance working.  But how often does a group have an over abundance of slowers anyway?  And add to that, that unless we can trade in our slows for much better heals we are still not as effective as a Druid or Cleric acting as the healer.  Slows really need to be considered separate since they can't be preformed at the same time as a heal unless two different characters are present, and slows are considered standard and a 'go no where without' tool.<br />
<br />
Playing the role of both healer and slower is already putting the Shaman at a disadvantage because they are expending the mana and time for both and can't be doing both simultaniously.<br />
<br />
Back to my main point though, stances for us are like choosing from two forms of the same thing which gets us nothing in the end.  Where as Druids choose from two totally separate roles on oposite ends of the spectrum we would be playing the same hand of cards shuffled different ways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slowing and healing are NOT logically related even though SoE thinks soYes they are.  It's clear they are.  It's clearly been a factor for over 3 years now since we got access to the complete healing type of spells, and was known even earlier than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">More my comment was aimed at the reasoning SoE used for the problems attempting to balance the shaman, and how Enchanters, nor Beasts, nor even Bards (which granted would be an entirely different can of worms) which all have slow themselves, are not considered as being problematic. It's the reason they put forward itself, that I really question.<br />
<br />
The idea of stances, I'm not sure either which way I'd be interested in seeing it go. I'd want to see a lot more information on the idea and how it would be implemented before I'd feel comfortable with a vote on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Some of you are complaining about the idea that having stances added will somehow limit your versatility.  That's a joke.  The addition of the difference stances would increase versatility.  Nothing says you have to use a stance.  You are perfectly capable of staying the way you are now and not use the stance.<br />
<br />
Currently we have:<br />
normal mode.<br />
<br />
With the addition of any stances we'd have:<br />
normal mode<br />
healer mode?<br />
melee mode?<br />
other mode?<br />
<br />
The point of the healing stance is that when normal mode, no matter how hard you try, if it is statisticly impossible for you to function as a main healer in a group, you will be able to function.<br />
The point of the melee stance is that when in normal mode, no matter how hard you try, the resist rates of the mobs make it nearly impossible to do any type of meaningful damage whatsoever and allow you to actually do some damage in an alternate way.<br />
<br />
I am actively for the stance idea to improve the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I posted in the other thread, I'll post here - I would like to see something that heals according to how fast a mob is swinging.<br />
<br />
One option is a proc buff on the mob where the mob procs a heal<br />
<br />
The other option is some sort of &quot;ward&quot; buff on a group member where each time they are hit, a self heal procs onto them.<br />
<br />
Then, the slowability of the mob plays a role in determining the effectiveness of our healing.<br />
<br />
I don't like the stance idea.  I honestly dont see how each stance is really different.  If you are trading strength in slows for strength in healing, are you assuming another slower is in group then so they can slow and you can heal?  If we are losing the ability to slow, how are better heals really helping us unless they were disproportionately better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">In my case, I am the healer and the slower. I can not be choosing between the two like that. I have a small grp that I am normally in at all times. Mage, bard and warr. I am the only one that keeps those three dudes alive and making sure the mobs are slowed. This stance thing would not work for me if that is the case. Granted the bard can slow, but even then my slow is still better than his, also lets him open up another song if needed.<br />
<br />
I don't like being main healer. In the little grp I'm in now it doens't bother me as much, but I don't want to be main healer if I was to lfg and end up in a random grp like say MPG, or RS. <br />
I'm just now at the point to where I can heal the warr i'm with now and have it actually heal. <br />
<br />
 But none the less, to have the stance thing for us, I would have to say no. It would be to much of a henderance for us. Hell, I think it would hender the druid as well. The whole idea doesn't seem right at all in general.<br />
<br />
I would rather have better slows, (like an upgrade to turgurs, make it like .. i dunno, 85% slow, less resistant, easier to land.) debuffs whatever than become a MH in grps. Granted healing doesn't get resisted, and i don't mind being back up healer in raids which is why it's nice that they want to improve our heals. <br />
But, at the same time, I don't want to be in the CH chain for raids, then turn around and get yelled at cuz I'm not able to buff or slow a mob because I'm the CH chain. That's where this is leading, I can almost see it now. If we have heals as good as the druid, the druids are already in the chain, that's where we'll end up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I still dont see why our heals should be balanced based on slows but other classes are not.<br />
<br />
Lets take Riftseakers, my favorite hunting spot, as an example.<br />
<br />
When the group is formed there WILL be a slower in the group and the Main Healer a cleric, but his heals are not adjusted just because there is a slower in the group.  <br />
<br />
Same way for druids; if a druid is Main healer in WoS and there happens to be a slower in the group does the druids heals get penalized?  No.<br />
<br />
When a vast majority of groups have some kind of slower would not all healers pay a healing penalty for slows?<br />

A trade off between slowing effectively or healing effectively is a bad idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a slight problem with what you say Juujuu... and that is when EQ first started, there was no similarity in healing abilities when comparing a Cleric to a Druid or Shaman.<br />
<br />
The Cleric has always been the mainstay healer of EQ, no buts about it. If you wanted to be a healer, you made a cleric, period.<br />
<br />
The Shaman and Druid have had quite a few changes to the class over the years, with the Druid taking a more prominent role as being able to be the main healer in groups, while Shaman did not have this ability in 'non-trivial' content.<br />
<br />
Shaman may have been defined as a priest class, but in non-trivial content are far from being a 'priest class'. So, people wo say 'if I wanted to be a main healer I would have rolled a cleric or druid' are completely justified in saying such things, although Druids came into their healing ability late in the development of EQ.<br />
<br />
SoE is trying to make the Shaman class into something it was never originally intended to be, and to an extent, the same thing is happening with the Druid.<br />
<br />
The Shaman today is getting back to what I imagined a Shaman to be (with the introduction of SotL and SotP, and I think SoE should pursue that avenue with the Shaman class instead of making us 'better healers'.</div></div><hr />

It would be nice for druids, but i don't feel it would be of much use to me as a shaman.  What seems to be left out here is that our main function is not that of a main healer but a patch healer.  I am not looking for increases in my healing power. With Yoppa's and PoP Ability AA's in Healing maxed, i do just fine with healing.<br />
<br />
I would much rather see an increase in power to my Nukes / DoT's before i would want a increase in my healing line of spells.  We are supposed to be pure casters, yet hybrid melee dps classes get nukes that are = to ours.  A Simple lower of cast time, and maybe even lowering the mana of our ice line nukes would be a nice change.  Or the possibility of a new line of nulkes beyond our Ice and Poison, like Fire or Magic.<br />
<br />
I myself like the new DoN spells and where they have gone with that.  adding an unresitable proc to melee in groups has already increased the want for a Shaman in a group.<br />
<br />
That being said i was rather dissapointed to see that Beastlords would be recieving a slow that is going to be higher % and have a less <br />
resistant rate, while Shamans did not recieve such a spell.  Balance of the Nihil our GoD spell is not easily obtained for casual players and thus they are stuck with Turgurs.  I am not asking for a slow that Slows for some ridiculous amount like 100%, my idea would be simply that our existing slows, land for a higher mitigation then other slowing classes beyond just the simple % we have over the base of the spell, i.e. 10% over Beastlords.  So where a Beastlord would land a partial slow, a Shaman could land a Mostly, etc.<br />
<br />
The problem with Shamans as healers, is there are virtually no mobs EP +, or in 65+ OoW / DoN zones that are fully slowable, so by the time we land our slows tanks are near dead, and we are forever catching up do to slow cast times.  Maybe somethign along the lines of a 50, or even a 40% unresistable slow would work in those situations.  That way we could slow on Incomming, heal, then cast our debuffs bigger slows.<br />
<br />
These aren't the exact way i want to see things, these are just my suggestions but something along these lines would make me 1 happy shaman.<br />

I'd have to disagree with that. Clerics shaman and druids where much closer in healing upon release than the would be even after the proposed changes for druids. On original release clerics shaman and druids all got the exact same heals with the exception of CH. Shaman and druids just got them one spell level later than clerics did. Otherwise the classes where identical in healing ability. CH wasn't ment as a combat heal back then and wasn't usable in alot of situations. Simply because tanks didn't have the hps to survive that long. CH didn't become a useful and eventually unbalancing heal until after an expansion or 2 later and mudflation hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being a priest doesnt necessarily mean being a healer. I dont hear anyone claiming that being a melee means being a tank, or being a caster means being a nuker. You are making up definitions to suit your own arguments. Shaman have traditionally been buffers/debuffers who could also heal. He chose his class in the role it was clearly intended for, and so did I. I have no regrets at all, Mokara has allways been what he is supposed to be, its just sad that you have apparently never felt the true power of shamaness. If you think that you are supposed to be a main healer, you might be a Shaman, but you know nothing about being a shaman ;). Until Luclin both druids and shaman were poor healers, you might not think so but I have tanked in front of those folk during that era, and trust me, both classes were pale imitations compared to clerics, particularly druids, since at that time their mana regen capabilities were a major issue. Shaman were a bit better if they didnt need to slow as well, due to their ability to canni. They both excelled at damage over distance fights, or a secondary healers, but not in close range ones as primary healers. After Luclin (and the healing revision that took place just prior to the release of Luclin) both classes became viable, but even then, it was never the intention that either class would become primary healers, both were intended as secondary healers who could perform that as the primary function under some circumstances. Outside of secondary healing, druids had the major role of dps with a minor role as buffers/debuffers, and shaman had the major role of buffer/debuffers and minor role of dps. True, those roles were not spelled out clearly prior to late Velious/early Luclin, but during that period they most certainly were. Taking a revisionist approach based on rosy recollections of a past that never existed is not a sound approach.</div></div><hr />

it isn't whining, SoE wants to know what our class thinks about this stuff.  people are giving feedback, and it hasn't degressed into name calling or personal insults.  people are giving honest feedback and rebuttles to other's points.  i don't like stances for shaman, and am an advocate for a minor healing increase + new spells for old dead spell lines.  griz, well as SoE, asked and i gave my opinion just the same as others are doing.  <br />

and with Druids n Shammy's getting heals one spell set later thats 4 - 5 lvls. where by the time you got your new heal it was trivial in the new hunting spots.<br />

<br />
For a shaman to MH we need something to keep the MT alive while we are trying to malos, slow, etc.  A heal proc or ward would do this.  A proc cast on the mob would be a problem because we would need to get the proc on the mob first then try to slow while the mob is still incoming.  Almost impossible to do in most content.  If it is cast on the MT like a ward then it looks a lot like a HoT.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps the best solution that fits with shaman abilities would be a bolstered HoT or a HoT with a heal kicker at the end.  This HoT would then be our main healing tool with our blast heal used to patch as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">It's easy to be MH with what we have now. Don't need all that jazz. Just throw Breath on the tank in the grp b4 the mob gets pulled. The tank is being healed over time while your slowing the target. Once the Target is slowed, you go back to healing. Or whatever you do. For me, I have a mage in my grp that I hang with all the time, he malos so that's one less thing I have to worry about. But, for those that don't have that, The HoT on the tank b4 the target gets the grp works just the same. <br />
<br />
HoT-malos- slow.. <br />
By then, your free to heal the tank and he'll need it.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with the duration of the panther/leopard spell. I know it was meant for a short term boost. But, to have to cast it on people like in a raid every minute is pretty pathetic. There are other things we need to worry about than casting a spell every minute on so many people. <br />
<br />
I'm so not complaining about the spell it'self. I love the spell, it's a huge improvment, just the duration part of it I don't like. <br />
<br />
As for the heals/slows/nukes all that jazz..... I'm actually happy with the heals we have now.. finally.. will admitt we could use a faster cast time on our heals, (like quick heals.) Other than that, with Breath/yoppa + AA's the heal is fine imo. <br />
<br />
Slow on the other hand. .. I'm pretty disapointed as to where our slows have gone. In EQ version we are meant to be main slower, yet our best slow is a lvl 50 something turgurs?? WOW. Even the GoD spell doesn't compare to tugurs to my understanding. It doesn't last as long and it's basically meant to be a preslow. (don't have the God version so can't totally say. ) Just off hearsay.) Honestly, I'm tired of the all preslows we've been getting, watching the beasts and chanters get 70% something slow that casts much faster and lands far more with less resists than our does????? What gives?  Hell I've had chanters tell me, if I can't get the slow to stick to tell them and they'll slow whatever mob?!?!?!? I don't think so!! To me that is bs.<br />
<br />
As for nukes.... Honestly, I don't really nuke that much. I Dot and such when I can, but during a raid, I'm to busy buffing/slowing adds/ back up healing the grp when the cleric is in the Chain healing the MA. Curing whatever AE has been casted from the raid mob... Really no time in there for me to put mana into nukes. I use em in my little grp I have, and solo.. nukes will break root, so I end up using DoTs there too.. but other than that... I don't care what happens to our nukes.<br />
<br />
The puppy, I've been playing for like 4yrs now and I'm still trying to figure out what the dog is for. Use him to solo, but the higher mobs in like GoD, or even oow, the puppy can't handle those even when slowed, I end up doing the root/rot deal. I would love it if they did something with our puppy. Maybe not quite as strong as the mage pet, but give us AA's or something to improve the dog. Oh wow, I can click off whatever buff i don't want on him. oooooo... I can provide him with grp buffs.. oh my!!  That doesn't really help the the solo'ing shaman, I tend to solo sometimes just because I don't like looking for random grps anymore and I used to depend on my puppy, it's hard to do now.<br />
<br />
These are some of the things I would like to see improvment on. As for buffs, with the oow ones out, I don't have much to complain about those. Some of them do us no good, but I like what they have done with those. (Like GoD though, they should make the 69-70 spells a little easier to obtain. /sigh..) <br />
<br />
Beyond that I don't see how they can base our heals off our slows, calling us a problematic class to balance. Like it's been said, other healers don't get penalized for having the mobs slowed, why should we? Makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

Sure, but it wasn't simply a matter of who got the spells when. Clerics didn't spend as much mana and a cleric healed for a greater amount, even though it was the same spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Until Luclin both druids and shaman were poor healers, you might not think so but I have tanked in front of those folk during that era, and trust me, both classes were pale imitations compared to clerics, particularly druids, since at that time their mana regen capabilities were a major issue. <br />
<br />
Complete, Utter and Total Nonesense.  I totally refute your assertion regarding shaman healing capabilities in the luclin and velious era.  (Druids sucked pre the Incomplete heal - but that is a druid issue, this is a shaman board)<br />
<br />
You are wrong.  You are so wrong you have no understanding of the game at that time.  Were you playing in Velious/Luclin era at all?  If you were you certainly had no idea of what was going on, or what well equipped characters were capable of.  <br />
<br />
Luclin and Velious I was main healer for any group.  I could make any group of 5 people plus me function as a **** hot XP group (I stress the any part).  The Shaman was the most single most powerfull healer of any class - if they had their spells.  I had my spells.  Malo, Torpor, Turgors, Regen, Chloroblast, Canni4.  <br />
<br />
I owned the content so hard it was unreal.  Druids until the introduction of the incomplete Heal were pathetically weak healers.  Groups would choose me over a cleric, every time, every single time, no contest.  <br />
<br />
In the era of Luclin/Velious shaman were the most powerfull healer, hell, we were the most powerful character in the game.  Anyone who says differrently is either an idiot or a liar.  <br />
<br />
I would make groups in Velks Lab, me + 5 casters (or anything). I would pull with malos and slow the mob on inc.  i would tank the mob and hold aggro (poison dot, cripple), with Torpor up, slowed mobs could not make me lose HP.  I would never run out of mana.  <br />
<br />
PoP changed all of that.  PoP with the four or fivefold damage increase of mob damage meant that my HoT was relegated to pathetically insufficient healing.  My healing did not keep pace, to have kept pace, I should have had an 800hp/tick heal in the pop era.  My ability to tank mobs IN TEH FACE was totally removed.  <br />
PoP made clerics the greatest healers, and made shaman also rans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">&quot;Even the GoD spell doesn't compare to tugurs to my understanding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nihili cast time is 1.5 seconds with a built in -40 MR check. Its by far the best slow in the game. Fastest slow for enc's is 3.0 seconds off their time clicky. Bst slow is fast, yeah, but with no way to debuff, it isn't very effective.<br />
<br />
After bst get their (probably) 1.0 second cast, neg resist check slow mentioned in the balance article, I'm guessing that nihili won't be &quot;the best&quot; anymore. Sure, nihili will be 75% whereas the beast slow will remain 65% (I guess), but that 10% doesn't mean squat when the mob mitigates.<br />
<br />
Really, the only advantage slowing that we shaman will have (in a group encounter) is our TA. Nihili slows 90% of the group content without malos as is. If bst get something as powerful...well.. who cares I guess, but its still just one more relative weakening of the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Being a priest doesnt necessarily mean being a healer. I dont hear anyone claiming that being a melee means being a tank, or being a caster means being a nuker. You are making up definitions to suit your own arguments. Shaman have traditionally been buffers/debuffers who could also heal. He chose his class in the role it was clearly intended for, and so did I.<br />
I chose a shaman because I wanted to play a primitive race and wanted to bea healer. The shaman class description said they were the clerics of their races. And that was what I did in groups: heal, and occassionally throw in damage whenever I had leftover mana.<br />
<br />
If you think that you are supposed to be a main healer, you might be a Shaman, but you know nothing about being a shaman ;). Until Luclin both druids and shaman were poor healers, you might not think so but I have tanked in front of those folk during that era, and trust me, both classes were pale imitations compared to clerics<br />
 :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I outhealed clerics preKunark. Not by all that much, mind you, but noticeably so. After Torpor I outhealed clerics easily, by a factor of 5 or more. Same deal for Velious and Luclin. Sure, clerics got a HoT and a more efficient CH (thanks to tank HPs). Of course I got upgraded regen spells and canna and a longer fight duration. Clerics got groups because of rez and because of being the second best healer. Was that balanced? Hello, no. But don't tell me I could not heal in the prePoP era when a shaman outhealed an entire group of clerics in the right content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">heres my idea to fix the &quot;revisions&quot;<br />
<br />
1. i think we should be the only class with an above 50% slow... give beast 35 and chanters 45%.. and thats it... <br />
<br />
2. give us a heal that can make a tanks health bar move + without us having to spend 35+ aa's to get a 5k heal... maybe make our yoppa's mending or the next heal in the line(cant remember the name) a 3000hp base heal.. keep the casting time the same keep everything the same.. but FFS give me a heal that mobs dont laugh at.. or that i have to chain cast to get a tank back up to Full life.. i have all my healing aa's including oow maxed out.. and my best heal is still laughed at by druids/ clerics.. christ PALLYS even crit heal for more than i do</div></div><hr />

Bst's best slow is 65% period. A bst may have told you there best slow is 200% and the mob actually heals the tank while beating on them but that doesn't mean it's accurate.<br />

<br />
BST slow is 65% - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3462&amp;source=Live. <br />
<br />
Turgurs is 6.5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Nihil is 1.5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The only reason you, as a shaman, might feel like you have no place is because you don't take the time to either get your spells or understand what they do.<br />
<br />
Nihil is an awesome spell, combined with TA it rocks.... without TA it rocks...<br />
<br />
Still, that pesky 74% BST slow almost made you quit, I feel bad for you when you find out about the paladin slow, you'll **** your pants.</div></div><hr />

I take the time to get the spells, and i know what they do. Just lately the spells have not been easy for me to get. I tend to get crappy grps, therefore I don't lfg anymore, or as often. I never get invited to high end grps like RS and such, Just not as popular I guess. I can spend hours lfg and get nothing.

Thanks guys , good stuff .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Tehya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I agree with several points here.<br />
<br />
1) We do need better, more efficient, heals 65 +<br />
<br />
Forget about mitigating our heals because we can slow and druids cannot.  There's so many classes that can slow almost as effectively as we can, the difference in hitpoints saved per fight by our slow is nominal.  <br />
<br />
Ask any cleric or druid to group but, first, tell them you don't have a slower... watch how quickly they /afk, /quit, or suddenly have something better to do.... like burn their house down.  You are not going to get many druids willing to heal at these levels and in the appropriate level zones without a slower, so to put a harsher penalty to us because we happen to be able to slow does not make practical sense to me.<br />
<br />
All that &quot;stances&quot; and recourse effects would do is put the Beastlord or Enchanter as the primary slower in the group and force the shaman to play cleric.  Bah!<br />
<br />
An improvement to our heals that would allow us to serve as decent backup healers in intense encounters would please me.  Make our current heal's cast time faster or even increase the healing hitpoints a bit to be more in line with the massive growth of tank hitpoints or mob dps.   Either of those things would be an improvement.<br />
<br />
I realize the &quot;majority&quot; of the most vocal on this board feel they should be able to fill the roll of main healer.  However, I do NOT want to be a bad &quot;wanna-be&quot; cleric.  I do NOT want my Shaman perceived as a replacement for a cleric, or even a druid for that matter. Rather, have the shaman working as a compliment to either of those classes in a group.  I add my name to list of those that say they would have rolled a cleric if they wanted to be a main healer, in any situation.  I quit playing my 65 druid for this very reason, as it's not my playstyle.<br />
<br />
2)  Burst DPS  - Spirit of Leopard/Panther<br />
<br />
This was the right direction for Shaman in my humble opinion.  Will a group choose a shaman vs. XYZ class to fill an open slot for dps?   It's probably going to be a even draw now with these spells, but isn't that the point?  To advance this further will definately inspire the hawking and squawking of the other dps classes, unless, of course, they receive a bump first. /wink  <br />
<br />
But, I think the possibilities for this type of dps should be explored further.  I am already literally bleeding to death to canni as much hitpoints for mana as possible to maintain slows, backup heals, buffs, dots/nukes and now here is SoL.   I feel busy in the group again and I love it!   It adds another choice to playstyle and functionality of shaman and I believe that short term attack buffs could be the niche that I would enjoy.   <br />
<br />
How about expanding the options, say by adding pet only atk buff for more damage and compensating that with a higher mana cost?  I would likely use that more often as I know exactly when my pet is on the mob,  where that melee class I just blew 540 mana on is standing there picking his nose and not attacking (or stopped to /ran on that rune drop).<br />
<br />
Just my humble thoughts on this, as I rarely post on these forums....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Well, the guild I'm in now is doing a lot in GoD, so perhaps someday I'll get it. Though we are in qvic/texvu now, haven't seen many runes drop cept for ancient type spells. Would be nice if it was questable/easier to gain. Kinda like the 69-70 spells which I have none of those either for the same reasons. Now I hear that the rune drop rate for those spells has been nerfed, which makes it harder to gain. + the DoN expansion makes it harder to get grps cuz everyone is wanting to do DoN... /sigh... I'm patient though, just frustrated is all hehe..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">1. I totally hate the idea of any type of slow stance unless it will make slows unresistable.  If we go the stance route then it should be Healing or DPS modes.  Slows shouldn't be effected in either case.<br />
<br />
2. Our pet still needs an HP boost and shaman need to be added as a class on pet focus items.  Shaman are a pet class!  Our nukes really suck and DoT's take too long and pull too much aggro to be really useful in exp groups.  So I depend on my pet to be my dps in an exp group situation.  The dual wield fix was great but his hp is still way too low.  He shouldn't be able to tank for the group but he needs to be able to take a couple hits when we get an add or something.  If beastlords can get a better slow why cant we get a better pet.<br />
<br />
3. Rabid Bear needs to be totally revamped.  An hp boost while using it would be nice.<br />
<br />
4. I would rather get a boost in debuffs or dps than in healing.  The end effect is the same but we get something to distinguish the class instead.<br />
<br />
5. This one isn't my idea but one I read and liked.  Since you keep sticking alchemy components on the forage table yet most shaman can't forage how about you give shaman a new skill called 'Find Herb' that works like forage but will only result in alchemy items.  That way it won't interfere with foragers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Brokkem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">My thoughts:<br />
<br />
1) Make Nihil's available from vendors or from a mob more readily accessible to most shamans.  I empathize with how hard some had to work to get this spell, but I think slow is the signature of shamans, and this is our only serious upgrade since Turgur's.  Either that or put the BL new slow deep in GoD and let them savor the same fun shamans had to go through to get it.  <br />
<br />
2) I too would like to see an increase to our quick heal, the 3k number tossed around seems fair given the HPs of MTs nowadays. I dont really want a bigger CH, personally I would prefer being free to cast 2-3 different spells than be locked into a 10 sec CH because I have one.  <br />
<br />
3) I think between SoL/SoP and decreased poison dot aggro that fixed our DPS concerns. <br />
<br />
4) I am really not in favor of the whole &quot;stance&quot; idea, although if it was forced on us, I would have to say I liked Brohg's version the best, with the stances mirroring the mitigation levels of our slow.<br />
<br />
In general, I would like to see the developers emphasize/focus on the debuffing/slowing aspect of shamans and less on the &quot;underprivileged healers&quot; side.  This is not to say that I wouldnt like more healing, but if I had to choose, I would rather have NO healing increase and know that my role as the premier slower class would stay the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">I do not agree fixing our healing will solve the slow Mitigation problem.<br />
Those are TWO separate problems for the Shaman class and I believe they will never balance.<br />
Shaman class is lacking a reasonable healing ability and getting worst even if you dont consider the slow mitigation issue.<br />
<br />
I do not agree the stance idea at all but here is my idea.<br />
<br />
When our slow hit the mob no matter landed or not, the game will do the following: <br />
When mob Mostly slowed, your healing spells remain 100%<br />
When mob Partially slowed, your healing spells will become 150%<br />
When mob Slightly or immune slowed, your healing spells will become 200% <br />
<br />
Going for the extreme, when your slow hit the mob:<br />
When mob Mostly slowed, you remain as a Shaman<br />
When mob Partially slowed, the game change you into a Durid<br />
When mob Slightly or immune slowed, the game change you into a Cleric.<br />
<br />
Nay.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea that when slow lands - there will be an effect the spell itself will make the mobs attack with a healing effect on the PC it is hitting, if the mob mitigation slow. <br />
Or simply make our slow mitigate the mobs attack value when the slowing effect is mitigated. <br />
<br />
PS: Please fix Shaman nuke cast time, define Shaman as a true pet class, fix our pet, reduce our dot argo and cast time etc</div></div><hr />

No one enjoys little yellow text that says &quot;you mostly suck&quot; or &quot;you slightly suck&quot; while trying to contribute in a group.<br />
<br />
ROFL, I cant get over how funny this is.  I never thought of it that way before.   :D <br />
<br />
 Anyways, after reading everyones posts, I have noticed something.  <br />
 It has just been SOOOO long since we were ever considered an actual group healer, that most of you have permanantly swiched your playing styles, and liked it.  I am not saying that is bad, but we may want to totally re-evaluate the direction in which we want to have the Shaman class go. For instance ; <br />
<br />
- Instead of trying to bring our healing capabilities back to where it once was, perhaps it might be better to take a step in the &quot;mob control&quot; role.<br />
<br />
- Or, maybe we want to continue in the path of a DPS role, by perhaps giveing shaman &quot;pet focus items&quot;  or added abilities given to our pet.<br />
<br />
 Just keep in mind, this &quot;class re-invisioning&quot;  is a one way ticket.  Once it is done, thats it.  So, do we truely want to go back as being main healer in a group, or do you guys see Shaman as something else??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I definitley don't envision the Shaman as a main healer in non-trivial content.<br />
<br />
When the game first started, I saw the Shaman as a mix of Healer/buffer, melee, and enchanter.<br />
<br />
Now... well, I honestly don't know what to think. We can heal somewhat in a pinch (non-trivial content), the enchanter part of the Shaman is gone (Charm), but we still have buffs (99% being placebo's), some DPS in the form of DoTs and SotL and SotP, and we can still CC when needed, just differently.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the Shaman:<br />
<br />
1. Developed further with buffs that actually do something. Sense and Fortitude are good examples. Buffs with a function.<br />
2. Get slightly increased healing, but not much. I do NOT want to be made into a healer type priest class.<br />
3. Shouldn't be getting their abilities farmed out to other classes. I don't give a crap how much other classes whine about it. Once slow got farmed out to so many classes, Shaman took a big hit across the board. I think that Classes with Slow need to be re-examined and truly balanced in terms of how well their slow works.<br />
<br />
Other planned changes may help overall with the Shaman, so I am kind of holding my breath until additional details are given relating to the class revisions.<br />
<br />
I also don't want to see a massive whine fest over class envy as a result of these coming changes, but it's going to happen, so may as well brace yourself for it now.</div></div><hr />

I guess it doesn't matter where we came from.  Lets focus on where we want to go.  For me, I'd rather NOT be considered a MH in non-trivial content.  I have enough to do already.  <br />
<br />
I would, however, like an adequate enough blast heal, to always be able to step in and support a real main healer.  The big gripe in GoD content, when we really started pushing for more heals, was that our blast heal couldn't even keep a tank up if we spammed it (like if the cleric or druid died).  Likewise, with no group hot, if the cleric were having a hard time keeping the MT alive, and it was our job to heal the other 2-3 players taking damage, we just couldn't do it.<br />
<br />
We got our group hot via our epic, which helped some.  They boosted our single hots by mucho, which helped a lot also.  The last remaining piece, for me, is an increase in our blast heal relative to a druids.  250-350 more hp on Yoppa and I'd be happy with our heals.<br />
<br />
(Thats all based on dps reducing debuffs remaining in the game.  Their erradication, thereby allowing a true balancing of heals to take place, is another argument entirely, and one I support, but since it won't happen, I'll go with a bigger blast heal).<br />
<br />
1.  Bigger blast heal<br />
2.  Stronger less resistable VP<br />
3.  An emergency self buff or &quot;get out of jail free card&quot; of some sort.<br />
4.  Continuing to develop non stat related buffs<br />
5.  Shorter duration dots<br />
6.  More HP on dog dog and better chance to enrage<br />
7.  Some buff(s) to help casters<br />
8.  Reduced refresh time on malos<br />
9.  No foraged components for alchemy <br />
10. Upgrade to speed and attack of bihili<br />
<br />
If I got all that, I'd feel pretty balanced:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">You're pretty much going to find a sharp divide amongst shamans over healing.  Those in solid guilds with regular groups generally dont want to heal better, they want to do other things.  Those that have to lfg want heals.  Healing is almost always the limiting thing to find or put together groups.  Improved healing alone may not alter that too much though.  Most people running around eq wouldn't wipe their arse without a cleric there to rez in case the paper was sharp.  Dont get me wrong, more healing would help, but just more healing won't end cleric dependance.<br />
A few things I'd like to see...  <br />
Upgrade Billy. Seriously, its time.<br />
Dont balance healing -vs- slows.  Its just stupid.  How many clerics work without slowers?  If anything shaman are at a big DISadvantage because of slow.  Clerics and druids dont have to malos/slow before healing.  Shamans cant take an average tank and be effective because we're waiting so long to slow.<br />
Alchemy, foraging.  Just not a great combo....<br />
Overall reevaluation of slows.  Maybe reduce the value of slows and rebalance mob dps to match.  Probably waaaay too big a job.<br />
<br />
At my level of play, eq and the shaman class are currently pretty good.  Sol/Sop really makes a big difference, since it gives you a completely different way to do things.  A nice tool in the arsenal.  A lot of what Brenlo had in his post sounds quite reasonable.  At least theres nothing there that immediately outraged me, and I'm a hothead :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Why don't they just make the damn beast lord into a shaman and a shaman into a damn cleric? That's all they are doing. Giving a bst an even BETTER slow, while doing nothing to ours? <br />
The reasoning is that we shamans have Malos and Nihil (for a total of 95 off a mob's MR). Enchanters have Howl of Tashan (-50 MR) and a 70% slow instead of a 75% one, whereas beastlords get a 65% slow with no way of lowering MR other than using a Tash stick.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine that any new slow for beastlords would stay at the 65% level and have a modest resist check, purely so they can actually slow mobs again (in Riftseeker's Sanctum and the like). Without going into the arguments of whether or not other classes should slow, it makes sense that if a class is given an ability they should be able to continue using it through the rest of the game - removing the Fear level cap looks to be along the same line of thinking.<br />
<br />
As for melee stances and the like, I used to be a big fan of shaman melee - heck, I still have a bag full of weapons, a fair bit of +ATK gear  and even a cleave aug. But however much you polish it, our melee will never even be close to hybrids and melee classes. For example, they have mainhand damage bonuses and are on a different damage table to casters after level 50 (and possibly before). Even boosting one's ATK to stupid levels (my record is just under 1900) doesn't really help that much - yes, you'll get more hits for the maximum but if a meleer wielded the same weapon they'd effortlessly hit for more as their damage caps are higher. <br />
<br />
It's a fact that casting Leopard on yourself will up your melee DPS far more than all the ATK buffs you can muster! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Sigh, here we go again, eh. <br />
<br />
Maybe I should pull out the &quot;Balance through AA&quot; threads, WOO WOO! (I still like that idea more than the &quot;stance&quot; thing)<br />
<br />
Personally, I wont be contributing that much to this debate this time around. I am satisfied with the niche in the game that I have. I am adequate at my role in groups and raids. I am not spectactular, nor do I suck. I guess I dont mind being just another bozo on the bus. <br />
<br />
SOE has an impossible job. There is no way they can make everyone happy with a class like Shaman. A quick glance through this thread will prety much tell you why. <br />
<br />
There is only one issue I would consider &quot;troubling&quot; enough to REALLY push for a solution, and that is emergency survivability. Other than that, /shrug, I am a reasonable healer, a reasonable buffer, a reasonable debuffer, and now with the DoN line, a reasonable DPS option. Am I saying there is no room for improvements in these areas? Of course not. Class Balance is a process, not an event. Its an evolving, changed, living thing. There is no black-n-white answers. Every single class is gray. I just feel that we have a pretty decent set up right now, and that SOE doent need to hear us RANTING about issues that arent really that bad. <br />
<br />
So mark me down as &quot;reasonably satisfied, except we need a Jolt-Rune-DA-FD-Evade ability of some kind&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">I have thought about it some more and hear is what would really make me happy:<br />

Bump Yoppa's up a little (Base: 2800)<br />
Give us a updated complete heal like druids currently have: (4950 base)<br />
Raise meele skillcaps on pierce,1 handed blunt and 2 handed blunt to 260<br />
Give us Double Attack.<br />
Raise bash cap to 220.<br />
<br />
We are battle priest let us meele. But be able to heal the way druids do now. They will still out heal us after the change but I don't care. Hell Clerics meele better than us atm, why is that?<br />

It's got real potential to be another signature Shaman ability. Non-stat related buffs (damage modifiers, etc.) are where it's at.<br />

2. Give us a better blast heal. I do not want to become a &quot;main healer,&quot; nor do I want to find myself added to any healing rotations. Ever. I just want something that will solidify my role as a solid, reliable BACKUP healer. I don't want to step on cleric/druid toes, but jeez ... I'm a priest, too.<br />
<br />
3. Either remove the foraged components from the alchemy recipe list, or give shaman (as someone suggested earlier) a &quot;Find Herb&quot; ability.<br />
<br />
4. I am completely and wholly against the idea of a &quot;stance.&quot; Improved healing or not, leave my slows alone -- unless you're going to give me the ability to make them unresistable or make a non-immune mob unable to mitigate them. <br />
<br />
Honestly? I'm a happy camper, overall. I like my class and I'm very satisfied with my abilities in groups and raids. I think the class is too versatile to ever be fully balanced against every other class. There are things that need improvement (like the above) but hell, I think we've got a pretty good deal going right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Fr0z3n</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">actually if they implementing the stance thingy i just wish they put slow / heals on same stance ( healing ) and dots / nukes ... on offensive stance<br />

since its mentioned in druid part that it will have a 5 min reuse or is it duration ? i mean wouldnt change anythin if they put slow / heals on differente stances slowin a mob for 40 % then healin for a little more wont make us efficient healers only in case theres another slower in grp :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">There is a slight problem with what you say Juujuu... and that is when EQ first started, there was no similarity in healing abilities when comparing a Cleric to a Druid or Shaman.<br />
<br />
The Cleric has always been the mainstay healer of EQ, no buts about it. If you wanted to be a healer, you made a cleric, period.<br />
<br />
sorry Aruman, this is so wrong it causes me physical pain. Shamans were excellent healers for many levels and until the PoP expansion. Second only to clerics and actually ahead of druids. When I made my shaman in the first week of Kunark, I wanted to be a healer firstmost. Shamans are the clerics of the &quot;primitive&quot; races&quot;, remember that description?<br />
<br />
I see another misunderstanding in this thread. As long as there is a cleric or druid in group or no second slower, there is no reason for a shaman to use a stance to assume any spezialized role! These stances are thought to increase our flexibility and stackability. Thats all. And that is something I consider a major improvement to our class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">My vote is no on the stance idea.<br />

Got a query tho.  With the new aa to add buff slots, and the 5 added buff slots from the DoN trial awards, what is SoE thinking?  I can see it for the SoL/SoP because it was an excitement (albeit a pained one on some Anguish Trials).<br />
<br />
So I went this way in the healing line.  (I currently can hit 6104 crit heal pretty regularly).  But what can kill me on a raid is the &quot;cures&quot;.<br />
<br />
Would there be any merit to having an RGC type HoT?  Preferably group?  Could be just a few ticks/timer, but buy me time to have a chance at saving some of the robes.<br />
<br />
Same goes for Curse HoT?<br />
<br />
Or an endurance HoT (limited time).  Could even be single target?<br />
<br />
Since I can back up heal in the higher end content, give me a niche role for adequately curing some of the crap you have thrown at us. <br />
<br />
That way I can still serve my role as a slower/debuffer, back-up healer, dps giver (by the way I wouldn't mind at all if you would let pet classes give their pets their own name and keep it).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Have ever actually compared the healing abilities of the shaman vs the druid vs the cleric?<br />
You do realize that the shaman is at one point the best healer of all 3 classes for a total of 5 levels.<br />
At level 24, clerics have greater heal.<br />
Shaman and druids both get greater heal at level 29.<br />
Hey look, we both have the exact same healing spells to work with.<br />
But wait!  Shaman also get their first regeneration spell at level 24.<br />
Clerics don't have a regen of any type.  They don't have a cannibalize of any type to regenerate mana faster.  They don't have any heal over time spells.  Shaman better healers from level 29-33 than clerics and druids who lack the extras besides.<br />
Clerics don't get better heals until level 34 when they get superior healing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying though.<br />
<br />
You are talking about now... I was talking about before they started making these changes to heals. Cleric heals at one point healed for more than a Shaman or Druid even though they were the same spell AND used less mana, so sure, in a way you have a point, but regardless of what you say, clerics are, and always will be (rightly so) the better healer for any situation. <br />
<br />
I'm not 100% sure on this because I don't play a cleric but I believe Clerics enjoy a lower mana cost for spells that are identical to Shaman and druids also. Mana cost for greater heal for a cleric and a shaman are not the same. It is lower for a cleric. I think that pretty much offsets any mana regen inequalities.<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't forget the words 'non-trivial content'. Your narrow focus on levels 29-33 is laughable. If you make a Shaman so you can be a better healer than a cleric or druid for a few levels... well, you are a bit misguided, to say the leaast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Mikar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">&quot;&quot;A fairly easy way of &quot;fixing&quot; it (assuming for the moment that we all agree that it needs fixing) would be to introduce a Shaman &quot;stance&quot; just like the Druids will be getting.<br />
<br />
Depending on the stance, you will be either a better slower or a better healer. If you are in the default (&quot;slowing&quot;) stance, then your slows and your heals remain as they are now. If you are in the &quot;healing&quot; stance, then your slows become less efficient (65%?), but your heals improve to make MHing more manageable. The same 5 minute &quot;stance cooldown&quot; would apply as it does (well, &quot;will&quot;) to the Druids' stances.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I see a problem with the cool down only being 5 mins though.<br />
Imagine wanting to do some named (after all, who cares about trash)<br />
<br />
a) <br />
turn on slow mode - wait 5 mins <br />
cast a HoT on the tank<br />
pull<br />
slow<br />
b) turn on heal mode<br />
heal<br />
<br />
Suddenly you just had your cake and ate it too. You were both a better slower AND a better healer.</div></div><hr />

I was talking about EQ well before any expansions. When *I* created my character, no one (except people who had been in beta for a long time) knew much about the later capabilities of any of the classes.<br />
<br />
In the original release (which is what I was talking about) the cleric was the better healer of the 3 priest classes. I didn't say a Shaman couldn't be a healer, I just said a cleric was the better healer. Heck, I made a Barbarian Shaman because a friend started a Barbarian warrior. We teamed up a lot with me being the healer for the group. I remember being the healer in LGuk and Cazic Thule also.<br />
<br />
Just remember that I never said a Shaman couldn't heal, I just said the Cleric was the better healer, and rightly so. It's what they were designed to do.</div></div><hr />

Back a while ago, we were considered &quot;the swiss army knife of classes&quot;.  (this was back when root was an effective tool for mob control, and there was no such thing as slow midigation).  Now, because of the dungens, caves, and other areas, where running around all over the place is not an option, our effectiveness at any type of mob control seemed to have been thrown out the window.<br />
<br />
I would rather see my self with the ability to have a form of mob control (in tight areas), then become main healer of a group.  For me personally, it would be more fun and it would add to my existing playing style. (not totally change it around).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started playing EQ with kunark ... The class discription I read was the one in the old RoK manual ... THAT is the discription of a shaman I signed up to play . While I do not have the exact text anymore it was certianly suggestive that shamans WERE a healing class . <br />
<br />

Just tossing my own veiw out there for you guys to see .<br />
Keep up the great feedback :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">I vote nay to stances.  Allowing druids to optionally nuke like a wizard or heal like a cleric might make them happy, but to me it just blurs the distinction between classes even more.  I like the flexibility I bring to a group and the tools we have to help the group survive.  I don't want any of those tools crippled by taking a &quot;stance&quot; so that I can be main healer in hard group content.<br />
<br />
As a class, shaman still have good group desirability.  We just need a little tweaking.  As has been mentioned multiple times in this thread, make me more and better at what I already am.<br />
<br />
- I was the first class to get spirit of the wolf. Why hasn't my sow been updated with more attack, plainsight and maybe EB.<br />
<br />
- A barb shaman from Halas should be able to freeze the nipples off a mob with my ice nukes. I've got two cold nuke focus effects yet I never ever load ice nukes simply because the cast time makes them impractical to use.  Lower the cast times on our bigger nukes. Spear of Yoppa is nice and fast but 1K is kinda light.<br />
<br />
- Healing, ahh healing. I believe we still need some help with out fast heals. As has been mentioned, our heals haven't scaled with Tank HP and mob DPS.  Giving us a 2500hp base, fast cast heal would resolve that.<br />
<br />
- DogDog is gimp.  He gets squashed way too fast.  He needs more HP.<br />
<br />
- and another pet peeve, I don't like the short timers on my buffs - extend the duration.<br />
<br />
- and whatever happened to charm animal, wheres my uber upgrade so I can play chanter?<br />
<br />
Iyanna - level 69 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">At 60th level, with a full spellbook shaman were the best healers in the game for XP groups in the Kunark/Velious/Luclin era.  We brought way more to the table than any cleric or druid (Malo, Slow, HoT, regen, haste, stat buffs, DoT's, Rains, Nukes, decent pet).  The only thing we couldn't do was rezz, we could do everything else, but nobody died in my groups.  <br />
<br />
When I stated a shaman I was the healer of the primitive races, that's what the book said - just like GrimbearEQ says.  <br />
<br />
PoP changed all that - PoP changed Shaman from being the best healers in the game to being the worst healers in the game.  <br />
Our heals did not scale to the DPS, <br />
our heal over time spells did not scale to the DPS, <br />
our slowing capability was reduced.  <br />
Our ability to offtank was lost due to AC and mitigation changes and healing reductions<br />
Our pet became a speedbump as it could no longer offtank for more than 10 seconds.  <br />
PoP destroyed shaman.  <br />
Expensions since PoP have continued this theme.<br />
<br />
Pre-PoP I was the most powerfull charcter in the game.  While it would be nice to go back to that, realistically it ain't gonna happen.  But my role as a groups healer should be restored.  <br />
<br />
Now back to the main point of the thread<br />
The vast majority of groups have slowers and healers<br />
Clerics and Druids heal against slowed mobs<br />
Their heals are balanced for doing exactly that.  <br />
Shaman heals should be the same.  <br />
Anything else is madness and will perpetuate the inequality between the priest classes.  <br />
<br />
That shaman can slow is one of the 'other' things we bring to a group, just like druids bring nukes, snares, tracking or cleric bring the best buffs, spell haste, mok/mor and XP Rezz.  <br />
<br />
Shaman need more healing and need more healing all the time.</div></div><hr />

While I see where you are coming from... I guess using that far fetched logic, we should have a better SoW spell than druids/rangers because at some point (the begining) we got SoW before the others... It's all a matter of opinion.  I guess that's why we get asked for Bih Li all the time as people click off thier FoE/SoE. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I didn't role up my Shaman as a main healer, but have MH'ed on occasion.  I like the versatility, but much rather prefer to be a buffer/debuffer that heals.<br />
<br />
The path the SOE seems to be heading is based on our buffing DPS spell line, SotL and SotP.  I liked the idea proposed to make Shaman more of a battle priest and up out combat abilities and pets... but I fear that the line between BST &amp; SHM would be even smaller than it is now. :( <br />
<br />
Now, if this is more or less the direction that we are heading, how are we gonig to MH and steadily keep the short duration buffs up on all of the melee/pets?<br />
<br />
Stance? NAY!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Maiviaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">Give us faster heals before anything else.  What I am seeing in most responses here is that people assume that raw heal power is the only aspect of healing that matters.  As a shaman in groups and on raids, I value the ability to land that blast heal on the people who are taking damage when they shouldn't be, or giving the primary healers some extra padding on a tank transition.  The little things like that make a massive difference and save a lot of deaths at any level of the game.  <br />
<br />
The aspect of this class that I love so much is our ability to take control of the situation when the **** hits the fan.  At the same time we can also provide solid dps and support when things are going smooth with panther, DoTs (when they are practical), buffs, and patch heals.  Like many have pointed out, the shaman class has evolved quite a bit over time.  With this evolution though, I have found my own style of play has developed as well and I have no desire to go back to what shaman used to be.  I find that there is rarely a dull moment as a shaman and I think faster heals is the best way to enhance our class in its current state.<br />
<br />
One other minor point that is completely unrelated to healing.  With the reworking of shaman buffs in OoW, I have found buffing to be much more time consuming.  It would be great if some of our buffs were consolidated.  Possibly merge fort and sense with focus as they are typically the buffs that get cast on everyone.  Or maybe merge fort, sense and might.  Constantly swapping buffs in and out gets old fast, and while it isn't a major class issue, it would take a lot of the tedium out of buffing.</div></div><hr />

Uh, no. Clerics got their heals a spell level earlier and they got their healing bonus. Shaman got canna and regen (and slow, but that was not nearly as useful as it became with turgurs). CH was not even in the picture, there were precious few melees you could get a better efficiency then a SH on. You might make a case for clerics being on par with shaman.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Kapakx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">I've enjoy playing the Shaman class since EQ first came out. I'm not a hardcore player, raiding every night or seeing very much end content. But when I do play, I play for 10-12hours at a shot. I've soloed, duo'd, trio'd, double boxed, grouped and raided. And over the years I have seen a steady decline in class verification. Some changes I have enjoyed, others, not so much. But I dislike the very idea of &quot;stances&quot; for our class. <br />
<br />
Our class is not easily defined. From my experience, we are BACKUP healers, Buffers/Debuffers, a pet class, qausi-melee and very versatile and utilitarian. And I enjoy that most about the class. I don't wish to see us pigeonholed into some specific role. I personally don't enjoy healing, I've played a druid and a cleric both to above 50 and I can honestly say, I dislike it. But I do like being able to save the situation if the cleric/druid dies.<br />
<br />
With the introduction of the Panther/Leopard spells and with OoW spells, I have begun to see an enjoyment of play that had seriously fallen since the introduction to the PoP era. The only way I see to maintain our versatility and still be SHAMAN, is to adjust what we have. <br />
<br />
If we need adjustments, and I think we do, then take an unorthdox aproach. Such as the heal proc as affore mentioned. Just take it farther, by adding things to it. I like the idea of being able to use the pet augs and the heal proc. I also would like to see the pet AA's added to our class. It wouldn't offset the balance to have our pets at least be 75% of the Beastlord/Mage/Necro's. I also liked the idea of taking the CH spell line we got and adding a higher level one. And what about adding damage mitigation to our slows? that would solve some of the quick healing problems we have. An AA to offset slow mitigation I think is also in order. If they are going to left everyone have the same lvl of slow, then at least let us slightly slow the &quot;immune&quot; mobs and mostly slow the &quot;slightly&quot; mobs and maybe even fully slow the &quot;mostly&quot; mobs. That would not only leave us our current place in groups, but also adjust the healing problem to some degree. Even just helping with the availability of spells for the casual or non-guilded character would severly improve our enjoyment of the game.<br />
<br />
Anyone one of those things is nowhere near enough, but together they'd mean a significant burst of versatility and str to our class without over balancing in areas the some of us don't enjoy. Preserve the Shaman as a CLASS, don't let them blend us together with everyone else like they are trying to do. If you want to heal, make a cleric or druid, if you want to let the pet do all the work, be a mage, if you want to nuke/dps, be a wizard. That's why there ARE different classes. But if you like the shaman class and always have, then don't try making it something it's not.<br />

True. It does not matter much though, a 15% bonus or a 5% bonus and a 10% penalty remains pretty much the same. ;)  And canna more then makes up for that, with regen easily making up for the lack of SH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, I may be reaching a little here, but seriously.  <br />
<br />
Slow mitigation is usually dependant upon the zone (ie. MPG partialy etc...) so simply change the healing spells and include a zone modifyer to the healing spells which will take into account the level of mitigation and adjust the healing accordingly.  More mitigation, greater healing nicrease.  It's just an idea.</div></div><hr />

As you know, I usually play a rogue.  I have never noticed an increase in Endurance regen.  Not in standing or sitting, not in any spell cast upon me or any other situation save death.  I have heard this rumor as well, but is usually confusion over the change from Stamina to Endurace.  I am constantly using Daggerfall (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6174&amp;source=Live) and when needed use Duelist Discipline (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4676&amp;source=Live) on named trying to save Endurace for Counterattack Discipline (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4673&amp;source=Live) in cases of dire need.  I monitor my Endurance carefully and have noticed no changes at all.  To my knowledge, that only way to increase Endurance regeneration is to spend the AA's on it.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, if standing or sitting has no effect on Endurance regeneration, why does jumping affect it?  Wizards can jump all day long and still have mana to cast spells with, my melee mana shouldn't be affected by me jumping around.... not that I do that.... a lot... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Xperiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">I think the boost of our heals dependant on slow sounds nice but would end up being exploited. So you bring over a level 30 mob in the zone and dont slow it and your heals are 150% on the 65+ mob your killing in group. Making the program figure out which mob it should base the heal percentage boost on would be very difficult, especially when there are times you may be fighting 4+ mobs. My suggestion in other forums was something somewhat like clerics heal shield, except on a much grander scale for shamans. Basically you cast on the mob a buff that every hit a group member does they get healed for a set amount (ie 50hps per hit). and make the heal shield not stack with any form of slow. This would in a sense help with mitigation and make our heals more in line.<br />
<br />
I am not trying to start a war here on who thinks shamans are healers or not, I know that even upto elemental (non raid fights) a good shaman can be main healer, have done it many times even Plane of Fire. However, the issue is with the OoW+ zones besides WoS it is hard for us to be a main healer and slow and cripple and do dps. (somewhat).<br />
<br />
In coming up with this idea I am trying to make an ability/spell that helps the group out but is removed with slow and doesnt require SOE to come up with some huge calc that tries to decide how to base a burst heal on what mob is slowed or not slowed.<br />
<br />
The stance idea, while interesting, wouldn't help a shaman imo, but would help a druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We could use some more healing, but I agree with you. We could use some sort of something to help us out. Personally instead of adding something I'd love to see them change Rabid Bear. Add a slightly significant increase in hps, increase in ac, and an increase in mitigation and/or avoidance so we can try and survive whatever aggro we just got, or live long enough to zone. Change the damn proc to leopard or panther, if thats not a savage maw I don't know what is. If that makes it to powerful throw a mana drain or a silence on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">I know I have said that already, but I will say it again and add a few things to this. <br />
The stance idea per se isn't terribly bad. Of course, given the mechanics of EQ, a very versatile class like Druid will benefit a lot more from it than, say, a mage. <br />
Furthermore, again due to the inherent game mechanics, the power boost is significantly higher, if you can pick between and are able to fulfill core functions(Healing - Tanking - Damage), as opposed to moving your &quot;power slider&quot; only between a single core function and a sub-function. Much more so, if the sub-function is part of the core-function(Slowing -&gt; Healing).<br />
Let's look at this a little closer by looking at what exactly these core-functions and sub-functions (wanted and necessary functions)iare, in order to explain what I am referring to.<br />
<br />
Wanted/desired functions(core + sub-functions):<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Slowing(sub-function)<br />
Crowd Control in camp(sub-function)<br />
Crowd Control out of camp(sub-function)<br />
Tanking<br />
Buffing<br />
Damage<br />
Resurrection<br />
<br />
These are the &quot;functions&quot; I split up to reflect what the average player wants to have in his group to feel safe. However, many of the functions perceived by the majority of players are only sub-functions which are not really needed, if you do dispose of enough power in the core-functions &quot;department&quot;.<br />
<br />
Necessary or &quot;core&quot;-functions:<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Tanking<br />
Damage<br />
<br />
Now, as mentioned above, in order to be succesful with only the core functions, these group spots need to be filled with characters who can perform very well in one of the three functions. The nature of this group will make sure that whatever other function could theoretically be somewhat covered by the character, 90+% of their time is spent on only one of them, their primary.<br />
<br />
With this premise and using Druids as an example, I wanted to clarify why a slow/healing stance would not only not be advantageous, but actually detrimental to the class.<br />
<br />
These are the 3 stances Druids will be able to pick from:<br />
<br />
a.       Normal  Their healing and offensive abilities are in balance.  This is the state they exist in today.<br />
<br />
b.      Offensive  Their offensive power is boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their healing spells.<br />
<br />
c.       Defensive  Their healing power is boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their offensive spells.<br />
<br />
As I have tried to make clear above, a Class performing 1 of the 3 core-functions will generally dedicate 90+% of their time to do just that. When looking at the Druid stances, you can basically see, that a Druid will gain a 25% boost to their ability to perform a crucial function, while taking negligeable penalty.<br />
<br />
[At this point some may argue, that a Druid in nuke-mode, will be an awful secondary healer, a term I have always hated, as all it's saying is that your character is to weak to perform as a main healer and apparently SoE agrees with me as, judging by Brenlo's post, after these changes, every real healer is supposed to be a main healer and in fact, in all of my career I can only think of 4 group encounters that at one time required an active secondary healere(which I would define as requiring two main healers).<br />
<br />
There is no secondary healer role in this game and it makes perfectly sense as only 3 healing classes exist, which means that 1/3 of the group make up would have to be from the pool of only 3 classes, when there are so many classes in this game.<br />
<br />
In other words, filling up a player who isn't under attack by throwing an HoT on him, doesn't make it a role.]<br />
<br />
Back to the point.<br />
<br />
A Druid in normal mode does already heal 35+% more effectively than a Shaman. Apparently, SoE's intentions are to see Druids and Shamans as equally effective at healing and the 35% healing advantage was introduced to account for the Shaman's ability to reduce a mob's damage output through the sub-function Slowing.<br />
<br />
SoE's intentions are summed up here:<br />
<br />
&quot;We are changing many of the all-or-nothing immune flags so they mitigate the effect instead.  We want you to use your abilities on most NPCs, but where we feel the ability might be problematic the ability will have a lesser effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is basically saying that 99% of the mobs that matter in the game will mitigate Slow to one degree or another in the future. <br />
No matter how their plan to make us heal more or less effectively, based upon the level of mitigation, will be realized, we can assume that, after these changes, much like now, by making use of the sub-function Slowing and the core-function Healing or just, if we choose or are forced to do so(for whatever reason), Healing, the Shaman will be able to heal more damage than a mob can inflict upon the tank.<br />
<br />
I estimate a Shaman or a Druid healing an adequate tank in RS currently has a margin of about 20-30% healing vs. the incoming damage. His HPS is basically 20-30% higher than the mob's DPS. A Cleric's margin is probably close to 80%(he heals 80% more per second than a single mob can damage their tank for).<br />
<br />
SoE has decided that this gap is too large(who would have guessed that they'd have to re-design healing?!):<br />
<br />
As with Druids, we are looking to increase your healing ability so you can function better as main healer in groups.  You folks are a little problematic though, since your healing ability is the function of not just your heals, but your ability to reduce an NPCs damage output through slows.  In a situation where an NPC is fully slowable, you are a superb healer but against an NPC who cannot be slowed, your healing falls behind.  If we were to just improve your heals, you would quickly outshine any other healer when facing NPCs that can be slowed.  So, we are investigating ways to improve your healing ability only in circumstances where an NPC cannot be slowed or you choose not to slow the NPC (for your own strange reasons).  These changes will be rolled out at the same time as any druid healing changes to ensure that one class does not eclipse the other.<br />
<br />
I am going to guestimate that both, Druids and Shamans, will be seeing an increase that puts them at about 50% margin. This is where the issues start, though.<br />
<br />
By this logic Shaman and Druid will be able to heal at a rate of about 1500 HPS when mobs are doing 1000 DPS, but the Shaman will have to do so by using Slowing and Healing(same as now), but he can't be healing for more than 1500 HPS whatever mode he's making use of.<br />
In the best case, the Shaman is looking at a HPS of 1500, whether he is in a healing-mode or slowing-mode, whether the mob is immune, slightly or mostly affected by slows, because Slowing + Healing must not exceed 1500 HPS in order to not outheal the Druid. <br />
The Shaman does not have a super-mode as he's bound to the 1500 HPS figure, which is divided in &quot;Slowing HPS&quot; and &quot;Healing HPS&quot;. The Shaman's pure &quot;Healing HPS&quot; when facing a slow immune mob(thus &quot;pure healing HPS as slowing isn't doing anything) must be inferior or equal to the Druid's, because the Druid does only dispose of pure &quot;Healing HPS&quot; and at the same time &quot;Slowing HPS&quot; + &quot;Healing HPS&quot; must again be inferior or equal the Druid's pure &quot;Healing HPS&quot; at best, in order to maintain the balance SoE intended.<br />
<br />
Whenever a Shaman finds himself in the &quot;second best&quot; case, whenever he can not instantly or at will decided which mode is going to be needed, he will be falling behind the optimum, while the Druid will gain even more power through his healing stance that will further increase his HPS by 25%, widening the gap between Shaman and Druid healing even more.<br />
<br />
This is why a Slow/Healing stance will not make us more powerful, it will merely shift the slider within the same function towards one end, the sub-function slowing, when mobs are highly vulnerable to it and the other end, the core function healing, when mobs are almost unaffected by slowing, but the magnitude of the total function [Healing] you are performing, will stay unaltered.<br />
<br />
On top of this, a stance that allows you to pick between 2 or more core functions like the Druid one will do, will allow you to actually fill 2 roles to the full extent of a core-function. You basically turn into a specialist for both functions with zero penalties 99% of the times. Druids will basically gain a 25% healing AND damage power for the mechanics I made reference to at the beginning, which do not allow you to do 2 things at once anyway.<br />
<br />
After this analysis(obviously subjective at this point, as everything I said is based on my personal view), I'd like to suggest a few ideas, that might give us an equal boost as the one in question for Druids.<br />
<br />
1. Add a carbon copy of Nihil(have the decency to increase the resist adjust if you are going to give Beastlords a -30+ MR check) that autocasts a HoT on the target of the target.<br />
<br />
2. Make the HoT scale with the level of slow mitigation. Set a default healing value for it reflecting a base mitigation(partially, I'd suggest )and multiply it with X for every level of mitigation, that is not the base, to be more or less powerful according to the effects of the slow.<br />
<br />
3. The HoT needs to pulse like Bard songs rather than per tick, go into the bard buff box, stack with epic and other HoTs and last 1 minute. Furthermore, to compensate for the fact, that part of our healing is resistable(slow), the HoT would have to be autocast independently from the success of the slow, so that a resist on a slow does not result in a bigger penalty than it already is(hate generation ect.)<br />
<br />
I have a lot of ideas regarding an alternate stance much like the Druid's nuke stance, but I feel this post is long enough already. However, it should, imo, allow us to boost a second core-function(just like the damage boost for Druids), if we wish to in trade of a healing penalty of some sort(I'd gladly post ideas on that to in a few) and I think since many of us here agree that Shamans lack the adequate survivability, I'd vote for a &quot;signifcant(25%?) boost in the tanking department stance&quot;.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">I've thought long and hard about this.<br />
<br />
The darkest days for shaman were when we were inferior DPS to beastlords, and there was almost no group makeup in which a shaman was a preferable choice to a beastlord.   By a wide margin.<br />
<br />
Currently, the combination on Panther line and requiring resist adjustments to land slows has totally turned the tables ... if the group needs a slower there is almost no makeup where a beastlord is preferable to a shaman.  By a wide margin.<br />
<br />
We are reasonably balanced with enchanters -- at the moment.<br />
<br />
For most content, these are the classes with whom I currently compete for group slots.  Beastlords and enchanters.  <br />
<br />
Right now, if a three groups needs a healer, and a cleric, druid, and shaman are all LFG, first group grabs the cleric.  Second group grabs the druid.  Third group disbands.  We are not a main healing class, and we haven't been for a LONG time.  Sure every shaman and their brother can hold it together in WoS ... maybe some can in MPG, but in RSS+ ... not many if any.<br />
<br />
The point here is that trying to give us a main-healing role, when that is not a role we have now, is a causing major balance issues.  How do we resolve that?<br />
<br />
I can see a good argument for a 'stance' in which we have 'new druid' level healing abilities, but our slow spells / Times Antithesis DO NOT WORK AT ALL.  This would let me be a healer when another slower is around.  Heck, in a healer stance, cast malos on Inc and your beastlord is now a great complementarty slower.  Two birds with one stone.<br />
<br />
But if I'm going to be a real healer, I need not only upgrades to my existing lines in terms of magnitude, I need group heals or maybe an AA Arb.<br />
<br />
Our other stance, debuffer, remains as is.<br />
<br />
I'd be ok with that implementation.  It gives me the flexibility to play healer when the beastlords start eating my lunch again -- but I would prefer to stay as debuffer most of the time.<br />

I believe that Brenlo's generalization here is based on incomplete reasoning.<br />
<br />
Consider four cases. <br />
<br />
Case 1.  The mobs our group is killing are mid-range dark blue or lower; most solo classes could solo these handily; most any duo could kill these quite easily; we have a full group and we are ripping through these very very fast.  <br />
<br />
Case 2.  The mobs are upper range dark blue or white.  We are killing fast in an experience grind; the goal is to kill these high experience mobs as quickly as we can.  <br />
<br />
Case 3.  The mobs are white or yellow, and we are farming for names.  We can handle this readily most of the time, but there are occasional damage spikes that give an adrenaline rush as we get close to losing people.  <br />
<br />
Case 4.  The mobs are white to red, and we are farming for names.  We are pressing close to the line a lot, and the damage spikes mean that someone dies pretty often:  but we figure that as long as we only lose one or two in bad fights and don't wipe the whole group, we will just recover and keep on going.<br />
<br />
Analysis.<br />
<br />
Case 1 is the place where a shaman is set up to outshine a druid.  Mobs like these are the ones that are fully slowable; plus a shaman can heal the modest damage that even unslowed mobs inflict with just a HoT.  But it doesn't matter.  Any healer can provide far more healing than the damage generated by the mobs.  If the druid can provide twice as much healing as needed while the shaman can provide three times as much healing as needed, the advantage is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Case 2 will be a situation where most mobs mitigate, and so the difference between a slowed mob and an unslowed mob is less.  This is the situation that is closest to all healers being equal and sufficient to the task.<br />
<br />
Case 3 is the most problematic.  All the mobs mitigate; most of them mitigate a lot; and so shaman healing is already marginal compared to the other two.  And the shaman will be busy:  in order to provide that marginal healing, the shaman will often need to cast two or three spells at the same time.  But of course it is not possible to cast a malos and a slow and a heal all at the same time.  <br />
<br />
If I am a cleric in this situation, the job is not trivial.  Do I cast many fast heals?  That will keep the tank alive, but it might run me out of mana.  Do I cast Complete Heals?  That's very mana efficient, but the tank might die during the 12 seconds between casts.<br />
<br />
But if I am a shaman in this situation, it may well be that:<br />
<br />
(a)  by the time I cast malos and slow successfully the tank is already dead;<br />
<br />
(b) after I slow the mob and then start casting heals, the heals are not sufficient to overcome the amount of damage the slowed mob generates;<br />
<br />
(c) by the time I have cast malos and then bounced a slow, the tank's health is so low that I can only spam heals as quickly as I can; the tank does not have enough health margin for me to risk taking the time to attempt another slow:  and we are going to wipe unless three lucky things happen for us right now:  I get a crit heal and the wizard gets a crit nuke and the mob doesn't generate a damage spike.<br />
<br />
In Case 3, then, a druid is presently a more reliable healer than a shaman, and a cleric is a much more reliable healer than a shaman.<br />
<br />
In Case 4, virtually all groups plan on having a dedicated healer and a dedicated slower.  It is rare rare rare that a group will trust a shaman to be able to fulfill both of those roles successfully, consistently, against mobs at this level.  <br />
<br />
(Please don't bother to explain that you have successfully done this.  So have I.  I've failed at it a lot, too.  And if you are honest, you'll admit that you also have failed plenty of times.  The group members know that the chance of failure is high:  unacceptably high for most people.  So the fact remains:  it is not at all typical that a group will trust a shaman to be able to slow and heal consistently versus this level of mob.)<br />
<br />
Commentary.<br />
<br />
The fear that Brenlo expresses has to do with Case 1.  This is where mobs are fully slowable.  I would propose that SOE's best reaction to this fear is to laugh at its irrelevance.  Suppose that improving shaman healing results in shamans being five times more effective than druids in such situations.  So what?  Druids are fully capable of dealing (lazily) with all the damage the unslowed mobs dish out in Case 1; the group will gain nothing by dumping the druid and choosing a shaman to deal (five times more lazily) with all the damage the slowed mobs dish out.<br />
<br />
The critical area, by contrast, is Case 3.  This is the place where the inadequacy of shaman healing must be addressed:  in situations where mobs mitigate a lot, resist a lot, and can kill a good tank in just a few seconds.  <br />
<br />
Presently, SOE's worrying about Case 1 prevents them from augmenting shaman healing to deal with Case 3.  This is a mistake.  <br />
<br />
The proper course is to recognize that no boost to healing can unbalance Case 1, because all healers are already more than adequate to deal with that.  And therefore, what SOE needs to do is augment shaman healing so that shamans, like druids and clerics, can heal sufficiently in Case 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3. The HoT needs to pulse like Bard songs rather than per tick, go into the bard buff box, stack with epic and other HoTs and last 1 minute. Furthermore, to compensate for the fact, that part of our healing is resistable(slow), the HoT would have to be autocast independently from the success of the slow, so that a resist on a slow does not result in a bigger penalty than it already is(hate generation ect.)<br />
<br />
These ideas accomplish nothing that a bigger blast heal, or less mitigated slow could accomplish.<br />
<br />
In the end, you're talking about a tank either A) taking less damage, or B) getting healed more.<br />
<br />
By having our slow &quot;autocast&quot; a hot, thats exactly the same as the slow just being more effective.  The hot is mitigating the mob dps in place of slow.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen one suggestion in this entire thread that truly overcomes the fundemental flaw of tying healing to dps debuffs.  <br />
<br />
 You cannot balance healing, ever, with 1 of 3 healers having slow <br />
<br />
There are too many situations where between partially, mostly, immune, it &quot;landed&quot;, it &quot;bounced&quot;, etc.. our healing would need to scale up or down.  <br />
<br />
Being a main healer means this:  being able to slow the UNSLOWED DPS of a mob.  Period.  <br />
<br />
With mitigation in place, the only real advantage that slow brings, is to not run out of mana on long fights or steady pulls.  There are a few situations where the unslowed dps of a mob is slightly greater than a clerics ability to heal, but not many.  <br />
<br />
They want shaman to be main healers (bah don't want to be), then we need the ability to main heal unslowed dps.<br />
<br />
Really, the only way to balance healing, is to UNTIE it from slow.  Whether that means removing slow from the game, or removing slow from shaman and giving it to another debuff class, or giving slow the druids and clerics, I don't know.  <br />
<br />
I, like many of you, have slow so ingrained in my playstyle, that removing it is almost inconceivable.  Yet, no matter which way you look at it, tying one priests ability to heal, to his ability to slow, will never, ever be balanced.  <br />
<br />
If we keep clamoring for true balance among the healers, here's what we'll probably get from SOE:<br />
<br />
1.  Stance thing.  Totally negating our jack of all trades persona.  Will greatly diminish our ability to be responsive to the battle.  And really.. do any shaman really want a narrowly defined role?<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
2.  Bump in blast heal efficiency and power.  Perhaps a druid like CH.  <br />
Go go complete heal chain.  Not.  That would suck.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
3.  Removal of slow.  Least likely.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, please, for the love of god, stop asking to be main healers hehe.  Ask for a bump in your blast heal, then ask for increased power in our other roles like dps buffs, CC, etc..<br />
<br />
I'm almost happy with my healing power, except for the blast heal being bumped slightly.  Thats it.  If we keep pushing the main healer concept, there are all sorts of things that soe might do that would totally screw the shaman class (if, you like the diversity it has now).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">The earlier suggestion of a 'buff' you cast on the tank that heals when the mob hit them might be the least problematic of them all.

It really sounds like something that would fulfill soe's needs here.<br />
However I'm just not sure that in practice its any different from a hot.  As it is now, we hot the tank on inc-&gt;assist puller-&gt;malos-&gt;slow-&gt;assist back to tank-&gt;HOPE the tank survived.  Swapping out the hot for the heal buff doesn't change the rest of it.  We're left hoping the tank survived.  I like the idea, but I'm afraid they just cant make it powerful enough to DO anything and still work within the existing game.<br />
I think withing the existing framework, a simple heal upgrade is about all we can hope for in the heal department.</div></div><hr />

'insert heal amount you think is fair'...<br />
Though quite possibly though to balance, I like this proposal, but you may get a lot of opposition in these parts if you add yet another short term 'buff' to the current line up.  This is another solid suggestion, and falls in line with the buff class that SOE is leading us down now. <br />
And let melee's be able to crit it as their level/skill/aa's improve.<br />
I don't like this part though... not all melee have the high cost AA's to improve the crit rate, and it's not on top of priority lists currently.  The overall crit rate would likely be greatly reduced if this was added and only serves to cripple the lower level players rather than help out everyone equally across the boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Maiviaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">A defensive proc lifetap is a very interesting idea.  That way, the rate of the taps would be dependant on the haste at which the NPCs are hitting. This would allow us to add healing based on the slowability of NPCs without a massive class overhaul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">The main problem here is they are trying to balance a class ( shaman) in two distinct areas of play. Those areas are the debuffing and healing areas. Having different stances only works in scenarios when the abilities that the two stances enhance one while weakening the other. Stances for shamans are a bad idea because I don't want to break my one arm to make the other stronger. If getting an increase in healing ability means I got to give up something then I am VERY Against That.<br />
<br />
I honestly think we are looking in the wrong direction. Lets face it, we do a little bit of everything and when it all adds up makes us powerfull. I don't see why we cannot approach the mitigation of mob damage the same way. So after reading this huge brainstorm session we got going on I will add my thoughts.<br />
<br />
1. Casting times. Drop Yoppa and malos to a 3 sec casting time. Get rid of the recast time on Malos and Turgurs.<br />
<br />
2. Give us a benefical short duration buff to help mitigate damage. Like an upgrade to voice of the berserker but targetable and put a 20%(throwing out a number) shielding modifier on it.<br />
<br />
3. Upgrade Spirit of Sense modifier higher than 7%. I'm thinking around 15%.<br />
<br />
4. For those shamans that like to mele I say give us a bear form that has a 50% (Throwing out a number) damage mod and 300 attk. I doubt your going to be on a mount if your in combat anyway.<br />
<br />
I don't think we need to reinvent the shaman wheel by giving us stances. We have a ton of buffs and abilities that could be augmented to reach the same goal and help shamans keep thier core values intact. Face it, We are buffers and debuffers, and personally I am very happy in this role. It is true that we are priests but it is also true that priests specialize in different aspects of thier practice. I say leave the mega healing to the druids and the clerics. What they do with healing spells I think we can obtain through buffs. Not to mention the upside of buffs would be that they are already on the person who is going to take the damage while we finish our job on the debuff end.<br />
<br />
Personally the last thing I want is to be stuck in a  CH rotation. I would rather be spot healing, debuffing, curing, and doing damage through buffs or spells. I like to think of myself as a bard with an insane mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Konarg_Shaminator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">I am not a fan of stances.

<br />
I'm a jack of all trades and I like it because I am ready to shift gears at a moments notice to save group from a nasty encounter.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">These ideas accomplish nothing that a bigger blast heal, or less mitigated slow could accomplish.<br />

<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
Look at it again. The level mobs will mitigate at is nothing that is up for discussion(nor is pure healing, duh). SoE will decide what X mob will mitigate slow for, so that saying &quot;hey, we could just make the mob mitigate less or have bigger heals and accomplish the same!&quot; is not an option. The game isn't designed just around Shamans, it's designed around all classes.<br />
<br />
What my idea/suggestion is dealing with is that our healing is supposed to ACTIVELY be adjusted to remain the same regardless of the level of mitigation, allowing us to be main healers in all situations without making us overpowered for 'non-mitigating or close to' mobs and underpowered for 'immune or close to' ones(which is the whole point of this discussion).<br />
<br />
No Shaman main healer = No Shaman slow with HoT autocast. unless of course you'd want a Shaman to be that damned secondary healer using the new slow with a higher mana cost for the autocast HoT, which would be the same thing as if you tossed your regular HoT on the tank after slowing ect.<br />
<br />
I hope you can see the purpose of this suggestion now.<br />
<br />
Edit: Another thing, Ungkor. You said this<br />
<br />
There are too many situations where between partially, mostly, immune, it &quot;landed&quot;, it &quot;bounced&quot;, etc.. our healing would need to scale up or down.<br />
<br />
My suggestion offers a solution for this as the HoT DOES scale with mitigation levels AND is not subject to resist. On top of that the interval of the ticks is not six seconds as that of a regular HoT, but faster, in order to alleviate the problem with HoTs taking too long to actually mitigate incoming damage and the large gap of 6 seconds inbetween <br />
healing pulses.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen one suggestion in this entire thread that truly overcomes the fundemental flaw of tying healing to dps debuffs.<br />
<br />
I posted one:<br />
<br />
1. Add a carbon copy of Nihil(have the decency to increase the resist adjust if you are going to give Beastlords a -30+ MR check) that autocasts a HoT on the target of the target.<br />

<br />
But I still think your idea is essentially the same (as others in the thread) in this regard:<br />
<br />
Its an overly complex bandaid on a fundementally flawed system of debuffing and healing.  <br />
<br />
1. It doesn't necessarily address the mobs base dps.  Be it partially, mostly, or immune to slow, the mobs base dps may still be something we can't heal.  <br />
<br />
2. The situation where slow bounces.. does the scaling hot then heal tremendously more to make up for slow not landing?  If not, it won't address slow bouncing.  If it does take into effect a bounced slow and heals way more than normal, then what advantage does landing slow actually have?  <br />
<br />
3. Does the mana cost of the hot scale with what stage its at?  Will it cost more to heal more?  Or is that just &quot;free&quot;?<br />
<br />
Even if we reach satisfactory answers to the above three things (and I'm sure there are more), isn't this getting pretty complex when all we want to do is keep someone alive?<br />
<br />
I just think it would be way more simple to take the shaman in another direction, away from main healing.  <br />
<br />
If we truly want to be effective main healers in all content, then I can't see a solution that doesn't involve removing slow from our arsenal (and in the long run, from the game entirely).  I don't want to type out all the numbers and arguments about this that have been debated ad naseum when PoP mitigation first came out, so at this point, you either agree with this or you do not.  Not going to bother to explain it anymore hehe.<br />
<br />
Regardless of your views on why mitigation was introduced, and what effect slow has in the game as mob dps continues to climb expansion by expansion, my personal goals for the shaman roles are this:<br />
<br />
1.  Adequate low to medium content main healer<br />
2.  Adequate high content backup healer<br />
3.  Debuffer (where those debuffs mainly focus on allowing other classes to do more damage, NOT making the mob do less damage).<br />
4.  Damage enchancer (leopard.. maybe a crit buff for casters)<br />
5.  Stronger CC (better VP, emergency spells)<br />
6.  etc.. <br />
<br />
The standard &quot;test&quot; for whether our heals are good enough, should always be, can our blast heal keep a tank up against an unslowed mob, in any experience group?  Granted, there are a lot of factors (tank level, named mob vs. normal mob, etc..)  but thats generally a good enough way to look at things.<br />
<br />
The big &quot;scream&quot; for more healing originated when GoD came out, and it was pretty clear our blast heal could not succeed in the above test.  Now, I can spam heal a tank in Riftseekers on an unslowed mob, and 9/10 times the tank lives.   Its pretty close, but needs another 200-400 hp to be perfect imo.  <br />
<br />
With the introduction of leopard, its actually advantageous to have an extra healer, thereby freeing me to cast leopard on all melee.  <br />
<br />
4 melee, one cleric or druid, and one shaman with continuous leopard on all 4 melee is greater dps than 5 melee and one shaman wasting all his mana on heals.  At least I think so from casually watching numbers.  If I'm completely wrong, I'll kick myself, but I don't think so.  <br />
<br />
And honestly, I like that role much more. I can rez in the cleric if he dies, the group is more stable, we have more buffs and are stronger, melee act like little kids watching all the procs.. etc..</div></div><hr />

But I still think your idea is essentially the same (as others in the thread) in this regard:<br />

<br />
1. It doesn't necessarily address the mobs base dps.  Be it partially, mostly, or immune to slow, the mobs base dps may still be something we can't heal.<br />
<br />
Not really. Currently a Shaman can main heal everything that is partially+ slowable and is a group encounter. This might not be intentional, but I doubt it seeing as that's the most common mitigation level in the post-PoP game.<br />
As I explained above, main healing is a function of HPS vs. DPS in 99% of the fights. If you can main heal for X mob you must have a HPS that is higher than X's DPS by Y margin. <br />
A Shaman healing their group in RS, with the adequate gear, is probably about 30% over the required HPS and since they announced a healing boost for Druids and Shamans, I was speculating that we are going to be seeing this: Shaman's HPS = X's DPS*1.5 when partially slowable.<br />
<br />
That's about where the base would be and the HoT would scale based off the mitigation level of X mob in order to make every mob in the game virtually &quot;partially&quot; slowable, but only for the Shaman, keeping so the balance intended by the devs and only adjusting our healing.<br />
<br />
In other words, a mob that is only slightly affected by slows would do, say 1200 DPS, while it would only be doing 1000 DPS if it were partially slowable. In this case the HoT base value would be multiplied with, say, 1.15(if this was the average determined by devs to be applied for the a partially - slightly relation) in order to mitigate close to the same damage a partial slow would have had. It doesn't and probably can't be exactly the same if you want to keep things proportional, but it doesn't need to either.<br />
<br />
Really, this sounds a lot more complicated than it is. In part because I am probably not explaining it too well, because I might take things for granted because I elaborated it already.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. The situation where slow bounces.. does the scaling hot then heal tremendously more to make up for slow not landing?  If not, it won't address slow bouncing.  If it does take into effect a bounced slow and heals way more than normal, then what advantage does landing slow actually have? <br />
<br />
Of course it would not. <br />
<br />
The HoT would only be multiplied with a set multiplier based upon the actual mitigation and the base mitigation: partially.<br />
<br />
You say it doesn't accomodate for bounced slows? <br />
<br />
Well, what the hell, not like ANYTHING currently does. The HoT would obviously not &quot;know&quot; if your slow bounced or not and heal for the same amount it would always have for that slightly mitigating mob, but at least it would mitigate SOME of the damage, giving you time to cast another slow instead of having to watch your tank drop and forcing you into a fast heal chain. <br />
This is what I was referring to when I said it was a solution adressing the issue with part of our healing being resistable in the post earlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Does the mana cost of the hot scale with what stage its at?  Will it cost more to heal more?  Or is that just &quot;free&quot;?<br />
<br />
The mana cost would be a set for the slow, that's it. If I had to implement the spell now, it would cost about 800 mana. Hard to tell, I'd have to look at the source code to give a more precise mana cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just think it would be way more simple to take the shaman in another direction, away from main healing.<br />
<br />
You can't. You never could and they are correcting this. You can not have only 2 classes being able to effectively heal or you are creating a tremendous bottleneck. Healing is a core-function and core-functions need to be covered by and spready among more classes. Tanking and Healing are already way too rare, but it's somewhat justified because you usually only need 1 per group.<br />
<br />
When the game was released no one cared about main healing or some such, because there was no need for it. <br />
Shamans were ok healers, not as good as Clerics when they got 39, but it wouldn't matter because the HPS margin over DPS was much higher to the point that it didn't matter. That's why heals had to be efficient back then, because the only issue with healing for a healer was running out of mana.<br />
<br />
If we truly want to be effective main healers in all content, then I can't see a solution that doesn't involve removing slow from our arsenal (and in the long run, from the game entirely).  I don't want to type out all the numbers and arguments about this that have been debated ad naseum when PoP mitigation first came out, so at this point, you either agree with this or you do not.

3.  Debuffer (where those debuffs mainly focus on allowing other classes to do more damage, NOT making the mob do less damage).<br />
4.  Damage enchancer (leopard.. maybe a crit buff for casters)<br />
5.  Stronger CC (better VP, emergency spells)<br />
6.  etc.. <br />
<br />
<br />
That's where your &quot;problem&quot; is. You do no want to be a healer, thus you refuse to look at a creative way to combine healing and debuffing. Definitely your right, though.<br />
<br />
With the introduction of leopard, its actually advantageous to have an extra healer, thereby freeing me to cast leopard on all melee.<br />
<br />
The &quot;active buffing role&quot; does not satisfy me personally. It makes all Shamans the same and enables everyone to do the same things, regardless of gear and skill mostly.<br />
<br />
4 melee, one cleric or druid, and one shaman with continuous leopard on all 4 melee is greater dps than 5 melee and one shaman wasting all his mana on heals.  At least I think so from casually watching numbers.  If I'm completely wrong, I'll kick myself, but I don't think so.  <br />
<br />
And honestly, I like that role much more. I can rez in the cleric if he dies, the group is more stable, we have more buffs and are stronger, melee act like little kids watching all the procs.. etc..<br />
<br />
I play EQ in a different way. I want it to be challenging otherwise it stops being fun. In a group with a Cleric and me casting Panther, what exactly did I invest my time into acquiring gear and experience for? There's only so much fun I can get out of seeing mobs die faster and knowing it's all me(exaggerating).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Torl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">I can't see a solution that doesn't involve removing slow from our arsenal (and in the long run, from the game entirely). Ungkor<br />
<br />
Remove slow from the game.  It would be better for us, better for game play.  With slow gone, our class is open to reinvent itself and still remain shaman.  A replacement for slow can be developing the cripple line of spells to allow melee to hit more and miss less.  Mobs would die quicker, but still be challenging, but this works well, slow is removed, exp is faster, players have to concentrate more (the mob may not live longer, but it has not lost any of its offensive capabilities).  We retain our role as the best debuffers, but we are contributing to overall positive game play changes (slow is terrible for game design and balance). By giving up slow, we open the door to make our class more diverse, powerful, and fun to play.  Some new abilities can be:<br />
<br />
Healing: I do not want to be the healer, but we can get great secondary healing capabilities.  With slow gone, the door is open, it can be very fast blast heals, good group heals, new HoTs that heal over the cap (adding or maintaining a rune if the target is at full health).<br />
<br />
Pet: I do not want to be a Beastlord. I want to keep diverse capabilities.  With slow gone, we can be a real (junior) pet class.  Pup can get those hitpoints and we can use pet focus items, and maybe get AAs to better control swarm pets so we can more effectively buff them with Leopard or Panther.  With better secondary heals, our pets should do nicely with slow removed from the game and hit better with a new cripple line.<br />
<br />
Self Runes: The shaman way is to stand in the face of your opponent, hear the roar of your foe and take the hits.  With slow gone, a self rune line of spells would be great for soloing mobs.  It would be a real shaman dance, debuffing, using Panther, new heals on pet, casting rune, getting agro.  Not really a different strategy then what we do now, but it is without *slow* and we can be tweaked and balanced for debuffing, dps, healing, and rune strength.<br />
<br />
Other spells: An AE malo type debuff, shorter cast times, Malicious Decay built into VP.  Perhaps without slow, these changes would be much more readily be considered.<br />
<br />
We can still be shaman without slow, unique and diverse in abilities, and, at the same time, improve game play, design, and balancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">Removing slow from Shamans would destroy the class. Everything is designed around it. <br />
The Shaman's nature is that of a really slow and efficient class. We are slow acting because we have the power to slow mobs and we wouldn't be worth a time in the fast paced EQ of today because it's way too present in every single aspect of our game.<br />
<br />
Could you remove slow and adjust everything else? I doubt it, but even if you could and Devs would really want to spend all their time on that, you'd basically have designed a totally new class.<br />
<br />
Cast times(which you mentioned yourself already), recast times, active mana regen, DoT as primary meaning of damaging a mob, Healing over Time being an important aspect of our healing, no form of crowd control in or out of camp except root ect. These all are things that are directly linked to our ability to slow, and there are more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">My 2cp:<br />
<br />
Adjust healing. plain and simple. Shaman DO NOT need a CH-type spell, that should be reserved for clerics.  However, it is our &quot;splash heals&quot; that need to be improved upon; i.e. why do we get greater healing at level 29 and no significant new healing ability until level 54? Stoicism is a basically worthless spell in terms of game play, no matter how good it looks on paper.  160hp's a tick for four ticks in still definitely no where near what it needs to be, considering that mobs at level 44 consistently hit for 100+, and double/triple attack in many instances.  And let's not forget about the slow/snare effect of it...really, what melee class is going to want to be effectively slowed for 24 seconds whilst they attempt to take down a mob?  Also, in a raid situation, IF the target is unslowabble, we quickly lose effectiveness.  Our DOT's are generally a bad idea to utilize, due to the high aggro inducement; and as most shaman would agree, our nukes are horribly inefficient.<br />
<br />
My take on improvements towards class balancing are three-fold:<br />
<br />
1)  A 500hp heal, available at lvl. 39 mana cost 300, 3 second cast.  This would give us the ability; in group situations, to slow the incoming mob, and then fall back into a much more improved healer role. Also, another similar spell at a 60+ level, healing for appx 2.7k with a 4-5 sec cast time, and a mana cost equivalent to the level.<br />
<br />
2) FIRE based nuke spells, available at alternating levels with the COLD based line, with perhaps a slightly higher mana cost and damage output.  This would give shaman a slightly more agressive &quot;battle priest&quot; feel; but would also allow the player a choice of spell selection that many feel is too confining. Considering our role as the &quot;utility class,&quot; we are extremely limited in offensive output, and this simple fix would go a long way towards changing that.<br />
<br />
3) Pets.  As stated time and time again by Mystics, Heyokahs and Fateseers; we are a pet class, more and more so as we progress in levels.  I propose an improved pet, adding somewhere from 3-5% hp's to the pet at each level; or another &quot;pet-only&quot; buff to improve HP, AC, str, dex, and a % haste determined by level of pet. Example: Level 44 pet only spell: + 250 hp, +30 AC, +10 str, +5 dex; duration 30 minutes. As I am not &quot;high-end&quot; yet, I cannot accurately describe a &quot;pet-only&quot; spell for 65+.<br />
<br />
 Three ideas, simple in concept; but with the ability to completely revamp and, more importantly, update the Shaman class, which is as Old World as the expansion we are biased upon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">I'd fix our healing by:<br />
- increase our direct heals by 70% or so (make yoppa's heal 3000 hp)<br />
- give us a better &quot;big slow 400-mana heal&quot; healing say 5000 hp or so<br />
<br />
Then address their desire that shamans not be able to be both slower and main healer in a group by giving our slow spells a bard-box recourse that reduces our healing by 40% minus 10% per level of slow mitigation. You'd want the recourse to last for about the expected lifetime of a mob. A minute or so would probably work.<br />
<br />
Net result:<br />
- yoppa's mending heals for 3000 base hp<br />
- if we successfully fully slow a mob, we'd be healing 1800<br />
- if we successfully mostly slow a mob, we'd be healing 2100<br />
- if we successfully partially slow a mob, we'd be healing 2400<br />
- if we successfully slightly slow a mob, we'd be healing 2700<br />
- with another slower doing the slowing, we'd be healing for 3000<br />
- on an unslowable mob, we'd be healing for 3000<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm still rather infatuated with this idea.<br />
<br />
Good points:<br />
<br />
1) Slow mitigation is directly related to our Healing power.<br />
<br />
2) It lowers the issue of shaman &quot;stacking&quot; in groups, while still ensuring that each shaman has then potential to cover for the other, and to take control if the &quot;**** hits the fan&quot;.<br />
<br />
3) It invents for us a new role in raids, as a real backup healer. With the traditional one or two slowing shamans still keeping their role, and their regular abilities.<br />
<br />
4) It makes it possible for us to play main slower and main healer, albeit to a lesser extent. With the difficulty *generally* being tied into the mitigation level of the mob, this means that when the mob becomes more difficult, our healing ability adapts to compensate.<br />
<br />
In any case, in no way do we lose out with this introduction, in fact, we become just as we were before PoP to an extent. Back then all of our slows were always full, and what i'm quickly gathering is that the huge lessening of our healing power was due to this concept of the full slows in pre-PoP, but, with the introduction of mitigation, we were double-penalised, so to speak. Kazim's idea recovers one of those penalties, the mitigation penalty. With this nifty little idea, we gain back what was &quot;taken&quot; from us when mitigation was introduced.<br />
_____________________________________________<br />
<br />
I like above idea, so will keep my additions seperate.<br />
<br />
Also, rather than the duration being fixed to the average life span of a mob, perhaps make it tied to the slow itself, add the recourse to both turgurs and nihil, and simply make the recourse last until the slow is gone. (either faded, or the mob dies, or overwritten).<br />
<br />
Perhaps a second attribute to this recourse could be added, in the form of minor avoidance, or mitigation. Something not overly large, but perhaps a 25% decreased damage per hit, or 25% more avoidance added. Something that brings back our raw, exciting ability to be able to offtank, with the inherent expense of our heals, and the provision that we must be the slower.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, I believe Kazim's suggestion covers a lot of the gripes that many shamans in this thread were having. Would look forward to some feedback of this, personally i'd be very happy with this introduction, and feel that others would be also.<br />
<br />
I also am against the idea of the partial CH upgrade, and hate the idea of stances with quite a passion :)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I most certainly do want to be a main healer.  Just not in the hardest content.  I would, however, like the ability to keep a tank up if need be in that hard content (emergency).  SOE just needs to be certain that our blast heal can (when spammed) slightly outheal the dps of any unslowed mob in a group encounter.  Thats all I really want in terms of healing.  Long term, that blast heal will drain us OOM.  <br />
<br />
I'm all ears to any solutions that do not involve tying our healing to slow.  Every group has slow, and it just is not fair that our healing remains tied to it.  <br />

<br />
Giac::: The &quot;active buffing role&quot; does not satisfy me personally. It makes all Shamans the same and enables everyone to do the same things, regardless of gear and skill mostly.&quot;<br />
<br />
And how exactly, would changes that make us main healers not make all shaman the same also?  You're talking about strengthening a core role of EQ: healing.  We'd be known as 'healers' and when a group formed, you'd seek a shaman out for his 'healing' rather than his buffs and debuffs.  <br />
<br />
Making us a viable main healer in all content makes us more narrowly confined than strenthening our other 2-3 roles imo.  Groups would label us a 'healer' and that would be our one job.  How is that different than our one job being to provide dps via our buffs?  How is being known as a the main healer less confining than being known as 'the guy who adds uber dps via leopard, the guy who adds good CC with a better VP, etc..?'<br />
<br />
Instead of a scalable hot, why couldn't SOE just make all mobs mitigate the same amount?  Or get rid of mitigation and just make our slow 25% or something?  <br />
<br />
And what happens in this situation:<br />
<br />
1.  Mob inc.  Enchanter tashes the mob right before we try slow and gets aggro, our slow bounces, your new scale hot lands on the enchanter.  Seconds later the mob turns its attention to the tank, who now is facing an unslowed mob and doesn't have a hot on him?<br />
<br />
Does the hot need to know how to 'smartly' transfer to whoever has aggro despite the initial cast aggro?  Not sure that would be possible code-wise.  <br />
<br />
Giac:: &quot;removing slow from Shamans would destroy the class. Everything is designed around it. &quot;<br />
<br />
You are correct.  And that is exactly what I am suggesting.  No more bandaids.  A complete redesign.  But as I've said before, I doubt SOE will take that much time.  The game would have to be redesigned from level 1, the first expansion, thru level 70, the last expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">The game would have to be redesigned from level 1, the first expansion, thru level 70, the last expansion.<br />
<br />
It actually wouldn't.  The shaman class and it's abilities were so completely ignored for the first three years that they honestly didn't realize until Luclin that they'd built a one-man raid force.  Take a look at the spells for evidence: we had enchanter debuffs and buffs, druid heals, necro dots, magician nukes (in basic, with a fall off in kunark, but who cares), and a slew of non-functional stat buffs.  We had one unique ability in design, Cannibalizing for mana, and gained another, Heals Over Time, in Kunark.  With game design endemically having such terrible internal communication, it's no surprise what resulted, in hindsight.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, content adjustment would only have to be done from PoP forward.  That was (very observably) when developers really recognised the power of slow and started building around it.  Personally, I don't see it happening, and I'd lean on the side of not wanting it to.  I'm very comfortable at this point with how shaman do healing.  I'd just like to be a tad better at it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u158"><b>Exin Krup Gutkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p158">I need something answered for me.<br />
<br />
In any content that isn't trivial it seems that most are in agreement that every group will have a slower.<br />
<br />
Also, in all content that isn't trivial I think all are in agreement that every group will have a healer.<br />
<br />
Now what ways can this be accomplished?<br />
<br />
1. Group grabs both a healer and a slower.<br />
2. Group grabs a character that can heal and slow.<br />
<br />
Here is my main question.  Is it overpowering to have one character that can fill both of those functions?  Why?<br />
<br />
Now take into consideration that the one character can't actively be fulfilling both functions at the same time due to inability to cast multiple spells at once.<br />
<br />
There are already built in limitations to why a Shaman can never be perfect in both simply because both situations can not happen concurrently.  They have to happen in series.<br />
<br />
Druids have debuffs that while not as obvious or as pivital as slow do decrease the DPS of a mob quite well.  Clerics as well though potentially a bit less.  Now I am not saying we need Clerical healing abilities, but being somewhat close should not be overpowering in my opinion because unlike the Cleric we can not cast out damage reducing spells before the mob is pulled.<br />
<br />
So, if every group doing non trivial content needs a slower just consider slow to be a given.  Slow is only needed because it is a very beneficial way to reduce DPS done by the mob.  While Slow and Healing are opposite sides of the same coin (reducing or mitigating DPS), there is no overpowering aspect of having both of these skills especially in one person.  If slow makes our healing capabilities workable while it makes the other classes healing capabilities just easier we are working from another disadvantage beside needing to both jobs at once.  If we are called upon to play two different roles at once, there shouldn't be any reason why we are severely handicapped at healing because of slow...remember slow is going to be given in a group one way or another.<br />
<br />
Almost every class has or can play other roles, and often in the same group.  Does the Beastlord suffer from being able to slow and do DPS at the same time?  Oh wait add in the ability to heal as a true back up healer, and even tank with either their pet or theirselves in a pinch.  Rangers heal quite well especially for a true secondary healer in a group, can pump out quite a bit of DPS (can do both with weapon recycle and casting), and also add limited crowd control, buffs both defensive and offensive etc.<br />
<br />
My main point is that if classes can have multiple roles they play in a group all at once managing to fulfill requirements that could be met by taking multiple other classes, then why can't we be capable of being both a healer and a slower which is just two different ways to approach the same problem, namely keeping people alive?  For example if a group needs somone who can snare they also look at wether or not they need more DPS or more healing and then choose either a Ranger or a Druid.  So why not look and say hmm I need a slower now would we prefer more healing, more crowd control, or more DPS and pick Shaman, Enchanter, or BL respectively?  Or we need a healer and would prefer a slower, port/ds/snare/etc, DI/rezer/group healer and then take the Shaman, Druid, Cleric?<br />
<br />
Am I really off my rocker here?  Is being capable of managing two roles in a group seriously such a crime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">[Am I really off my rocker here? Is being capable of managing two roles in a group seriously such a crime?<br />
<br />
<br />
No.  Most classes will always have multiple roles.  The debate right now is what roles, and what percentage of our 'power' should be devoted to those roles.  <br />
<br />
Some want to focus on healing<br />
Some want to focus on buffing/debuffing<br />
Some want to focus on damage<br />
Others want various conbinations of the above.<br />
<br />
The tricky part is that if one role is dependent on another role, you often can not succeed at either.  The threads original question about stances was a first attempt at solving slow being tied to healing, and all the problems that arise as a result.  <br />
<br />
In the case of the stance idea (which I think is what your thread is addressing), the shaman might still have two roles.  It just sought to untie slow and heal, leaving our roles of buffs, damage, etc.. still fully functional.  Seems like most in the thread do not like that idea (myself included).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">The problem with always tieing our healing to our slows is that for part of the fight, (the first part), the mob isn't slowed.

I most certainly do want to be a main healer. Just not in the hardest content.<br />
<br />
You are either able to main heal in all of the content, or you are not a main healer. As mentioned in my other post, if you create content or design the game so that it is only doable with a Cleric or a Druid as healers, you will only have two options for a core-function, arguably the most important at that.<br />
Sub-functions like Slowing already have at least 4 viable options and the core-function Damage can be performed by 80% of the classes in a decent way.<br />
<br />
I would, however, like the ability to keep a tank up if need be in that hard content (emergency).  SOE just needs to be certain that our blast heal can (when spammed) slightly outheal the dps of any unslowed mob in a group encounter.  Thats all I really want in terms of healing.  Long term, that blast heal will drain us OOM.<br />
<br />
Unless you create a disc on a timer for emergency healing, this is just the same as main healing. The difference between being OOM after a few fights and being able to keep healing over longer periods of time, is that you will have to adjust your kill rate.<br />
<br />
I'm all ears to any solutions that do not involve tying our healing to slow.  Every group has slow, and it just is not fair that our healing remains tied to it.<br />
<br />
I partially agree, but I can see the reasoning behind this. There are already 3 core functions, if you had to assume every group needs a slower(if you don't need one, you can't assume everyone has one), you'd have a 4th core function.<br />
This would be limiting the group set up even more than it currently is. SoE is actively trying to redesign classes, so that more group set ups can be effective and succesful.<br />
<br />
Me:: &quot;With the introduction of leopard, its actually advantageous to have an extra healer, thereby freeing me to cast leopard on all melee.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
And how exactly, would changes that make us main healers not make all shaman the same also?  <br />
<br />
I'll answer this with a simple question: What's the difference between a Bazaar geared Shaman's Panther spell and a Anguish geared Shaman's one?<br />
The question could also be: What's the difference between an experienced Shaman's Panther and a newly &quot;acquired&quot; newbie Shaman's Panther?<br />
Then compare their ability to keep a tank up, their DPS from nukes and DoTs.<br />
<br />
The active buffing role is something you can't really excel at. If you limit yourself to being an &quot;active buffer&quot;, you are contributing the same damage as a naked Shaman(well, if he can keep the buff up with his mana, which is probably possible even when naked). The player makes no difference whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Making us a viable main healer in all content makes us more narrowly confined than strenthening our other 2-3 roles imo.  Groups would label us a 'healer' and that would be our one job.  How is that different than our one job being to provide dps via our buffs?  How is being known as a the main healer less confining than being known as 'the guy who adds uber dps via leopard, the guy who adds good CC with a better VP, etc..?'<br />
<br />
Besides the fact that being a main healer is going to get you more groups(3 vialbe healers, 10+ viable DPSers), there's no difference. Except what I said above.<br />
If we wanted to lead this pragmatism ad absurdum, though, you could as well just be a good entertainer and have no abilities at all and still get groups.<br />
<br />
Instead of a scalable hot, why couldn't SOE just make all mobs mitigate the same amount?<br />
<br />
1. Because SoE wants diversity<br />
<br />
2. Because this would affect ALL slowers, when all we want is to make our heals scale with the mitigation of our slows. This way, if a mob was only slightly slowable, we'd still be able to heal as if it was partially affected(close to anyway as it would never be 100% the same), and the mob would be slightly slowed and generate the SoE intended DPS for every other slower<br />
<br />
<br />
Or get rid of mitigation and just make our slow 25% or something? <br />
<br />
People don't like to keep paying when they get nerfed and for some reason SoE wants them to keep doing that.<br />
<br />
And what happens in this situation:<br />
<br />
1.  Mob inc.  Enchanter tashes the mob right before we try slow and gets aggro, our slow bounces, your new scale hot lands on the enchanter.  Seconds later the mob turns its attention to the tank, who now is facing an unslowed mob and doesn't have a hot on him?<br />
<br />
That's the worst scenario that can happen and all it means is that you have to slow the mob again and timing it better the next time, duh. What do you do now when your slow bounces? <br />
Doesn't your tank face the same unslowed mob and is he getting magically healed?<br />
<br />
Currently you'd try to reslow a mob and your tank's HPs keep dropping. With my suggestion, you'd safe about 6 seconds, because your tank would have an HoT on him that pulses as quick as a bard song after the 2nd slow. In other words, my tank would live and &quot;yours&quot; would die, especially if the second slow bounced too.<br />
<br />
Does the hot need to know how to 'smartly' transfer to whoever has aggro despite the initial cast aggro?<br />
<br />
Sorry, what?<br />

Ain't happening, and I wouldn't want it to happen either. I didn't invest 6+ years to have my character get changed to something I have no affinity to.<br />

Correct, and that's the reason why Shamans need an emergency heal AA  la Spirit Shifting which we proposed long ago, which has become an unsubstantial part of the healing upgrade request(Top 10 class issues), though.<br />
It deserves to be listed seperately imo.<br />

Actually good point.  And on second thought, I think you are correct in your definition of a main healer.  At this point, the MH role vs. not MH role is a matter of preference.  My preference is not to be a main healer in the toughest content.  The current balance is ok with me, with the exception of a bigger fast heal.  <br />
<br />
Unless you create a disc on a timer for emergency healing, this is just the same as main healing. The difference between being OOM after a few fights and being able to keep healing over longer periods of time, is that you will have to adjust your kill rate.<br />
<br />
Well, for me thats a huge difference.  In the toughest group encounter, running OOM after a few fights means you cannot be the healer for that group. However, having the tank die because the mob is unslowed means you aren't even a healer at all.  In the toughest content, I want to still be a healer.  When GoD came out, I might as well have been a ranger (until I got new spells, gear, etc..).  My wish is that our blast heal can always keep up with an unslowed mob, but that it isn't a means of effective long term experience grouping.<br />
<br />
<br />
I partially agree, but I can see the reasoning behind this. There are already 3 core functions, if you had to assume every group needs a slower(if you don't need one, you can't assume everyone has one), you'd have a 4th core function.<br />
This would be limiting the group set up even more than it currently is. SoE is actively trying to redesign classes, so that more group set ups can be effective and succesful.<br />
<br />
Good point.  However, removing slow would remove the need for that 4th slot, as well as greatly simplifying the balancing of the game.  But, I agree it won't happen.  What I'm talking about is the &quot;theoretically perfect&quot; EQ.  Reality is another matter.  <br />
<br />
I'll answer this with a simple question: What's the difference between a Bazaar geared Shaman's Panther spell and a Anguish geared Shaman's one?<br />
The question could also be: What's the difference between an experienced Shaman's Panther and a newly &quot;acquired&quot; newbie Shaman's Panther?<br />
Then compare their ability to keep a tank up, their DPS from nukes and DoTs.<br />
<br />
The active buffing role is something you can't really excel at. If you limit yourself to being an &quot;active buffer&quot;, you are contributing the same damage as a naked Shaman(well, if he can keep the buff up with his mana, which is probably possible even when naked). The player makes no difference whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Ahh.  Now we seem to be getting to a new point here.  You want the diversity of the shaman class to come from gear/aa/skill/etc... <br />
<br />
Thats all well and good.  But don't you think that the bottom line naked shaman should be balanced in the game to begin with?  Namely, our core roles and spells should provide the fundemental gameplay style and power required to be effective at our chosen role?  <br />
<br />
What you seem to be suggesting here.. is that being an effective main healer would require gear that gave you focus abilities, bigger mana pool, etc..  Thats fine.  Clerics and Druids have that limitation also.  But I totally disagree that this in some way &quot;diversifies&quot; our class.  Buffing/debuffing/nuking/dotting/cc'ing is all effected by gear also.  The benefits that gear brings to healing are the same that it could provide for our other roles.  Just because our new proc doesn't have a focus, doesn't mean it never will, nor does it mean that its effectiveness isn't linked to our mana pool.  Same with CC and being able to take hits.<br />
<br />
Saying that balance and diversity comes from gear is the wrong route.  Lets balance the naked shaman first (against the other classes, not the content), then worry about gear.<br />
<br />
Besides the fact that being a main healer is going to get you more groups(...)<br />
<br />
Here's a preference thing again I guess.  Do I really want to log on each night and have all my roles except healing totally neglected because I'm chosen as a main healer 9 times out of 10?  <br />
<br />
Just tonight in fact, I put up lfg and got a tell instantly &quot;Can you main heal in wos?&quot;  Well.... sure I can.  Its it my preferred way to spend an evening?  No.  Do I have a rez when our puller died?  No.  (well, 0% yeah).  Would I have rather debuffed, CC'd, nuked, dotted, and backed up a cleric or druid?  Yes.  <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Because SoE wants diversity<br />
<br />
<br />
?? Guess thats sarcasm hehe.  Hope you aren't serious lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Because this would affect ALL slowers, when all we want is to make our heals scale with the mitigation of our slows. This way, if a mob was only slightly slowable, we'd still be able to heal as if it was partially affected(close to anyway as it would never be 100% the same), and the mob would be slightly slowed and generate the SoE intended DPS for every other slower<br />
<br />
<br />
If slow and its effects were consistent in groups, then SOE could much more easily make healing in groups fair and consistent.  Having some groups with 65% slow, some with 70% slow, some with 75% slow, and mobs with 3 levels of mitigation on top of that, is just way too complex a system imo.  <br />
<br />
If all mobs mitigated X amount, or mitigated none and slow was 25%, then it would be very straightforward to set the mobs dps.  As it is, SOE has to say.. well in the worst case scenario, the mob is bard slowed, and the healer is a druid, what should we set the mobs dps to that the group can survive?  Why make things so complicated?  Just to make balancing the game damn near impossible?<br />
<br />
People don't like to keep paying when they get nerfed and for some reason SoE wants them to keep doing that.<br />
<br />
True.  But I'm talking about a real system that can be balanced.  I don't want to bring up politics or economics here.  <br />
<br />
<br />
That's the worst scenario that can happen and all it means is that you have to slow the mob again and timing it better the next time, duh. What do you do now when your slow bounces?<br />
Doesn't your tank face the same unslowed mob and is he getting magically healed?<br />
<br />
Currently you'd try to reslow a mob and your tank's HPs keep dropping. With my suggestion, you'd safe about 6 seconds, because your tank would have an HoT on him that pulses as quick as a bard song after the 2nd slow. In other words, my tank would live and &quot;yours&quot; would die, especially if the second slow bounced too.<br />
<br />
My tank wouldn't die if SOE made certain that my blast heal could keep pace with any unslowed mob's dps in a group encounter.  <br />
<br />
Likewise, my tank wouldn't die if I cast a hot upon inc either.  I find myself (like in RS or mpg) casting a hot well in advance of the mob getting within range of my slow or malos.  Your idea would be less of a headache for sure though.<br />
<br />
Ain't happening, and I wouldn't want it to happen either. I didn't invest 6+ years to have my character get changed to something I have no affinity to.<br />
<br />
This is one of those &quot;Yeah, I agree won't happen&quot; and &quot;I'll agree to disagree&quot; things at this point.  <br />
<br />
In the end, SOE will implement some absurdly complex scheme to bandaid the current system again.  Then, 3-4 expansions from now when dps is once again much much higher, we'll find our slow-hot inadequate, or the difference between a slowed/unslowed mob too great, and we'll be in the exact same position again.<br />
<br />
If SOE keeps actively upgrading our slow-hot, and carefully watching how much they raise mob dps, etc.. It may work as a viable solution for quite some time.  But honestly, SOE's ability to balance new content with player abilities is just dismal.  The less complex the system, the more chance we have at playing an adequate class expansion to expansion. <br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
p.s.<br />
    Does the hot need to know how to 'smartly' transfer to whoever has aggro despite the initial cast aggro?<br />
<br />
Sorry, what?<br />
<br />
<br />
Was in reference to how the hot acted with aggro. In the situation where the enc got aggro first, was wondering if your intention was for the hot to move to whoever had aggro, or whether it was based purely on the aggro at first cast.  You answered that by saying we'd need to cast another high mana slow attempt on the mob to both slow the mob and land our hot on the tank who now had aggro.  <br />
<br />
Might be an interesting implementation to have the hot actually change PC targets depending on who had aggro, although that would be tough to code I bet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I can same the thing about being a Main healer. I didn't put 6+ years into my shammy to become a cleric now. I made a shaman, Iwant to remain a shaman. I don't mind being a healer, seriously, but I'm not classified as one and I don't wish to be classified as one. <br />
<br />
You want scenario with what would happen if we had the same heals as a druid. here's one for ya.....  <br />
<br />
*Raid:<br />
Shamam, druid, clerics all get placed into CH chain.<br />
Someone dies... A tank... Needs new buffs.<br />
You can't buff cuz if you break out of the CH chain, the other tank has a chance to die.<br />
Hence, you get yelled/chewed out by the the one tank that died OR you get yelled/chewed out at from breaking the Cchain. Mean while that tank, that was possibly the MA, or even an ADD tank needs those buffs so he can jump right back in.*<br />
<br />
NO!! I don't think so... I do not... DO NOT... want to be in that kind of situation. I watch for  those that die and I buff them Before they even finish looting their bods. I do not want to be stuck in a CH chain and have to deny a possibly MT, or any of the back up MT's buffs just because I can  not break away from the Chain. It's not happening for me.<br />
<br />
I am honestly, seriously, satisified with the heals we have now. I will admitt yoppa's can be a little stronger considering the level it is, but, I sure as hell not complaining about it. It saves my grp in raids, the Epic heal saves my grp if I can not get everyone from say an AE. The AA's make up a huge difference imo. <br />
<br />
Yes, Shamans can heal, Yes, shamans were possibly better healers than the cleric at some point in time. Yes, shamans can be Mhealers in a grp situation. Hell, I was able to heal in RS... It was a tad slow, but it was doable till we gained a real healer. It's all in how you play the class and how well you know the heals and what to do with them. It took me a while to get the hang of it, but now that I have it, I'm happy with it. Shamans are not classified as healers, I don't care what anyone says. Sure, it's the discription that they were the healers of their primative tribe or whatever. But that doesn't classify them as healers.<br />
<br />
Shamans = debuffer/buffer/slower/back up healer. Hell, we are even have one up on the druids/clerics with Nadox, they don't get a grp cure like that and we do. Granted it's self grp only, that they can change, make other grp targetable. If we were meant to be healers, we would have had the heals to do it a long time ago. Simply put. No, we have a million buffs, we have our nukes, dots, debuffs, cripples, etc.... <br />
<br />
Take this post as you will. I for one like being a shaman and I don't wish to turn into a cleric. If what is said happens, especially basing our heals off our slows, which is pure stupidity imo, I may quit eq. I put far to much work into my SHAMAN to have her turn into a cleric/Mhealer, possibly even thrown into Cchain where she does not belong. Again, if that is what I wanted in the first place, I would have made cleric or a healer that did belong in that situation. A shaman wasn't meant for that, I'm sorry, but it's how I feel.<br />
<br />
If they want to improve the shamans, then improve their dog, nukes/dots, recast time on spells, duration on buffs. Focus on those things instead trying to make a shaman a Mhealer. If you were to base our heals from our slows, we are no better than what we are now, to me that is just nerfing the shaman in the wrong direction. Give us buffs that actually do something, make spells easier to get (for everyone cuz some of us have a real hard time getting spells that are highly needed), make the durations longer, give us a lvl 69-70 slow, I don't know. These are the things that should be focused on, not the heals.<br />
<br />
These are the things that make a shaman, not their heals. If a shaman was meant to heal, they would have all the heals that druids/clerics have. Pure and simple.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who claims differwntly didn't have or use all the tools or is lying.  <br />
<br />
Until PoP I was main healer for every group.  I would pity-group guild clerics and tell them nuke, because I was the better healer.  Mana efficiency was the most important thing, and I was more mana efficient that a cleric, and the damage was not so fierce as to kill people quickly<br />
<br />
Here is a direct quote from the Everquest Manual &quot;Ruins of Kunark&quot; <br />
<br />
Similar to a cleric but closer to a tribal witchdoctor, the shaman can be found among the more primitive races.  Her primary focus is healing but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well<br />
<br />
It was only after PoP that the description of shaman was changed.  Anyone who started playing a shaman 5-6 years ago, had the shaman are healers description as their primary guide to what a shaman was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">Ahh.  Now we seem to be getting to a new point here.  You want the diversity of the shaman class to come from gear/aa/skill/etc... <br />

Clerics and Druids have that limitation also.  But I totally disagree that this in some way &quot;diversifies&quot; our class.  Buffing/debuffing/nuking/dotting/cc'ing is all effected by gear also.

Just because our new proc doesn't have a focus, doesn't mean it never will, nor does it mean that its effectiveness isn't linked to our mana pool.  Same with CC and being able to take hits.<br />
<br />
Saying that balance and diversity comes from gear is the wrong route.  Lets balance the naked shaman first (against the other classes, not the content), then worry about gear.<br />
<br />
You misunderstood. I am the first person to say that balancing through gear is the biggest mistake you could do.<br />
<br />
What I am saying is that your role needs to be able to be improved with AAs/skill/gear ect. and scale accordingly. There needs to be a progression, buffing doesn't scale.<br />
Whether I cast Panther at the beginning of the expansion or at the end, it will always add the same amount of damage, no matter how much I improved gear/AAs/levels/skill through these 6 months.<br />
<br />
Six months from now, I will be a better healer(let's pretend there'd be no healing changes coming up for argument's sake). Six months from now, my Panther will be the same as now. <br />
I refuse to look at it as my role, if it's going to be static. It's so static in fact, that it won't matter whether I am fighting in RS or in NC. My contribution AND my performance is exactly the same in both zones.<br />
<br />
If slow and its effects were consistent in groups, then SOE could much more easily make healing in groups fair and consistent.  Having some groups with 65% slow, some with 70% slow, some with 75% slow, and mobs with 3 levels of mitigation on top of that, is just way too complex a system imo.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't the differing slow percentages as they won't even be noticably for mobs that usually are partially slowable. The problem is the healing gap between the 3 main healers.<br />
<br />
My tank wouldn't die if SOE made certain that my blast heal could keep pace with any unslowed mob's dps in a group encounter<br />
<br />
I don't think we have the option to ask for a blast heal that makes slow superfluous.<br />
The concept is pretty clear, SoE wants Shamans to be main healers by using Slow + Heals, making sure that they can still heal when they aren't able to slow a mob as much as they'd like to, but at the same time to not outshine every other healer when they can fully take advantage of Slow. Hence my suggestion is aiming at just that.<br />
<br />
Likewise, my tank wouldn't die if I cast a hot upon inc either.  I find myself (like in RS or mpg) casting a hot well in advance of the mob getting within range of my slow or malos.  Your idea would be less of a headache for sure though.<br />
<br />
Especially in dungeons, you usually find yourself losing time when doing this. Every second you have to delay your slow due to spell refresh and HoT cast time, the tank is taking unproportional extra damage.<br />
<br />
In RS, you usually can cast the HoT on the tank and then pull when you're ready however. In such cases, it would be the same, just that my autocasting HoT would stack on top of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Might be an interesting implementation to have the hot actually change PC targets depending on who had aggro, although that would be tough to code I bet.<br />
<br />
As far as I know they have been working on finding a way to code this. If this was in place, the autocasting HoT Slow would be even more desirable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would work just the same with another healer in group, keeping Shaman the preferable slower(which with the upcoming BST slow will be questionable considering their higher durability), much like the idea that suggested that Shaman slows would be mitigated &quot;lighter&quot; than others' without changing the basic mechanics. The Shaman would mitigate additional damage through the HoT instead of altering the mob's delay.<br />
<br />
With this slow the Shaman would actually support heal, just like he can now by using regular HoTs, in cases when his &quot;main job&quot; is slowing, for those who want to fill a group slot with a slower.<br />
<br />
However, that said, we need to walk away from the concept that a group needs 2 healers. No group really does.</div></div><hr />

I hope you are not serious. Ever heard of a rez/buff group? Any shaman not in that group will get yelled at if he ninja buffes rezzed people. And I am sure the tank would rather like the cleric/druid buffs first before getting the few HP our wimpy buffs give. Which is why a rez/buff group always has a cleric and a druid (as well as shaman, pally and beast, at least the way we do it).<br />

All you are saying, kazuyal, is  &quot;Do not change a thing, I do not want anything new&quot; if I understand this correctly. Sorry, but I, and quite a few more shamans, wish to get improvements for our class. Not just for our own benefit, but also for the groups and raids we participate in. <br />
<br />
I still like the stances idea best because it allows a shaman to shift his role when the group/raid setup benefits from it. My main argument is that it increases the stackability of shamans enormously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">It seems to me a simple solution to giving us the option to be main healers in all group while slowing would be quite simple.  Reduce the casting Time on Malos and our blast heal to 3.0 seconds.  Drop the recast timers on Malos/all slows/all heals.  Add a more powerful blast heal.  Our HoTs should also be faster casting.  Wow, fixed.  I'm sure there will still be lots of places, we wouldn't be the &quot;preferred&quot; healer (which is fine with me) but we could do the job and it seems that's what Sony is after.<br />
<br />
You can argue for other ways to fix us (for Sony's envisioned shaman role) and you may have valid points, however, this is a simple solution and easily built on in the future when new expansions come out.<br />
<br />
We all have experienced the problem with being slower/healer at the same time since PoP came out.  If slow bounces, in a tough experience area, it is often a disaster.  Faster casting times on the malo line and spam healing, along with dropped recast times should fix this.<br />
<br />
They are balancing us against a druid and cleric because we can slow.  To do both, we need faster casting spells.   The druid isn't slowing, they can go straight to a heal.  The cleric isn't slowing, they go straight to heals.  A group in a difficult experience area will almost always have a slower.  The easiest way to have us do both is to speed up our casting times and drop the recast timers on heals and debuffs.<br />

<br />
Thats really the bottom line for me.  Regardless of all the minor stuff we talked about before, it really truly does come down to this one point.  If we have to rely on slow landing to keep our tanks alive, we aren't main healers in my book.  <br />
<br />
Slow won't be 'superfluous', it will still be a necessary aid to keep mana from running out.. but it won't be a life or death thing.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps your slow-hot would take just enough edge off to make it not a llife or death situation when slow bounces.  Perhaps not.  Especially if it misfires on another char getting aggro.  Like maybe multiple times.  Today in RS, tank was a bit spacey and the rogue, enc, me were all getting aggro left and right hehe.  That hot would have just sucked in that situation.<br />
<br />
In other words.. I'd rather not have my healing power placed into the hands of the melee.  If the melee weren't working well together, my healing goes to hell.  Thats not right.<br />
<br />
But I really don't see what would be overpowering to give us a blast heal that is equal to a druids. Problem solved right there.<br />
<br />
Druids have CH, we have HoTs.  There's no reason our blast heal couldn't be the same level.  <br />
<br />
(I do think its time for the druid CH, as well as the cleric CH, to get another bump up given the large HP and dps increases since their release.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">CHeal is not getting bumped, now or ever.  Designers and developers HATE cheal.  HATE it with a passion you cannot easily understand.  CHeal breaks encounter design, gear design, and character balance.  It's the single worst part of basic EQ to ever be made part of the game.  Worse than Pacify, worse than Feign Death.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any threads or articles that talk about this more in detail?  I can't ever recall seeing a discussion involving a developer of EQ stating that they did not like the complete heal in game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I don't care.  Clerics and Druids have their special heal (CH), there's ZERO reason why we can't have at least a Druid blast heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">This entire thread is a testament to why I am still FULLY behind some form of focusing our individual choice of roles in the game by using AA or some other means. <br />
<br />
Some shamans want to be better healers. Some don't.<br />
Some shamans want to have more DPS. Some don't.<br />
Some shamans want to be better buffer/debuffers. Some don't. <br />
Etc<br />

Say what you will, but no one is RIGHT and no one is WRONG. <br />
<br />
The idea of a stance thing is WAY WAY too powerful, and since I dont feel like arguing about it, dont bother trying to prove me wrong unless you dont expect an answer. What needs to be done is a &quot;Permanant Stance&quot;. Want to be a better healer? All your slows, buffs and DPS output are reduced. DPS your choice? Expect lower slows, buffs and heals. Buff-Debuff your preference? Better slows, worse heals and DPS. <br />
<br />
And the choice is PERMANANT (with, perhaps, an expensive AA that can change your choice). But being able to toggle is to fit the need of the moment is never going to work. <br />
<br />
A while back I posted some ideas using AAs to accomplish this. You pick your &quot;school&quot; and buy AAs to increase those abilities. The other &quot;schools&quot; then become grayed out, unless you &quot;re-set&quot; the whole thing. <br />
<br />
Tell ya what though, I see a whole lot of posting in this thread that says nothing more to me than &quot;Unbalance my class by making me goddly again, screw Clerics and Druids&quot;. Some of you need a dose of reality, here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>Exin Krup Gutkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">I don't think we have the option to ask for a blast heal that makes slow superfluous. <br />
The concept is pretty clear, SoE wants Shamans to be main healers by using Slow + Heals, making sure that they can still heal when they aren't able to slow a mob as much as they'd like to, but at the same time to not outshine every other healer when they can fully take advantage of Slow.<br />
This is what I was questioning.<br />
<br />
Healing and Slowing can not be done simultaneously.  We can either heal or we can slow at any moment.<br />
<br />
Every healer will have the advantage of slow.  The difference is that other healers can't cast that slow themselves.  As I said before, we are being penalized for our ability to do more than one thing.  Even if they can't be done at the same time, but are expected to be occuring simultaneously.<br />
<br />
We wouldn't outshine every other healer because any other healer can heal without slow.  If they can heal without slow, then if somone does slow the mob it is just that much easier.  I can see no reason why the same can't be done for Shaman.  Make it that we can heal without slow and if we can find the time to slow without the tank dieing then it is that much easier for us.<br />
<br />
This is the reason why I say that Slow is a given.  Either a group with a healer has it, or the healer is a slower as well.<br />
<br />
We shouldn't be Heal+Slow for an effect that is passible when all other healers just need Heal to be effective.  Because they will get the slow as well.  We need to be effective with just a heal.<br />
<br />
Granted this is all based on the assumption that we should be a main healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">and the assumption that everyone WILL have a slower.   Since mitigation I have seen MANY more groups that don't really bother with getting anything more to do slows than maybe a proc or 2.  The fact they have a BL, bard or enchie tends to be unrelated to having slows handy many times as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">Enchanters used to suck at slowing, and habit will probably keep it that way for a good long while.  Tash agro, Forlorn cast time, class-based cowardice makes them not slow mobs till like 70% or something.  With tash being changed, and especially with their Serpent from PoTime, they're effectively the same or better than shaman, just with mez instead of heals.<br />
<br />
Tangential anecdote, little/no point: Shamans used to be really really really rare on Innoruuk, and with the way Enchanters didn't really do their job, I don't think I fought slowed mobs until I started raiding in mid-50s.  In those times, player vs mob dps was a lot more fair, too, though.  This on my first character, eventually level 64 magician.  It was after witnessing shaman powah on raids that I decided to make the gnome/ogre audible :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u185"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p185">I really don't see why we need messed with at all.  I use only Yoppa's Mending, no form of C, and can main heal and slow for basically any tank in MPG and lower.  The only zone I can not do by test is RSS because of the high chance of 2+ quads in a row.  I canni the whole time after each cast that I can (when it is up), use SChanneling, and my other AA;s like AAid to help out.  It works more efficiently with a Paladin tank but I have so far pulled it off with a Shadowknight moderatley geared and a Beastlord from a lower end guild that does not provide raid gear-or the oppurtunity to raid big targets rather, so I feel I really don't want anything with my slow messed with.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have had to make a lot of changes in my play style, I have pushed myself to drive harder and test the limits of my class only to find out we can do anything we want, for the most part.  The last thing I need is for anyone, SoE, or comunity players suggesting we need adjusted to fill this role of MH, when it's being done already with a little more work and heart.  I am Time geared but eventhough my guild is in Qvic/Inny, I don't have one piece of it.  With maxed healing AA's, which I don't have yet, completely, I don't see the problem.  I heard this was suggested because of the mitigation on slows, but jeebus where do you fight at level 70 for experience where the mob is fully slowable?<br />
<br />
Honestly I wish they wouldn't make any changes to us at all.  With the right direction in AA's a great Shaman can pull off the impossible, nuff said.  Magelo is upto date as well if you care to check, but I can do MHeal in MPG and Main Slow at the same time.  I think a goodunderstanding of what each class around you can offer also adds benefits to healin decisions, but a change in slow for increased healing? -No thanks, especially not 50%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldn't the simplest solution be to REMOVE slow mitigation? Then we can heal like we did before and everyone will be happy...everything will be balanced like it was back in the olden days.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with leaving in immune mobs, as it adds a little excitement every so often.  I remember being a main healer in PoI at lvl 57/58 or so and doing just fine. Occasionally coming across one of those immune robots - I could *just* keep the tank alive, and if offered a nice wake up call to a sometimes boring grind.<br />
<br />
Granted PoI is a far cry from RS...but I think a fully slowed Geledran would not be such a formidable foe for a shammy healer.<br />
<br />
NOTE:This is NOT an invitation to add more immune mobs!  Just a sleepy thought from a frustrated kitty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Judge-- you have obviously put a lot of time and effort into your Shaman.  But let us not forget, we are discussing balancing of the ENTIRE class, not just those at the high ends of the game.  <br />
<br />
Example:  Group of 6 in Velk's: Mage, Druid, Zerker, SK, Ranger, Cleric, and me, the Shaman.  I believe the highest level was 54 ( the zerker ).<br />
Pulling spiders and golems, 2 or 3 at a time.  Bad timing a pull of 2 spiders and 1 gargoyle, just as our camped room repops, with 3 more spiders. Of course, the Cleric goes LD.  First thing I do is sic doggy on the mob the MT is smacking, then target hop casting turgurs and hasting the PC's.  All targets slowed, im at 35% mana (thats with canni time between refreshes on Turgurs).  Im thinking to myself,there was absolutely no way the druid and myself could keep up on heals, even when i had two of the spiders aggroed on me, and i was letting them chew on my back as I continued to spam away with my so-called &quot;greater heal&quot; and stoicism.  Sure, we got the job done, but all pets died, mage went down, and the druid went down on the last mob. I myself was left with 17% health and oom.<br />
<br />
This is a perfect example of where the stance idea would have been incredibly effective.  As soon as I noticed the cleric gone, I could have easily just pressed a hotkey, and viola! instantly better healing powers, at the expense of worse slowing; but at that point, with everything slowed, i wouldnt have cared.  However, I do think we need access to better heals sooner. By level 54, the mobs are, more than likely, outpacing a 500-600 hp heal, and my measly 300hp heal hasnt really been effective since my mid 40's.  Stoicism is a nice addition to my heal line, but no MT or pure melee class enjoys being snared and slowed for 30 secs.<br />
<br />
--Still a noob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u188"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p188">Thlayli of Xev, the difference in raw dps between a poi mob at 75% slowed and 0% slowed is radically different from an RS named 75% slowed or unslowed.  Even more so on raid targets.<br />
<br />
The mitigation was put into place to 'balance' the ever growing tremendous dps difference between slowed and unslowed (where unslowed was not possible to heal against, whereas slowed was trivial).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, SOE forgot to compensate the healers that relied on that 75% slow....<br />
<br />
Now, irregardless of what type of mob we are facing (slowable, not slowable, partially slowable, etc..), SOE is still expressing an interest in tying our healing to our ability to slow, which is just friggin retarded. <br />
<br />
Perhaps they will give us what Giac suggested and we'll get an insta hot that scales with mob dps.  Perhaps we'll get a stance.  Dunno.  What I do know is that tying healing to slow is wrong.  Every group has slow.<br />
<br />
You either remove slow and rebalance all healing and all mob dps, <br />
or<br />
You take slow away from enc/bst/bard so that any group we are in, is the only group with slow, and therefore you can tie our healing to slow (and again all mobs dps would need to be tweaked so groups without slow could function),<br />
or <br />
You come up with some complex scheme that takes into account what type of mob we are facing, and magically increases or decreases our healing depending on several factors.<br />
or<br />
You give us stances that force us into roles whereby we become more effective at either healing or debuffing<br />
or<br />
....<br />
<br />
At this point, we'll just have to wait and see.  I haven't heard any ideas on this board or eqlive that I've liked so far.  Each one that I've read about has a major downfall of some sort.</div></div><hr />

You dont see this as totally overpowering? Whats to stop us from doing this every fight, back and forth, slow everything, one button, become Cleric-level healers? <br />
<br />
My personal choice is for players to have a &quot;Stance&quot; but its permanant (or re-settable through AA). You wanna be a Shaman Healer, pick healer, and your slows are forever gimped.<br />
I haven't heard any ideas on this board or eqlive that I've liked so far.  Each one that I've read about has a major downfall of some sort.<br />
Welcome to EQ. You cant have these big leaps one way without some compensation in the other direction somewhere. Otherwise, you will end up with 15 classes of Uber Characters that wont ever need each other in any way. Balance is a process. Its give and take. Its a tweak here, and a nudge there, and a step back on this side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u190"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p190">Personally I think we shamans should drop the idea of stances and just get our current spells upgraded..  I mean we are almost there with all our spells just a little fine tweeking and we will have no problems..<br />
<br />
This is the best way to go and everyone will be happy.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">Shortening the reuse timer on Ancestral Aid would be a great place to start.  I'm almost 100% confident I could heal RSS with a shortened reuse timer of that spell and better and sooner upgrade of Complete Heal.  And I understand where you are coming from Vox, but eventhough you are not high end player, there are plenty of zones you have access to for focus effects that are useable up to level 70.  Granted they are not on the % that Qvic/Time gera give, but something is better than nothing.  I realize at 54 it's a tad harder to fill this role, but with thought out and proper mana management a Shaman can do it without stopping ot med, or at least minimal.<br />
<br />
I have put a lot of time into my Shaman, yes I have.  To me there is no other class and I hate all other classes and only play with them because I feel everyone should be afforded a chance to feel like they are doing something . . .(Hehe) . . . That being said, Shaman doesn't need nerfed or stepped back to be on par, we need something a little sooner in the line of heals and an increase in CH.  Take a look at slow - Enchanters are only 5% below us, but look at our CH - We are far behind the Druids and Clerics, to me that's not balanced. We have the same advantage to Druids solo so why shouldn't we have the same in healing.<br />
<br />
I've heard the arguement about Shamans soloing better in higher zones because of the slow ability but that's simply not true for some zones.  NC for instance, you fight RRunner unslowed it's still a cakewalk because with Snare and as long as you baby step him he doesn't summon, or at least not often.  But put us in a CH fight, Druids will be criting for over 8k, we are far behind that even with healing AA' s maxed.<br />
<br />
IN short-  Decrease reuse timer of Ancestral Aid and give us a better and sooner Complete Heal.  Shamans will be on par with the Priests after that IMO.</div></div><hr />

If we were meant to be dps, we'd be like the necros/mages/wiz/bst so on with the pets and spells do so.<br />
<br />
If we were meant to be healers we would have the healing spells like the clerics and now druids the same time they got theirs.<br />
<br />
If we were meant to be pure buffers, that would be the only line of spells we would have, probly set up like the cleric. Only with more useful buffs.<br />

Sure our haste is not up to enchanter level, but compared to no haste, its still quite effective.  Our healing, as it stands may just compare.

All the slow does is allow the cleric or druid to save mana and lowers the likelyhood of burst damage taking out the tank.<br />
<br />
Without a slower, they would just have to pull slower, they don't want to pull slower that's why they get a slower =]<br />

We need to be able to keep the tanks up by ourselves, unslowed. Nothing else is acceptable to me.</div></div><hr />
