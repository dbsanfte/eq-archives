<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, this isn't necessarily a shaman-oriented question so pardon me.  I'm asking it here because for one, folks here seem generally knowledgeable, and two, this forum has a good amount of activity.  If this is too off-subject feel free to delete this thread and/or smack me upside the noggin.<br />
<br />
The question is, what factors influence melee weapon damage (primarily concerned for tanks, like say, my ranger alt)?  How does the weapon's damage, wielder's class, wielder's stats, wielder's level, and whatever else figure in?  How does the damage cap work?<br />
<br />
I'm less concerned with DPS and ratios than knowing how much damage an X can do with a Y at any given level/str/etc.<br />
<br />
I tried google and some of the more useful general EQ sites but couldn't find the info.<br />
<br />
If someone can point me to a resource that deals with this info that'd be great too.<br />
<br />
I guess I could add that even with full buffs I seem to do very pitiful melee damage with my spear, so I'm guessing that class has something to do with it.<br />
<br />
Although I am the shaman most of the time, I do use my ranger alt for tradeskill item farming because his tracking makes it very efficient.  The critters he farms were green to him but I leveled him up a bit more for dual wield and double attack so he could be even more efficient.  I'm interested in weapon damage calculations to see if/how he'll become more deadly over time.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think the exact formulas have ever been decoded, but in the end it boils down to ATK vs AC with respective levels thrown in. Raising your weapon skill raises your ATK in turn. A check of some sort is made against the target's AC based on your ATK, and your damage is calculated from several factors including weapon base damage, level modifier, 2h bonus, how much you beat the AC of the target by, etc. Other mitigation factors include things like dodge, block, parry, riposte, etc.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion:<br />
Max weapon skill = good<br />
Higher ATK = good<br />
low AC mobs = good, high AC mobs = bad<br />
<br />
I think the Steel Warrior forums are your best bet for actual statistics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there are a few hardcaps for damage too..first one is level 10 i think (might be level 12 or so), second is 20, and i believe there is a third around 40 (might be some after, but i dont remember for sure).<br />
<br />
As was mentioned warrior, or possibly rangers glade would have more information (rangers glade is forums.interealms.com/ranger fyi~)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank ya, I'll try that ranger's glade.  I visit www.eqrangers.com for info for ma ranger but they don't seem to have this info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Formula for max hit goes something like this: max damage=(strength+weapon skill)/100  * weapon listed damage + damage bonus.<br />
Dont think anyones ever adequately worked out the relationship between ac and atk though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's a sheet on lucy.fnord.net that shows damage bonus related to level and weapon, this allows you to figure DamageBonus per second, just add basedamage*2/delay and this will give you a ballpark number of how your ranger will perform with a weapon - the number you come up with is called MN for Magic Number. Against High ac mobs you rely more on DB/delay than ratio, en example would be in ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There used to be a weapon damage calculator out, bout the time of Kunark.  It had every weapon and you would toss in class, haste item, weapon, and it would pop out a graph showing aproximitly what DPS you would do from lvl 1 to 60.  I lost the program due to a format, and have been unable to locate it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Different, but close, perhaps an earlier version, but close enough to give ya some idea probably.</div></div><hr />

As an aside, for priests (or shamans at least), assuming you have 200 Offense and 200 skill in wielding your weapon, the formula's something like:<br />
<br />
4.18 * DMG<br />
<br />
Based on a 74 DMG Dathor Great Hammer maxing at 310 and a 39 DMG Hammer of Spiritcalling maxing at 163. <br />
<br />
The only fly in the ointment is that I've seen a couple of 165s from the Hammer of Spiritcalling, smashing hundreds of Kobolds in the Warrens with FA up. Using Rabid Bear didn't produce any 165s, nor anything above 310 with the Dathor hammer.<br />

Just a note, if you look again you'll see its str+skill, not offense+skill.  So, it works out about the same.  But this is for max hit, not the modal damage number, which is what shummn is quoting, I believe.  That number is more accurate for guessing how much damage you can actually do, max hit is just for dreaming :)<br />
To be honest, I'm not sure were even on the same damage table, this is the 'standard' melee table.<br />
There used to be a nice explanation about this on a forum.  I'll be danged if I can remember where, and its probably long since deleted by now.</div></div><hr />
