<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I would like to know how a Shaman gets the kind of AC that this person supposedly has.<br />
<br />
I have looked closely at his stats (character and armor) and compared it to mine.<br />
<br />
I honestly do not see how it is even remotely possible for a shaman to have an AC higher than the #18 Warrior across all of the servers.<br />
<br />
Is Magelo bugged somehow?<br />
<br />
Here is the link to his Magelo profile:  Grumpf Silvermoon (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=247586)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I know that section, but the most you can add is 100, no more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What Chukzombi is saying is that you can put in an AC modifier - you can fiddle the figure if it's not quite accurate.<br />
<br />
I suspect this person originally didn't have his Defense set to 200 in skills, and used the AC modifier to adjust it. When he updated Defense later, his AC got stupid.<br />
<br />
One thing you can do to compare gear - go to &quot;Modifiers&quot;, &quot;AC&quot; - you can see how much AC he has got from gear. In his case it's 561, in your case 547. His gear seems to be a pretty similar level to yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you look at his ac modifiers youll see he has only 560 in ac adding gear. on my mag i got 601 and i only have 1519 unbuffed. Hes obviously monkeying with Magelos ac system somehow. its a free service dont expect airtight security.  dont make yourself crazy over it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, just makes you wonder.<br />
<br />
I'm not a stat freak, but that Magelo made me do a double take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think that it used to allow you to modify AC a lot more than 100. I've seen other Magelo's with crazy AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ppl calm down, its just a bug.<br />
i entered my ac correct but somehow alot of ac got added.<br />
correct ac is 1460 or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No need to be defensive, I was honestly curious about how your AC was so high on your Magelo is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There was a bug in magelo for a while that it was calculating ac wrong. He must have done it during that time and not updated since. It's not that uncommon to see ac's off.</div></div><hr />
