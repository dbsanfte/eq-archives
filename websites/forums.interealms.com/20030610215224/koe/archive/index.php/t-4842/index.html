<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Woohoo found it, its a program called dremples you can find it by searching google for it.  I'd post a SS of my desktop to show you what I mean, for it to be active on the boards I have to put it in bmp format and thats 2.25 MB heh.  <br />
Helek, Active desktop lets you show web content as your background picture.  For example what I did have for my background was the weather channel showing the weather for my area.  To figure out how to use look through the Windows Help off the start menu, it'll brief you pretty well.<br />
<br />
Here is the web site that I got dremples from, but it seems to be down for now http://www.geisswerks.com/drempels</div></div><hr />
