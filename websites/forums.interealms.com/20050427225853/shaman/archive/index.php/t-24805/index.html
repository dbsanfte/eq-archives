CE x2 + 1 regular (for brother)<br />
<br />
Wife and I want all the fancy-shmancey doo-dads that come with the CE.<br />
<br />
Side note: Enjoyin' the hell outta the game so far. Human Warlock is 10 and just got his Void Walker. NE Hunter is 8. Tauren Shaman is 6. Others vary, but those are the ones I've played the most. Not really focusing on the Hunter because he will be my main come retail, and I don't want to learn everything in OB. :) Though I will concede...I absolutely LOVE the Tauren home lands and the native American/Eskimo flair it has. He actually may end up being one of my primaries after retail. :)</div></div><hr />

Collector boxes for video games just seem way over the top for me.  MUCH different from paying $8 to play it a week early.  *snicker*</div></div><hr />

The ingame pet will probably suck but who cares ? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's only like 30 bucks more than the regular here in canada so it's all good.<br />

<br />
Chances are the pet will be as useful as the glasses you got in the SWG collector's edition. In other words useless.<br />
The glasses had no stats and you could not wear a helemt with them on. All for show. Pet is probably a random cute thing that follows you areound and dances but does nothing useful. They are not gonna give a real pet that can attack etc to ppl who play warriors or classes that should not have pets.<br />

HA HA HA HA HAH! Sorry bro. She's only got a brother. :)<br />
<br />
We kinda grew into it together. We were both night owls when we first met (10+ years ago). I was in a band and she liked to go out dancing with her girlfriends. Over the years we settled down quite a bit, and with my IT career computer based hobbies just kinda came naturally. Though I still do quite a bit of leather crafting as well as music recording, I'll admit that most of our time (outside of our professional careers) is spent together in some virtual world conquering evil or vanquishing villains of some sort. :)<br />
<br />
They're out there. I'm just glad I found mine already.  :p</div></div><hr />

My wife plays a lvl 68 Wiz &amp; 65 Bard.  AND she loves Mechwarrior and getting killed in CS.  She's horrible at gaming (and knows it) but loves playing.  If she didnt play I'd never see her :)<br />
<br />
She's a High School Teacher and is &quot;The Hot Teacher&quot;... she's asked to Prom the first day of school and her kids love the fact that she can chat with them about gaming.<br />
<br />
Sorry... /brag off :)<br />

I'm a lucky S.O.B. and I know it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
She has a 66 necro, 63 druid, 52 cleric and countless newbies.  Meanwhile, I've taken a shaman to 65 and my highest alt is a 41 warrior.  She out-games me :).  She gets nauseous playing first person shooters though, so we can't deathmatch together.  She kicks my ass at fighting games on PS2 though.  She also finished Final Fantasy X and I haven't even come close, oh well, hehe.<br />
<br />
I'm very lucky :).  Keep looking though, I think there's a lot of women out there that like to play when given the chance.<br />

She plays a 65 cleric and 62 druid when bored of clericing and wants her solo time.She's completed all the final fantasy games. Heh Ive never been able to beat them she takes em over after watching me play and finishes em out for me.</div></div><hr />

&lt;---- Also has a gamer wife.  She plays EQ and WoW.  She likes Zelda games on Nintendo, etc.  She not a FPS player though.<br />
<br />
I would like to buy the CE, but that is a bit too much money just to get the pets.<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/news/images/04-11/pets.jpg<br />
<br />
Even though I would love to have a mini-Diablo. Those pets are just for looks.  If you are a hunter, you could look like a walking zoo: tame a cat, have a panda from CE, and buy a decorative owl (if you can have both).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Dude it's not about the pets at all. It's about the game on DVD (no cd swapping) the art book and the map that is printed on a cloth. Also the guest pass is nice for my friend. I am gonna get him hooked :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My wife isn't really a gamer per se, but I did get her to play EQ, and she really took off in it. She has a 67 warrior in EQ1 to go along with my 68 shaman, and we are guilded together.  She tried CoH but didn't like it much.  She REALLY disliked EQ2.  And now she is more hooked on the WoW beta than I am; we will definately play it retail.<br />
<br />
I don't ever see her playing a non-MMP game, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If you add the cost of the reg. edition &amp; 1-month subscription, it almost the cost of the CE. <br />
Ill get the CE with all its junk.<br />
<br />
Eh?  The RE doesn't come with a 1-month subscription?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I don't quite have a gamer wife.. Haven't quite married her yet (that's next year).  <br />
<br />
However to get a gamer chick, here's what ya do...<br />
<br />
Find someone who isn't appuled at gaming, doesn't need to play... Then introduce her to gaming and get her addicted. /shrug that worked for me.</div></div><hr />
