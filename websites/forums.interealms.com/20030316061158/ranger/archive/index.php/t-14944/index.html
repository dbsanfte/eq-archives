<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tanas Moorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, was wondering if you all  have stopped using Warders in favor of SoT and CoR?  or is it situational, I would assume that all stacking issues for SoN and CoE apply, anyone comment please?<br />
<br />
I would assume it is like this<br />
<br />
Outdoors is what most PoP areas are or all not sure.<br />
WP+NP+GWF+thorncoat=<br />
<br />
125 Atk, 14AC , 5 regen, 26 DS, 75HP<br />
<br />
SoT+ CoR+CoP+GWF+NP+thorncoat=<br />
<br />
155atk, 67ac, 39DS, 125HP<br />
<br />
That sound  about right?<br />
<br />
Of course you can throw in chloro and str and what not and of course adding bladecoat and other stuff until lvl 65 when one would most likely use POTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use CotR, CoP and SoT over Warder's.  More atk, same hps, more ac and more DS .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tanas Moorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok, just was wondering if there were many stacking issues/bugs, thanks, Juneau</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">not memd warders since i got  SOT,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kalanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use Warder's when I'm soloing - Can't beat the duration.  In XP groups, I use CoTR, CoP, SoT.<br />
<br />
-Kal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've moved over as well to the triplet. Well more to the point, the double SoT and SoP. I use a 10th ring and that doesn't stack with CoR.<br />
<br />
It won't stack with SV (BST) and BMB (PAL). Well, SV and SoT will overwrite eachother all day long. Annoying as hell.<br />
<br />
Just let BMB stack with everything will make life better. Then only the BST and RNG will be bickering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I always use CoP + SoT + CoE over WP now, more atk, more hp, more ac, less DS unless I keep shield of thorns up, but DS was the part I cared least about with WP anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use SoT + CotP (SotP when Luan is around!) all the time now.  I do not use CotR or Bladecoat unless I have a reason to need the extra AC (ie. tanking for an exp group - not that it has happened more than once.  =p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Toshiden Satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the only time I ever use WP now is when I am off factioning, or farming tradeskill type stuff, where I simply don't need the extra atk and I dont want to recast buffs as often.  But in groups/raids, it's always SoT/Cotp (don't have cotp upgrade yet =/ )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snakeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use CoR, SoT, and CoP (/rude Spectreal parchments).  I dont use wolf form since it wont stack with avator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">when i got cor i memed it and put it in the back of my book, when i got sot i memed it and put wp in the back of my book.<br />
<br />
i don't tank so cor is pointless, and a waste of a buff slot imo.   the added atk with sot and sop (cop for those without sop) is too much to go without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Azarius  you never cast CoR on other people?... i hardly find a group where people don't want that AC/DS, the only ones that don't have the 10th ring<br />
<br />
<br />
but anyways i use warders for factioning b/c of the DS and length<br />
<br />
<br />
more atk, more HPs the better... can't wait for the WP upgrade  i'm sure i'll always have it up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Underbrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If CoR only stacked with the 10th ring ... sigh</div></div><hr />
