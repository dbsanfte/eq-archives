Was just wondering if anyone knew anything about this item. It is iksar shaman usable and I heard a rumor that it was for some type of a shaman quest? Does anyone know anything about this. The shield dropped in the basement of Karnor's but I haven't even been able to find this item in the Alakhazam database. :(</div></div><hr />
