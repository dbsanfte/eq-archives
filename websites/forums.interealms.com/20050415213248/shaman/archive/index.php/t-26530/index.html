<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With enc and bst slows climbing close to ours<br />
And Rng and Paladin heals approaching ours<br />
And the sweet new Panther nerfs.. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking of leveling up one of my other characters as my main.  I would be gearing him with trash drops from PoTime runs mainly, and he'd be played mainly in GoD+ raiding eventually.<br />
<br />
My two choices are:<br />
1.  Zerker (currently lvl 50)<br />
2.  Necro (currently lvl 64)<br />
<br />
I have fun playing both, and to be honest, the thought of playing a melee is attractive to me.  The only thought I'd have about the zerker is that I might get bored on raids.  The stun/snare line is great for instant aggro, like to save a cleric.. but other than that, I&quot;m going to be just htting attack and thats it.. <br />
<br />
The necro is far more complex (was my first character actually), and I'm 10x as familar with him.  The only thing that makes me hesistant is having to be a mana battery on raids.. I'm not sure I'd like that much.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm looking for some advice.  If you were to re-roll, and your choice was melee dps vs necro, what would you pick?  <br />
<br />
I pretty much know both classes well.. but having never raided with either, I guess I'm seeking others impressions of the more long time roles these classes have in raiding.  <br />
<br />
Or, to heck with it, I could power level about anything with a shaman.  I wonder what the &quot;most fun&quot; class is?  Having been a buffer for so long.. I'm quite attracted to dps classes now.  You show up, chat, and just blow crap up.  hehe.  The simplicity there is attractive.<br />
<br />
At any rate, enough babbling. If anyone has comments, I'd love to hear them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I personally like monk and necro. If it wasn't for my bf I'd probly roll out to my necro or monk chick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I 2box a 68BL right now...with the upgrades to BL slows and even to BL heals, they are getting closer and closer to what we are/were.  They even get to melee...and some nice pets too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think after a time you'll get bored with not being able to do all the crap a shaman can do. Unless you roll a chanter or a druid or bard, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the most fun class is the shaman. no need to reroll!<br />
<br />
but since that wasn't one of the choices i would have to say necro. you can snare stuff and run 'em around in circles for hours. what fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the most fun class is the shaman. no need to reroll! <br />
I wholeheartedly agree!  The shaman in WoW is a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>hasek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have a lvl 61 berserker, and getting to know the class has been pretty fun. I enjoy spamming decent sized numbers in melee damage. The discs they get are good, but I disagree with their long recast times. Also, I disagree with using one and watching 4 become inactive. The cleave II aug I made him makes him crit a decent amount. Heck, soon I'll be able to spam the new gimp panther every hit. The AA's I'll get will hopefully make him useful DPS. <br />
<br />
He's pretty much bazaar-geared, my shaman has farmed for him. I got an EP rot for him, I'll gear him up that way. Hopefully my guild will get bored and I'll get him the Fennin kill. Eventually get him a Time backflag.<br />
<br />
He's the perfect alternative to a shaman, I enjoy being a slacker now and then. A legitimate concern is that raiding would get boring eventually just meleeing over and over. Plus, I still love to raid with my shaman, no matter what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And Rng and Paladin heals approaching ours<br />
<br />
A quick not about ranger heals.  They dont even close to approach shaman heals.  Yea, they did bump out 650HP heal to 1100, but we a damned druid hybrid.  Additionally, healing focus for rangers is very rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have MANY classes over 60; 66 chanter, 65 shaman, 70 paladin, 63 rogue, 69 necro and a few classes over 40.   <br />
<br />
What I can tell you is this....EVERY class has their hayday. <br />
 Rogues went from crap to way overpowered in RoK.  <br />
<br />
Necros went from way overpowered, to unwanted in groups,  to just right and continue to go up and down.  <br />
<br />
Paladins were ok pre rok, sucked in rok and really shot up in PoP when they found that holding aggro was so important. <br />
<br />
Enchanters were GODS when PoP came out, then went back in the crapper/bot bitch once charmed got nerfed to hell and people realized that chanters were good for buffs only if CC wasn't NEEDED.  <br />
<br />
Shamans were the solo kings at one point and their slow/buffs really made them awesome.  I remember NEEDING a shaman for many camps.  Torpor was just so powerful too back then.  After beastlords came on the set, shamans started to shine a bit less.  Then slow mitigation etc. and shamans started to go down hill a bit.<br />
<br />
Warriors/clerics will always be needed.  You can't raid(anything good) without them, PERIOD.  Kinda stupid, but soe just can't figure out how to change that. <br />
<br />
All classes seem to be THE class at one point or another.  The next expansion comes out and they sink back down and another takes the lead.  Thats why I play SEVERAL classes.  Trust me when I say the grass is always greener till you play that class.  Classes get a bit boring after playing them full time for years.  Changing to alts for a bit always refreshes your main class.  Shamans could use a few tweaks, but they are still a cool class and very wanted.  Are they fun to play??   Shamans today are a bit less fun to play maybe , because of decreased soloability.  I think thats why the Panther line of spells is so important to shamans now.  I gives them more soloability AND a way to do dps, a shamans weakness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SK do seem quite good.  I'm leveling up one right now to join my current Shaman/BL 2box.  Once I get him up high enough to join, I might look at replacing one of the other two.</div></div><hr />

But since you are upset with our recent changes and the rising power of other classes similar to ours, i would say go with a necro..  I love no other class as much as my shaman, never have, never will love anything more.  But Necro's can dot, snare, and get all kinds of cool abilities.  Berserker on the other hand never really grabbed my attention.. They do do alot of damage when they get a sufficient ammount of aa's.  But like you stated i believe you might get bored during raids, i know i would.  I would say go with the necromancer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed necro. IF your playing a shaman it's probably because of the the all around ability that makes us so much fun to have. Where we can (though used to do much better) solo and group and pretty much find ourselves useful in a variety of situations. The necro now a days is the same way except more heavy on the solo end and a little bit less on the gruop (though mw in omens is rediuclously useful). <br />
<br />
Honestly would imagine you would get bored with pretty much any class other then the necro. I know I personally can't play anything but shaman/necro.<br />
<br />
As to mana batteries on raids this should not be happening except on very few raids as a necro will out dps pretty much everybody but the rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nothing comes closer to a Shaman than a necro, at least in my opinion. It is a kinship of sorts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Necro's are fun if you want to be a caster.  However, for me, nothing compares to the mind-numbing fun of my monk alt, Klumsy.  Its fun to play around with different weapon sets and see just how badly I can out-DPS the &quot;MT&quot; in my group.<br />
Hit 31 with him yesterday and I'm currently doing well over 100 DPS with a 2hb!  They really are a lot of fun, especially when you run in a 70 shammy for haste.  Sure, I could buff the crap out of him and blast heal him, but it's an exciting challenge to see what he can solo with just haste on him.  Chain pulled 4 red sarnaks in OT with him yesterday, haste only...until some bastard 50-ish Shaman came by and threw regen on me. So, if you can 2-box, play the monk.  Shammy slow the mob, haste the monk and watch the beat-down begin =)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  just used a DPS calculator. 2hb dps is 218, dual wielding weapons DPS is 149.  Ill recheck my numbers...something might be off on the dual wield...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Almost a year or so ago i was in the same situation and eventually made my necro my new main. Best decision i have ever made, combined with a shaman it' a killer combo. I would deffinitelly not playing EQ today if it wasnt for that change,  now i enjoy it more as ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I also play a 65 Berserker with only 40AA's or so, and DPS wise without AA's they are pretty useless. Berserkers really come into their own once you start to get 50+ AA's in offense, and when you are 100+ then you can really put out some good DPS. If going berserker route know that until you have a fair few aa's and good weapon you will struggle to output some real nice damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I now play a Wizard.  I started the Wizard and the shaman within about 2 weeks of each other back in 2001 when I got tired of my ranger, which wasmy first character.  I had much more fun as a shaman than a wizard, because in Velious shaman were crazy powerfull.  So the shaman got levels and the wizard didnt..well..not as many anyway.  <br />
<br />
But it was FA and the drudgery of short term, limmited effect buffs coupled with the undesirability of Gates that did it in for me.  I started playing the wizard more and more again, and I had a blast (groan..bad pun) actually doing damage to a mob instead of giving   others a better capacity to do damage that I did as a shaman.  I still play Thor on occasion, but wizard is now my main.  I cant walk away from the class that I played and loved for 3 years though, which is why Im still concerned with shaman issues and why I still come here :)</div></div><hr />

I have to agree here. After playing a Shaman, othre classes just seem to bore me fast. I think about the only REAL potential challange and fun would be available on a Chanter or Bard (not really druid, IMHO). Problem is, in a lot of raids, extra Chanters are almost worse than extra Shamans. <br />
<br />
I would go Bard.</div></div><hr />

218 DPS with a 31 Monk? Er, what are you using as your parser?</div></div><hr />

Was using a spreadsheet format doo-hicky thingamajig.  Rechecked and realized there was a field for proc damage...fixed that and the new (correct?) number was 155.19.  I would like to check that against a parser to see if that's correct; any info on a good program would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how the removal of poison dot aggro will affect the necros, who rely on aggro for kiting from the early 50s, One said that a disease/debuff spell was their best for aggro kiting, but I haven't checked up on that.<br />

You might find with a BER that LFG can get very tedious. I gave up on my rogue around lvl 52, whan it started to get hard to find groups.</div></div><hr />

Really hasn't affected us much. If it's a long kite you might have to cast low level fear which realy pisses a mob off but it hasn't been a big deal. Actually have to keep one eye on what your oding now is all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I wholeheartedly agree!  The shaman in WoW is a lot of fun.<br />
Actually..the Hunter in WoW is just a little better than the Shaman in WoW..but I like both over all other classes there....<br />
<br />
About re-rolling..play the necro...class shares alot of simular things as a shammy so necro will be easy to learn..I have both in EQ..Shaman is main..necro second main..all other just alts.<br />
<br />
On a side note - To me, a shaman of 5 years - I find playing this class now has become too fustrating. Our class is dissappearing. This is directly SOE dervs fault and it saddens me. They have not listen to us. Almost all our once revered abilities have been given away to other classes. If anyone thinks sitting in a raid and just casting maloes/slow is fun, if anyone thinks its gratifing to see a mob go down before your first attempt to cast a nuke or dot is finally cast, to not be able to heal the hitpoints of one hit from a mob on a tank . . . Its just not FUN anymore. If I would of known 5 years ago that when I hit the high end game my class would become almost useless, and nerfed to the point of class extintion, well, I feel sort of cheated by it all.<br />
<br />
In my guild of over 600 players which at least 1/3 are mains...I am the ONLY shaman of my lvl left playing..all the others have left, the lower lvl shamans stopped lvling and playing other classes...and SOE sem to act clueless to all this. Changing our trivs in alchemy was hard to swallow but this last nerf on the panther spell..and if you check your other nukes..you may find some interesting downgraded changes..is the last straw for me for this class and it looks like for the game as a whole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">about above person's post please stay on topic there are numerous I am a shaman and now I suck posts...<br />
<br />
If your looking for a nice lazy class and enjoy seeing impressive damage numbers..  go with Wizard or Rogue...  both alot of fun to play..  well rogue is all hotkeys as long as you have common sense..  Wiz is a wee bit more utility I am enjoying CC with my Wiz currently 45 with wiz and 57 with rogue...  plenty of enjoyment and one minded in raid situation DAMAGE...</div></div><hr />
