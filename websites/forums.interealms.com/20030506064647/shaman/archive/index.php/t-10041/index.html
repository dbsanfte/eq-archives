<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for advice on gear upgrades.  This is my alt so I don't want to go too expensive but can probably afford a few things.  I do have a fungi but it's usually on my main to help with down time and I really can't afford to get one for this toon right now.  Any suggestions would be most appreciated :cool: <br />

Magelo is in my sig...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your gear is pretty nice. I wear a lot of the same pieces at 61. I see you're shooting for a Cloak of the Wise, it's a nice upgrade and &quot;free.&quot; In case camping the pages gets to be a pain, a Justice Cape is comparable. A Hiero Cloak better but a lot more expensive. The Chitinous Belt is one of the only other pieces you have with no mana or hp. Barbed Rubicite Belt is nice, so is Artificer's, and Girdle of Mithaniel but that is expensive, then again, the other two aren't exactly cheap either, heh. Personally, I'd rather use a Goranga idol than a Gantru charm. If you have a group that can help you get the 9th ring then you can do the Talisman of Benevolence quest just as easily, it will depend on your CoV faction though. Skull Marked Shield and Bone Braced Buckler are fairly cheap and easy to get. Not really upgrades to the SBS but alternatives to consider.</div></div><hr />
