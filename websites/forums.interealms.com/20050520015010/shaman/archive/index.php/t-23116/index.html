<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been thinking about 2 boxing, but I would need to do this on a single computer and just switch between the two instances of EQ.  For those of you that do this, I have a few questions…<br />
<br />
What are your system specs?  CPU speed?  RAM?  Video Card?<br />
<br />
Do you need to turn off the new models and turn down the graphic settings at all?  Is lag a problem?<br />
<br />
Are there zones that are unfriendly to 2-boxing on one machine?  Maybe PoK for example?<br />
<br />
Do you use any 3rd-party software to run two instances of EQ at the same time and switch between them?  EQ Windows?<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a machine that is 2.4 GHZ with 1 Gig of RAM and I am just about to get a new video card, either one of the NVIDIA 6800 series or the ATI Radeon x800 series.  Both of those cards have 256MB RAM.  Is this enough to &quot;2-box&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.6ghz.. 384 ram.. radeon 9200se video card<br />
<br />
i can 3box on this computer if i use eqplaynice.. you should be able to have a complete group with a beast of a computer like that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I run two accounts on this machine.<br />
I have an AthlonXP 2800+ (Runs at 2.04 ghz), 1 gig of PC-2700 ram, and a GeForce FX5900 128mb vid card.<br />
<br />
I run my desktop at 1280x960, and EQw runs 2 instances of EQ at 1152x864(roughly), so that I can see a smidgen of the other screen as well.<br />
<br />
Another really helpful thing I found, is create 2 install directories.  I have Sony/Everquest1/EQ files  and Sony/Everquest2/EQ files.  plus another EQw directory for each one.<br />
<br />
In each main directory with the INI files, toss in a nosound.txt file to kill your sound on both accounts.  As well, my main account (#1) runs with every option turned on, allmodels, mipmapping, etc, but has spell effects off.  Account #2 has ALL models off, and most of the lighting/mip mapping stuff off (texture cache for both is on).  Account 2 usually has pc names off as well as spell effects off.<br />
<br />
While it does take a little bit to load the second account, once things are allloaded up, I can both through small raids and xp groups with no trouble whatsoever. In a full 50+ man raid, or even a 40+ man raid, I notice performance issues and it becomes hard to play.  Also, my account 1 clip  pane is 100%, account2 is usually around 50% or less.<br />
<br />
just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use EQw and 2box on one pc<br />
2.5ghz, 1gb 128mb geforce<br />
all models, all effects, no clip<br />
<br />
zoning takes a while, and PoK sucks, but that is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can run more than one instance of eq using eqw and eqplaynice on machines with pretty low specs.  I can do 2 just fine on a 1.13 Thunderbird, GeForce3 and I think 768RAM.  I even do it on my laptop, a p4-1.6 with 768ram.<br />
<br />
The computer you spec'd should have no problems running 4 or 5 instances, just don't have all the options set to max.  Bazaar is the only zone that is painful :(  I have to set the clipping plane to minimum.<br />
<br />

<br />
My normal setup is an Athlon 1800, 1gig ram, GeForce4 4800.  I only have one install directory (i didn't notice any difference using two other than it being a pain to keep the character files synched for multiple accounts) but you will want to make the nosound changes.  I run as many old models as I can (I think I have about 5 new models turned on), low details, 1600x1200 for usually 2 sometimes 3 EQW instances.<br />
<br />
Make sure that if you use eqplaynice you set the background mode to framerate limited rather than cpu limited, otherwise autofollow won't work too welln and the background window will fall behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could probably load at least 4 clients with that setup.<br />
<br />
Use eqwindows and install that patch they provide that allows you to alt-tab in EQ.  EQW is infinitely better than the default EQ client in every way.</div></div><hr />
