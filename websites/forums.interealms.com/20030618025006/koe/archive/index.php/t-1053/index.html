<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of the time, I don't have much contact with our lower level members.  I see ya on the Green Spam (/gusay). I sometimes pass down the odd item to you/for you, but on the whole, I have been a &quot;fairly insular&quot; member of the &quot;higher levels&quot; *.  The vast majority of my EQ time is spent on Wulfran and I find this does create a bit of a gap between me and others that aren't ready to die with him...er... group with him.  I honestly suck at chat, a lot of the time, as my typing isn't the greatest and tank battle spam makes keeping up with a conversation fairly difficult. The three trade skills I have are fletching (make arrows and spend plat), fishing (cast and reel...easy... even inkies can learn this one), and Alcohol Tolerance (drink and be merry, for tomorrow we will die... esp if Ransure pulls or Wulfie leads :p ).<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about this a bit since Helek posted a little while ago. Is there anything I can do to help our lower levels?  Is there a quest you need help with? Is there advice you need? Is there a raid you need help planning? I know we have good peoples coming up, and I would liike to help them and get to know them a bit better.  <br />
<br />
*&quot;higher levels&quot; is a fairly relative term.  At level 56 I don't consider myself &quot;high level&quot; or anything.  To me, 58-60 is high level...I'm just an almost :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would love to get to know ye  a lil better ... and I may call upon some of that knowledge pool from the higher level KoEers including yerself soon.  <br />
<br />
I will let ye know when .. and it may include a guided tour of parts of some dungeons.. or areas..  <br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
again.. thanks..</div></div><hr />
