<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Takacha drops this in Fungus Grove but who and where is this NPC?  Is he in the small town, among the dregs or the Shik`nar?  Anyone know his spawn time?  <br />
<br />
Guessing for the nice stats on the shield it might be hard to zone in and see him up.  Prolly killed on spawn.  <br />
<br />
Any info would be nice.  <br />
<br />
Thx in advance!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just got off the phone with a friend that called.  Part of a ring of fire thing in FG.  We are going to try it tonight and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Looks like it might be an easier ring of fire than some of the others that my guild has done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not a ring of fire type encounter at all.  You get 3 mobs at a time.  Unfortunately, he calls them pretty fast, so you keep getting 3 mobs every couple of minutes.  Eventually, the caller gets tired, and sits down for a rest.<br />
<br />
There are 3 types of mobs he can call.  The larger fungus beasts, the smaller ones that hit really fast, and the named.  All are random.  You can even get 3 named.<br />
<br />
The script goes on until you hand him the note to stop it.  (He gives you the note when you start the script).<br />
<br />
The named are uncommon (possibly rare?), and I think there are 3 named.  Takacha's rare drop is the shield.  You can run the numbers and see that the shield is NOT a common loot.<br />
<br />
(uncommon percentage/3 named) x rare percentage = bloody small number!<br />
<br />
This is a fun camp for exp with a group of six high levels, but it can be easy to get behind.  2 group should be able to handle this with ease.<br />

Think the cheapest one is the slowest.</div></div><hr />
