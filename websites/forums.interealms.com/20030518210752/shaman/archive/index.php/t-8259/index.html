<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was in a exp grp in pod, kiling rats and tetsian flys, it was fun but slow exp.<br />
<br />
I noticed the rats hit for `120 ish.  Havinf soloed one mob in POI and found it pretty hard(hit for 250)   Was wondering if any one has tried these rats for soiling?<br />
<br />
i am an ogre shaman 55  epic no jbb or horse ac is 1000<br />
<br />
got flu atmo, so not feeling bright enough to try solo atmo.<br />
<br />
i know they doable, i mean is the exp worth it??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ilias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my exp the rats hit for 200+ mostly, but I might have fought some heavier ones than the ones you mean. <br />
However, the tsetsian flies you mentioned, definitely hit for only 158 max or near, have few hp, are very easily soloed at lvl 60, and give very reasonable exp at 60. In my opinion you could manage them no probs at 55, and I'm thinking the exp at 55 must be superb. My advice is to try them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone got a good solo spot for this? I was thinking about doing this along the zone wall where the water meets the land when you head right from the zone in along the zone wall. I saw several islands with flys on them. I thought mebbe just lev'ing myself to run out and pull back to dogiedog would be good.<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ilias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You don't really need levi. You can invis to be sure, but just walk down the platform to the left, and follow the waterline to the righta bit. There is a spot just before the fly islands where nothing spawns or wanders, except a big non-kos ogre. Just pull flies to this spot, no adds. At 60 flies are a single pull, dunno at lower levels.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>seedsman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">all sort of resistance(especially MR for slow, PR for our DoTs)and approximate HP info on those flies would be very much appreciated. I'm afraid that they might have quite high DR, PR, cause they live in plande of DISEASE! :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The flies are cake. Resists are rare and HP is no higher than about 7-8k I'd think. Max hit I took was 127, average hits were roughly 50-75. I usually set up at the rock facing the tsetsian isthmus if there aren't many wizards/druids around quadding them. They're the real hazard, as it is historically considered &quot;okay&quot; by some to suddenly drop their quad on an engaged shaman once they realize they can't handle it. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't mess with the rats, they're mean bastages with way too many HP and fairly decent resists, plus they hit harder than I like to deal with for grinding (200+). <br />
<br />
I'm 56 atm with fairly average gear, save for the holy triumverate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ilias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Flies occasionally resist slow, but not a lot (say 1 in 10 maybe).<br />
Flies have never ever resisted Bane of Nife (poison dot).<br />
Flies sometimes (mostly partially) resist JBB (cold).<br />
They might have a tendency to resist disease (epic too sometimes), but if I do disease dots I use insidious decay anyways, and after that they have never resisted disease dots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Are these flies the flies on the island close to zone in? Is it possible to single pull them at 56?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lorace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tried these guys last night, solo at level 56 with Jbb+horse+fungi.  Pretty easy, and all of the 5 or so that i pulled came single.   They did hit harder that mentioned above, tho not often, with some hits in the 170's.  (my ac is 915 or so)<br />
<br />
One dropped an egg sac of some sort, which sold to a vendor for 60p, but I didn't see any other loot.  <br />
<br />
The only plance i found to pull to was the rock sticking out of the zone wall just before the islands, or on the zone wlal next to it, and it was rather hard to keep things positioned right  while on a horse there.  Going to have to go deeper and see if there is a better spot sometime soon.<br />
<br />
Probably is better xp elswhere, killing lower level stuff or in someplace like Katta, but these are fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xani Crimsonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tried these guys tonight.  Killed 3 and didn't even notice a pixel of xp change.  Not worth it in my opinion.  I had 100% to reg xp., but didn't try it with AA on.<br />

I'm 56 with epic and no JBB.<br />
<br />
Pulled with Slow, stuck dogdog on it. Epiced, Baned, medded, reapplied Bane, medded, reapplied Epic.<br />

No catchy sig or pic.  Sorry :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The flies are kinda annoying to pull and you will most likely have better luck pulling goos and rats from zone line going left as you zone in.  Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I usually don't solo for safety reasons (yes I'm a chicken).  But I decided to try it in PoD after reading this thread, and knowing  guild cleric was only a zone away ;) <br />
<br />
I highly recommend the flies, they are quite easy and I had almost no downtime.  Go straight out from zone in to the first patch of land (yes you have to swim or lev).  I set up camp near the big rock.  There are about 5 static spawns of flies if you walk forward from there and to the right.  I pulled them single every time.  <br />
<br />
Things to watch for:<br />
1.  RATS - these suckers hit hard, have a lot of hit points, and really aren't worth it.  I was able to take one but it took most of my mana, and killed my pet.  They wander, but aren't hard to avoid and do not seem to get near home base.  Stick with the flies unless you are feeling adventurous.<br />
2.  Traps - there is a risk of springing larvae traps if you wander around too far from &quot;home&quot;.  I tried once to go farther and pull an extra fly...sprung two larvae and had to gate out.<br />
<br />
The flies don't seem to be resistant.  Slow, pox, epic, and jbb is what I used mostly and only had a couple resists.  There is enough room in this area to let the flies run when low health.  They are pretty slow and never got too far before dying.<br />
<br />
This is a popular spot for quad kiters...and if they are taking those static flies there is not much else nearby that camp.  <br />
<br />
Be careful, and good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, I tried these flies tonight.  Lev and went straight out from zone-in to the first island and parked pet.  No way could I single pull them.  Tried from different angles.  Tried pulling with malosi and cancel magic.  Every time I pulled at least 3.  Can't figure out what I was doing wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No loot, no parchments, just experience.<br />
<br />
Try pulling from max distance, you might have better success at pulling a single.  I usually lev and hang out up on the wall, high on the wall.  Kinda funny they try to get to you but it takes them a while, usually they will just warp up the wall eventually and you can then root and move away.<br />
<br />
Very very easy solo spot, and I could even take two at once with a little bit of effort.  3 was too many IMO.<br />
<br />
Also, just FYI, in PoN from ZI go straight and around the hill there. Great spot to solo trees in this little valley.  I think only 3 or 4 trees spawn here.  Get Aego to solo here if you are level 58 or lower (just my own experience), or you might run out of HP to canni.   Root and rot them for excellent experience and Page drops for the Cloak of the Wise.</div></div><hr />
