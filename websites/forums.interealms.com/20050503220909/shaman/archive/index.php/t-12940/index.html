<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok....<br />
<br />
Im not that hung up on it but..... when I was growing up....<br />
<br />
If my name was ... Surr Rezalot.... I would have been hunted by the name nazi's....<br />
<br />
but today... I see all these names that Roxxers... from the L33t d00ds &lt;-- haha... not sure thats how to say it. (Note the sarcasm)....<br />
<br />
some of the lame names I have seen lately are....<br />
<br />
Marsh Mellowman<br />
Booy Toyz<br />
Lyckme Knot<br />
Havvin Abadday<br />
Fourrr Rezin<br />
Show Cow<br />
Eadgar Beaver<br />
Seamore Buuuttz<br />
Jeeeorge Busch<br />
<br />
I do chuckle sometimes but for the most part If I see one more High Elf named <br />
<br />
Kristiniaa Agulaaara<br />
or<br />
Brrrrittknee Speeeeaarrrs<br />
<br />
I going to go postal.....<br />
<br />
<br />
All in good fun though.... I just remember when My Rogue named Subotia was name Nazied because it was a char... from the movie Conan.... guess they didn't pay attention to the movie to much because my current toons name is PHORGRIM... is from the same movie.<br />
<br />
So as I see it.... I guess I benefitted from the lack or sensorship as well... oh well...<br />
<br />
Been awhile since I saw a funny names you have seen post.... What are your best?</div></div><hr />

It'd be one thing if it was just the game, but its frightening that these people might be preparing my food when I go out to eat, or piloing a 1-ton automobile on the same roads as me.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah I know what you mean.  Seems VI is laxing many of its once steadfast policies to encourage more people to play (thanks to actual competition now).<br />
But at what cost? I ask.  Apparently having Frogloks named Meangreen Lickmachine and of course the obligatory cutesy High Elf and Vah Shir moniker, like Charmy Snugglz and Iwant Meowmix.<br />
<br />
In some of these persons' defense, however, last time I tried to come up with an actual original fantasy name for an alt, I sat through one rejection after another for about 10 minutes straight.  Finally came up with something not as cool and nowhere near my original choice (and I refuse to choose the bland, uninspired randomly-generated names VI offers).</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 weeks later i was informed by an english guide that it violates their policy and that it had to be changed, i was deeply annoyed as i love this name passionately, and what really pissed me off was that i was grouped with 2 frogs who had versions of the name kermit at the time, who probably wouldn't even get a tell from a guide...<br />
<br />
my name was added to the list to be removed, 2 months later it hasn't been removed... i guess there's a good side to SOE's pathetic GM-manpower  :p <br />

 I heard that! the stupid name filter rejects all kinds of innocuous fantasy names while letting &quot;Iamthewin Uaretehlose&quot; right through. I've had multiple names straight from their own &quot;random fantasy name&quot; generator rejected!! how annoying is that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yatta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A LOT of bad names actually pass through the filter. In my opinion the reason why so many &quot;bad&quot; names are getting through now is because of the lack of CSR on most servers at any given time. When you submit a name to the server, a little box pops up on a Guide or GM's screen listing your name and a &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; button. Yes means it passes, No means it's rejected, obviously. Lately I've noticed, at least on 7th, there are rarely any Guides about... if nobody is on at the time and a name passes the filter it's automatically approved.</div></div><hr />

I've got a ton of suggestions for a surname.  Stuff like Phinger Inyourear, Upurnose, Phood, etc..etc..<br />

Hell my last name (McFattyfatfat) was once changed because it had too many syllables. However Alluvierialinsathnaysit, or whatever unpronouncable wuss high elf name the rng spits forth from its infested loins is perfectly acceptable (dammit people.... have a name thats easy to type already!).

I know this because I was talking to a senior guide one night that was complimenting me on my name.  And telling me that if someone petitioned it, that I would have to change it.  Apparently, Hodur is a well known character in some book.  I actually named him after the blind brother of Odin (Norse mythology), who should be obscure enough to not violate the naming convention, but I guess the source of the name won't matter if it is petitioned.</div></div><hr />

They could generate a list of every new name and have a human review it from time to time and then flag all the characters with inapropriate names and change them.<br />
<br />
They should change the name to somthing like &quot;Name Moron #1432&quot; which they would be stuck with untill a GM had a chance to help them select a new name.<br />

Any new character or new surname would automaticly be reviewed and this would solve the problem.<br />

The worst though, is that when I originally hit 20 with Rorgg I couldn't think of a good last name, so I took one I swore would be forced to be changed soon.  Of course, when I finally did come up with something else, a year plus later, I had to not only petition myself as an obscene name, but explain to the GM just why 'Rorgg Azim' was obscene.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd be content with folks getting rid of the crass ones (Ironarse is great, Ironkok is not) and the unimaginative blatant rip offs (how many Mazrim Taim/Wheel of Time versions do we need).   I wonder how many of the &quot;hero&quot; name knockoffs are 11 yr old kids or so -- I know I had to discrourage my kids from choosing obvious rips.<br />

Actually that's not true, when I had my guide (for about a month on bertox) I used to sit in GFay when I was bored and report all the really stupid names on all the nubi chars. All you had to do was make a note of it in the CSR chat channel (which is logged and parsed) and later on post it on the GM msg boards (wherein a GM will make a note of it and change it). However on my play server I never petition names.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Having spent many long nights over the past twenty-five years playing AD&amp;D and various other tabletop RPGs, I tend to take character naming fairly seriously.  I want it to be a name I can live with.  Most of my character names are just made up, but when Luclin came out I looked up Egyptian names and chose Pait for my kitty shaman.  Though I like to choose &#8220;serious&#8221; names for my characters, I feel there is a lot more leeway for halfling names.  I had a halfling cleric, who ended up being my vendor, named Ticklefoot.  And because I doubt I&#8217;ll ever really play him as a character, I have a green frogie paladin named Gerken.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the names I see in game bother me, but mostly I&#8217;ve learned to ignore them.  I&#8217;ve only petitioned once to have a character name removed.  I happened upon a male barbarian in Everfrost with a name that described what he wanted to do to certain part of a female&#8217;s anatomy in a very graphic fashion.  That name wasn&#8217;t just stupid, it was offensive.  And I&#8217;m happy to say I received a message about a half hour later that it had be taken care of.  <br />
<br />
And I agree that its getting harder and harder to come up with decent character names.  I created an enchanter last night and had the hardest time finding a name for him.  I had literally dozens of names rejected.  I finally just made one up and Azzroth was finally born.  But as frustrating as it is, I&#8217;m thankful for allowing only one character per server with the same name.  UO doesn&#8217;t have that rule, or at least it didn&#8217;t when I played it a couple of years ago.  You wouldn&#8217;t believe how many Merlins there were on each server.  And not a day went by that I didn&#8217;t have at least two Drizzts cross my path.  Oh the horror.  :p</div></div><hr />

They could generate a list of every new name and have a human review it from time to time and then flag all the characters with inapropriate names and change them.<br />
<br />
They should change the name to somthing like &quot;Name Moron #1432&quot; which they would be stuck with untill a GM had a chance to help them select a new name.<br />
<br />
Any new character or new surname would automaticly be reviewed and this would solve the problem.<br />

It would not take long before people would just do it right in the first place.<br />

Naming Policy (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_naming_policy.jsp)<br />
<br />
The naming policy was changed a while back. Now names that form phrases are allowed where they weren't before. That's the only change.<br />
<br />
Names with titles, that are borrowed from popular fantasy or RL (which in itself is open to interpretation as to how recognisable the name is) are still not officially allowed. There have always been people with bad names making it to level 60 (65 now) before getting noticed.<br />
<br />
A lot of names go around that are against the naming policy, I'm sure many of them would be changed if they were petitioned.<br />
<br />
A few years ago, they did a sweep where they looked at and changed names offline. I know a couple of people who's name was changed as a result. One was offensive in spanish, but innocuous in English, and the other's surname was removed where it formed an offensive phrase in combination with the first name.</div></div><hr />

Yup!
