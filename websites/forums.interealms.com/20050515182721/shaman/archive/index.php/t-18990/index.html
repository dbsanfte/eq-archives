<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ologhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not looking to make this post a &quot;best&quot; race post (looks at the dead horse lying beaten and bloody), but I'm looking to my Troll brethren and hoping I get a  &quot;hell yeah&quot; we level so slowly we lose exp with each kill.  <br />
<br />
I cannot believe how slowly Trolls level.  IMHO I think they have the best stats and look the best too.  When I was starting a Shaman I would send tells to level 65 Shamans and ask them if they weren't busy if they could answer a question for me.  Most of the time, if not all, people had time for me - I asked them if they had a chance to do it over again what race would they choose, most people said Troll.     <br />
<br />
I realize regen plays less importance in later levels.  I've obviously found that negative faction has played a lesser role since ROK.  But today, with many exp packs later, I can get anywhere without a problem these days. <br />
<br />
But oh my - the racial exp penalty is a killer, I feel for you guys that had to do this back during the days of &quot;hell levels&quot;.  I've managed to stick to zones with bonus exp modifiers but even they're slow. <br />
<br />
I don't regret my decision one bit, I guess this is the price you pay for efficiency =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm looking to my Troll brethren and hoping I get a &quot;hell yeah&quot; we level so slowly we lose exp with each kill.<br />
<br />
I'm not one of your troll brethren (I play a barb), but I would be if I was rerolling today.  Trolls and ogres are the best 2 races for shammies, IMO, with iksar 3rd.<br />
<br />
Remember that while it will take you 20% more exp per level as a troll, the level formula is exponential, and thus you won't ever be more than a level or 2 behind a frog shammie (the fastest-leveling shaman race).  Since any given level can now be had in, at most, about 10 hours of play time, I think its fair to say that the exp penalty is not that significant in the overall scheme of things.<br />
<br />
In fact, I did a spreadsheet a while back that compared various races/classes on this issue, and found that a halfling warrior (the fastest race/class combo) would hit level 60 (the cap at the time) just before a non-warrior troll/iskar would hit level 57.  Because of the race/class penalties, the halfling had something like only about 65% of the exp that the troll had.  However, because of the exponential nature of the calculations, this didn't scale directly into levels.<br />
<br />
This calculation would be off today, because the exp gained per kill has been adjusted for mob level (it was just a flat deduction for high greens then), but the overall idea remains the same.<br />
<br />
Put more simply: no, its not that big of a deal.  Leveling for any class really starts to suck past about 55, regardless of race.  Don't reroll because trolls are one of (if not the) best races for a shammie, and you're only about 1 day of solid play behind where you could have been as a frog anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ologhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You my friend are a genius - just what I needed to see.  <br />
<br />
I never intend to reroll, this is my first Troll char and the exp penalty has always scared me off before.  But after having played one I realize what I've been missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Iksar &gt; all~  The penalty can get annoying, especially if you're always grouping with the same people (typically of the fleshy variety) who come out of a night a bit ahead of you.<br />
<br />
Racial penalties do not apply to AA exp however, so you're safe in that boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have an iksar..so the same 20% penalty.  It honestly didn't matter that much, but, whenever I was dragging along in a level, I never hesitated to blame my exp penalty :)  Some levels seemed worse than others.<br />
<br />
Also, as was mentioned, AA exp isnt affect by the penalty.  So you gain some extra hp regen per tick over the other races at no cost to you (the cost is sunk).<br />
<br />
If I could pick another race for shaman would I?  Yes, I would pick a high elf shaman, but since this is not a real option...I am stuck with the iksar and that is what I will play :)  I actually picked iksar because of the casting animation for alteration spells and the way they sit with old models... Looking back, I feel I have made the right decision.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get back under yer bloody bridges damn trolls. :p<br />
<br />
Barbarians are by far the best race. With our cool beards and wode what more could you ask for. Oh yes I nearly forgot a crazy eye :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive always liked myself as a halfling shaman. Their armour is just classy.</div></div><hr />

Troll Powaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !<br />

I agree :D..although, I always ask an enchanter to throw Vah Shir illusion on me at raids anymore.<br />
And with the new GoD AA (forgot the name) that lets you channel through stuns, you will almost have the same non frontal stun as an ogre.  In some cases it may actually be superior (for ogre as well), since you can still get stunned from the sides and from behind.<br />
<br />
And don't forget your &quot;ability&quot; to snare as well.  It won't be useful at all at raids, but used to be mega helpful in Seb (rip), and in some xp groups, and even LDON</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL I was snarer on an LDON hard adventure yesterday - Never discount the snare, I pull it out at the wierdest times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If I were to start over (god please no) I would be a ogre, but back in the day when I started, it was really difficult for dark races......these days you could play a race that even the iksar look at and say &quot;yo, chill on the evil stuff man&quot; and it would really matter....PoK and to a lesser extent Luclin ruined Faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Possibly a rumor because I can not remember where i got this ... but I have heard that the racial penalties only apply to lebvel 50.  At 51+ all races level at the same speed.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm or deny this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">false Fib.  The xp penalty is applied to all levels.  Only aaxp is not penalized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It isn't even really a &quot;penalty&quot; per mob either.  You get the same exact amount per kill as anyone else, but your xp bar reflects it differently.<br />
It just takes you an average of 20% more experience total to go from 1-65 than it does your &quot;average&quot; race.  And once you hit 65 all is fair game AA wise.  It's pretty outdated now but www.hackersquest.com had a chart with race/class combinations and the experience for all of them to go from 1-60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dunno what level you are, Olag, so adjust this to fit your needs. Yeah, we trolls level slower but I am sure this is one of those accidental acts of VI (back in the day). How were they to know at the time playing a troll shaman was so great the extra playing time to level would be a benefit to the player? Then again, perhaps they did know.<br />
<br />
With the variety of places to level (group or solo) that 20% penalty is, like travel and faction, negated. The only 'real' hell level I had was 57. I sat there about a month of RL time. But this was my fault. I stopped focusing on leveling and soloed Dulak, Gunthak and other hotspots for cash/drops and spent way too much time in the bazaar looking for spells. I was able to find and fund all my spells up through 60. Took lots of tedious cash collecting and bazaar wheeling and dealing, but I would do the same again. Having those spells as I hit the new levels helped a lot.<br />
<br />
Once done, finding groups in PoP/LDoN groups is pretty easy for troll shaman. Perhaps other racial shaman also, though I have no clue why anyone would want to group with them.<br />
<br />
To your point: our racial penalty is not so much a penalty but a bonus that allows us to play more to get to the same point a non-troll shaman must get to quickly to prevent them from deleting their character and re-rolling a halfling druid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>zimbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Some above posted that an ogre could be stuned from the side or behind.  In my experience, that isn't true.  I have been hit from all over and with mobs beating my back, sides, front whatever....as long as I'm not moving...I don't get stunned.  Ogres are immune to stun if they're standing still.  I've been in too many situations with mobs all around me for it to have never happened if its possible, so I'm repeating it here Ogres are immune to stun.   &lt;---that is a period.<br />

I've posted this before, when I first observed it and I still stand by it.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt say nothing: <br />

the upgrade is a Panic Animal necklace....the hinted at upgrade (regent symbol) would have been Fear, but I am not 100% sure they implimented it before that line of toys petered out.<br />
Sure Spook the Dead and Panic Animal arent as useful as Clinging Darkness, but its better than Summon Crappy Hammer :P</div></div><hr />

I never did.<br />
<br />
I love being troll. If I had to start over I'd be a troll again.</div></div><hr />

And I'm married, have 3 children, job, home....pets...bills.  I like to advance just like the next person.  I don't have all weekend to play - it kind of stinks when I have a friend that is 2 levels below me and after a few nights is ahead of me and soon out of grouping range. <br />
<br />
So, I guess I give a crap =)  <br />

Do the positives outweight the negatives, defintely.</div></div><hr />
