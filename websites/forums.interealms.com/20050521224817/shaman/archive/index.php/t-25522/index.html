<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This looks intriguing.  A 3 sec cast, 1 min rune/FA spell with a 4 min recast.

these 2 spells make baby jesus cry...i am crying with the little guy...<br />
<br />
edit-the 5 tick duration the on the pet buff is retarded as it stands now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">These spells are extremely preliminary...<br />
<br />
The necro DD Shadow Orb reads more like a Wizard/Mage DD spell: &quot;Summons a giant comet of ice from the sky, causing between #1 and @1 damage to your target.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Druid Spell, Guard of Righteousness, is a 25% damage mitigation, 7500 max damage (actually sounds nice) but lasts 3 WHOLE TICKS, with a 15 minute recast...  Umm, ain't likely to be many people using that.  <br />
<br />
Druids also get a new snare that doesn't reduce movement any more than an older snare of theirs, but lasts 2 minutes instead of almost 15. Woot!<br />
<br />
Clerics get an Undead DoT.  Next they'll demand Lich! ;)<br />
<br />
Mages get a new Mod Rod at 56...  'nuff said!<br />
<br />
Enchanters get a 1200 HP Rune... I'm sure they'll use it about as much as their 1105 HP Rune (which is to say almost never).  A rune that will absorb 1 hit from a quadding mob and generate almost as much aggro as a Shadow Knight pumping full hate spells, yeah they'll love that!<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights get a 25% melee mitigation self-buff (10k max) for 3 secs.  Yeah, like druids won't be whining about this being better than their useless buff!<br />
<br />
Rangers get a Snare/DoT that doesn't snare as much as their older spells and does minimal damage. So they are now Necros with Bows?<br />
<br />
Wizards get an Ice Nuke that's almost bad enough to be a Shaman spell!<br />
<br />
I'm guessing these are just being thrown out to mislead people.  That or some of the developers at Sony just got a new shipment in from Colombia and started the weekend early! :)</div></div><hr />

Well, check the fizzle modifier. I'd say it's working as intended.<br />
<br />

That's what people say every expansion. Then we get stuck with Winners like Disease Dots, Talisman of Alacrity, Vindicitive Spirit, and the Daiku spells.</div></div><hr />

What is wrong with Vindictive Spirit?<br />
<br />
IMO Vindictive Spirit is one of the best spells, if not THE best spell that is in OoW.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with Talisman of Alacrity either.<br />
<br />
The other two are mediocre spells, I'll agree with that.</div></div><hr />

I haven't been using it too much, but I find it every day moving closer and closer into my spell lineup (bye bye magic dot.. i'll miss you /sniff).  It's great for events when you have 15 adds that spawn and you need a quick slow with almost no agro attacked.  Pretty awesome and it prob helped save us a few times on some events in say.. tacvi.</div></div><hr />

Maybe this is useful in anguish or something, but in time/uqua I really can't see any use for it.... if the duration was something more reasonable (1 minute) I could see it being worthwhile, but three ticks? Come on... And the recast is just annoying. I might fire it off when the adds pop on a mob like Altar Construct, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's good for my guild in places like tacvi where I can fire it off to help kill the dude in front of every mob.  For whatever reason 75% of the time he's pulled and half the people are afk and we lose a few warriors at least (and prob half of it I die from slow resists cause no one is there to tank now).  It's good for that to help mitigate some of the inc dmg to you, and also to give the clerics and tanks a quick slow to get their rotation up and ready.<br />
<br />
I used it when the north snake in Tacvi last night popped her final two sets of adds.  It helped a lot, and was the first time that that part wasn't a mess.  Got them all slowed quickly, and helped a few extra healers survive which led to us beating it for the first time.</div></div><hr />

The crit part isnt of much use for the MT, since melee crits don't add agro.</div></div><hr />

Well, DI is actually USEFUL though.  And when was the last time you had 4 shaman on a raid?  We had three last night for Quarm and the shaman channel consisted of 2 shaman complaining they had nothing to do.  And would you really want to invite 4 shaman on a raid to do nothing but keep this buff up?  Thats just silly to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's about as silly as inviting 8 clerics to keep CH up on the MT, or wizards to keep SS up. It's what you do to give you the edge on encounters. And in any case, its a matter of 3 seconds of your life every 4 minutes, and paying attention to the MT's call, hardly a case of extreme tedium, and in return you get a ~10% edge for even the best MTs, somewhat more for your average MT. That is not trivial, and you get it for the cost of a few emeralds. One of the favorite mantra's for the complainers is that there isnt a reason to have more than 2 shaman on a raid. Well, now there is one.</div></div><hr />

Well, speaking as a tank, if Yella had an extra 1500hp, the vast majority of those times when DI actually fired wouldn't have triggered the spell. DI is a tool for coping with damage spikes or slightly late heals, and in most cases an extra 1500hp would have removed that risk. DI would still be very useful even with panthers of course, but the dynamics of existing encounters would be changed by reducing the risk involved, or the healing resources required to cover them.<br />
<br />
The same argument applies for single groups doing high risk nameds btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your shaman can't find anything useful to do on a raid then I feel sorry for them. The days are gone where it was better to have an empty spot on a raid in case someone logged in than bring a shaman. <br />
<br />
Seriously, why do people whine that shaman are useless. It's so boring to hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I don't really want yet ANOTHER buff to deal with.  The way it goes atm is I log in and discover I'm the only Shaman on time.  Raid leader announced target and and at 3 minutes till she wants to get started calls for buffs.  I buff the raid group by group with Sense and Fortitude, MGB Wunshi, tag the few people who like to start out with ToT with that one, give the 2 monks with no Faerune items Acumen, toss Charisma on the few people who ask for that, hand out the dmg mod str buff (I don't have Champion yet but I know what's coming), make sure all my buffs are in place, buff all the late people who stroll up, all the while cannibalizing like mad trying to keep myself near 60% mana so when the pulls start I've got enough to deal with debuffs.  And as the raid progresses, people will die (and need new buffs) and late people will show up (needing buffs).  And on top of all of this you want to add a buff that has a 4 minute recycle and a 1 minute duration that costs an Emerald?  Screw that.  I'm more likely to use it in a group.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Karshak is right.  There are many many things Shaman can be doing these days.</div></div><hr />

----------------------------------------------------------------------  On avrege we have 5 shaman per raid and have yet to hear one complain of nothing to do. even if your not debuffing there is tons to do you can add dps with focus effect sisslak+bane is over 1k a tick without crits. heal/cure while we arent the best healers i've yet to see a dot that i couldnt out heal provided the ppl have the hp's to live 5 secs spot heal the mt on larger mobs deff will most likely not last the whole fight and spot heals are key when it drop you could stay busy with just what i've brought up and thats not even counting buffing/debuffing.</div></div><hr />

&quot;oh no whats the point of more than 2 shaman on a raid&quot; now someone says the exact same thing and he gets slaughtered.<br />
This comes from a non raid person but apart from buffing what was the massive increase from OoW that now all of a sudden made Shaman major useful on raids. ?.(This is actually a question not sarcasm as i just cant see it).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">IMO, remove the recast timer or remove the emerald to cast it.<br />
<br />
I can see myself casting this for a Named pull while XPing and a few other rare situations, but what good is it to 'waste' a spell slot in other than raiding situations.  It's hard enough to keep a slot open for FA/Champion let alone this one for only 1 minute.<br />
<br />
...and a serate one for dogdog???  I want some of what they were smoking when they said &quot;Oh hey, what if we made a version of this spell for the pet too...&quot;  :p <br />
<br />
Not *all* bad though, still needs some work to make it viable in the rest of the time between raids.  I am intrigued by the idea here and want to see the final product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Everyone seems to be looking at the 1500 hp added,  I for one would be curious to see how much extra dps &quot;Increase Chance to Critical Hit by 100%&quot;  If that makes every hit a crit (which by the way it reads it would,  Hastening of Salik is 20% for example) then that could be a ton of extra damage from a class like a ranger or rogue if you hit them right as they use a disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Looks like it doesn't stack with quite a few discs' atm.  Things change of course, and I can't recall many spells that did not get some sort of alteration before they were released.<br />
<br />
Where are my stat buff line extensions dammit!? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">We had three last night for Quarm and the shaman channel consisted of 2 shaman complaining they had nothing to do.<br />
How could a Shaman have nothing to do on Quarm? Shaman are pretty key for that fight. Quarm needs to be fully debuffed 3 times, and other members of the raid need to be constantly cured, especially classes like rogues and other melee DPS that wont be hiding around the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">On raids, its a spell that would most likely be reserved for the MA. Warriors usually use fellstrike as their damage disc, not mighty strike, so it wouldn't be an issue. Savage onslaught is used sometimes as a second damage disc, since it is on a separate timer, but usually during a large target fight, a warrior would likely be using their endurance on furious/defensive (or avoidance/stonewall), followed by aura of runes in that order. Throw in bellows for agro, and they dont have end for much else. In any case, panther has a damage component built in, so there isnt much need for SO anyway.<br />
<br />
Regarding the question of what &quot;100%&quot; means, it means that your chance of criting is increased 100%, so, if your chance of criting normally was 10%, it would increase to 20%, ie you would crit one out of every 5 hits as opposed to 1 out of every 10. Likewise, if your chance of criting was 1%, it would become 2%. From that perspective warriors benefit the most from that part of the spell due to their inherent ability to crit/crip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">well, looks interesting enough, but it probably isn't even close to being finished, there is alot of tweaking to do for it.<br />
<br />
looks like a fantastic spell for melee DPS classes...I wouldn't be able to stand casting this on a tank.<br />
<br />
at the moment, this spell is obviously only good for rogue/ranger/monk. but like I said, there is alot of room for teaking...as for component cost...am I level 40 again scouring for fish scales? (though, I guess it could be an excuse to claim all emeralds in a group...maybe convince your group that you're saving up fire emeralds for upgraded version of spell)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Question : <br />
How do you augment a support class's dps without turning them into a dps class. <br />
<br />
Answer : <br />
Give them short duration buffs that turn melees into their dps. <br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like a castable disc. Seems to me like a pretty interesting answer to the question of shaman dps if they manage to balance it right. The reagent on a 1 minute spell pretty much kills it but if it was removed, this would definitely reinforce the shaman as being the support class that uses his powers to turn melees into mob chippers.<br />
<br />
Basically instead of casting a dot or a nuke, cast a short duration melee superboost on one of your teammates and watch the pieces fly. That ensures group desireability while not encouraging soloing. That means that the better equipped that group is the more they'll want a shaman to shoot their dps through the roof. <br />
<br />
If you consider it like you would a dps spell, this line has potential and would be much more in the spirit of the shaman than a better nuke or more powerfull dot. The reagent seems superfluous to me however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to make this an ability for us, make it an AA, and just have it decrease our mana pool when used just like Fading memories does. I will not waste a spell gem with this crap. Champion was a step in the right direction, especially if you load up your group with 5 melee dps on raids, and this is a huge step backwards.<br />
<br />
What reason do you have for not making Talisman of Alacrity a 60% haste spell? other than wanting buffing to be tedious. I have news for you, buffing isn't fun. It's something that goes with the class, and is a necessary evil, but out of all my good experiences, and fun times that I've ever had with this game, Nothing ever comes from casting buffs on people. It's annoying, monotonous nonsense that just wastes time when you could be enjoying actually playing the game.<br />
<br />
Here Rytan, I'll do your job for you:<br />
<br />
Shaman Spell 1) Merge Might/Sense/Fortitude into a single group buff with the exact same duration as focus. Why in god's name focus lasts an hour and 20 minutes, and the others last an hour and three makes zero sense.<br />
<br />
Shaman Spell 2) Group 60% haste, Same duration as Talisman of Alacrity.<br />
<br />
Problem solved! Since I've freed up some time for you, you're free to go deal with clerics whining about losing thier healing stranglehold.</div></div><hr />

I honestly hope you're going to reply to my question. I am not disliking this buff, nor am I criticizing you(but I can see why you wouldn't want to reply to it): Which of the top 10 Shaman issues is this new short lasting buff supposed to adress?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, in the same vein......  Buffing isn't fun.  I realize that you are trying to give stuff for Shaman to do and ways for them to be attractive to a group/raid, but seriously, something needs to give.  With all the new buffs in the game now that everyone wants, plus all the old buffs that everyone wants, even with the AA that gives extra buff slots it's getting mighty crowded on people's buff bars.  Add in the AE's mobs are tossing around now, and there's just no room.  Best option would be to just start giving us buffs that take some old stuff and add new stuff to it, like Grizlor suggested.  Take that new buff and add Champion (single target though.  no sense in making it overpowered) stuff to it, would be one way.  Combine Sense and Fortitude into one buff.  Add AC to Wunshi.  Give us a 60% or more group haste buff with a dmg modifier.  Stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

most of us don't like short duration buffs, and we don't like worthless buffs... as has been suggested for a long time, i see no reason st/dex shouldn't be added to might to make the diaku line obsolete, or to have might/sense combined...or any combination of constricting our huge number of buffs together.  that is kind of off topic anyway for this thread...</div></div><hr />

Hey Ryan, thanks for the post - I appreciate hearing the accurate update from you rather than guessing what's going on.<br />
<br />
Lack of component = good!<br />
Short duration - bad!<br />
<br />
I hate the idea of using a spell slot for a short duration buff - how about an AA? Can you also put the buff icon in the short duration buff box? What about stacking issues - will it stack with champion? <br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing how the spell evolves over the Beta - please keep us posted! :)<br />

Jen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Here Rytan, I'll do your job for you:<br />
<br />
Shaman Spell 1) Merge Might/Sense/Fortitude into a single group buff with the exact same duration as focus.<br />
<br />
While I definitely agree that having to cast/refresh multiple buffs for an entire raid is very painful, I doubt that they will even consider combining these spells.  As I understand it, the whole reason that the developers have them seperated out like this is to force people to have to be somewhat selective about what buffs they use, since there is a limit on exactly how many can be stacked at once.  Admittedly, with the ability to get 5 extra buff slots via AAs this isn't quite as big a deal, but those extra slots quickly get eatten up by all the new AA and Epic HoT effects, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Well as far as gates spells I for 1 was Po'ed when they changed the Disease dot to a flippin heal espicially now that the OOW heal is avaliable, but that is not the topic at hand. <br />
<br />
This spell will never be scribed by me at if it is anything like it currently stands we seem to be getting more and more spells with a long recast time and quite honestly it irritates me to no end.  If we had like 10 for 15 spell slots taht would be 1 thing but between Pained Memory, FA, VS, and the magic dots (even if you only mem 1 of them)  that is 4 of our precious spell slots constantly eaten up this would make 5 and lets be honest malos a slow HoT and direct heal eat the rest. <br />
<br />
I guess what im getting at is that the recast time vs duration of these spells makes it difficult to use them ...<br />
<br />
I hate having to burn a spell slot for FA (i have nearly deleted that spell)  but I use it because it adds DPS and that is fine but at least give it a decent duration.<br />
<br />
The magic dots shouldnt have a recast like this on them non of our other dots do this makes no sense to me but whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I dont have VS yet but it looks really useful but with the recast on it i dont see it being as usefil as it could be it should have a 6 sec recast time like AE mez or at most a 12 like AE stun.<br />
<br />
this spell with it's 4 min recast even if i scribed it would be used about as often as Spirit of Cheeta ... and when was the last time you memed that. now if it was kinda like a DA that migitated like 60-70% of incomming damage kinda like a castable defensive a long refresh would be understandable. I know that might be overpowering but the point is that for something with that kind of recast should be a bit overpowering not underwhelming :/<br />
<br />
 Anyway i was eating lunch and lost my train of thought ... either way the likely hood of me even scribing this spell is next to null unless the recast is dropped to something reasonable or it is actually beefed up to compensate for the loss of a spell slot permanetly (along with he one lost by FA)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Why do these annoying short-time buffs always have so tiny effects anyways? Even when you cast FA you need to parse for a while to be sure there is an effect at all.<br />
<br />
If we are to get a &quot;discipline&quot;-type spell have it cost 4K mana and then up the effect to have the monk or rogue we just cast the spell on do, say, an extra 15K damage over the duration of the spell. At least that way when I burn a spell gem I get to see things happen instead of spending my time casting yet another buff just because 5 hours worth of parsing show it to be a bit more effective then my resisted DoTs.<br />
<br />
I only get 9 spell gems. They better have a noticeable effect, because they are most likely competing with one of my few precious damage spells. After Canni, HoT, heal, malos, slow (possibly insert malosinia, root, turgurs here) there is not all that much room left. I usually have 3 spell gems to play with, and one of them ends up as a cure, haste or essential buff quite often. That leaves me with 2 gems for a nuke and a DoT.<br />
<br />
Thus anything that does not at the very least situationally outdamage my DoT will not get memorized. And unless these spells get a ton of improvement the extra damage will barely be parseable. For comparison, the warrior crit discipline adds 10000% instead of 100%.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: In the current version one shaman per raid will grudingly cast this on the MT for the HPs. Possibly all shamans may hit the various tanks with it, if the raid is tough enough that is. But the crit percentage is so crappy as to be useless.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Rytan:<br />
It is nice to know that the reagent is a mistake but still, the spell looks like just another annoying buff to me. As Giac but it - Which of the top 10 Shaman issues is this new short lasting buff supposed to adress?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Bottom line: In the current version one shaman per raid will grudingly cast this on the MT for the HPs.

<br />
No they wont. It has a recast time of 4 minutes and lasts 1 minute, which means that to keep it up on the MT, you would need 4 shaman. The only people who would be getting this spell during raids would be the MT, and even then only on large targets. It is a situational spell that will give you the edge in marginal fights, if it is used correctly. During raids on large targets, you don't need most of the spells you normally have memmed.....it is a simple matter, taking a few seconds, to switch one of them out during the prep phase before the large target.<br />
<br />
Oh, and suggesting that the shaman &quot;will grudingly cast&quot; this spell on the MT is absurd, it's like suggesting that a cleric &quot;will grudingly cast&quot; conviction on the MT before a large target fight. I find it incredible that you don't understand the importance of hp to an MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I see his point though.  This spell is like a 1500 pt rune that has some effects and can't be &quot;chewed&quot; through in the normal rune sense.  But, to make it worthwhile, you have to have at least 4 and more likely 5 or 6 Shaman to make sure it never falls while the fight is going on.  This buff is gonna be a pain in the ass, pure and simple.  Worse than Avatar ever was.  To be honest though, I don't know if the MT would even want this buff, considering all the other slots that are taken up by the normal buffs and the HoT and DI and resists and the AEs from various mobs.  I just don't think there will be any room. Which brings us back to the whole combining buffs argument.  There's gotta be a happy medium somewhere.  Right now, if you count this new buff, Shaman will use somewhere between 7 and 10 buff slots on the raid in general.  By themselves.  That's just nuts.  And, as has been mentioned before, BUFFING is not fun.  It's what comes after buffing thats fun.  So lets skip the not fun part, or get through it as fast as possible, and move right along to the having fun part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
come on, you know that analogy is garbage...<br />
<br />
in the current form this spell is gonna end up being used as much as putrid decay.  it has a use, but it is super situational (soloing high pr mobs=putrid decay, tough boss mob fights=new spell of no duration.)  i don't see this ever being cast in an xp group /shrug.<br />
as a shaman main the last thing i want is more highly situational spells.  i am not saying this is going to be worthless, but tugala can you at least see where a lot of people are coming from in thier beefs with this current spell?<br />
i don't think that anyone is arguing this isn't a good idea for a spell...just the implementation isn't the greatest atm.<br />
<br />
something to think about-maybe raid encounters will be balanced around this spell? maybe shaman will be balanced around this spell?...please god no...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Ways to make this spell useful:<br />
<br />
1. Turn it into &quot;shaman damage on resistant MOBs&quot;. Make it cost huge amounts of mana, figure out how much damage a shaman can do with nukes on a non-resistant MOB with said mana, then tune the spell to have the melee we cast it on do about that much additional damage.<br />
+ gives shaman a way to do damage on resistant MOBs<br />
- potentially overpowered given that we could cast it and then use our remaining mana to nuke or heal (as opposed to chainnuking). Might need to grey out spell gems for a while to avoid this (and thus force shamans to use rabid bear!).<br />
<br />
2. Turn it into a &quot;save the tank&quot; spell. Make it add 5K HPs and let it cast instantly. Also add some sort of avoidance or mitigation buff. Lower the duration and up the recast time. Call it the &quot;shaman bestow DA&quot;. Oh, right, mana should probably go up too.<br />
+ gives shaman the &quot;oh crap&quot; ability we have been asking for for ages.<br />
+ useful for raids, grouping, duoing, soloing, you name it<br />
+ multiple shamans will not be able to chaincast it, thus it goes from a tedious ability you have to time to a LoH type ability<br />
- watch clerics go berserk over it<br />
- multiple shamans will not be able to chaincast it, thus bosses in the next expansion will have to hit for a little less<br />
<br />
3. Turn it into an offensive buff. Combine shaman focus and champion stats and mana cost, set to focus duration, make it a single target buff and be done.<br />
+ frees up buff slots<br />
- still as tedious if not more so then group buffing a raid and cant be MGBed<br />
<br />
4. Turn it into an offensive buff. Start with champion stats, add crit, strikethrough and such as needed to up the total damage a melee char does by 30%. Have it last an hour, recast time of 20 mins. Make it cost however much mana is needed to balance it.<br />
+ still takes up a spell gem but at least the bother is gone<br />
+ visible effect<br />
- I bet someone will find the ability to basically do the damage of a DPS class via a buff (if you have 3 DPS classes to buff) overpowering.<br />
<br />
5. Turn it into a defensive buff. Start with group focus, remove offensive stats, add avoidance and stamina overbuff, maybe add a little mitigation to flavor. Done.<br />
+ less buffing for shamans<br />
+ a couple more buff slots for casters on raids<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, of all of these only no. 2 adresses any of the current shaman concerns. All however are useful spells that will get memmed outside of tough raids and that do not appear to be designed with the sole purpose of annoying shaman.</div></div><hr />

I would not go that far myself. To me spells that I have to time to use them efficiently are annoying and also spells that have little effect are annoying.<br />
<br />
So my avoidance buff is annoying to me because the effect is so little that I have yet to see anyone parse it, even though it lasts long as is not too expensive. And FA type spells are annoying because I have to constantly recast it and keep a list of who to hit when.<br />
<br />
A DA type spell on the other hand would not be annoying to me, even though it has a long recast time and short duration. No timing DAs on people, no hard-to-notice effect = happy caster.<br />
<br />
Similarly I do not mind the way I cast cannibalize (or canni 5) - I have the timer right in front of me, no need to switch targets or the like, just hit it when I have a free moment. The same goes for VP, Ancestral Aid and Epic 1.5 clickie - I would go utterly insane if I had to recast VP every 5 seconds, even if it cast instantly. As is I can fire &amp; forget it, no tedium involved.<br />
<br />
Now, recast delays on buffs like SoW are just silly. I could never figure out the reason for that one. Apparently it is there simply to annoy the caster. Even if SoW is for some odd reason too good and needs a downside annoying the caster is hardly a downside for the user of the buff, especially given that it is usually cast during downtime anyways. Recast timers belong on combat abilities and nowhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Hrm, wonder how this'll work with Trueshot.  Or Duelist.<br />
Just a wild guess on my part but it will probably work much worse then with non-disced melees. For example:<br />
<br />
 - We have a base crit rate of 100% (not 100% of your hits, this is just our baseline - how much this actually makes you crit is not important here).<br />
<br />
 - Now add some gear and AAs and you are at, say, 200% crits.<br />
<br />
 - Add the newly improved spell and you are at 950% crits.<br />
<br />
 - Melee disciplines however have a huge effect. A Mighty Strike using warrior would crit at a rate of 10200% - or 10950% with the spell, hardly noticeable. Similar things would apply with other disciplines.<br />
<br />
You would probably get some synergy when using this with discs that make you hit harder or more often but not make you crit more often however. Say for example a non-disced monk does 200 DPS. His &quot;hitting faster&quot; discipline adds 40 DPS, his &quot;critting more&quot; discipline adds 45 DPS and our spell alone adds 40 DPS. Without the buff he is better off with the crit discipline. However as crit increases likely stack up linearly the crit spell + crit discipline add up to 285 DPS while the &quot;hit faster&quot; discipline and the crit spell would add up to 240 DPS * 1.2 = 288 DPS - which beats the previously better discipline.<br />
<br />
Of course this is all theory at this point. If anyone can dig up some parses about the effectiveness of +crit disciplines we can deduce the effectiveness of our new spell. Until then I will go with my best guess, which says &quot;still not worth it for the DPS increase&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your MT's are probably clicking off sense because they are tanking with evasive, which will overwrite sense, or because they think its agility. Generally speaking if you have to make choices about buffs, you pick hp buffs over mitigation/avoidance buffs since they deal with damage spikes better, so, if they have to lose a buff, it probably would be sense. And just remember, given a choice and provided that it can be maintained, most (well, lets say all) MTs would choose a 1500hp buff over a 680 one (wunshi) or a 412hp one (BBB). MT's dont need might since their role isnt dps, and raid MT's with decent equipment generally have good CHA, so casting reverance on them is just an annoyance. Don't do it unless they ask you to. Same deal with might. The chances that they would intentionally click off panther are about zero.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot;If it can be maintained.&quot;  That's the rub.  On most raids I'm on these days, maximum Shaman attendance is 3.  That's a big hole to have in any kind of buff rotation.  Not to mention that on most events in Anguish, I have other things that MUST be done.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Not to mention that you'll have some people who will simply refuse to cast it.  And, if this is a drop spell, it will be quite a while before you have enough of them to execute something like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Well, if you have enough shaman it will be a required rotation. There might be the odd individual that would refuse to cast the spell, and if they are in a guild that tolerates carrying dead weight, then that might be ok. Most proper raiding guilds will probably insist though, and I think that most shaman will do the right thing, after all, they probably want to win encounters, particularly challenging ones. And in any case, even with less than optimal numbers, having periods of elevated hp would still have a significant impact on reducing risk. For example, if you only have one shaman, timing the spell to land just before the MTs discs fade would be usefull.<br />
<br />
The point is, properly used, this spell could be a powerfull weapon in the raiders arsenal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Throwing out some ideas, assuming its possible to code.  <br />
<br />
How about a buff that gives a piece of your max hp pool to the targeted MT.  <br />
<br />
Works like this shm1 casts on MT shm1 drops (for example) 300hp and gets the buff icon. The MT gets the 300hp added on and 150% to crit rate.  Now shm2-shm5 also hit the MT he now has 1500 more hp and 750% higher crit.  <br />
<br />
The MT would idealy have no buff icon (one if nesecary for coding) the shm would take the buff slot.  Have the spell last at least 60+ min, or until clicked off by the shm. <br />
<br />
For coding purposes have the spell check up similar to bard songs, if the shm clicks off or logs next tick it will drop off the MT.<br />
<br />
The divisions can be adjusted for more or less shm.  Then just set a cap on the total amount that will be effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Considering I sometimes even forget to recast champion, which is a one minute refresh on the gem, and even gives me an icon for which to time its duration, I don't see how I could possibly keep myself in any sort of rotation of this spell on the tank. Now I'll address this gem:<br />
Not all MTs are warriors, and not all warriors are MTs. I highly doubt that Frodlin thinks that the primary role of the MT is dps.<br />
Your primary banner that you've been parading around in this thread is that every tank is going to want this spell for the 1500hp, yet the spell it self is contradictory. The HP component and its retardedly short duration gives the dilemma where encounters are going to be designed requiring the tank to have 1500 more HP, yet the crit component is surely better being cast on a DPS class.<br />
<br />
If you absolutely must keep this spell and its retarded limitations, remove the hit point component completely. I absolutely refuse to mire myself into some sort of rotation of anything. I have enough sh*t to be worrying about on most encounters already. If it is intended to be a &quot;Discipline&quot; as Rytan said, then make it purely DPS oriented, so that I can hand it out at my leisure.<br />
<br />
Tugela simply doesn't understand certain things, having not played in a raid enviornment on his shaman. A good example would be Quarm in time for instance. Here's the situation:<br />
<br />
1) 3800 max hit. a quad for full without defensive can one round the tank.<br />
2) Tons of AEs, need to keep people cured.<br />
3) Annoyingly resistant, need to alternate TA/Nihil to slow usually.<br />
4) Need to heal group in addition to slowing and curing.<br />
<br />
On quarm, here's what my spell gems look like:<br />
<br />
1) Disinfecting Aura<br />
2) Blood of Nadox<br />
3) Serenity<br />
4) Malos<br />
5) Nihil<br />
6) RGC<br />
7) Yoppa's<br />
8) Pained Memory<br />
9) Abolish Disease (that slow is the devil, gotta get it in one shot.)<br />
<br />
My guild got hit hard by burnout/eq2/wow, and a lot of our new recruits have horrible resists. To top it off, We've had 1-2 bards on for time the last couple weeks, so getting resists on Quarm is an issue sometimes. I usually split the curing up with 1 other shaman, or rarely two. During the fight, between trying to slow after each head explodes, plus cure my group or anyone that sends me tells, plus heal my group, plus keep myself alive, there is absolutely no time for me to worry about my turn to refresh this spell on anyone. Even if I had a second where I could toss it on someone, I can't because I don't have a spell gem to waste on it.<br />
<br />
Once again, I'm strongly suggesting they make this an AA ability, and remove the HP component so that no MT would want it. Have it decrease the user's mana if you must.<br />
<br />
You can steal my spell gems when you pry them from my cold dead hands.</div></div><hr />

Are they TRYING to take every ounce of fun out of the class? Thus far, they're succeeding. <br />
<br />
There's already a dry run of raiding Shaman on my server, between transfers, retirees, and people just quitting the game or the class. Short Duration buffs are bad. They're a stigma on this class, and give a lot of overworked Shaman even more to do.<br />
<br />
This class is not an occupation. I don't want to have to constantly refresh short duration buffs, because of someone short-sightedness in developing spells for this class. I've got enough on my plate.<br />
<br />
Honestly, this just goes back to the whole, &quot;Who let someone design these spells, why do they think this way, and what do I do with them after I stuff them in my trunk?&quot; line of reasoning.</div></div><hr />

You honestly mean to tell me that you can't handle that? Just watch the gem, when it refreshes, hit it again. Not exactly rocket science. Depending on the situation, we've had clerics doing BoV cycles and wizards doing SS cycles, they've been able to cope just fine, I'm sure shaman will too.<br />
<br />
And Giac, I have played a shaman on raids, even on Quarm. You have spell slots you can open there. Drop malos, let mages take care of resist debuffs. Failing that, only one shaman needs malos up. The rest of you don't. The shaman on malos can drop slow. So there's a slot right there. Also, why do you have DA up as well as Nadox? It implies that you are curing specific people outside of your group. That means that you do have spell gem allocated to an infrequent &quot;rotation&quot;, just as panther would be. Lot's of guilds did Quarm just fine with only 8 spell gems prior to the release of OoW, so I'm pretty sure that you will be able to use the 9th gem for a spell as powerful as panther.<br />
<br />
And Giac, you are misrepresenting the Quarm situation. Firstly, its unlikely that Quarm is going to quad for full on an MT in a guild capable of doing him (and in any case, panther would completely remove the possibility of that one rounding a decently equiped tank). Secondly, allthough Quarm has a lot of AEs, you don't need to cure everything. True, some people have horrible resists, but given the choice between them dying and the MT dying, I know which I would choose and probably you do to. Since you obviously dont know anything about this, the size of quarm makes AEtaunt pretty dicy on him, so keeping the MA alive is the number one priority. If the folks in your guild have crap resists, then take some time to gear them up properly for the content first, the problem will go away then.<br />

<br />
They also changed it from a crit modifier to a 20% 1hb mod, which I'm not so sure about. Not everyone uses 1hb weapons, knights almost never do, warriors use whatever gives them the best agro most of the time. Monks may want it but I doubt any of the other melee would. Ofcourse this part could be useless for melee depending how it works with the skill caps. May allow shaman to actually hit when meleeing, it would take your 200 skill in 1hb and turn it into 240 (I think OoW changed our ckill caps but I dont recall them right now).<br />

In any event the spell is still changing.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that if we were to get the spell that we all wanted, it would be Champion + Howl of the Predator + Might + Fort + Sense for 2500 mana, would be MGBable and lasts for 3 hours.  The reality is that a lot of Shaman were complaining about being bored on raids... well keeping short duration buffs going keeps us busy, but its not a lot of fun.  :(   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">I think I am starting to look through this. The spell looks a lot like something to give to a class to increase their group desirability. Something very simple, an HP buff with a short duration as to not be able to be cast by a bot or in PoK.<br />
<br />
This is definitely something every group would want a Shaman for. At the same time it's a horribly boring concept.<br />
<br />
I am sure we will see one or more spells along these lines for each class. Something unique a group will want them for, but very flat and uninspired. We'll see if that's the way to go for EQ in regards to balancing classes versus each other.<br />
<br />
To me it looks like this concept is taking precedence over adressing the top 10 class issues(isn't DoN release really close already?) and I am not sure I like that.<br />
<br />
Imo, SoE would be best off delaying the DoN release a few months. Adress the class issues, rebalance DPS and healing in general for all classes and then start designing these unique spells to increase everyone's group desirability in that order. <br />
<br />
3 months of beta testing(yes, make it part of the DoN beta) should be good enough, I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Why would every group want a shaman just for the ability to give them a couple more HPs and 1H blunt? After all clerics are not wanted because they spend their time casting HP buffs - they are wanted for sheer healing power.<br />
<br />
This spell is good for raids, for grouping in high risk places like Riftseeker's and to cast on your group's melees if every single one of your damage spells gets resisted. It does not make us heal better in any form, as we do not use a tank's full HP bar anyways, not by a long shot. All this is good for is to allow a chainhealing cleric a greater margin of error.<br />
<br />
I doubt I would ever cast it in a group setting except when pulling nameds in dangerous places. I guess the removed recast timer is nice in that case though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">I'd guess that 70-80% of the damage in a group is absorbed by a tank nowadays(as stupid as this concept is, SoE designed this game to be like that and I don't see it changing anytime soon), so that keeping this on your tank will benefit you greatly in places like MPG(in people's mind anyway).<br />

Of course, and you are correct on this, the net effect is marginal overall, but the playerbase is full of ignorant people who are blinded by this kind of buffs. <br />
Hell, most groups nowadays do not move from the zone line, if they do not have a &quot;Slower&quot;, Enchanter, Cleric and a Tank in their group. Groups will want a Shaman in their group, so that their tank has 1500 HPs more than he'd have without one, no matter if it's needed or not, just like Shamans were getting invites for Slows during PoP(when Shamans had neither Nihil nor Vindictive Spirit, even though the net difference between Slows was marginal at best(Beastlord and Enchanters were actually superior in most cases). <br />
<br />
It took quite a while for people to realize that Shamans were actually crippling their effectivness and for people to invite other Slowers over them for the added benefits they were bringing to their group.<br />
<br />
Tugela would be the first one to invite one(if not his own), because of the 1500 HPs alone. That's the typical playerbase :p</div></div><hr />

He has said a lot of things, but he didn't say he didn't like buffing.<br />
<br />
Myself, I like the change made to the spell. Honestly, I'd really rather see it offer a modifier to ALL melee ... 1hs, 2hs, piercing, 1hb, etc. Seems it would be more widely useful that way, even if they had to decrease the modifier percentage. I don't mind a small recast time, so long as it's not hugely disproportionate to the duration of the spell. I'd honestly rather see them lose the reagent.<br />

When I made my shaman Lucy did not exist. Heck, reliable spell lists did not exist. I went by the in-game description of the class and word of mouth. I picked a shaman because I wanted to melee and cast spells and the hybrids did not have enough spells for my liking.<br />
<br />
Shaman only have the most buffs because of the crappy stat buffs and because we get a little bit of everything anyways. If you look at actual buff effectiveness we are way behind the curve of the specialists.<br />
<br />
Shaman buff effectiveness:<br />
HPs<br />
-- shaman<br />
------------- cleric<br />
--- druid<br />
---------------- paladin<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
----- shaman<br />
---------- enchanter<br />
----- beastlord<br />
----------------- bard<br />

I wouldnt invite someone particularly to do this in a group either, I don't need to, Yella's hp is good enough for pretty much all single group content. Like I said before, its primary use would on large raid targets, perhaps on the tougher single group names, allthough the original recast time would have reduced its utility.  It would also potentially open up a lot of group content to less well equiped players though, depending on how they used it. The main purpose would be to give a margin of error in those situations. Hopefully you wouldn't need that margin, but if you are at the edge it will definitly make or break the encounter.</div></div><hr />

I don't think most shamans are going to have a choice on whether to keep this up or not, I bet it's going to be required.<br />
And that is part of why the spell is crap. If clerics got a spell that required them to type out &quot;walla walla&quot; every 20 seconds but made CH cost no time you bet it would be required on raids and a powerful ability in groups as well (which this piece of crap is not).<br />
<br />
That does not make it desirable, does not help the class, does not make it fun - it only makes it annoying and powerful. There is no need for that. You can not balance power with annoyance, so all spells, all abilities should be balanced by power and then have their annoyance minimized. Adding annoying powerful abilities only results in annoying one part of your playerbase and having the other part ignore something SOE spent precious development time on.<br />
<br />
If shamans for some odd reason need the ability to give the MT more HPs to balance the class but for equally odd reasons it would be overpowering to cast it on the entire raid just make it a 10 min refresh, 40 min duration. Of course with the recast time now gone it seems like that was never a balancing factor to begin with. Apparently we are to decide between giving someone +1500 HPs or casting a nuke or real heal. I think I would still be happier with the 10 min / 40 min  duration, even though that is an annoying spell too. Because I don't have to keep a list of people to rotate this on that way and also because I can get back to casting real heals during combat, which beats having rogue_no_192 having a prettier number in his inventory.<br />
<br />
Rytan, if you read this, would you mind telling us what this spell is supposed to do for us shaman and how you want us to use it (or rather, how you not want us to use it)? I am sure we can come up with a ton of good ideas. Currently it seems like a rather narrow spell that has a huge annoyance factor, and I am sure annoying customers is not what the spell was supposed to do.</div></div><hr />

What I meant to say was this:<br />
Adding nonsensical requirements to an EQ ability, be it reagents, spells you constantly have to recast or having to type out some line in /say can not ever be used to balance said ability. All it does is add some annoying prerequisite that will not stop the ability from being used.<br />
<br />
 - manual song twisting did not stop bards from doing it, it only gave them carpal tunnel<br />
 - cannidancing was annoying, yet we all did it for the added power<br />
 - manual arrowing did nothing to lessen archery power, it only forced people to get a gamepad<br />
<br />
similarly the short duration on panther will not keep us from casting it if it is needed, it will only annoy everyone involved, just like &quot;walla walla&quot; for free spells would not stop clerics from using it and annoying the hell out of their raids and groups.</div></div><hr />

Do the 'cast' procs like this tend to go off more than twice a minute?<br />

Two 550 procs a minute is nothing to sneeze at, but given the alternative uses of mana, its probably not be worthwhile for 1100 dmg for 650 mana.<br />
<br />
The damage / mana ratio on Yoppa's spear is 2.7:1 -- adding in focus effects (which do not work on procs?) it's pretty much 3.3:1 -- so for this to be 'as good as' Yoppa's spear it would need to proc 3.9 times per cast (per minute).<br />

Actually, Clerics were never intended to get any HoT type heal at all. Back in the day SoE ****ed up one of their Kunark spells and, after experimenting a little with it, decided it wasn't worth the hassle so they copied Torpor(a spell that had been tested extensively on test) and modified it to have no drawbacks, but be less efficient.<br />

<br />
if it stays where it is...I wouldn't really complain...duration could be improved, but the recast is 0, doesn't have indoor/outdoor restriction, and also, looking over the proc, it isn't half bad....405dd w/ chromatic -300 resist check....for those of us who jump in and melee, this isn't bad at all....just my opinion....</div></div><hr />

Edit: I was looking at the various changes this spell has seen and I must say that the spell had really great potential up to the 23 January. The spell became worthless when they added the proc, imo.</div></div><hr />

Check my post in the proc thread. It's adding around 75 DPS when stuck on the wolf, if not more - 6750 damage (assuming 50% extension) for 650 mana seems very reasonable to me. :)</div></div><hr />

Anything with a 1 minute duration is annoying. Yes, even heal over time spells. DoTs at least give us a message when they wear off, and you don't DoT more than 1-2 mobs at a time usually so they are easy to keep track of.<br />
<br />
This is the difference between the way you think and the way we think.You see 1500hp and you think &quot;0mfgz0rz I could be th3 w1n r0x0r tank if I had that&quot;. We see it and think &quot;great, an annoying spell I have to cast every minute in addition to the stuff I'm already doing, and the spell doesn't even give as much HP as conviction which lasts 4 hours.<br />
<br />
Like I, and many other people have said multiple times, you do not play a ****ing shaman. You play a BOT. There is a world of difference. Here is an example of the crap we as a class already have to deal with:<br />
<br />
(Before killing Chailak, while waiting for latecomers before starting Queen).<br />
Idiot1 tells you, 'trib pls'<br />
Idiot2 tells you 'hammers'<br />
Idiot3 tells you, 'agi and tribunal'<br />
Idiot4 tells you, 'i was afk and missed MGB focus can I hav eit and trib?&gt;'<br />
You tell ____:3, 'why are people asking me for trib? the AEs on this guy are -500 resist and he recasts them constantly'<br />
____ tells ____:3. 'because they whine'<br />
Idiot3 tells you, 'and can ur nec dmf me 2 plz?'<br />
<br />
I have played a shaman as my main for 4 and a half years of my life. I've been the only shaman in halls of testing, I've been the only shaman in Vex Thal, on the RZ script, hell I've been the only shaman on in PoTime and on Quarm.<br />
<br />
Buffs are a part of the game to enhance a player, but building a class around buffs is an incredible design flaw, because 1) it is an interchange of power, you are not directly killing something yourself or with something you control, or keeping someone alive, and 2) Maintenence on such spells causes interrupts in normal playstyle. On top of that, the only way to time buffs is either by casting themselves on ourselves at the same time. In an exp group, you get into a routine, and the need to refresh a spell such as this breaks it horribly.<br />
<br />
I would much prefer this be a group spell which added a 200ddish proc and lasted half an hour. Hell, throw in 60% haste on the spell too, and make it cost a stupid ammount of mana, but let me demem if once I'm done casting it and forget about it. Spell gems are at a premium for us. We aren't rangers where we need to keep up snare, root, and eagle eye and can waste the other 6 slots on 4 nukes and a heal.<br />
<br />
bWhat I really would have liked to see in this expansion is a buff/debuff timer window. Maybe something that is either a leadership or AA ability. When you cast a spell, it lists it in the timer window, and has a timer in seconds of when that spell will wear off. Group spells will be a different color, and only have one timer. For single target spells, you could click on the listing and it would target the thing you cast that spell on (if in range of the normal /target command). Right clicking on the listing would erase the timer from the window.<br />
<br />
I would love something like this. I could serenity someone, resume slowing things, see when it is going to wear off, click on that spell listing in the timer window to target the person again, and cast the spell again to refresh it. Then I might be less apprehensive of these short duration buffs. At this stage in the game, the last thing they want to do is to make playing tedious.<br />
<br />
Anyways, enough ranty rambling for now. Go Growlbacks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u175"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p175">The point of a spell like the original version would be to use it in tactical situations. Some people can handle powerfull tools when given to them, some cant, because they don't have the co-ordination, lack attentiveness, have poor reaction skills or are just simply lazy, whatever. The only way that new tactically powerfull spells will come into the game is by having significant limitations associated with them, and the original spell was just that. You guys have a choice really, do you want powerful, usefull spells which are limited through tactical application or do you want low power spells with genereral applications, because those are the two options that are available. The days of the best of both worlds with spells like turgurs, CH or defensive are long gone, for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">As a follow up, just to cover my ass, I am not going to claim any knowledge of how to play my two-boxed necro. I know how to DPS with him. I'm not going to show up on the necro boards and start lobbying for a more efficient twitch that works over time and has a 1 minute duration or some such bull****. Do us all a favor and go back to the steel warrrior where you and your buddies can cry on each others shoulders some more about knight utility and poor itemization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">On top of that, the only way to time buffs is either by casting themselves on ourselves at the same time.

<br />
Couple of points.<br />
<br />
1) If you had ever played an MT on large targets you would know that timing on intermitent spells are taken care of by the tank, and the status of it is communicated by the tank via hotkeys. Very simple to deal with, its a team effort. And in any case, the original spell had recast timer which exceeded the duration, ie the spell gem would act as its own timer, all you need to do is pay attention to your assigned tasks, I assume you do that anyway, this would just be another one, the importance of which would be decided based on prioritization by the raid leader/buff co-ordinator depending on the situation and resources available.<br />
<br />
2) The spell would be used differently in groups as opposed to raids. The most obvious applications would be to tag it onto the MT on nameds when they signal their disc about to fade, or to pop it on yourself or other classes at risk when facing a potentially difficult pull. Basically give those people a bit more margin for error when dealing with critical situations.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of situations where a thoughtfull shaman could have made good use of the spell. All they need to do is pull their head out and think of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">Do us all a favor and go back to the steel warrrior where you and your buddies can cry on each others shoulders some more about knight utility and poor itemization.<br />
<br />
Dont know what you are talking about. I dont have issues with knight utility or poor itemization (what the hell is that?), and neither do most warriors I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">The only way that new tactically powerfull spells will come into the game is by having significant limitations associated with them<br />
<br />
Can you give me one good reason why the 1500hp on the original version was powerful enough to need to be regulated to a 1 minute buff, but it is alright for 1787hp/94ac Conviction to last four hours? I understand the crit portion being interesting, but in its original state with the crits it still wouldn't have been used on dps, due to the 1500hp. I'm not saying I would have used it, but if other people did, they would have used it on tanks.<br />
<br />
Sticking with the twitch example, it would be like giving necros a spell that gave 15 mana per tick for 1 minue and cost 300 mana to cast. It would be less mana per tick than clairvoyance, but somehow because it's a different class but similar effect it should be ridiculously limited to use and a pain to do so?<br />
<br />
Hooray for logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">As much as I hate it, but as I stated before, the 1500 HP buff was a great spell(even though it didn't adress any of our top 10 issues) and it definitely became less powerful when they changed it to what it is now.<br />
Most people didn't look at the spell the right way, I believe. <br />
<br />
The buff itself not only allowed Shamans to buff an additional 1500 HPs putting us on top, even ahead of Paladins, in terms of HP buffing, but what was even more important and powerful is that it allowed every Shaman to have a 1.5 second fast heal for 500 mana. <br />
<br />
Obviously no foci would be able to enhance this heal, but it would still be very valuable.<br />
<br />
I think this was reason enough for it to be that short lasting. This doesn't mean I support short term buffs, but it certainly had more legitimation to be a short term &quot;buff&quot; than the ****ty proc it is now(even if it added 75 DPS to each melee, which seems a little much despite the screenshot showing just that).<br />
<br />
So in other words, short term buffs suck, but the spell sucked &quot;less&quot; before, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">What boggles me is the evolution of the spell. It went from a HP buff / heal thing to a damage / movement spell. The only thing the two versions have in common is the annoying duration. My conclusion is that someone at SOE decided &quot;hey, shaman need a short term buff&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now I ask, why the heck does something think shaman need an annoying new spell? New spell, sure, everyone gets new spells every now and then. A new expansion comes out, everyone gets upgrades to some existing spell lines and maybe a new spell line. Now, usually they come in two flavors.<br />
a) A class needs something - say &quot;necros need something to show groups how cool they are&quot;. And necros got group taps and everything was well.<br />
b) Someone thought of some great new spell and some random class gets it. And clerics got spell haste and everyone likes the spell (even if they may argue about what class gets it).<br />
<br />
This spell is neither. If someone believes shaman need a quick heal, a melee damage increaser, a HP buff or heck, even a movement buff - I may argue whether they are right, but at least we would get a spell something thinks shaman should have. Instead someone seems to believe shaman need some more annoyance when playing this game. That is crap. It is like some developers are deliberately going out of their way to annoy paying customers.<br />
<br />
If we need a new fast heal then give us a new fast heal. We surely have made enough suggestions on these boards in this regard.<br />
<br />
If we need better HP buffs then either make our existing buffs better or add a new HP buff. If we for some unfathomable reason need to buff only up to 6 other characters and it is not possible to code this directly then make this an AA ability, at a cost of no more then 3 points.<br />
<br />
If we need more damage potential then give us some new damage spells. Make the Bane line unresistable. Give us some resist modifiers on nukes. Make rains unresistable. Or heck, let us buff more people with existing avatar spells. I would even be happier with a decent pet buff. There, problem solved. I can only cast it on one target and now it can have a 60 minute duration.<br />
<br />
And if we need a movement buff just give us an upgrade to spirit of bih'li.<br />
<br />
The current version of the spell, no matter if it is useful or not is crap. Not because it is too weak. Not because it is too strong. But because it seems like it exists only to annoy us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">Movement component is gone.  Has been for a week or more.<br />
<br />
Rangers' Eagle Eye lasts an hour now, and snare is on an aa click button.<br />
<br />
This is not a 1min duration buff, it's a no-resist no-agro damage spell like the magician ds.  It's 70dps!  That's right in line with Bane, but you can have it running on as many folks as you have meleeing for you, even your pet!<br />
<br />
Would sure be nice if it were longer duration, but then it couldn't be as good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">It's neither unresistable(granted -300 Chromatic is pretty hard to resist) nor agro-free(the person who procs will create aggro while a Damage Shield doesn't).<br />
Furthermore, the only thing I have seen indicating that it procs more than 3 times/minute with max Dex and skill(main hand + offhand combined) is Retron's screenshot that shows a pet proc'ing this a few times back to back. <br />
Hardly enough to assume it will add an average of 70 DPS to anyone.<br />
<br />
I'd actually assume that this will proc up to 4 times/minute with a huge amount of Combat Effects. Weapon Affinity does not apply to innate procs afaik, so that you won't benefit from that AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">-300 Chromatic is much, much more unresistable than Wizard Lure spells.  Much much more.  Less resistable than all our normal spells to such a degree that it's hard to calculate.  Pardon my hyperbole in saying &quot;unresistable&quot;, but seeing this proc resisted on any mob not specifically absolutely immune to all casting will be worth a screenshot, it'll be so rare.<br />
<br />
On the other point, it most certainly is agro free for the caster.  One of the biggest points of complaint for shamans, coming up over and over, is how our damage gains us so much agro.  This spell doesn't give us any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u185"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p185">So let me get this straight...<br />
<br />
BST gets the 1500hp, 150hp regen, +20% damage buff that lasts for a minute, and costs 650 mana.<br />
<br />
Shaman get a buff that gives someone an unresistable (Chromatic -300) 550hp proc that costs 650 mana.<br />
<br />
Something just doesn't seem right here, but I can't quite put my finger on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u186"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p186">BST spell is a pet only buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u187"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p187">BST spell is a pet only buff.<br />
<br />
Not really.  Somehow the spell is cast on the pet, but then the spell casts itself on you or sometihng like that.  EE effects go on the pet part of the spell, but not on the caster.  This is how I understand it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u190"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p190">So, I'm trying to see what my spell set is going to have to look like now in a typical group.<br />
<br />
1. Nihili<br />
2. Malos<br />
3. Root<br />
4. Yoppa Heal<br />
5. Canni<br />
6. Trushar<br />
7. Champion<br />
8. Panther<br />
9. ??  Guess a weak arse nuke, maybe a curse dot ??<br />
<br />
<br />
While I can see that 4k+ damage for 650 mana in the log above is a good thing... it just seems like shaman sure have evolved far from the class I originally started playing.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I like doing the damage myself.  I like the feeling of stacking my dots and doing damage.  I like chaining two rain sets and seeing crits happen.  If I have one free slot in which to do so..its not going to happen.  <br />
<br />
For me, the shaman class is feeling less and less fulfilling. Good Healing, good damage dealing, and ok buffing were a perfect fit for my playstyle.  Later we evolved to better buffing, weaker healing, and moderate damage.  Now I guess SOE's vision of us is moderate healing, low damage, high support/buffing.<br />
<br />
I guess if I want to feel fulfilled I need to turn on &quot;others damage&quot; again... lame.  <br />
<br />
I just got my epic, am almost fully time geared, am moving into Qvic, am next in line for a TA... and despite all that, I'm seriously considering another class.  What does that say about the new direction SOE is taking shaman?<br />
<br />
I always knew I was a support class, and I was fine with that.  But we had our active role in healing and damage dealing.  If SOE wants to not increase our traditional active roles of healing+damage, and instead wants to create another active role in the arena of buffing:  I say to heck with that.  Thats the last place I want my activity focused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">/rant on<br />
<br />
Does anyone at SoE understand how INCREDIBLY ANNOYING it is going to be to cast a 1 minute duration buff (3 second cast, 0 recast delay - so I can cast it on 20 people in 60 seconds?).<br />
<br />
Option 1 - Given our average raid that means one of our shaman is going to be chain casting a spell every 3 seconds on most of our melee for over 3 hours (up to 8 hours on weekends). <br />
<br />
Option 2 - As we raid with max 3 shaman due to people quitting, almost 20-30 seconds of every minute for every one of our shaman over an entire raid (which on the weekend could be 7-8 hours) is potentially going to be taken up with casting this spell.<br />
<br />
Even in your average xp group with cleric, shaman, mage, tank, ranger, 2nd tank/melee etc means you have to cast it 4-5 times at 12-15 seconds of every minute of your entire 2-4 hour xp grind group (assuming you cast on pets which I do with FA as a matter of course).<br />
<br />
Is this fun, Hell NO.<br />
<br />
It must be part of the policy at SoE, ohh, we stopped shaman having to click Canni IV every 5.5 seconds when we gave them Pained Memory - lets think of a new way to really piss them off via another spell and give them one they have to recast every 3 seconds instead for anything from 25 - 33% of their time in the game. <br />
<br />
This spell in its current form goes to prove Chutoi was exactly right in his estimate of Rytan - that guy is completely brain-dead if he thinks this spell will enhance the playing experience for shaman. I can potentially see this spell having shaman quit the game in droves.<br />
<br />
The only shamans that are going to really like this spell are the shamans who are buff-bots for melee mains, or shaman with melee alts who duo a lot.<br />
<br />
I really, really hope they have sent bad information to Lucy deliberately so that the spell may end up being something that people will want to receive because in its current form if I get this spell from a rune drop I will use it to wipe my big, hairy bear butt and then post the spell scroll to Rytan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">Your not going to be chain casting this spell in it's current form on everyone in the raid, so you can drop the hysterics. You dont have the mana to do it. As it stands it's primary use probably would be to up dps on the pup a bit, or as a self buff to those shaman who play around with melee occasionally. It's basically a toy now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u193"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p193">As it stands it's primary use probably would be to up dps on the pup a bit, or as a self buff to those shaman who play around with melee occasionally. It's basically a toy now.<br />
At the risk of sounding like a stuck record, if you cast it on anything other than a pet you're doing yourself out of DPS. It's amusing to me that with this spell we now have the best pet in the game for doing damage, albeit at a hefty mana cost.<br />
<br />
Anyone pestering me for it will get a big fat &quot;no&quot; under most circumstances, and if they protest I'll just tell them when they can proc like a pet then I'll buff them like a pet!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u194"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p194">&quot;As it stands it's primary use probably would be to up dps on the pup a bit, or as a self buff to those shaman who play around with melee occasionally. It's basically a toy now.&quot;<br />
<br />
BS.<br />
<br />
If we get this spell, I can guarantee raids will stick shaman with 5 dps melee, and I'll be expected to rotate the spell on them.  Honestly, at 650 per pop, with our mana regen, I bet I can keep a rotation on a group going for quite some time.  <br />
<br />
I have 7300 mana now, so thats 11 casts.  <br />
3 second casts, ~1 second for the gem to refresh. ~4 seconds per cast.<br />
<br />
20 seconds total for 5 melee.  That means, per round, I have 40 seconds to canni.  Or, even better, casting canni in between casting the spell: so:<br />
<br />
Round::::<br />
1.  Hit melee 1. - 4 seconds<br />
2.  Pained - 2.25 + 1 sec gem refresh<br />
3.  Hit melee 2 - 4 seconds<br />
4.  Hit melee 3 - 4 seconds<br />
5.  CanniV - 2.25<br />
7.  Hit melee 4 - 4 seconds<br />
8.  Hit melee 5 - 4 seconds<br />
9.  Pained  - 2.25 + 1 sec gem refresh<br />
End Round:::: <br />
=28.25 seconds.  I don't wanna bother figuring out another pained or two during that 20 seconds or so I have before the next round of casts, so, <br />
<br />
Total casts 650x5 = 3250 mana spent<br />
Canni = 1200 + 720(2 pain) = 1920 mana gained<br />
Total time = 28.25 seconds = .. what? about 50 mana per tick or so? = 200-300 mana. (dunno tired).<br />
<br />
So, net spent per round = 1008 mana.  <br />
<br />
Next round, I won't get canniV, so I'l spend 2208 mana.  <br />
<br />
So 7300 mana - 1008-2208-2208-2008 = oom'ish. <br />
<br />
4rounds x5 melee x 4000 damage = 80,000 damage in those 4 minutes, or about 333 DPS.<br />
<br />
Thats.. great.   And because its great, we'll be expected to do it.  And it'll be boring as hell.  <br />
<br />
The thing is, depending on mob resists, some shaman can push 333 dps.  This spell will be great when the mob is resisting your own dots, because you can transfer your damage dealing to others to do.  <br />
<br />
Whats most annoying about this whole thing, is how its being implemented.  If SOE wanted the net result to be shaman having the ability to transfer their mana into 333 dps on a mob, why pick this annoying route?<br />
<br />
why couldn't they have just let our dots land??  Is that so complicated... (guild in qvic tonight, I have my epic, scs3, and poison is only landed every 3rd attemp, so I get pissed and chain cast until they stick.  Of course, summoned dead:)<br />
<br />
Or maybe a huge mana cost, like 4000 mana, but it lasts 7 minutes.. or about the same as FA with extensions?  Anything but be locked into the eqivalent of a CH chain, except for damage dealing instead of healing.  <br />
<br />
With the absurdly high resists of mobs raid mobs, of course this will be the preferred way that shaman dish out damage.  And man, its gonna be boring hehe. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This most certainly will not be a pet buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u195"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p195">Quite a few assumptions and mistakes in there, Ungkor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u196"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p196">Like what Giac?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u197"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p197">Like the gem refresh, the cast times, the mana regen from Canni V, the damage calculation per melee, proc rate etc.<br />
<br />
Of course melee will want this. Melee want everything and Casters are annoying as **** when it comes to their melee DPS, but it will definitely be most beneficial on pets due to their proc rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u198"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p198">Cast time for pained = 2.25 seconds<br />
Cast time for panther = 3 seconds<br />
Mana returned from canniV = 1200 for 1924 hp.<br />
Mana returned from paine = 360<br />
<br />
<br />
That I know is true.  refresh times on gems, and the canniV cast time I just guessed.  Know what they are?  I'll recompute.<br />
<br />
&quot;the damage calculation per melee, proc rate etc&quot;<br />
<br />
In terms of the proc rate, I'm just using the number of procs show above.<br />
<br />
edit:;<br />
<br />
Grr, I just noticed that there are two people.  The one guy had 8 procs or about 3240 damage.  That sucks then.  If we use that parse, its more like 240 dps for 5 melee if they are proc about the same as the above guy did.<br />
<br />
Regardless of a second or two here or there in refresh in the calculations, or the proc rates, I'm pretty sure the intention of this spell is to transfer the dps that a shaman could do himself (if everything stuck, etc.), to melee instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u199"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p199">The mana you gain from Canni V is 1066.<br />
<br />
Now I honestly don't know what the proc rate will be, but I don't see this proc'ing more than 5 times per minute(I know the log shows more than 5 for one of the 2 and a lot more for the pet). I might be wrong, who knows.<br />
<br />
Assuming this will have a ppm of 5, then the max damage per minute you will add to a PC is 5 x 550 or 2750(about 46 DPS). Of course this is speculation. <br />
There are very few instances in which you have more than 3 melee in your group usually, so on average I'd say you could add 150 DPS to your group by keeping this up on 3 of them. This in an era where Warriors are already close to 400 DPS.<br />
<br />
We shall see, but I would have preferred a hate reduction and a change to the resist checks of our DoTs, if they wanted to up our DPS. Even though the DPS increase for the puppy will be nice, certainly.</div></div><hr />

http://eq.crgaming.com/archetype/Details.asp?Id=154  says 1200.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, yeah, I guess we'll just have to wait and see more parses to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">another problem with cast imbue type procs is the order they are in the buff bar.  if this lands under the pally/sk self proc it only has a chance to go off if the self buff proc doesn't go off... this reduces the effectiveness of the spell and really just adds a minor head ache into buff organization for not only the shaman casting the spell, but the melee haveing it cast on them.<br />
someone already mentioned potential stacking issues with  other proc buffs....<br />
<br />
we can debate the dps output and the different uses of a 1 minute duration pre exstention buff, but how many shaman are going to keep this buff up on the melee in their groups?<br />
<br />
in all honesty i don't have champion but have stopped casting FA in xp groups a while ago. it isn't that i am lazy, it is more to the point that recasting a buff with such a short duration isn't fun (it is actually obnoxious.)  99% of the people i group with understand this and don't bother me about casting FA.  i doubt i will cast this new buff outside of partnering/farming with my pally.<br />
it is really kind of sad that the duration of this buff is so short.<br />
<br />
on the plus side, my pally is going to get a moderate to decent disc to help him tank tough mobs... it isn't super but it will help. SKs get a decent disc too. to bad our spells for this expansion are imho, **** (at least as they stand now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">Sad to say but this argument sounds a hell of alot like all the bitching that was going on in EQ 2 when it was released.<br />
<br />
People couldn't comprehend that short term buffs were made short term for a reason. They were powerful tools, and they were not ment to be kept up on everyone all the time, but used as a booster when needed, or an emergency resource.<br />
<br />
A prime example was the Enchanter mana regen spell, damd I can't even remember what it was called. It was the EQ 2 equivalent of Clarity, and it had a 3 minute duration.<br />
<br />
3 lously minutes~ Take a trip over to the EQ 2 boards, check out the enchanter class boards, and the game mechanics area. You will find more than a few threads with many, many people arguing about this exact thing.<br />
<br />
I however do have to admit that I am surprised to see short term buffs appearing in EQ 1. Just think soon bards will be screaming at us stealing thier class definieng ability, the short term buff. Oh hell more likely they will be screaming welcome to my world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont think the casters of these buffs have a problem understanding that.<br />
Its the people who recieve the buff who have a problem with it.<br />
Melees whatever are going to look at this and think &quot;aha this gives me an extra 75 dps (or whatever) I WANT THIS KEPT ON ME&quot;.<br />
Simple as that really.<br />
<br />
EQ2 started off with short term buffs and people who came to EQ2 fresh to mmorgs accept it because they know no different but introducing short term buffs into EQ 1 where people are used to long term buffs will cause problems because the buffee will not understand that theyre emergency buffs.<br />
<br />
Short term buffs to me seem to be SoE's way of trying to get people into groups as the buffer has to be there ie you cant get it in PoK then toddle off and exp for a couple of hours.<br />
<br />
One thing i cant understand about this particular spell is the old argument that having a 1hr FA would be to overpowering.IF this is the case then why so short a refresh on this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u204"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p204">Short term buffs in EQ2 are not meant to be used in &quot;dire situations&quot; (some can be, just like in EQ1/WoW/etc), but mostly to ensure that people will group. You want better mana regen? In EQ1 you just grab KEI or better and that's that, may not need/want that char anymore. No such thing in EQ2 - want mana regen, then also take someone who provides it. Boot him/her - kiss goodbye to mana regen. Same for speed buffs and various other things. In a way clever thing of course, as it means that there wont be anymore such 'buffbots' or some class wont be dropped after you get a buff from them (like shamans in EQ1 - give focus, give STA/avoidance/whatever - goodbye, we don't need you anymore after those buffs). Thus if they want powerful buffs/effects, they have to take the shaman with them.<br />
<br />
Not that those spells are anything to really look at..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u205"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p205">If this is an &quot;emergency buff&quot; it should cost 2K mana or more and do an appropriate amount of damage. If this is the spell that goes into my damage slot it better be able to earn the name. What I don't get is why we get buff-based damage though. It has stacking issues, it takes a buff slot, it does vastly varying damage depending on what or whom you put it on and it is incredibly more annoying then a nuke, pet or DoT.<br />
<br />
There are some very few reasons to make it a proc instead of a nuke or DoT. These are:<br />
1) it is too powerful and needs the chance to dispel to balance it.<br />
2) someone at SOE thinks you can balance a powerful spell if you make it annoying and/or complicated enough<br />
3) someone at SOE believes shaman should do more damage in pet groups<br />
4) for some odd reason shamans should do less damage in groups with melees who have their own proc buffs<br />
<br />
1) is a pretty crappy reason - dispels are a rather small risk<br />
3) and 4) seem pretty odd to me<br />
That leaves 2 . . . and sadly I can just see this conversation:<br />
<br />
 - Hey, this new proc buff rocks!<br />
 - But, isn't it a little too powerful?<br />
 - No, no, you see, the shaman has to sacrifice a spellgem (and thus swap more often), has to time the buff and the melee has to watch his buff order. It is very annoying but if you are willing to endure it, it rocks!<br />
 - Oh, ok then.<br />
<br />
I hope that wasn't the case, but I can just see it happening. Bottom line: this is a game, it should be fun. If SOE gives any class an annoying ability it should better be the only way to achieve power balance. This spell is annoying to both shaman and the target of the spell. The same result could be achieved in a less annoying way. Hence the spell sucks - powerful or not is not even the issue here.</div></div><hr />

Solution? One hour buffs. Heck, make them 40 minutes, 60 with max spell extension (and then reduce the MGB timer a little).<br />
<br />
I do not mind recasting my buffs once per hour and on the other hand if someone is willing to go shop for buffs (10 minutes), go to his experience zone and get set up (10 minutes) and then leave after 40 minutes .... let them. Yes, the duration and KEI and some other spells is ridiculously long. No, the solution is not to make the duration on all buffs ridiculously short. There is some middle ground between 6 minutes and 4 hours where durations are &quot;too short&quot; to shop for buffs and &quot;long enough&quot; to not overly annoy players.</div></div><hr />

It's just very hard to see that any shaman will want to join a group in order to be a buffbot.  And it's almost as hard to see that a group will want to recruit a shaman in order to have a buffbot.  If it comes to that, it seems much more likely that someone will bring along a two-boxed shaman specifically as a buffbot.<br />
<br />
Murtak is right, as usual.  One hour buffs are about the right amount.  If someone wants to buy a set of buffs in PoK and then go solo for an hour: let him.   If a group wants to go somewhere for two or three hours or more and wants shaman buffs, let the shaman cast those buffs once an hour and then get on with the game.</div></div><hr />

i would much rather see a maloxxx buff that has a faster cast time, even if it is the same debuff value as malos...<br />
<br />
btw, just because this is a 1 minute buff doesn't mean people can't macro a shaman next to the group and have him cast this. it only means you can't get this buff in pok and run off to xp without a shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree 100%, but you can make that statement quite accurately about virtually every single class in the game.  An out of group rogue does good dps.  An out of group wizard?  Check.  Boxxed cleric?  Heals pretty good.  Check.  Ranger with outfire?  Check.<br />
<br />
The point is the 'you can still box it with a bot' doesn't hold too much water for me ... that's true of nearly every class.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't view casting a buff twice per mob (assuming 1-min kill rate and 80% total extension, 3-4 melee / pets) as any worse than casting a nuke twice per mob.  I view this spell as a superior nuke to any we have gotten in the past, and I plan to use it that way.  Personally, I never thought of my nukes as annoyingly high maintenance.  Different strokes I guess.<br />
<br />
I suppose as parses come out we might all decide it sucks, but from the data we have available, it's a great spell.  Maybe it'll only be worth casting on pets and dual wielders, who knows?  At this point though it looks very promising to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was purely pointing out the fact that this wont stop people from botting a shaman as a buff bot. i realize other classes can be botted as well, but this spell wont change buff botting a shaman outside the group. (i am assuming a short duration spell like this was partly ment to reduce buff botting.)</div></div><hr />

I can cast a nuke whenever I have the mana and time. I have to time a buff.<br />
<br />
I can cast a nuke 10 times in a fight if need be. I can only cast a buff once per melee.<br />
<br />
I can cast a nuke without worrying about buff slots. Without worrying about refreshing it before it runs out so it does not land in the wrong buff slot. Without worrying about stacking issues. Without having to deal with the odd whiny player who wants it kept up 24/7.<br />
<br />
Also a nuke does not do ten times more damage when you have a pet in the group (or ten times less if you don't, whichever way you prefer looking at it). And nukes do not get dispelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u215"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p215">Amazing how perspective can change the whole picture.  Isazo's view is a ray of light on how to use this new spell.  By-pass mere worst-case speculation.  If annoyed, don't use, like the shaman who don't use FA... Used to advantage and not scorned for disadvantages, this spell has its definite upsides.<br />
<br />
As for taking up that precious spell gem, yes, that can be annoying -- but not insurmountable.  Don't confine yourself to the &quot;I only have 9 spell gems&quot; mentality...  The great thing about spellsets is that you can interchange them on-the-fly:  <br />
<br />
For all practical purposes you have 11 to 12 spells immediately at your disposal by switching out only 2 or 3 spells.  ONCE MOB IS ENGAGED, you can safely switch to a spellset that is nearly identical to your main set save for disposable spells for the remainder of the battle... all it takes is a quick /mem m2 or /mem m3.  When done, switch back to main spellset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Disposable spells&quot; will vary for each playstyle, and you will want to switch out spells that have a fairly quick refresh time, but some examples could be as follows:<br />
<br />
1) root<br />
2) canni (esp if you on the full side of the mana bar)<br />
3) malox<br />
4) Q/BoT/HoT (mostly if your MH is awesome)<br />
5) slow (for the brave, longer-lasting fight)<br />
6) quick refresh DD/DoT<br />
<br />
Really, get used to the idea of flexible adaptation as far as spellsets go, and watch your productivity skyrocket.  Tailor your spellsets to the changing situation, and free yourself from rigid spellset-think. <br />

<br />
I'm excited by the promise of more DPS for less aggro, or even for the soloing/melee shaman to strut his melee/pet muscles more in older zones.  And yes, I can already hear the nay-sayers bringing up the speculative worst-case scenarios...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nukes are FUN for me - I have a cold focus, I've invested AA into nuke crits. I like big boom booms. Where is the fun is of casting 2 buffs on a melee? I don't get to see the damage, I don't get fun parses where I get to see my damage, I don't get any credit for boosting damage. <br />
<br />
Nukes - fun, I see the damage, I enjoy it. Casting a buff is ****ING BORING. I do enough buffing already, I can just feel the big sucking vortex of UNFUN at the thought of melees asking for this buff over and over. Panther, panther, panther, panther :(<br />
<br />
My rule will be anybody that asks for this retarded POS will never get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u217"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p217">I don't think anyone is arguing against this:<br />
<br />
1.  It appears to do a good deal of damage in a short time for a small mana cost.<br />
2.  It appears to bypass our other spell limitations, like aggro and resists.<br />
3.  1+2 = good.<br />
<br />
Nobody is arguing that it isn't valuable. People are upset about how it was implemented, and what it means to play a shaman.<br />
<br />
As others have pointed out, as this is a buff, its going to bring with it the baggage of maintainence.  And if you don't know what that is, and how its different than a nuke... well, I guess you haven't played a shaman very long.<br />
<br />
We used to have active roles in healing and damage dealing.  Now we have a third active role in buffing.  Whether or not the net result of that new active role is good or poor dps, or is overall better or worse, is irrelevant.  <br />
<br />
The fact is, SOE added yet another way that shaman are the MOST pestered class in EQ today.  We are becoming less and less of an active force in a raid/group, and more and more of a support class ONLY.<br />
<br />
How would enchanters feel if they were given a 1 minute buff who's effect mezzed any mob who hit that player?<br />
<br />
How would a wizard feel if they were given a 1 minute buff who's effect was to nuke the mob for 5k if it hit the player?<br />
<br />
Whats it like to play a character where all you do is cast spells on PC rather than NPC characters?  Granted, this is just one spell, but what if the trend continues? <br />
<br />
Its not that the effect is any different than if we did the nuking ourself.  Its that it takes the active role out of our hands, and places it in anothers hands.  <br />
<br />
We might as well put slow, malos, heals, nukes, and dots as all buffs that can be triggered by other other classes right?  I mean, whats the difference?  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u218"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p218">&quot;My rule will be anybody that asks for this retarded POS will never get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aye, except, you'll be a considered a &quot;bad shaman&quot;.  This spell (from what we can tell about the limited parse logs above), does in fact seem to have a big effect.   <br />
<br />
How are you going to argue with your guild that you'd rather not increase 5 melee dps by 72 each for a 4-6 rounds? Especially on raid targets that are typically resisting most of our dots anyways?<br />
<br />
I doubt you'll win that argument.  Its no different than the FA parses/arguments (and the result of which was us getting champion), and the single casts of swift like the wind versus group alacrity that have reared their heads from time to time.  Remember the monk boards fuming over us shaman arguing that 10% more haste was retarded to mantain via single casts? And how boring and mana intensive it was?<br />
<br />
My answer, I guess, is to make sure this is the last POS I get out of the expansion.  After I have all the new focus, hp augs, etc.. then, maybe I'll get it.  And hopefully my guild melee will be none the wiser.  Otherwise it'll be pure hell with the /tells for panther.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">another problem with cast imbue type procs is the order they are in the buff bar. if this lands under the pally/sk self proc it only has a chance to go off if the self buff proc doesn't go off... this reduces the effectiveness of the spell and really just adds a minor head ache into buff organization for not only the shaman casting the spell, but the melee haveing it cast on them.<br />
someone already mentioned potential stacking issues with other proc buffs....<br />
I know that I can have a weapon proc and a buff proc go off at the same time.  I've had it happen.  1 swing, 2 procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">Weapon proc and buff proc, yes. Buff proc and buff proc, no, at least as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the bottom line is, as others have already said, that this spell is the most annoying version of low aggro shaman DPS they could have come up with. A low aggro chromatic resist DoT or nuke would work quite close to this buff, but all of the annoyance would vanish. There is not one reason to keep the spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The paladin in my parse was proccing his own self buff along with Leopard Maw, although his own buff wasn't going off as often as Maw. He seemed bowled over by the proc rate, although after showing him what it does to our pet... He was strongly of the opinion it'll get nerfed as now we've got the best pet in the game for DPS it's bound to upset all the necros, beastlords and mages!<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, the bottom line is, as others have already said, that this spell is the most annoying version of low aggro shaman DPS they could have come up with. <br />
We've already got two lines of nukes, fast casting weak poison ones and long casting cold ones. There's even a poison rain for variety.<br />
<br />
DoTs - again, long lasting disease, middle of the road poison and quick magic ones. There's not much room for expansion there, and if they'd given us &quot;Bane+25%&quot; as they did in Omens I'm sure people would have been moaning about how unoriginal they were.<br />
<br />
This is something brand new for our class and although I'm sure &quot;panther plz&quot; will get really annoying, hopefully once people see that it's best suited to pets rather than players that'll become less common.<br />
<br />
And last but not least, it gives us all a reason to use the wolf - I know he gets one-rounded in Riftseeker's, but now he'll proc 10 times a minute or more it's all the more incentive to watch positioning and the like!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u224"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p224">The spell itself looks fine, a proc spell is something I've been wanting for a long time.  There is however, two difficulties.<br />
A one minute duration is work, not fun.  I just dont know any other way to explain it.  We'll get used to it, just like we've gotten used to canni, fa, sltw, etc.  At the same time, we'll be hating it, thats just wrong.<br />
The other problem?  Well, silly as it sounds, its about player perception.  Just imagine how that tank will be crowing about his great dps.  Thats right, his dps, the shaman creating that dps is irrelevant.  I know this sounds petty, but just how many folks reading this have gotten terribly upset when things like this has happened in the past?  I can think of a couple times.  Was in an ldon a long time ago with an afk cleric.  Puller brought in a big overpull, and I chain healed through the whole fight.  At the end of the fight, the tank comments 'nice job on heals'.  Naturally, the cleric comes back from afk just in time to thank him and tell everyone what a great healer she was.  I've had similar experiences with enchanters mezzing mobs I've already root parked, then going on about how great they are.  This kind of thing is not a BIG deal, but it does detract from our enjoyment.<br />
And if someone spams me with tells for 'panther plz', they get /ignore.  Period.  I'll do it as I can mange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u225"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p225">The other difference between this one and a DoT is that if there aren't any mobs in the camp because of complications from the pull, you don't have to worry about 5 melee pestering you to cast the DoT just so that it is up &quot;in case&quot; the pull arives soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u226"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p226">What exactly is the difference between casting a dot on mob and casting a proc buff on something attacking a mob, the thing that makes one spell so incredibly annoying and inconvienent and the other not?

I can cast a nuke whenever I have the mana and time. I have to time a buff.<br />

<br />
Also a nuke does not do ten times more damage when you have a pet in the group (or ten times less if you don't, whichever way you prefer looking at it). And nukes do not get dispelled.<br />
Most of this applies to DoTs too. If they wanted shaman to have more low aggro DPS they should just modify the Bane line to be unresistable and to have no aggro-causing counters on it.<br />
<br />
And if it absolutely has to be in buff form make it a 1 hour pet buff. Added DPS, gives us more reasons to use the dog, no hassle at all and on top of that SOE does not have to worry about the effect of a shaman keeping the buff up on 15 pets on a raid.<br />
<br />
And before someone tells me about the awesome DPS potential of this spell again: Yes, it looks like a very powerful spell. It also looks like an extremely annoying spell however. And there is no reason for the annoyance. Guess what, if clerics get an instant click 100 HP heal item it would be powerful too - and many clerics would complain about the annoyance, and rightly so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The dot would be more fun. I have dot foci, I have invested AA into crit dots. I like to dot, I like to see the damage, I like to see the crits. It is fun for me. Buffing a melee to proc gives me no fun at all. <br />
<br />
I am not directly affecting the mob myself, this is a big deal to me. In the past, shaman were powerful against mobs, remember level 49 when our poison dot was pretty damn studly? <br />
<br />
When I'm in an exp group, I generally only have to dot one mob. I get messages when the dots are in affect, and a message when a dot wears off. <br />
<br />
In an exp group, I'll generally have 1-4 people who would benefit from this spell. This means, casting this spell on all the people would could benefit and then using some sort of timer to figure out when it wears off. I swear, if I hear 4 melees start screaming at the same second that panther wore off, I will start thinking about quitting this game.<br />
<br />
This doesn't matter to you at all, whether you hit a hotkey to dot or a hotkey to buff, you're not watching your shaman screen anyway - your shaman is a bot for your warrior. You will be playing your warrior and watching the fun procs, having a good time directly affecting the mob.</div></div><hr />

I was really hoping that that 1 minute duration on this would have been changed.  :mad: <br />
<br />
I mainly play a rogue, and play my Shaman for a break from the ordinary and the pure enjoyment of it.  Short duration buffs are not enjoyable for those who are casting buffs to make other people do the cool crits that evey player wants to see with their name attached to.<br />
<br />
for enjoyment &gt;&gt;&gt; crit backstab for 4465 = crit blast 2400.  It's good to see a nice big number from time to time, then emote a RaWR!!<br />

I am pleased with the indirect DPS that Shaman add to the battle.  However, I want to see Shaman deal more direct DPS, most of all, have more fun.</div></div><hr />

It is a pure hassle and if nothing else, I wish to god they'd fix it so we get a message when it wears off.  Make it so that it can be toggled on and off or whatever.<br />

They just upgraded him to duel wield so he has the best chance of getting a proc. I don't think the other pet classes can whine about it cause it is not our pet only, we can cast it on anyone, player or pet.

I believe I've heard many of the posters in this thread complain about buffs with effects &quot;so small that you have to parse to prove it does anything at all&quot;.  Well, here's a buff where any idiot can see a major effect.<br />

I'd rather have a spell that people WANT.  If they upped the base damage on &quot;Ice Age&quot; by 20% and gave it to us as DoN spell &quot;Cryo Blast&quot; -- do you think that would up your group desirability?  Would it have a material effect on your overall group contribution?<br />
<br />
I have discordant ice focus -- sometimes Ice Age crits just over 3k.  That's cool, and I love to see it.  If it were 20% better I could crit for 3600 or so ... which would make us ... the worst nuking class in the game, still.  (I think).  Other people wouldn't go &quot;Damn, Isazo has that sweet new Cryo Blast spell, lets get him because we need a wizard wannabe, sure his nuking still pretty much blows, but it blows 20% less now!&quot; -- the fact is they wouldn't say a damn thing at all about the (theoretical) new nuke spell.  Nobody would care, except the DPS Parsers.  People will care about the proc buff, they will want it, and in my book that's all good.<br />

I agree with that - if it were a 30 minute buff or a 20 minute buff or a 10 minute buff. This is a ONE minute buff, that people will scream to have on them during every fight.<br />
<br />
Normally on a pull, I malos, slow, sick dog dog, bane, pox pants, nuke nuke, reapply bane if necessary, assist heal if necessary. Do I do a ton of damage? No, do I feel like I contribute? Sure.<br />
<br />
With this new spell, it's going to look like: panther highest DPS on inc, malos, slow, panther all other melee, too late to cast any dots at all, nuke, start recasting panther on all DPS. UGH. It just sounds so ****ty and oppressive :(</div></div><hr />

Guess what? There is no reason whatsoever to not give us a spell to achieve the same DPS with no hassle at all. Panther need NOT be annoying. Yet it is. If you could have a pet buff, a nuke or a long term that lets you do the very same DPS would you still prefer the 1 minute buff?<br />

Your argument seems to be &quot;if I had to choose between 20 lazy DPS and 500 annoying DPS I would choose the annoying DPS&quot;. That is a silly argument however. Why can't we get 500 lazy DPS instead? I mean, obviously SOE is fine with us doing the kind of DPS that panther will produce. Why not give us the same DPS in a less annoying format?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u238"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p238">My response to the 'annoying' argument is this:  This spell is an augment to / replacement for our DPS spells on mobs, and it is not much more 'annoying' than casting those nuke / dot spells 2 times per mob.<br />
<br />
To me, doing F2-Cast, F3-Cast, F4-Cast, isn't substanitally more work than doing F8-Cast Cast Cast.<br />
<br />
In my mind the annoyance-factor is another way of saying &quot;time spent&quot;.  Time spent on casting Panther is time not spent on casting Sisslak / Yoppa / Whatever.  I'm probably giving the designers too much credit, but it is at least POSSIBLE that the buff can only be as good as it appears to be BECAUSE it will prevent us from using some of our other DPS spells due simply to casting time / encounter length issues.<br />
<br />
And in the end, that may be the BEST argument for &quot;why panther sucks&quot; -- because the NET effect of the spell on group DPS is negligble because were I not casting Panther I would be casting Sisslak, etc.  That's a good argument.  The argument of &quot;it's annoying to cast spells on players but it's fun to cast spells on mobs&quot; is at best personal preference.<br />

Last time I checked, mobs didn't beg for dots when they wore off after a lousy minute.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">It's funny how people think it doesn't matter how you contribute &quot;your&quot; damage.<br />
This buff is primarily going to up melee DPS, which is already absurdly high. Why up it even more? <br />
And don't ****ing tell me that Priests and Casters can melee too.<br />
<br />
Are Paladins or Monks getting buffs that up my DoT damage?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time I checked you only needed to cast Nihil once per mob and only when the mob was in camp. Are you going to start buffing your group when the mob is in the camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u244"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p244">Yes Just like you cast a dot once a mob is in camp...Dont get me wrong I would have rathered something esle in terms of dps but jsut trying to see the good out of it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u245"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p245">Hey Isazo,<br />
<br />
Lets just put all our spells as buffs.  <br />
<br />
Slow buff - duration 1min.  Any mob attacking the player is chromatically slowed 75%.<br />
<br />
Heal buff - duration 1min.  Any mob attacking the player triggers an ancestral direct heal for 2k+ focus.<br />
<br />
Malos buff - duration 1min.  Any mob attacking the player triggers a magical explosion that lowers the mobs resists by 55.<br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
Same effects right?  Who cares whether we have to cast them on an NPC or PC right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u246"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p246">That definitely gets rid of our agro problem Ung LOL....<br />
<br />
Of course that will also make my TA rather useless :P.</div></div><hr />

I've stated in this thread that I would have prefered a different implementation.<br />
<br />
Guess what?  I could choose to hate the spell too, but I pretty much play the hand I'm dealt.  I don't think the spell is the seed of all evil -- it's pretty good.  You hate it?  Use /feedback.  I doubt that will change the spell either but it has a better chance than directing sarcastic comments at me in this thread.<br />
<br />
I guess my glass is half-full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">What i think it boils down to is What does more DPS per mana spent.. buffing pets/melee or dotting/ nuking the mobs...I would need to see some parses on this new spell to determine if i will use it or jsut keep up with dots &amp; nukes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">&quot;I've stated in this thread that I would have prefered a different implementation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, hehe.  What are we all talking about then? /confused :)  <br />
I think that is what everyone is saying.<br />
<br />
Seems like the majority of argument was with the idea that this spell is 'no different than a nuke'.  That I'd argue with.  <br />
<br />
I guess, just being in raiding guild, where we have 1, and on good nights, 2 shaman during the raid, I'm really, REALLY not looking forward to having this in my arsenal.  Tedious.<br />
<br />
(Didn't intend my examples to be sarcastic, just examples of how this is most certainly not like a nuke, imo.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">Glass half full here too.  The shaman is a way fun class... I love getting into a rhythm of Malos, sic pet, Slow, Bane, Rain, canni a bit, new Bane/Rain as needed and done.  VP park adds, spot-heal, backup heal when needed.<br />
<br />
I do more CC than a cleric or druid.  I do more DPS than a cleric or enchanter, and sometimes even a mediocre knight.<br />
In easier camps, I can melee/tank and hold aggro for rogues and casters.  I can be MH if needed, and do sufficient CC when needed.  So in mid-range camps don't NEED a cleric or chanter.<br />
I can cruise many Old World zones easily, and help powerlevel lower classes.<br />
<br />
Shaman can pull with several tools, including the under-used pet pulling trick....panther gonna make that much easier... we are a jack of all trades that just got better.  My group desirability is awesome.  My only regret is not having better gear (max 5850 HP so far at 66), being in a family guild.  But I'm ok with being the Big Fish in the little pond.  I'm the Class Organization officer, and the many tips I give -- from targetting to assembling a good group to heal rotations to totally understanding and controlling aggro -- these all come from being an experienced shaman, and much info i owe to the Crucible here.<br />
<br />
Fun fun fun.  The shaman is a great class.<br />
Panther is a new tool in the arsenal for the bard-like, busy keyboarding shammy.  Yes it can be annoying.  I also get annoyed by WoS toons with bad attitudes....you know what....I ignore them and don't get caught in the drama... IGNORE.  Panther is my spell, my mana, my choice.  Doing a FA rotation is my choice.<br />
<br />
I don't need praise from other lesser classes saying that I'm doing awesome.  I know I am, and my fellow shaman know I am.  When I do get praise, its often from a well-skilled player who knows a good toon when he sees one.<br />
<br />
Panther is gonna be my creme-de-la-creme.  My treat to myself and my pup when I want to strut my uberness.  I already contribute greatly to a group, and the drool factor of Panther is gonna be something I hand out when I have the time and desire to do so.  I secretly want to be more a shaman tank, and this spell is a definite in that direction.  Too bad about taking away the HP buff, cuz it would have been a great heal tool as well.<br />
<br />
Annoyance.  I used to think having to cast Malos was an annoyance.  I'm sure many mediocre shaman think the same about canni.  Many might enjoy sitting on a mount and casting one or two spells a battle and seeing a big boom... nice thrill but boring to do for 2+ years IMO.  In the endgame, getting to 9k+ HP, maxxed defensive, healing, and damage AAs makes the shaman master of a few trades.  The DPS of casters, the fun of tanking, the blessing of healing and the need for pullers -- all this in one package, the almighty shaman.<br />
<br />
The potential is awesome...I will not trivialize and nitpick on a new gift that I will chose to use as I see fit.  My glass is half-full.<br />
Unfortunately Isazo, many minds are made up,  I realize a positive post is not going deter, and may simply draw more antagonistic replies.  Maybe one day I'll grow up and enter more endgame zones and find that my favorite class is gimped after all, and i will see the light that many here are fervently pointing out.  <br />
<br />
But atm all I see is aristocratic whining.  We are an elite class, and I prefer dignity and action on the field, rather than laying blame and nattering before a new spell even gets used.  I would love to see a 180 degree shift in opinion on the new spell a month from now.  Alas, good news and testimonials don't garner as much attention as an all-out hate thread does....lol<br />
<br />
Although I dont' randomly shout out in /ooc like i used to my 30's to 50's, here it is for old-times sake...<br />

Shammies Rock!<br />
