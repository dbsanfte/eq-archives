Nope, buckler is it</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moshka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont know about Defilers but I have in the secondry slot a &quot;Firwood Tome&quot; classed as a symbol, came from Stormhold lvl23 mob and item conns orange to me at 21. Not yet found a decent shield at all.<br />
<br />
Gives wisdom, Int stats plus a reasonable power bonus.<br />
<br />
Brings me onto the next subject, I group with 20th Crusader, 21 Swashy, 21 warden, 21 summoner and it appears with buffs up that I have both more power and hit points than the other classes without any major upgrades on equipment other than standard levelling quests, anyone know why we get so many HP?  Not that i am complaining.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Medium armour - race - buffs: I think Mosh - all give good hp boost - could just be guessing !!<br />
<br />
But I have grouped with tanks with lower hps and Ac than me :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And perhaps your companions had inferior gear as well.  I know that I have about half the HP of the Guardians I group with regularly.<br />

re:  Shields<br />
<br />
Yea - I had a tough time with Shields in my mid to late 20's.  Once you get to 30ish, there is a crafted shield - Briarwood Buckler - that gives really good defense and stats.  There is also a shield that drops in Nektropos Castle called an Oakwood Buckler that's really nice.  That may drop elsewhere as well, but mine came from NC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, at level 25, I had AQ6 gear.  The guardian that I group with regularly also had AQ6 gear.  I must say, that self-buffed, I was close his HP and beat him on AC.  <br />
<br />
That got him really pissed, because he spent the next few days farming stuff, and upgrading his gear.  Now at level 30, he's AC is about 2400 (and mine's about 1600), but his HP has outstipped mine by over 700.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moshka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the good info guys :)<br />
<br />
Working on the Aq quests at present which I believe have been pretty well put together by Sony. All classes in similar area, no camping for days and good gear upgrades to boot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It depends on your group makeup and what the people are using for concentration.  If the Shaman/Mystic/Defilier wants to buff themselves up with Auspice, and some of the other buffs, and not put on the group buffs, you will come reasonably close to some of the plate wearers.<br />
<br />
Thinks change in the middle 20's though.  That's when the AC and HP seems to kick in for the tanks.  However, we should still compete favorably to templars/inquisitors, and probably be ahead of druids/furys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another decent secondary item is the Bulwark of the Alchemist off a named Skeleton near the silk room in Tomb of Varsoon. (It's red to me, but I'll be able to wear it shortly after 30)<br />
<br />
I'll post stats from home later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Regarding hp/ac equal to a tanking class:<br />
<br />
Find a new tank or start hassling them.  There's absolutely no reason you should be even close to them if they're the same level.<br />
<br />
As far shields go however, I am very disappointed.  With the enormous variety of shields out there, I just naturally assumed that our skill would evolve from buckler to at the very least, round shield.  Using a symbol or a book is just insulting in my mind, and like you said sud, there really are no good options till 25-30.  I opted to go 2hander so I wouldn't feel so embarrassed running around with a symbol, dwarven staff of cleansing.<br />
<br />
That really needs fixed - there's no good reason why priests can at least use round shields.  Thanks for the replies guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Who can use round shields anyway ?<br />
<br />
I never see tanks using them . . . Mages can't . . . . Scouts?  That'd be awful silly if it's a Scout shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yep - my dirge uses a round shield when he solos.</div></div><hr />

Warriors/Guardians can use all shield types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just found an amazing shield for a level 30-40 shaman.  It's called the Guardians Aegis.<br />
<br />
Guardians Aegis: skill lvl 30-40 buckler<br />
197 shield factor @ 40<br />
11int, 13wis, 33health, 39power<br />
attuneable<br />
<br />
Was listed at 50gold the other night, and I would have bought it except I wasn't sure if I could quest it or if it was crafted.  In fact, I could find absolutely zero information about it.  Can anybody help me out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On a side note, though it's not a shield, I just looted a Bulward of the Overseer off a named mob in varsoons last night.<br />
<br />
level 28-33<br />
6int/wis, 28health, 16power<br />
<br />
Was quite pleased with myself and my guild for finally figuring out how to take down the encounter.  The named kept casting fear, which wasn't the obstacle.  Rather, it was the buggy walls we kept running thru into the next room.  Took us 3 tries before we finally pulled it off easily enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shiny Brass Shield (from the Zek Heritage quest) comes in a Buckler version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Merry?  You are from NC?<br />
<br />
Opps, should update my info I guess. Nope, I used to be in NC. I'm actually from Sweden. Worked in Greensboro, NC up until recently though.<br />
<br />
To the thread:<br />
<br />
I don't consider HP and AC to be vital for us. At later levels we don't take a beating all that well. Given a choice betweeen a totem or a shield I look at the stats and only if all else is equal do I pick the shield for its protection.</div></div><hr />
