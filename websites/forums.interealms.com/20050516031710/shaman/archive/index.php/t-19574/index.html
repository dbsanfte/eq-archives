<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jarcey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off im new to this board. I play a Shammy on the nameless server.<br />
When I first found out about this site I was excited to know that I had found a place to go and be w/my fellow shammies.... when the page loaded and I seen the banner on the page I thought o' lord what's this about. I wasnt here when the site was sold, I had no chance to donate to the site's fund.  /sigh<br />
 So of course I have read many of the very imformative post on the site, as well as seearching for a post about IGE/Yantis and the problems that plague EQ at this time.  I didn't see any, nor did I see a post about buying PP from them, just the banner.  I read where you guys have been getting rdy to submit info about class balancing for the shammy.<br />
Some great info there, some which I hope SOE does address.  I also read<br />
where some peeps felt like Brenlo and the dev team wouldnt stop by the site here and read about our concerns as a class.<br />
 I just left the shadowknight.org site and they have a post going on over there <br />
http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=19750<br />
and thought perhaps some of you would be interested in reading that.<br />
 Its now time for me to copy/paste my lil message I have been posting on The Nameless's guild's boards this morning.<br />
<br />
 Not trying to start any arguments or flames here.  I'm sure<br />
some of you have noticed a change in prices in the baz.<br />
Some items that where as low as 16-19k pp on The <br />
Nameless server went as high as 80k pp. When I first heard<br />
of price changes in the baz I really thought nothing of it.<br />
As I rarely have over 2k pp in the bank. Then I came across<br />
some disturbing information in the EQ communities about <br />
PP being duped, lvl 65 chars w/300 aa's being made in a day<br />
or two.  SOE acted on these issue's and banned accounts<br />
that they found in violation.  I thought how could SOE <br />
allow this to happen.  I've read the conspirecy stories about <br />
SOE, and IGE/Yantis.  To be honest I cant say why SOE <br />
hasnt acted to stop this blatant disregard for the EULA. <br />
<br />
Borrowed from http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section<br />
/newsview.jsp?story=60634 <br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Smed, what is your position on the Yantis/IGE issue? <br />
&lt;Smed&gt; We have made our position on this issue very clear <br />
&lt;Smed&gt; we don't endorse the idea of selling items or characters <br />
&lt;Smed&gt; it's a violation of our EULA and more importantly <br />
it's not in keeping with the sprit of EverQuest <br />
&lt;Smed&gt; We are looking into this further and but don't expect <br />
us to go this way with EverQuest <br />
&lt;Smed&gt; and no, we do NOT condone it <br />
<br />
So of course I continue to read the articles and follow links <br />
to this page and that page.<br />
 I'm not saying any of you do, have, or will buy PP from<br />
IGE/Yantis. I for one never have and never will. I might <br />
spend 2 or 3 days camping geo's, killing hg's or even those<br />
stupid rockhoppers, but I will never spend one hard earned<br />
American dollar for PP in game.  Because its just that a <br />
game. <br />
  Sadly I've had lvl 20 peeps come up too my SHD, and LOL<br />
at me because of my gear. All I can say to them is every<br />
piece of gear on my chars are quest/drop/ or bought with <br />
PP earned in the game, and while my chars my not have <br />
the best gear there is available, Im happy to play my chars. <br />
the way I do. I know from first hand experience that gear <br />
makes a huge difference in EQ. My rl friend loaned me some <br />
gear for my SHD here awhile back. Well my highest 2hs hit <br />
was right around 150 dmg my average hits around 70 dmg.  <br />
With the gear he loaned me I started hitting for 224 quit<br />
regulary and my avg went up to around 140, so it doubled.  <br />
There's lots of items I see in the BAZ that I would love to <br />
have for my char's. Even spells I'm that are missing from my<br />
spellbooks. <br />
 This link will take you to what I feel is perhaps one of the<br />
best and imformative on the issue's... plus you can follow<br />
the link to the safehouse forums. Which also has lots of <br />
insight to the problems.<br />

<br />
 I understand a person wanting to have better gear, and <br />
spells, but I feel that this type of behavior, and the fact that<br />
thus far SOE has turned and looked in the other direction.<br />
We as players of this game have some say, but we must all<br />
decide which side of fence we stand on, and if your on the<br />
same side as me then we need unite and let SOE know that<br />
we dont condone this kinda behavior and that they must act<br />
to stop IGE/Yantis from destroying the game we all know <br />
and love. So voice your opinion.<br />

<br />
Sites like Yantis and Player auctions actually help SoE's profits.  Think about it 1000's of accounts that other wise would have been canceled sold off and kept active.  Orginal thought by SoE is that these sites would detract fromt he game, meaning if people only want money for Items then the in game economy poofs.  But this hasn't beent he case at all.  The biggest seller on these sites is platinum, making the sites more of an exchange rate rather than something that drains the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The United States government doesn't have complete control over the borders of its own territory.  Thus contra ban can be smuggled into the country.  Sony, on the other hand does have near complete authority over what goes on under their roof.  The fact is, this problem is just coming onto the radar of most players.  We, as a community, are finally beginning to express our disatisfaction loudly enough for SOE to take note.  Sony has the means to stop this, but its going to take some hard nose policy changes that will alienate some of the consumer base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, IGE and Yantis advertise right in front of everyone's faces the fact that they buy and sell accounts, items and plat, Sony huffs and puffs about its EULA and does nothing. <br />

Sony looks inept.<br />

Obviously thay have had their inhouse lawyers look at this problem and decided its not worth it to try and make a legal issue out of it.<br />

- If SOE wanted, they could do something easy. Unfortunately SOE no longer cares about the integrity of the game. They could have GMs go &quot;buy&quot; from IGE and Co, and then start tracing items back from whom they came ... and then crack open the can of ban'arse. Ban everyone who was involved. <br />
<br />
The US doesn't have (Yet) an ID (sorta of major database) on every citizen, on every piece of drug but SOE does have an item ID on pretty much everything but stackables. And with a bit of detective work, they could easily crack down very hard on IGE. Even stackable items can be traced. SOE has proved it very well in the past that they have the tools to track down exploiters ... but today they are unwilling to use those tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jarcey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Supply and demand...<br />
HMMMZ<br />
So basically if I and not IGE/Yantis had control of say 1 billion pp on my server and sold it for real $... but in the mean time i used 500 mil pp to buy all the higher end droppable gear in the baz and set up a vendor to sell my gear and everytime i seen someone selling say a windblade for under 50k pp i bought it... cuz my vendor only sells it for 90k... there for im dictating the price's of gear in baz... Tell me that you havent noticed the prices in baz going sky high? Well what better why for me to sell my dupped pp that i transfered to chars and allowed the accounts expire b4 SOE banned those accounts. So now i get a game card and reactivate those accounts w/ Billions of pp, I now have the markets in Baz so that you causual everyday player can no longer think of buying half decent gear, said player isnt in a uba guild that raids 6 nites a week.<br />
What really surprises me is you guys seem to be ok w/ sleeping with the Devil or playing his advocate.<br />
 I personally think that if you control the prices in baz... are selling pp then your not helping the game in way shape or form.  Sony either has to act on this, or this will be the end of this game being a game.<br />
Think about back in the day playing Diablo... Was a decent fun game untill one day lvl 1's had uba gear and could go kill anything in the game.<br />
Perhaps thats what you want from EQ, I how ever dont.<br />
I will probably end up giving all my gear to ingame friends or guildies<br />
and allowing EQ to delete my chars, I know im not the only one that will prolly do this. As I'm sure im not the only one that will not move on too<br />
EQII.<br />
 Then there's the thought that IGE/Yantis is owned and operatied bye SOE. /boggle   Either way i feel that we as customers to SOE should have some word from them about the situation. They say they dont condone it, but yet forced ebay to stop what they where doing at the time. So if they continue to allow IGE/Yantis or any other player auction sites to stay in business then perhaps it is the end of EQ and the begining's of EQII... what better way to get a fan/customer base.<br />
 /shrug...... the hell if i know what im going to end up doing, but personally i think its bs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Do you have a link to a news article about that lawsuit? I failed to find any reliable sources for it on google. I'm interested in reading that. Also Everquest, like all service providers is under no obligation to provider you with service. They can simply refund what is left of your payment and cancel your account.<br />
<br />
When I worked for an ISP we canceled a porn sites service, our terms of service did not allow adult content, and we had the right to cancel a account for any reason. We were sued and we won. A buisness does not have to serve you.<br />
<br />
Not to mention they could simply quote user security and billing concerns to the judge for selling of accounts. I bet they have a few hundred documented cases of a guy buying an account and getting ripped off because he didn't change the password asap after buying.<br />
<br />
Also, kind of a side thought, would you really want to go up against sony's legal department? Especially with rumor's that IGE is hacking the plat, sony could get DCMA warrents and take all IGE's computers under the pretense of stealing or modifying/cracking encryption or even breaking into their systems. I'm sure theirs lots of charges that could be faked up just to cost money and be an ass. Although IANAL.</div></div><hr />

If you are refering to the incident I think you are, there are some minor issues you are missing :<br />
1)Said suit took place in China.<br />
2)Plaintif was an individual chinese citizen, not an American (either an individual or a corporation).<br />
<br />
Since neither Yantis or IGE are located in China nor is Sony Online Enterainment, there is little risk that such a case would take place in China and as such the precident of that case would not apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jarcey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
 You might remember someone's post awhile back explaining that there were dupes inflating bazaar prices in the game.<br />
<br />
You might remember that shortly after this, SOE patched and posted they were working actively on fixing the problems.<br />
<br />
You might remember that after this, things seemed to stabilize for awhile. Prices in the bazaar started to become more reasonable so that players could actually begin to buy some toys without being forced to buy duplicated or exploited platinum from Yantis or exploiting it themselves. I mean, let's be serious here. 150,000 platinum or more for ornate armors? A normal player will never be able to afford that. 500,000 Platinum or more for a white dragon helm? Same problem.<br />
<br />
Now, you may have noticed that again, prices are increasing in the bazaar to insane levels. Ornate is again up there at 150,000 + for the pieces that anyone wants. The cool items are again running way too high on the pricing end.<br />
<br />
Enter in two new issues. I will not explain details of where or how to get anything in this post. I will explain the problem, though.<br />
<br />
Number one, as most know that have read other various posts on the issue and online news sites. IGE and My supersales have merged. Each side used to combat eachother on platinum prices for real world money. Each side's main opponent was the other. Now, they have no competition, and thus the only hurdle is how to control the platinum market.<br />
<br />
Platinum for real life sales is controlled by supply and demand like any other market. Supply here is simple. IGE and My supersales has a dedicated team of professionals specifically employed to hack, crack, cheat, dupe and macro. Basically their job is to find any and all ways to get excessive amounts of platinum easily or for free using loopholes or bugs in the game. These are paid individuals hired specifically to, in essence, cheat YOU.<br />
<br />
Look at My supersales offering level 1 to 65 and 300 AA in 24 hours some time ago. They yanked this when customer accounts were getting banned and people were issuing complaints when their $1500 purchase was deleted overnight, and sometimes their main characters as well if registered on the same credit card. Remember the post by SOE and the patch that fixed this?<br />
<br />
Look at My supersales listing up billions of platinum on every server while simultaneously refusing to buy platinum from anyone. Remember the post by SOE and the patch that fixed this?<br />
<br />
It has reached that point again. The prices IGE and My supersales pay for platinum is extremely low, and they say they are &quot;full&quot; when you try to sell to them in quantity.<br />
<br />
They have an unlimited supply line. Dupe or macro or exploit or whatever, that platinum they have is &quot;free.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was rumor posted by another individual here, saying that my supersales had received thousands of free EQ accounts through Ubisoft. They give out free trial accounts to any email address. Yahoo, hotmail, etc. When the last dupe was in they banked millions on every account and let them expire. When SOE banned off the exploited platinum, these expired accounts were not checked, and now when platinum is needed they are renewed for $15 and the plat is pulled from them for use or sale.<br />
<br />
Because whatever plat they get, and how they get it is free, they can price it extremely low. Low enough to push out remaining competition for them, unless that competition has access to the same exploits.<br />
<br />
But there's a problem. People only need so much platinum. Now, it does no good for IGE or My supersales if their plat is priced extremely low so people can buy alot cheaply, because that just means the customer will be able to buy all the stuff they want faster.<br />
<br />
So they need:<br />
<br />
More customers.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
In game inflation on items.<br />
<br />
<br />
More customers is way too hard to control. But in game inflation, for an entity with access to ulimited free currency, is very very EASY to control.<br />
<br />
So, number two,<br />
<br />
There is a program out there currently that does the following:<br />
<br />
You set up a character in the bazaar and set price points for items you want to buy. So... I want to buy all white dragon helms that are up for 300k or less.<br />
<br />
I set this program to white dragon helms for 300k or less and when someone puts one up for sale for, say, 275k, it warps right to the vendor, buys the item, and continues searching. The program runs 100% free of human interaction, so all that is needed is one person to restock the plat on the characters when it becomes low (it will even make the PC beep when it is low).<br />
<br />
You can set it to search for anything. You can make a list of 5,000 things and it will search for them.<br />
<br />
What happens is any item they put in this program fixes the price at whatever they put it at. Since within SECONDS it will buy anything put up for less than their fixed price.<br />
<br />
---HERE YOU HAVE INFLATION 100% CONTROLLED BY THE PEOPLE WITH ACESS TO THIS PROGRAM AND ACESS TO THE UNLIMITED PLATINUM---<br />
<br />
The program exists. EQecon.com uses a similar one to find all server prices for their site. You can't get the program from them. I merely list it here for an example of a legit site that uses the basics of the program for non detrimental means to prove it exists. And I know IGE and My supersales will have people come here and post up that all this inflation is due to Lost Dungeons of Norrath. Please, the playerbase is far more intelligent than that.<br />
<br />
If they have unlimited plat, and this program, why don't they just buy ALL high level items that show up in the bazaar? Items are a hard sell and platinum is an easy sell. Price fixing causes people to NEED more platinum, increasing their sales. If they bought up all high level items there would be no need for people to buy platinum from them, as people would have nothing to spend it on. It would also make it glaringly obvious, and they get enough bad attention, and likely do not want more or do not want this thing getting nerfed.<br />
<br />
Why do they only control the high end prices? Simple, that is what people buy plat from them to buy in game. People don't buy 500,000 platinum from them to go in and buy a bunch of 2,000 plat value items. They want the things that are 100,000 +. They are, to put it bluntly, screwing people who do not buy plat from them, but ALSO screwing people who do buy plat from them, forcing them to buy more and more.<br />
<br />
The end result here, is total control by IGE and My supersales on the in game economy. TOTAL. And it will continue until it is stopped. The prices on in game items will keep going up a little bit at a time as they artificially raise. In the last couple of weeks ornate and other high end prices have gone up 80% or so. Expect more of the same as long as this is allowed to go on.<br />
<br />
Your game, your enjoyment, your fun, is being controlled by these individuals. At the moment the in game economy is controlled more by them than by all the players and SOE combined.<br />
<br />
It is possible SOE does not even know about this. Or if they do they are not doing anything about it because the players do not know and are not complaining.<br />
<br />
Now you know. If you do not care, that's fine. If you do care, tell a friend and tell the makers of Everquest you want this stuff fixed.<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
Cliff notes:<br />
IGE (now with added Yantis!) is using their monopoly position to basically control the EQ economy for their benefit by reactivating (currently inactive) accounts full of duped/macroed plat, and using that plat + a macro-type program to buy up high end gear in the bazaar cheap and sell it expensive, with nobody behind the controls - i.e. price fixing of the high end gear + controlling the plat/$ market = profit!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tjorvi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So I used to play EQ, but I quit a while ago.  Sold my account to Yantis (got $100...not too shaby).  But I thought I should all let you know something that I found out about.<br />
<br />
There is a way to create platinum instantly (like 450,000pp, supposedly if you create the more you character gets an automatic flag) and there are people who exploit this and make TONS of real cold hard cash by selling it to people like Yantis.  I might also add that Yantis KNOWS how these people acquire their PP and gives them special deals.  The scary thing is that Yantis owns like all of the external EQ vending commerce so he basically dictates how strong or weak the EQ economy is.  This guy is the virtual Greenspan of the Norrath...What makes this whole thing even worse is that Sony knows about it but can only ban these illegal accounts and try to fix the bug, but each time they fix it these guys figure out a way around it.<br />
<br />
Yeah so thats like all I know...oh and don't even think about asking me for the code...that code is worth like a **** load and there is no way in hell this guy would let me get my hands on it<br />
<br />
P.S. I have seen him create this PP with my own eyes...the whole thing takes less than 5 minutes...i was shocked to say the least...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i read about this on allah's and thought it was pretty interesting. a lot of people seem to really underestimate just how big of a problem this is and think that soe is just looking the other way. i find that pretty hard to believe though.<br />
<br />
the problem is that the damage is already done. there's more than likely already a nearly unlimited supply of duped money spread out over scads and scads and scads of accounts, so staying ahead on those bugs isn't really going to do anything. with the ammount of time all that money would last, it would be pretty easy for pros to come up with something new.<br />
<br />
if there wasn't already a game breaking ammount of money in existance, there'd be no reason to fool around with bots jacking stuff up in the bazaar. there's so much that the only way to keep it selling is by lowering its value. <br />
<br />
banning bazaar sniffers doesn't really do anything because they're not there to make plat. they're there to keep the dollar value of plat up. soe could knock out a bunch of bots loaded to the brim with cash, but it doesn't hurt the hack crew because they've already got more than they could ever sell, and the items bought by the bots aren't restored at their original price. as long as the prices are high, they can still sell their duped money.<br />
<br />
the only way i could see around it is goobering up their bots with bots of their own. its really easy to see what items are on the sniff list, so you could just flood them and bleed 'em dry one at a time. <br />
<br />
of course, that's all assuming this stuff is actually true. i'm not &quot;in the know&quot;. i just kill stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Unfortunatly the best we may be able to do is draw the line at people trying to sell items for RL cash in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
You see people trying to sell their accounts and items though the bazaar, berate and petition.  Its bout all I can think of, but at least ldon armor can't be sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It starts here <br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/ <br />
where it then links <br />
http://www.goberserker.com/ <br />
which is hosted by <br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/ <br />
who is supported by<br />
http://www.ige.com/<br />
<br />
Sony links every class board under Community&gt;Links on its front page<br />
<br />
But high lighting a the top of the screen is going alittle far.  There are two other berserker message boards, both off to a very good clean start.  But why does sony support this paticular one with the IGE banners on it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoE does list those on a First Come First Served base.<br />
They do not look at the amount of support, traffic or the adds on the board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Halmah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you are refering to the incident I think you are, there are some minor issues you are missing :<br />
1)Said suit took place in China.<br />
2)Plaintif was an individual chinese citizen, not an American (either an individual or a corporation).<br />
<br />
Since neither Yantis or IGE are located in China nor is Sony Online Enterainment, there is little risk that such a case would take place in China and as such the precident of that case would not apply.<br />
<br />
I believe Yantis was just bought out by IGE for a reported 9 million dollars.  Yantis was based out of Florida......IGE....based out of Hong Kong....so yes one is a chinese firm<br />
