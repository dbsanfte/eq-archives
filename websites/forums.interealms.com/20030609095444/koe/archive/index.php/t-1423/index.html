I'm gonna list these on Allakhazam's shortly for the first price listed - second price is for KoE members and personal friends, either of whom would get priority.  Nolani has first right of refusal for the Bone Club of the Garou, and if I do sell it out-of-guild the procedes will go to the guild coffers, since it was a gift from her.  (Sorry hon, it just doesn't make sense for me to use a weapon anymore.. and it turns out I've got a NODROP +WIS weapon in the bank for CR).  The Lumi staff was bought from a guildie, but I don't recall exactly how much was exchanged (if you do please remind me!)<br />
<br />
Anyhoo..<br />
<br />
Ykeshan War Club - 3K (2500 = what I paid for it)<br />
Bone Club of the Garou - 8K (free)<br />
Velium Etched Stone Mace - 500 (free)<br />
Sentient Gauntlets - 500 (free)<br />
<br />
I'm looking at some truly gargantuan purchase (Sarnak Battle or Lodizal Shell Shield), thus the interest in raising funds.  Lumi Staff is still very useful to me, but some high end AC/resist item would be moreso.  Just wanted to give guildies a shot at it first.  Thanks,<br />

He could also use the Luminescent staff, I suppose but you then lose the ability to keep any other wisdom item in your hands. Now this may not be a big deal for a smartypants wise druid like Timbo, but half-elves are known more for their looks than their base stats. Like the old saying goes, I guess there's a price to be paid for having hairless feet.<br />
