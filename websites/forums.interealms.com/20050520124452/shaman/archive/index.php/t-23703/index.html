Anyone have the new spells yet?  If so, where did you buy/loot it(them) from?<br />
<br />
How is the experience?<br />
<br />
Anyone level 67 yet?  Where did you level and how much exp did you get per kill?<br />
<br />
Gaaah!  I'm dieing here.  Someone throw me a bone :(</div></div><hr />

Guildmates had been XPing in Kod'Taz for hours and I think the most anyong had gained was 7% EXP in 2-4 hours time.  Word has it that at 90% EXP and 10% AAXP, your aaxp bar fills much faster than the EXP bar.<br />
<br />
Looks like 66-70 are going to be some really delightful hell levels.  I doubt we'll see anyone thats 67 for at least a day or two minimum.<br />
<br />
Spells are dropped via mobs, and the only purchasable spells are in I thinkAbysmal sea.  Those spells being the druid/wizzy ports to Barindu for around 360plat. Yay.</div></div><hr />

Screw that, if that is true, the amount of exp needed is way too rediculous.  I am not about to grind 5 levels on my magician at one level per 6 months in non elemental zones.  Maybe OoW zones give better exp than KT/EPs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't explore much, but my Bard buddy said the entry level OoW zones had mobs conning lower than entry level GoD zones (ferubi, barindu, whatever).<br />
<br />
I was in a Vxed charm group, just for a little XP; Chanter, Bard, me, and a guild Ranger; Cleric was too low to zone in :(  Split four ways, even considering the Ranger was like 62 or something, it was about eight kills to get a full percentage into 67.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's gonna be a slow grind. Look for people to be farming XP for hours on end; good thing the GoD trials are instanced. <br />
<br />
Note: if doing GoD trials now, someone has to remain 65 to con the mobs!!!</div></div><hr />

I submitted several feedbacks in beta and even sent some e-mails telling them what was wrong with the task system, I'm hoping they just didn't get the feedbacks in time to make changes to the system.  The rewards are...well, they suck, and the tasks require you to do things that may be impossible or bad for your character (if you want to keep up Chardok faction).  I was only able to get Tasks from the Dreadlands with the 2 characters I tried them with...and it's just a pain for now unless they make some changes.</div></div><hr />

After i stepped into the dinning hall was giving the next part of the task to kill 10 flamemasters. <br />

Says the insurgents are rising fast and to take the raven to the ravens nest and kill 10 flamemasters. After that it says i can retire from being red beetle or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And sorry to hear about the hard grind :(<br />
<br />
I did 2 tasks with my 18 warrior in East Commons..........<br />
<br />
Started off in Rivervale talking to the taskmaster in the bar as Im a Halfling and I thought you had to start in your hometown (I dont think you do now).<br />
<br />
Taskmaster in Rivervale told me to go talk to either some peeps in East Commonlands or some peeps in PoK.<br />
<br />
After talking to some peeps in the tower sections of PoK, that particular taskmaster then gave me the option of talking to other taskmasters in about 7 different zones (ranging from Butcherblock,the Swamp of No Hope, Rathe Mountains, Karanas- I didnt have to go to all of these zones though, just one).<br />
<br />
I then chose to go to Butcherblock and the taskmaster there gave me the choice of 3 tasks that revolved around Dagnors Cauldron.  <br />
<br />
Can an 18 warrior solo the orc camp in Dagnor's?  I decided not to go there and instead went to talk a taskmaster in East Commons.<br />
<br />
*NOTE* This is where I have a question about the system.....does the system automatically take your level into account or is each zone going to have set level tasks? (i.e Butcherblock will always be 22-26, east Commnons 8-20, etc)<br />
<br />
The tasks I did all had 3 parts to them and I was rewarded about 15-18% exp and 3.5 plat after completing the whole thing.<br />
The taskmaster in East Commons gave me the option of 3 &quot;short&quot; tasks which all had to do with running to the undead tower in West Commonlands and &quot;searching for maps there&quot;.  All I did was train the undead outa there to the guards since I didnt feel like soloing them all.  After I walked inside the tower the same type of yellow script you see when you complete a LDoN poped up and said &quot;success&quot; or something like that.  The next part of the task told me to &quot;go search the well in Befallen&quot;.  $%^&amp; that.  As you all know that have been playing this game a long time, the well in Befallen is an icon of this game and has probably made a few people quit as they have such a hard time getting their corpse (at least in the old days).<br />
<br />
I did another task in East Commons that had me run to the undead pillars, run to another inn in East Commons, and finally to an inn in West Commonlands.  Same reward as I described above.  Took me about 20 mins.<br />
<br />
I applaud SOE for implementing the task system as they seem to be trying to satisfy the casual gamer who seems to be becoming the minority (not that I care one way or the other).  Ive only done 2 so I cant really draw any conclusions but so far, all its really doing is making you RUN yer arse off to long and forgotten zones.  When I was in PoK the taskmaster gave me options to hail other taskmasters in zones Ive totally forgotten about (Swamp of No Hope) so all of you that worship days past may like it.  <br />
<br />
Dont get your hopes and expectations ups though as I mentioned earlier, all I did was run from here to there.<br />

Just to give you an idea of exp pace...Clearing from zi to &quot;safespot&quot; in Qvic gave 6% exp on lvl 66 and took about 45 mins from our group....and then servers went down and me to bed...<br />
<br />
So...I would say it is doable :) Tho have to say 10-12 hours/lvl is a lot.<br />

 I figure it will  be the non raiders leveling faster, Unless the Raiders guild calls off raids untill everyone is 70, Raiders will spend most of their time in Raids (which sucks for XP)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well my group of friends started off the day in PoFire in what we call C2 (the castle with Reparm, AMY, and tables). Xp was a big slowdown when we dinged 66, but didn't seem too bad. Then about 50 other people decided to come try it out, so we were sitting around waiting for mobs to pop. After that we took off to try to find a &quot;sweet spot&quot; in OoW, but had no luck. We tried xp'ing in Wall of Slaughter and it was pretty bad compared to PoF. Also headed to Proving grounds, and it wasn't much better. Mobs are WAY too spread out and not enough of them. We tried one of the trails there and it was......interesting. After this we decided to head back to PoF and hope it had died down since it was getting late. It was still pretty packed but I dinged 67 and decided to call it a night. With exploring and all it took about 10 hours to ding 67, and its slowed down even more now =\ Looks like a long painful few days to come.<br />
<br />
Edit: Btw, I don't know if it means much to you, but out of the 10ish lvl 67's on Sol Ro when I logged, every single one of them were in PoFire. So I'm guessing that is the best place to be.</div></div><hr />

Seems that Fire is the route to go.  I may also give Ikkinz or KT a try as well.<br />
<br />
I'll post my results tomorrow..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Got our group together by 5:00 pst and we were in Walls of Slaughter by 5:30.  It was an easy run with invis and basically we were just exploring. <br />
<br />
Pulled a couple of the mobs closest to zin, then decided to branch out. Had a ranger with us that tracked a yellow named, so we all moved to the middle of the zone, halfway between Noble's Causeway and The Proving Grounds.<br />
<br />
Sat on a small mounded hill in the middle of the zone, and never saw a roamer in 4.5 hours.<br />
<br />
Group was SK, Shaman, Cleric, Enchanter, Warrior and Ranger. SK pulled, and in the 4.5 hours, this was the result ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Some horrid pathing, so be wary.  Once you learn it, very easily controlled.  Watch out for those nightmare pikachu things (for the life of me can't remember the name but when you see them you will know what I mean).  Once pulled they came into camp at locomotion speed.  They were unbelievably quick.<br />
<br />
Fast respawns.  We had 4 named that surrounded us ... and I think we killed them all 4 to 5 times.  Two of them conned red to 66, two conned yellow.<br />
<br />
We picked up 1 minor rune, 2 lesser runes and 2 normal runes - which turned out to be the spells for levels 66, 67 and 68 respectfully.<br />
<br />
I left with almost 1 yellow bub completed into 66.  So I wasn't horribly unhappy.<br />
<br />
We looted one attunable plate pauldrons item, that was an upgrade for the SK ...  Still trying to figure out this thing.<br />
<br />
Other loots included Plate boots (cleric upgrade)  and alot of silk bracer things (like 4 of those puppies).<br />
<br />
Our first death was from the pathing ...  Sk fd'd but the named pathed back to us to reset.  That was a surprize.  The only other death was when fd failed for the SK.  <br />
<br />
All in all, it was an easy night.  As a shaman I never saw any armor that was an upgrade for me, but the spell drops had my jaw on the floor.<br />
<br />
The cons were a few dark blue, but most even, some yellow and only nameds were red.  There was one named (Cyperion) that a small raiding party was trying to take out - this mob handed them their heads.<br />
<br />
Will probably go back tomorrow night and try this again just to see if the runes still drop like that.  If it is camped, we will head to the next zone Proving Grounds.  Some of the drops from there that were linked looked downright tasty.<br />

Saw Ancient as a title and thought what the hey - I am a 55 year old female - that is perfect.  Then decided naaaa ...  Turned on shadows. lag hit me ... and everything got turned off.  So decided a title wasn't that important anyway if I couldn't see it : )</div></div><hr />

Had a group in the Catacombs (instanced group thing...was like a normal LDoN wth respawns in terms of difficulty) and the XP was much much better than where we had tried prior to that (Fire, Yxxta, KT [which is a freakin zoo now btw]).<br />
<br />
Three runes, 1/4 of a level and about 2k plat later, I'm posting this :p<br />
<br />
So far I like OoW! Though I haven't tried the task system. The mobs are in a nice comfy spot between GoD &quot;gone in 30 seconds&quot; HP and Luclin &quot;is it over yet?&quot; HP, so I was able to use BoS and Bane to their full potential.  They seemed to have pretty big aggro radii, too, so watch for that.<br />
<br />
Just a few notes!<br />
<br />
Oh oh..and for rune turn ins!!<br />
<br />
He's a red con dragon guy in Dranik's Scar, Karsor the Mad...loc: (-1684), (-50).  Its the SW part of the zone, and he's sort of hidden behind a tree so you can miss him on your first go-round. His text is funny, take a min to read it! He reall is mad hehe...I spent a little time standing next to him after linking my spell in /gu etc, when he suddenly says, &quot;You filthy little Vah Shir.&quot;  I was cracking up!! hehe<br />

That's all I got for now!! It's way past my bedtime!<br />

Doesnt anyone remember how bad the XP went in places like PoN and POD once you broke 62ish? How you basically HAD to penetrate BoT to get any real XP? An AA = amount of XP it takes to get from 51-52, or so, according to most reports. I did my &quot;fill lvl 65 bar&quot; mostly in PoFire and Tipt, and it sure wasnt &quot;fast&quot;, not even 1% per kill in the regular bar. <br />
<br />
I am sure OoW has zones that will be better XP than places like BoT and Tactics, but if people arent going to go find them, then I really dont wanna hear how sucky the XP is at 66 in the mediocre 65 zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And maybe others that cant schedule large blocks of several hours EQ-time each day dont wanna hear how they have to change their life so they can get good exp?<br />
<br />
Just because PoFire or KT or whatever zone is in the game doesnt mean everyone will/can get access to it.<br />
<br />
But dont get me wrong - I dont really care anymore whether exp is slow or not. I know I will leave when WoW is released and there is no chance in hell I will be able to &quot;finish EQ&quot; before that anyway. So I am just doing what I enjoy now and when I stop enjoying it I will stop.<br />

I didnt even buy the expansion as soon or before it was released - thats a first in many many years :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">No kidding lol. The exp grind is not that bad people...just means you actually have to play. So instead of gathering 3-4 AA's a night or exp session for a while you are going to be getting 2-3 yellows or 1 level if your really motivated. Its all yellow text no matter what.<br />
<br />
I heard some people leaving AA on for 10 percent and Level on at 90. I personally never do that ..you dont know what Sony has for a formula for that it surely isnt as straight forward as it appears but somewhere I think you get screwed doing it that way. I go 100 percent AA or 100 percent Level exp.<br />
<br />
<br />
I started off in Kod Taz with a group. There was 55-70 people in Kod..was a freaking ZOOOOO. Pulls were slow and long at that to find one. Exp was so so. Then we headed off to Yxtta. I really thought the exp was rolling in here but our group had a weak in gear tank and the cleric had died once with no KEI/VOQ so ended up slowing down again. At this time we decided screw it and headed to POE. Amazing enough with low risk of death and constant 2-3 mobs in camp..burnt through a yellow in 66 pretty damn fast..under 2 hours for sure.<br />
<br />
I logged at half way into 66 with about 5-6 hours of steady grinding, few CR, and some moving around. I am not concerned about being the first lvl 70 so exp'ing to me is not a problem.<br />

<br />
Even if its perfect split, you only delay either goal (AA or Levels) by splitting.  If you want to level, go 100% level, if you want AA's go 100% AA, splitting up only delays both.  Going full in either allows you to gain improvements (AA or Levels) at a faster rate thus increasing the rate at which you can gain more xp.</div></div><hr />

That's 16.875 for us iksar . . . and it's only gonna get worse.  :(<br />

Sounds about right.  I spent about 14 hours online yesterday, about 12 hours of it doing xp.  I got all of 66 done and 8% of 67.  In that amount of time I would have made about 14 AA for the zone I was in (mostly KT) with the group I had.  Done this type of stretch before (usually only 8-10 hours) and its about right.  67 is definately slower than 66, appears to be about 10% more xp needed in 67 than 66.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">&quot;Casual&quot; player here. I don't have access to alot of the uber exp zones everyone is chatting about above, Best I can get into is SolRo. I did do a little prep for OoW so my first kill last night would ding me 66.<br />
<br />
I did the patch last night, bought OoW, but didn't patch OoW (I'm on dialup at home so I'm downloading it today while I'm at work).  I put up LFG in hopes of picking up a SolRo group but no takers. Best I could do was a BoT group in the area my server calls sbot. First kill did in fact ding me 66. Then it just went down the crapper. We cleared sbot 2 times before i saw my first percent of exp in 66 (I'd say approximatly 20-25 mobs). I hung out for one more clearing of sbot and bailed for the night a little discouraged.<br />
<br />
I figure I sould have the OoW expansion downloaded by tonight and I'll LFG for only SolRo GoD and OoW. I'd say you won't see very many people doing the grind 66-70 in BoT, it would just suck. And for those of us that aren't elemental or higher tier GoD flagged OoW may be our only hope at leveling at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I have a 58 Wizard that I was trying to get his last 10% for 59.  No groups wanted me, so I decided to try the task system.  Headed to Ak'Anon because the patch message said that task givers were available all over.  Nothing about having to go to certain ones.<br />
<br />
So the guy tells me, &quot;Hey!  You're too high.  Go see ....&quot;  And tells me who to see.  Couple in Overthere and a couple in Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
So I go to OT and get a &quot;Short&quot; task from the Iksar in the SW corner.  Started in Skyfire.  Had to check out some spot near VP, then second step was to explore the drawbridge in the northern passage.... in VP!   Needless to say I don't have the key so I Abandon the task.<br />
<br />
Head back to the Task guy and he has like 4 total tasks.  All will lead me into VP, and all are &quot;Short&quot; tasks.  So I find the other 2 Task givers (1 in DE fort, 1 in NE corner) and they have the same tasks.<br />
<br />
So I go to Dreadlands.  Find the first Task giver in the Combine fort area.  Nothing to give me.  I go out of the Hidden Valley and hit Find.  Select another Task giver and follow the trail.  Trail leads me to the giant fort and then heads straight down under the world.  Pffft!<br />
<br />
Hit Find and go towards the last Task giver.  He's a gnome near the FV tunnel.  Nothing to give me....<br />
<br />
Hit Find again and try the 2nd Task person.  Trail goes like 20 feet from the gnome Task giver and heads straight down.<br />
<br />
Wonderful systems.</div></div><hr />

Just because PoFire or KT or whatever zone is in the game doesnt mean everyone will/can get access to it.<br />
So go FIND some better XP if its that big a deal. Only 1 locked zone in OoW. Nobles and Wall are both EP+ xp, and not hard at all.<br />

But hey, if you don't have TIME for that either, then I guess you will just have to wait til 2005 to be lvl 70. This aint Diablo man, and I wish people would STOP trying to turn it into some perverted &quot;Arcade&quot; game. Its bad enough now. <br />

oh cmon, you cannot be serious?<br />
thats stretching the &quot;raiders vs non-raiders&quot; scenario waaaayyy too far, or should the ebil raiders have to grind exp for hours and hours and the non raiders should have 5x lvl 60 ahead?  :D <br />
<br />
scnr :)<br />
<br />
and before i am betitled as the &quot;evil green eyed ubar raider without rl&quot; or similar things, imo outside OoW Tipt will be the best exp camp, not KT because of overcrowding, fire, or any other zone. And guess what? Tipt is freely accessable by all :)<br />
and i bet, OoW will have some really really nice exp spots, too, and they won't be in the one locked zone :)<br />
<br />
and it certainly won't be much worse than reaching lvl 60 pre PoP or Luclin :)</div></div><hr />

Hell, I'll be happy if I can do a level a month.  :)  Honestly, should ding 66 tonight, then will probably take me 2-4 weeks a level until 70.

<br />
The key seems to be finding a good spot that is not crowded. I did some easy PoFire (the crappy stuff) and still cleared 6% (my one guy who was one kill away) or so in under an hour. I did it with pure volume. Everyone always run to the &quot;best&quot; spots and settles for sharing pulls. I pulled the whole field in front of the GY back to the lava line with my 6box. Pulled with shammy, debuffed, etc nuke it down to 40% and then let my melee kill it while shammyman speed out to get another 1-2. I had constant mobs in camp and the loot wasnt bad. Course higher levels may force me to re-evaluate but I have some good ideas on non-common camps with easily killed 65-66 level mobs. Wont be first but will at least be reasonable and not frustrating (I despise camp sharing) :)<br />

We were cautious and moved slowly but still got a bit more than 3% into 66.  I am certain the same group could kill twice as fast now.  Also vxed is now accessable to any 65 and gives near EP lvl xp from reports.  Soloed there a bit and was getting 10-11% aa a kill.<br />

Ouch, took me a month to save up the 22 aa's I had banked for omens launch. This is going to be brutal. I just leveled 2 characters through the 60's and it was more like 5 aa's per level so its really a sharp step up.<br />

Did do some exploring last night in WoS. It was packed though so we tried moving a bit too far in and got beat the hell down by some discordant named that hit for 3k.

<br />
Doesnt anyone remember how bad the XP went in places like PoN and POD once you broke 62ish? How you basically HAD to penetrate BoT to get any real XP? An AA = amount of XP it takes to get from 51-52, or so, according to most reports. I did my &quot;fill lvl 65 bar&quot; mostly in PoFire and Tipt, and it sure wasnt &quot;fast&quot;, not even 1% per kill in the regular bar. <br />
<br />
I am sure OoW has zones that will be better XP than places like BoT and Tactics, but if people arent going to go find them, then I really dont wanna hear how sucky the XP is at 66 in the mediocre 65 zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG Blazz I agree with you 100% for once :)<br />
<br />
Wonder if too many people have been spoilt and been 65 for so long theyve forgotten how much of a grind real exp is.<br />
<br />
Was in Wall of Slaughter earlier getting 4% or so aa exp per kill (damn i want that spell gem :)).<br />
<br />
3 runes dropped  plus a nice non shm usable ring and a int caster hat.<br />
Seemed very nice gear for the difficulty of the mobs as theses named seemed easier than GoD named.<br />

I'm sure there are better spots out there.  My point is, take a look around and keep in mind the 5 level rule - you want to be killing mobs within 5 levels of you for max xp.  Also, don't look for xp per mob, look for xp per unit of time - that's really the key.<br />

Still waiting on my dialup to finish the complete OoW download so when I got on last night I finished my Blood of Nadox quest. Which I was pleasantly rewarded with 2pct of regular exp in 66 (trying to figure a way to just farm that stupid quest for exp, might be doable). Went LFG after that and picked up a group in SolRo pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
In the two hours I was in solro I got about 2 blues of exp. I think that i figured I was getting a percent every 4 kills or so. I'm not upset with that. I did notice one nice thing... now that the protectors at the entrance are dark blue, I didn't get a single resist on turgers.<br />
<br />
Now that I've got a solid buffer in 66 the temptation is just too great and I'm gonna go grind 2 more AA's for my 9th spell gem before continuing on.</div></div><hr />

So i thought i'd post and share some data with everyone that's interested in what they can expect. <br />
<br />
First, the entire grind was done in PoFire in teh second castle. All mobs were level 68. The exact time of the grind took 21:38:40 (rounded to the nearest :05). We killed 1255 mobs. That averages to 0.3195% reg exp/mob and 0.30877%exp/minute. <br />
<br />
here's teh breakdown in # of mobs it took to ding each level. <br />
<br />
67 - 261 <br />
68 - 291 <br />
69 - 332 <br />
70 - 371 <br />
<br />
Additionally, AA exp on these mobs at lvl 70 was right at 4%/mob as compared to 5%/mob at 65.&quot;<br />

Not siding with anyone here, but I'd like to point out the cyclical nature of your argument.  Yes, levels do help you get to zones, so does gear.  Gear does make more hunting spots viable and it's also reflective of what flags/keys you have as some gear is locked behind closed zones.  So gear does help with getting levels and levels help with getting gear.  People rush to get levels when they are available because it's a sure thing (you get exp, you get lvls) and with a new expansion you can get both lvls and gear in the same go.  I recall when Kunark first came out and the guild I was in started making regular hunting groups because many peeps were not geared to get into the CoM castle, and that was before mudflation got out of hand and in a family/friends type guild.  It's only got more exagerated from there.</div></div><hr />

I did the LCY(Left Castle Yard?) of PoV zone where there are 6 static crystal golem spawns and found the exp to be acceptable... just very boring.  Pulls were all singles (even to a 61 SK alt) and with Bane/BoS/BoU/Pox, I was able to keep that side of the castle clear and net almost 2% per clearing (seems like 1% every 3-4 kills) at lev 66.<br />
<br />
OOW:<br />
Also hunted in some of the OOW zones and kills in the Proving Grounds (in full group) were approx 3 kills per 1% ish... but most of the mobs were red to a 66.<br />
<br />
Other OOW zones seemed alot less but mobs coned blue.<br />
<br />
Bloodfield zone-in trash mobs were bad exp at lev 66.  I think I solo killed 6-7 of them and finally saw my exp move 1% and cannot single pull some of those.<br />

Kinda strange being told to just make it to 70 to be able to get access to the zone with the good exp and drops. Especially strange when the one zone of choice for getting exp from 66-70 (PoFire) is a locked zone.<br />

Yes, I am aware that there are zones in OoW and GoD that has good exp too but you yourself have this to say in another thread:<br />

&quot;The problem isnt the XP per mob, its the way the mobs are spread out. Fire mobs are packed together in Castle 2, but is easy to pull singles because the aggro radius is so low. I dont think Fire XP should be nerfed, but I do think the aggro radius should be jacked up now. High concentrations of high XP mobs is the key to fast leveling.&quot;<br />
<br />
and Skadi (who I think is even more uber than you) had this to say:<br />
<br />
&quot;1) its restricted so only so many people can get in there which improves your odds of finding a good place to set up camp at.<br />
<br />
2) in my time grouping in new zones I would say probably half has been wasted recovering from player induced wipes. There is always some fool out there exploring who goes someplace he shouldnt and instead of just dying choses to share his discovery with 20 other people, killing himself and them. Thats the kind of crap I want to avoid, as much as I would like to see the new stuff as much as possible, sometimes you have to let some of the newness wear off first and let things settle down.<br />
<br />
3) alot of guilds like mine have taken time from raiding off to level up. Many like myself who are in such a guild have playtimes that usually end up with us being on during raid times most of the time leaving little time for grouping. So people want to make the most of it now in a relatively safe route.&quot;<br />
<br />
Its just confusing to be told as a casual player to get the levels first so I handle those zones. But then its gonna take a lot longer for me to get to 70 than you isnt it? And I will have to put up with a lot of problems because of overcrowding too? And if I level up my exp will die out a lot faster because I will be figthing lower level mobs than you and Skadi and others like that.<br />
<br />
Yes, the glass certainly looks half-empty for the casual player and close to full for the not-so-casual player. I dont see how anyone can say it is not.<br />
<br />
Whether OoW can still be fun or not is another matter but please dont tell me that getting 70 will solve all problems.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to get a spec of XP in any pre-Gates zone, other than raid XP. Just because I comment on where I think the &quot;best&quot; XP is doesnt mean I go there. Its not how I play. I have been doing 90% of my XPing in WoS, MPG or KT (and only because I needed spells here). Last I checked, WoS and MPG arent locked, and are extremely doable by a solid group of players with respectable gear.<br />
<br />
Gates was a screw up Spirit. Everyone knows it. SOE admitted it. After seeing OoW, its blatantly obvious that Gates was intended to be a sub-expansion of OoW, but since it was smaller, and the end-game players were screaming for content, and the mid-high end players were sceraming for the end-gamers to move out of the zones they had been farming for a year, SOE made a move. It backfired. <br />
<br />
So yes, you might have to get lvl 70 in order to pass the trials and access KT. Sorry. Think of it this way. SOE releases the EPs. The only level 60s with the SLIGHTEST chance to get in are the ones farming VT. 6 months later, they release the rest of PoP, and up the levels to 65. Now other players will have a chance to get to the EPs, despite that being releaed first. This is what I think happened with Gates-OoW. <br />
<br />
It DOES suck, but there IS hope man. Try to look at the GOOD side of stuff for a change. OoW is VERY cool. Fun zones, fun models, different styles of encounters, even in single-group situations. Shaman have good playability there again (this is why the XP in OoW is inferior to the XP in other, high-volume kill zones, BTW. We cant have our cake and eat it too. Encounters are longer, making them ore shaman friendly, but the XP is about the same per-mob. However, you get less kills per hour). Honestly, it sounds to me like your bitching about having to buy a Veal Parmesian dinner to get some bread and salad. Look at how good the Veal is bro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Just getting 70 will solve nothing. The game isnt going to change. The min/maxers will continue to dominate as it is in thier nature. Squeezing the last possible drop of fun out to get the most perfect algorythm of xp per hour or whatever. <br />
<br />
I have been in omens zones non stop pretty much every minute I have been playing. I have died in new and intresting ways. (Go Go exploring shaman!) I have gotten into 4 seperate pickup groups. (And I never ever pickup group) I had a pickup group yesterday where they saw shaman was the only healer and the Enchanter and Wizard promptly bailed. Well we picked up a druid and a bard in place and went a killing. We got 3-4 mobs killed then wiped. Ow... Well then we got ressed at the zone line by a nice cleric and we went traipsing off agian. Got about 10 -12 kills under our belt and The monk and bard got a few too many with a bad flop or two and splat they got munched. Ahh well.<br />
<br />
What always makes me smile however are how many people will wait and be spoon fed the spoilers and ride the coatails of the leaders then swoop in and start claiming they did everything because they are Level 70 and know all about all this stuff. <br />
<br />
The alkallazim geniuses who know what everything drops but know nothing about how the game actually plays in the zone. Who can recite all the spell effects and thier abilities but have never fought the monster. Who go looking to kill the monster because of its Phat lewt. <br />
<br />
Last night we went into nobles causeway and fought a fella named Dragorn Beastmaster. <br />
<br />
We had 6 people. Decidedly non uber. Shaman Beastlord, Chanter Paladin<br />
 SK and Cleric. It was one of the best fights we have ever had. We finished with the cleric at 1% Mana. I was at 5% after 2 Canna 5's and a ton of regualr cannas And All special abilitys were spent. At one point I had The top 4 disease dots on him. Bane Anathema and A blood of saryn plus the epic dot. I recast the Bane anathema and one more blood. (Didnt want to pull aggro with multiple Bloods. ) Plus healed alot and generally made a nusance of myself to the mob. <br />
<br />
Of course he dropped nothing. Figures.<br />
<br />
Now someone who had powered to level 70 With time gear is going to blow through this guy like he is made of tissue paper and completly miss the fun fight we had. And that is a shame. <br />
<br />
Sorry I rambled. I just think that something is wrong when the best geared and supposedly the uberest of the uber would rather plow through old content to get that extra % of an advantage rather than play the game as intended. It seems wrong to me. <br />
<br />
Winning isnt everything. The fun of compitition is in the challange. At least thats the way I see it.<br />
<br />
So to all those powering to level 70 in old content I ask you this. Can you please come to the new zones some. And try them when they are current so that later when you are 70 and reaping the benifits of the raid game you don't bitch and moan about how it is too damn easy and get the non raiders nerfed yet again.<br />

Kinda strange being told to just make it to 70 to be able to get access to the zone with the good exp and drops. Especially strange when the one zone of choice for getting exp from 66-70 (PoFire) is a locked zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Chats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Thanks Snow......my thoughts almost exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Good post Snoww. I have done a few pick up gruops in WoS. One group was brand new there, and I had spent some time there, so I suggested a spot (I saw lots of mobs there). Off we go, get set up, look to pull, the mob decides to turn around halfway to us, run BACK to his spot, run around in a circle, aggroing 5 more, and come back with all his buddies. Incredibly, we killed them all, except 1. That 1 went BACK TO THE SPOT, got 4 more buddies, and came back and creamed us, LOL. It was a total blast. Rooting stuff, getting summoned all over, I had a riot. After we got rezzed, 3 people in the group decided they were going  back to PoFire cause they wanted XP. <br />
<br />
/shrug. Some people play the game differntly than others. I am happy that EQ is able to adapt to SO many varying playstyles, but its both an asset and a detriment at the same time.</div></div><hr />
