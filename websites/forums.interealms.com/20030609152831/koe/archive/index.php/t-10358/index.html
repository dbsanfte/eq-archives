<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fennin went down thanks to Veeshan's FoH. A little set back due to Rallos Zek, but once they took him down, they are surely advancing fast....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They got him to spawn but did not kill him.  Best they did was 70% on him...but I bet in a couple weeks they will have figured out how to kill him.<br />
<br />
He Triples for 2900...so I will be interested in seeing how they over come that...but they will</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Considering for the moment they fought mobs that quad for more prior to this, I have to believe that there is probably something more like an insane AE lumped on top thats the real issue.  Maybe he flurries too for extra fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And I almost pooped myself when seeing Statue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So far my favorite was the mob that AE rampaged for 2k+.......<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't even get there from here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fedora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm, I wonder if that mace is ENC useable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dont worry Canelek your not the only person that &quot;poo'd a little&quot; when they saw this guy. :eek: <br />
<br />
From what I saw hes part of a very long script: like 2 hrs, so maybe just getting to him with enough ppl left alive is the real problem.  <br />
<br />
I soo wanna see this guy in person.... You think he'd have more hatred for a wiz that worships Prexus? (yea I know I know no flames I can't change it now)<br />
<br />
Plop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">think i stick to soloing greenies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well did not know you wanted the full spoiler.<br />
<br />
Triples for 2900<br />
AE Rampage(ie...if your in Melee range when he rampages you get hit)<br />
Has 2k AE<br />
Cant be slowed and disspells(so DoTs are useless against him)<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks B.  We still aren't sure if they killed it like Sori dreams of (he's the first Iksar worshipper of Planedefiler, we think), or if they will take another few days to get it.</div></div><hr />

I just think his rants are hillarious A. and B. think it's cool that FoH is leading the pack above all the other guilds of other servers.</div></div><hr />
