<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oldpapabear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, i wanted some clarify about this &quot;mitigation&quot; with slow with PoP or LDoN mob.<br />
<br />
When we have our slow not full landed like slighty, partially, mostly :<br />
<br />
1) the mob will be slowed by a x% from the basic slow % ? That will mean the shaman slow will be slighty highter than Chanter, Bst and bards (even 1 or 2 %).<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
2) The mobs have a slow cap with for example slighty = 30 %, Partially 50 % and Mostly 70 % (pur example). That will mean for partially , all slows are egal ?.<br />
<br />
I ask that because it seem we will have new spells with GoD :<br />
57 - Ancient Order  <br />
60% slow magic based / 400mana, resistadjust -30 (target type: unknown(34)) <br />
<br />
65 - Ancient Balance  <br />
70% slow magic based / 300mana, resistadjust -30 (target type: unknown(34))</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is correct.<br />
<br />
Taken from another thread (I've answered this question a few times :) ):<br />
<br />
&quot;When a mob mitigates slow, that slow is reduced by a certain percentage. I'm not sure how much the exact mitigation is, but it is something like 75%, 50%, or 25% mitigated (for slightly, partial, and mostly landed slows, respectively). Thus, a turgur's (75%) slow on a mob that partially mitigates will come out to 37.5% slowed. Grummus (40%) on that mob will come out to 20% slowed. So, basically, turgur's is always the best slow as long as magic lands. If not, grummus is the best.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a set % of the slow that was cast. Using your example, if you cast Turgurs on a mob(70%) and you got the message partially slowable, it would be slowed by 35%. However if you used a lower level slow(let's say tagar's, not sure of the slow %, but I'l say 50 for easy math), it would be slowed by only 25%.<br />
<br />
If you want to test this, find a mob that is &quot;mostly&quot; slowable. Cast a lower level slow on it, like walking sleep, and see if you get the message. If it's mostly slowed with walking sleep, it'd make sense that only 70% of walking sleep is taking effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, they really missed the boat on that one.  They should have SUBTRACTED the mitigation percentage from the slow percentage, i.e. a 20% mitigating mob with 75% slow cast on it would be 55%.  BST casting a 65% slow would get it slowed 45%.<br />
<br />
The way the did it, the difference between a BST or ENC slow and a SHM slow gets smaller with mitigating mobs, to the point that a &quot;mostly&quot; mitigating mob shows only a tiny difference when slowed by a shaman compared to an ENC or BST.</div></div><hr />
