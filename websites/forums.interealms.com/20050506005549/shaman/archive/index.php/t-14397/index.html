<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else have this problem?  I have two computers connected to a router so that I can use my DSL line for both.  It's not a linksys, in fact I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head as I'm at work still, but every two hours to the minute I go LD.  It's extremely annoying.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had this problem before?  Someone suggested I update the firmware which I did, but I'm still having this problem.  Any ideas how I can fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamluke256</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have the same problem.  I am using a D-Link router atm and its a pos.  2 comps are wireless one 2 are hardwired.  All 4 have this problem,  what I did is went on to the router and changed the idle settings for everything to none.  This mostly fixed the problem.  Also try upgrading your firmwear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another problem might be the router software.  If it's dropping every 2 hours, it sounds like 1 of 3 things.  1--your isp automatically drops people so that afk people don't take up bandwidth and your router is re-establishig connection.  2--your router is set somewhere in the config's to re-establish or at least drop every 2 hours.  3--you have a memory leak in your router software and it's filling up at 2 hours, and then it promptly resets.<br />
<br />
Of the three, I'd guess (3) is the problem.  Try upgrading (or perhaps downgrading) the software in the router.  A similar thing happens with the lynksys routers every 15 minutes if you use the updated drivers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go into your router's settings and set port triggering incomming range 1024 - 65535 and outbound range the same. It will solve the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What about for those of us w/ a linksys?  I have been getting 3-4 disconnects a day (random).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">for linksys you need to do the port trigger change AND possibly downgrade your firmware (assuming you are using the latest firmware).  <br />
<br />
I started having periodic packet loss into the red range using my linksys 4 port router, and since I wanted an 8 port anyway, I just went out and bought a netgear 9 port to replace it and I haven't had any of that cyclic almost linkdead but recover and find out you are in a different spot that you thought and mobs are beating on you problems :-)<br />
<br />
I do however place on BB which is having severe network problems right now during prime time so I'm crashing out because of those now....*sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey jorlaan i'm having that exact same problem with that I am almost going Link dead every minute or 2 ...can I fix it or do I need to go buy something new like you did?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another problem that may be happening if you're losing connections at 2 hours exactly is your router is probably configured to assign IPs via DHCP with a 2 hour lease period.   Every 2 hours it's telling your computers to renew their IPs and get a new one.<br />
<br />
Check in Admin options for your router and look up how it is assigning IP addresses, try increasing lease time if that's available, otherwise you'll have to change the computers to a static IP.</div></div><hr />

I set DHCP to renew using the one week setting. I have a DI604 and I rarely get disconnected.<br />
<br />
I also use the DMZ setting on my EQ computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I never determined if there was a fix or not.  I needed an eight port, knew there were a lot of problems with linksys and eq, so when I bought the 8 port, I just didn't buy another linksys.  Up until the 2 weeks prior to the 8 port purchase, I'd never had a problem with the linksys after I enabled port triggering.  The cyclic, timed/periodic packet loss to almost linkdeath but not quite, started up suddenly with me not changing anything in the router settings.  I assumed after fiddling with options and no resulsts, that the router was going bad, which made for a good excuse to go buy the 8 port that I wanted anyway :-)<br />
<br />
I ended up with a netgear that has vpn support.  I read that you don't want vpn support in your router if you want to play internet games, but I just disabled vpn on all ports and haven't had any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lyanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dang, lots of people with dlink routers.  Mine was having that issue every couple hours.  I had it email me the error logs for anything it saw (there were only 5 options of things it could look for).  It was dropping udp packets while a certain address would be talking to it.  Coworker went to a university website (no idea which one), looked up the address and found the name attached with the ip address.  I posted the ip address and the name on my guild website and someone came up with the possible problem, and possible solution.<br />
<br />
The address belonged to SOE, thier routers were just trying to talk to mine.  The possible solution was to upgrade my firmware (it was pretty out of date) from the dlink website.  This worked wonders for my connection.  So far Mediacomm hasn't pulled any shinanigans so I can feel safe in trying to leave my trader active in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm gonna go out on a limb here but your routers may have collision or bad packet counters on them.  Many do, and when it reaches a certain number, it cause the machine to power cycle or simply reset.  It is very possible that some of the data being recieved from Sony is less than satisfactory for these machines and the counters are filling up.  It possibly explains why many have the same estimation of time it takes to LD.  If they are similiar hardware with similiar buffers, they would fill up at the same rate after a reset while playing.  Many times these counters can only be manually adjusted or turned off through the serial interfaces of the devices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gaanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone know how to fix it with a belkin router?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">with linksys router you need to set port forwarding speciflcy for EQ also.  THere was a thread a while back about this in the EQ tech support area, may be stickied.  I used to go LD all the time, changed thisand never had a problem.  have upgraded my firmware in the past 3 months also.</div></div><hr />
