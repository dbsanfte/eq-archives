<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lvl 37 and been looking for the quest components for Canni 2 this last while. I picked up the crushed diamonds on Golra Isle and was auctioning for the rest between fights. Kudos to Saraza...sends me a tell saying he will MQ with me as he has the bone chips and the Yun Shaman Powder...but we still need the Strange Ochre Clay from CoM. I went their earlier today to see if I could loot it maybe..but there wasn't one person in the zone :/<br />
<br />
Anyone has it plz let me know and I'll happily buy from ye.<br />
<br />
Set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just to point out that you don't need to MQ, as only the bone chips are nodrop. So just give all the other components to your friend, and have him do the hand in.<br />
<br />
Can't help ya with the clay, sorry, wrong server!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you can push 39 (VoS), you could probably just solo the Shamans who drop it. Any Shaman Froglok can drop the powder in TT.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, the clay is tradable. It drops off &quot;an army behemoth&quot; in the zone. Chances are, most raids will probably just let it rot. Be there when it drops, and you could probably get someone to loot and hold it for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's only the Yun Shaman that drop it. The others drop a different powder. <br />
<br />
As for the Army Guy I've had him spawn most in the temple to the right of the gates as you enter COM. You'll need a full group to get it at your level, but it's good exp so it's well worth going there. Plus once you've cleared the temple you can grap the High scale icon from the left hand room inside the temple whilst you are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've seen the Army Behemoth in most places in CoM, on the ground floor. Although I can't remember seeing him in the stables, but he certainly has a variety of spawn points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen him lots down by the castle on the bridges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I spent a lot of time in CoM powerlevelling my twink warrior, and I got about 3-4 army behemoths all in the same spot (NOT in a row--they are a rare spawn it seems).  If you are facing the castle, all of them spawned in the left pagoda on the bridge leading to the castle.  <br />
