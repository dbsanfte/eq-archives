<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been into Nurga since the recent change and tried a few mobs.  The exp wasn't too bad and the mobs were comparable to LoY mobs.  My question is - I'd like to try out Droga, since I'm told decent PP drops there to boot.  Would it be possible to find a quiet corner and pull 4 to 5 mobs in lvl 55 or 56?  I'm pretty well equipped.  JBB, Epic, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Constan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have fought both in Nurga and Droga extensively since the change. One thing I noticed is that if you take the droga entrance from Nurga the mobs are alot lower lvl. You can move in slowly and they get progressively harder. This way you can work at your pace and take chances as you see fit. The mobs will all be blue to you but they were light blue to my 65 druid. The mobs at the FM entrance area are all blue to him. The other advantage of going to Droga is there is a decent chance at some good drops, even from some of the lower lvl mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I zoned into Droga from the FM entrance. Lowest level mob that came up on my 55 Druids tracking was an even con, most being yellow with a few reds sprinkled in the mix. Granted, this was just at the entrance, so there may be areas with lower level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go here (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=6704.topic) for some nice gear you can quest from Nerga.   A couple of the parts are quite decent for a shaman to wear up in the levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just went to Droga last night with a full group of guildmates. In 1 1/2 to 2 hours we got about 650p(mostly in coin, they dont seem to drop many items). I also got 13% of level 56, AND 10% of an aa. I kept messing with the aa percentage thing but decided to go all normal exp at the end. But the exp was fast! :) <br />
<br />
It was kind of a strange group too, 1 paladin, 2 druids, and 3 shamans. Owned everything we fought in there.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're looking to solo there, I'd just like to give you a little warning. Almost every mob we fought was a caster. I think they casted an AE 600 DD with stun(not sure if it was ae, but I kept getting hit with it and I didn't have much aggro). There was one point when a goblin cast an AE nuke that hit me for 799dmg, and I had 120 magic resist.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm sure there are places to solo in there, but don't expect it to be easy.<br />
<br />
PS: Those bugger LOVE to cast annul magic on us.<br />
<br />
I'm told decent PP drops there to boot<br />
They usually drop 15p to 20p, though one time a goblin dropped a mere 10 gold. :( It went hill giant on meh lol.<br />
<br />
Edit: One more thing. Just to give you sort of an idea of the exp, in the couple hours we were there(the time flew by so fast) my lvl 59 friend got over 10% exp easy. Seems like pretty quick exp to me, especially since it's fun AND rewarding. I have to give it up to SoE on this revamp.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">XP and coin here is nice.  At 57 now, I may try soloing a bit, but I'm concerned because my overall resist gear is not good.  With my self buff, all my resists are floating around 100.  I solo'g in Nurga at 56 VERY easily and mobs have a small agro range, but the xp was nothing like when I grouped in Droga.  If you try Droga solo, have ALL your buffs up, IMO and be prepared to Gate if need be.  A bad pull and you are looking at two wizard nukes or two SK HT's right off the bat.  From 55+ I'd say this would be a great duo spot with a mage/necro/BL, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll say what Constan said.  The area closest to the Entrance from Nurga has lower lvl MoBs.  These MoBs are even lower than the tougher MoBs in Nurga.  I would say 45-47 or so.  I can solo here fairly easily with my ranger at lvl 60.  With a shammy partner I can kill fast.<br />
<br />
Bring your own weapons, there are no puppy weapons to be looted.<br />
<br />
I've only found one named in the lower lvl part of Droga, but he drops a crappy common drop so he's not really worth camping.  I will look for more nameds when I get the chance.<br />
<br />
I'm still working on the Nurga quests, some nice stuff can be quested, but the drops are rare and rarer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Constan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another thing I started doing in both Nurga and Droga was adding labels on my map for any named spawns I find. This would work in any zone really. It helps when you dont have a tracker and wanna find that spot again to see if a named guy is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After spending more time in both Nurga and Droga I'd have to say Nurga is better solo in the 50s.<br />
<br />
I've soloed the easy part of Droga and have found 5 named in the easy part I can solo.  There should be a 6th but I can't find the shaman goblin named for this region.  The loots on these guys is nothing special except for &quot;Blood Ritualist Taprom&quot;.  He drops the prismatic necklace of peace, which is a nice drop.  The lower Droga MoBs do not seem to drop gems very much though (unless I'm just really really unlucky).  They drop about the same cash as the Nurga MoBs you could solo efficiently at these lvls.<br />
<br />
Nurga has many more named I can solo.  Nurga seems to drop gems more off the same lvl MoBs too.<br />
<br />
For grouping I would suggest Droga.  You can fight the higher stuff and get good drops and cash loot.</div></div><hr />
