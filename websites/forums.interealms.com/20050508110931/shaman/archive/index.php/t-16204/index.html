<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello and Welcome to the Shaman's Crucible forums!   While we all want to have fun and learn from each other, we do have a few guidelines that we ask you follow:<br />
<br />
<br />
GENERAL BOARD RULES.<br />
1. Post in the correct forums.<br />
We have different forums for where to hunt, what gear to wear and other catagories.  Please post your topics in the appropriate areas.  If you have questions about which area to post in, use your best guess based on the descriptions of the forum listed.<br />
<br />
2. Follow the signature rules.<br />
Our signature rules are -<br />
DIMENSIONS: 100 pixels high, width negotiable within reason (suggested less than 400 pixels).<br />
FILE SIZE: 25k or less<br />
RESTRICTIONS: No flash, shockwave, java, activeX or other script or embedding.  Please try and keep your signatures &quot;work safe&quot; and tasteful.  There is plenty of room to express your creativity within these limits.  <br />
<br />
3. Have some respect.<br />
Sometimes we can't help but use a little colorful language, that's okay.  Using punctionation/spacing and other tricks to circumvent the language filters for excessive swearing is not.   <br />
<br />
Try to have some respect for the other posters.  Personal attacks are not welcome here.  Please refrain from posting copies of &quot;this thread/person is dumb&quot; images.  <br />
<br />
Please don't purposefully antagonize the moderators by breaking the rules just to get a reaction.  We do this on a volunteer-basis, in our spare time, to try and help out.  We try and respect the posters of this community and interfere as little as possible.  Please respect our time and efforts.<br />
<br />
4.  One account per person. <br />
If you have lost your password or have other account problems, please PM Gloriana - or you can email Sunmoon.  We're happy to help.<br />
<br />
5.  Do not address posts to SOE or SOE Employees.<br />
If you have comments that you would like SOE to read please use their feedback form (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_feedback.jsp).  This forum is not run by SOE and has not traditionally been a place that SOE representatives have posted on.  If you wish to write posts that discuss issues for the shaman class and want SOE to see that, encourage others to write to the feedback for with a link.   Posts addressed to SOE will be locked/grey'd/deleted.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BOARD FEATURES<br />
1. Search Tips<br />
Access the search tool here: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/search.php<br />
This board software limits your searches to words over a certain length (3 chars).   For example, if you are searching for AA tips, typing in &quot;AA&quot; won't work.  However if you were to type in the abbreviation for some common aa, like SCRM or SCM you would be able to find threads on that subject.<br />
<br />
2. Avatars/Custom Titles<br />
Custom Titles are available to users with over 1000 posts.  Until our board software is updated, you may PM Gloriana to set your custom title for you.  There is a 25 character limit.<br />
<br />
Avatars are not available at this time.  If you have an avatar already and would like it removed, contact Gloriana.<br />
<br />
3. Reputation<br />
This system is a fun feature of the board, but has little practical use.  Since the question &quot;What are the green dots for&quot; seems to come up quite a bit, we will address it here. <br />
<br />
A poster's reputation is denoted by the number of small green squares next to your post count.  Reputation is earned and lost based on votes given by other users.<br />
<br />
If you see a person has posted a particularly helpful or insightful reply, you can click the talking head by the REPLY button on that post and give the poster a positive reputation boost.  If they have posted something inappropriate you can give them negative reputation.  Just because you disagree is not a good reason to give a negative reputation bump.  <br />
<br />
People with high reputations give bigger positive/negative boosts when giving reputation to others.<br />
