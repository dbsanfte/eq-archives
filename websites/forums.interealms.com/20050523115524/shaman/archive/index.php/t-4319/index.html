<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since I picked up my jbb, my evocation skill has languished a tad. Also, I find I'm chronically challenged with abjuration.<br />
<br />
So my question is, what is the best way to raise these skills? More specifically, do you skill up faster with higher wisdom (should I bust out all my trade skill gear)? Do you get the same chance to skill up with a level 1 evoc/abj spell as with a level 44? With evoc., does the mob have to be blue/light blue, or can I skill up on greens (rather than nuking myself)?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts are appreciated.<br />

You can raise spell skills on greens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell doesn't even land as there seems to be a 'no combat what-so-ever' feature there, but you still get skill ups. Maxed mine out pretty quicly there while waiting to be rezzed in from nasty TPW's in various strange locations :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can also gain skill by /gasp, casting on your pet ;)<br />
<br />
Use inner fire for abj and burst of flame for evoc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cast Inner fire over and over for abjuration.<br />
<br />
Target yourself and cast burst of flame over and over for evocation. I do this while waiting for the nexus and rez's. I generall get a couple skill ups each time.<br />
<br />
A high wisdom will help getting skill ups quicker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For Abjuration, I ran around hitting newbies in Freeport with BoS then Fleeting Fury, tossed an Ultravision on them and sent them on their way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i cast innner fire and bust of flame on myself at nexus and whenever im sitting around waiting on someone else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just an alternate suggestion: Fleeting Fury for Abjuration, as it's higher level (better chance of skill-up), much faster casting, and the same mana cost as Inner Fire. It's what I used, anyway. Burst of Flame for Evocation, and alternate True North and Sense Animals for Divination due to their long refresh times (thanks to the person who long ago suggested this).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll have to try Fleeting Fury.<br />
<br />
I macro'd my Inner Fire practice.  4 Inner Fires balance out beautifully with one Cann 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Torrent of Poison is great nuke spell !!! I discovery this after check what other shaman do to make him LOM all time.  man, we can nuke for 1600 DD !! you can use it in lots place but fizzle lots :( so only have chance to try when you are not the only shaman there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So so sad.  I just maxed evo and abj this week.   :o<br />
and I have liked 140 days played...been level 60 for 8 months.  I guess I just don't use nukes and buff ac/resists as much as others.<br />
<br />
I had to practice evocation a lot when I got torrent, when my skill got over ~210 or so it was a lot better and I never practiced again.  It just rose naturally on it's own.  I guess that shows how often I use DD spells... 25 skill points in like nearly a year!  To do the initial raising of evocation, I used burst of flame.<br />
<br />
I agree also that using fleeting fury is a good way to raise abj.  I noticed several increases when I was factioning in droga.  When I was with a bard I would use fleeting fury on them, that way I got hits for all the goblins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you all for the suggestions. <br />
<br />
I haven't found Divination to be too bad a skill to raise. I cast Acumen and Invisibility often enough to get skill raises, and I seem to get them more frequently that with Evocation or Abjuration.<br />
<br />
Jacinth and Shadoo fizzle a fair bit, and I imagine that Epuration will only be worse. I did some Inner Fire practice last night with a 5-cast macro, which worked well, but the Fleeting Fury suggestion sounds even better.<br />
<br />
I rarely fizzle on Ice Strike, but Torrent of Poison is another matter entirely. I was on a raid in Fear and the call came to load up AEs (doh!). Fizzle, Fizzle, Fizzle, Cast-Fizzle, Fizzle, Fizzle, Cast (woohoo!). oom. It's a wicked spell when it casts though. Practising in the nexus on self with Burst of Flame sounds like a perfect way to skill this up.<br />
