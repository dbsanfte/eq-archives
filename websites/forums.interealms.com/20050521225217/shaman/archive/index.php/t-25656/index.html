<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya,<br />
<br />
Thought I would give you all some tips on Glowing runes since they can be a pita to get...This is in noway a sure way or an easy way to get the runes but some help. Will say some camps that can be 2 boxed or camped with a friend. If you equipment aint so good bring another friend or two :).<br />
<br />
In ruined city of dranik you have the Kyv Bowhound and Stoneworker Stonetooth, can just run between these two camps.<br />
<br />
In MPG you can run between two camps that are fairly close to eachother, Blind Hunter Rekamu and Odiumate Isienne, OI can also dropp a 55hp aug which is nice.<br />
<br />
In RS you have the Prefect camp, Dogs and Pyrliens aint social so easy to pull. This mob dont only dropp glowing runes but also a sweet 65hp aug. (Just watch out for the roamers, I had no problem pulling this camp with my SK)<br />
<br />
Also in RS you have the Researcher/Summoner camp, these two nameds can spawn as charmers so its not allways possible to 2box this camp, when I have done it I have had a bard standing there singing mana and resist for me, very easy to box now with melody :). Also in this camp you can get 70hp or 70mana aug which is sweet.<br />
<br />
<br />
GL on getting your 70 runes :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you all for this wonderful information.  I am currently doing a few AA's and finishing out my 66-68 runes before seriously tackling this.  Do most of the nameds above have chances to drop greater runes?  or just glowing? varies by mob?<br />
<br />
Thanks again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The mpg mobs drop lvl 68 muramite runes more often than glowing.  <br />
<br />
The fastest influx of glowing runes has come from raids, in my experience. I think out of 10-15 blind hunter kills, I've seen maybe 1 glowing rune:(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Major bummer :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ruined city of dranik and MPG mobs can dropp all runes, the mobs in RS dropp either 69 or 70 runes.<br />
<br />
My post wasnt thought as a: These are the mobs that dropp 70 runes but more a: These camps are easy to get to and easy to camp and you can get 70 runes here.<br />
<br />
In raids you get alot of Glowing runes and if you raid CoA you get alot of Ancient runes aswell but that was not my point with this post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got my first Greater last night off of Bowlord Rorn.  He usually drops the droppable ones, but in the last 2 times I've camped him he's dropped the greater.<br />
<br />
Yay for Talisman of Fortitude!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I guess, but I once spent a marathon session camping Kuroun and killed him easily 15 times and 1 level 69 rune dropped that whole time, about 8 hour stretch or so.  Saw the necklace rot over and over.  <br />
<br />
Same goes with BH and other MPG camps.  I understand theoretically you can get 70 spells that way, but in all the hours I've spent, I haven't gotten a single one.  <br />
<br />
I hate Omens spell distribution as far as actual implementation goes.  It's worse than PoP, which is amazing.  Certainly more frustrating for me at least.  <br />
<br />
On a positive and unrelated note, got my time flag finally!  woo hoo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've gotten one Glowing, I think it was from BH or Odi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My 3 glowings came off Sent and Neuromancer in PG, and Laborer in RCoD. However, I have killed these mobs many dozens of times since I got mine and NEVER seen another 70 off them. I got mine really early, I am quite sure they took a BIG chunk off the 69-70 rate with the non-RSS mobs. <br />
<br />
Lots of doable raid targets have them though. 69's are especially easy to get, NC is full of 2-3 &quot;family guild groupable&quot; raid targets, all of which will drop 2 69-runes every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What RCoD mobs are soloable by a well geared shaman for 70 runes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What RCoD mobs are soloable by a well geared shaman for 70 runes?<br />
You would have a damned hard time with any of the named in there. When I do these named I camp jump with a 70SK that has about 11,000 fully buffed any my shaman thats 8600hp fully buffed.  Both chars have 550+aa and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Granitesmash is easily soloable. Other named I think would be a tought solo..maybe Stonetooth but I think he was changed to pure meelee a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nice out of the way camp in MPG is the SW corner around Body trial.<br />
You have to fight past some see invis but three named are down here,<br />
if you look just above the 'Body' area the corridor is in a V shape and right at the top in the dead end bit of this V spawns<br />
Hunter Leisov (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16448) <br />
who drops the MPG chain legs<br />
Below this on map is a hexagonal room center mob spawns<br />
Lieutenant Commander Nak`Muram (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16256) <br />
and the east of this is a round room that has a raid mob in but one of the mobs just outside spawns<br />
Cleaver Wiex  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16381) <br />
I got my Group Wunshi of Cleaver and the next time we went got a 69 spell of him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The trials in MPG also drop glowing about ½ the time, not to mention the awsome loot.  Make sure that you find a good statagy for these trials, and just a note, Shaman really shine in efficiency, especially if you have your TA (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24699).  :) <br />
<br />
Gloriana's Loot list post (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=24443) has the rewards that can drop if you succeed, not to mention the increase to your resist cap for each of the 6 that you complete.<br />
<br />
PS Thanks for the note on the good camps Spikehammer.  :)</div></div><hr />
