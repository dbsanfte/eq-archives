<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Charel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am a new Shaman level 24.  I am looking at upgrading my armor and started looking at the different armor sets that shamans can wear.  I started looking at a roadmap for what I want to wear and when I can get it.  Therefore, I am interested in at what level can I start getting each set of armor.  I know I can buy some of it in the bazaar, but I interested in questing for it if I can.<br />
<br />
Here an example of what I mean. <br />
<br />
Totemic Armor  - Level 20-30<br />
<br />
I know that the pieces for Totemic Armor can be obligated around level 20 but some pieces the suggested level is level 30.<br />
<br />
What about the other sets?<br />
<br />
Jaundice Bone Armor<br />
Iksar Mystic Scale Armor<br />
Rune Etched <br />
Rune Crafters Armor <br />
Spirit Weavers <br />
Spirit Callers <br />
Wolf Callers Armor <br />
Twilight Armor<br />
Scaled Avatars (or PoP armor)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
Charel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cannot help you out with all of the armors, but here is some thoughts:<br />
<br />
Totemic<br />
You can do the easier pieces in a group of late teens, or solo in early 20's. Easy pieces incluse bracer (easiest), boots, gauntlets. The harder pieces can be done in a group of mid 20's or soloed at high 20's / early 30's. The hardest pieces are BP (hardest), helm, cloak. The BP is hard because of the rarity of the treant in South Karana (grizzleknot). The Helm is hard because of the long spawn time on the Glacier bear in Everfrost. The cloak is hard because both pieces are quite long camps and a bit dangerous. <br />
<br />
Jaundiced bone<br />
The &quot;easy&quot; pieces of JB armor drop deep in KC. It is not viable to solo that deep in KC before level 60. But KC isn't about soloing, its about grouping - you can head into KC at about 35, but you will struggle to get a group before level 40, es[ecially a group that is going deep enough to get the JB armor. In actual fact, with so much good armor available these days, you can buy JB pieces in the Bazaar for around 200 or 300 plat!<br />
<br />
The &quot;hard&quot; pieces of JB drop in Old Sebelis. Again, it is not viable to solo Seb until you are uber and 60, and even then, its tough (Ubershammies can solo Juggs). Basically, Old Seb is a level 50+ grouping dungeon. The BP drops off Trak, which is a tough takedown for a good guild. The JB BP still sells on my server for up to 20k <br />
<br />
Hate armor (Rune Etched)<br />
RE armor drops in Hate. You cannot actually go to hate before level 46, and most people wait until 47 because the risk of multi-deaths and delevelling is too great. You also will not really contribute a lot to a hate raid before level 50. The RE drops fairly regularly in Hate, but actually, most of it is not very good. There is so much better armor that can be got much more easily than the RE stuff, that people really tend to go to Hate for epic pieces, rather than armoe these days.<br />
<br />
Plane of Growth Armor<br />
I cant remember which armor is the PoG armor (they all sound vaguely similar). The same sort of rules apply to PoG as Hate - i.e. 46 level min, 47 recommended, 50 to be useful. Again, the armor is not real good, and is kinda hard to get relative to the easier Velious armor.<br />
<br />
Thurgadin quest armor (Rune Crafted)<br />
The Velious armor is all pretty much better than the Antonica and Kunark Planar armor. Rune Crafted is generally agreed to be the worst of the 3, but the easiest to get (NB &quot;worst&quot; doesn't mean bad - compared to any of the above armor, Rune Crafted rocks). The quest parts drop in Kael Drakkel, particularly in the Arena area. Raiding the arena requires a degree of skill and teamwork. It is viable to go to KD on a raid at about  level 44, but you are unlikely to be &quot;useful&quot; before level 49. A single group including a level58+ puller, a 55+s slower and a CH cleric can camp the arena. The quest pieces also supposedly drop in the bank area, but I have camped this area a lot and never seen any. The gems for these quests drop in various Velious zones, but Sirens Grotto is generally thought to be a good place to get the rarer gems (black marbles). SG requires a good group of mid 50s, it is not recommended to go there before mid 40's<br />
<br />
Kael Drakkel<br />
The KD armor is slightly better than the Thurgy armor, but faction issues mean that most guilds tend to align with Thurgy / Dragon, and since you cannot have good faction with ginats, dorfs and dragons, not many people end up getting KD armor<br />
<br />
Skyshrine Armor<br />
Skyshrine is the best of the 3 Velious armors (well, there are 4 really, but ill get to that). The pieces for this armor drop in the Temple of Veeshan. The accepted wisdom is that you need to be 55+ to go into ToV and be a help rather than a hinderance. Generally, ToV gets raided by guilds, not groups.<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief Armor<br />
The Shamanistic Shennanigans armor is very rare, because, it is very very hard to even get to PoM (far end of ToV?), and very hard to get the pieces to drop. I am not sure that all the pieces have ever been got. Do not be expecting to be getting this armor any time soon<br />
<br />
Lucllin Armor<br />
There are 2 sets of shaman armor in Luclin (that I know of), one of which is quested from Twilight Sea, the other drops in Umbral Planes. I do not know much about either of these, but it is generally accepted that the quests are too long to justify doing most of them, and the armor that drops in UP is ridiculously poor compared to the level you need to be to actually function in UP. It is quite a bone of contention that Druids can solo their UP armor from level 53 or so, and their armor is comparable to Skyshrine armor. Our UP armor is much harder to get and is comparable with Totemic! Basically, you do not see many shaman wearing Luclin armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, there you have my patchy knowledge on armor. As you can probably tell, I have gone through Totemic, JB, Rune Etched and Rune Crafters, so I cant say too much about the others. I hope that helps a little bit</div></div><hr />

<br />
Result?<br />
<br />
She has Shamanistic Shennagain bp and boots. <br />
<br />
I admire her for doing so, but I doubt I will ever be able to do the same - the parts are very rare.</div></div><hr />
