<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yedra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes I made 60 Sunday, Skills are all above my lowest which is Divination at 186 or some such, most are maxxed including all weapons and a bandaid skill of 192 :P Oh and I had 17 Day 5 Hours played when I hit 60.<br />
<br />
I love my frog, I have 3 characters over 60 including a 65 Rogue who was created July 26 1999. I dont mind if you dont like me cause I created and leveled a frog. I have played this game 4 years, played all three priest classes now to 50+ (51 Druid and 60 Cleric).<br />
<br />
I do respect all those who came before me but I did need to play a differant class with the total uselessness of Rogues in POP. I appreciate these boards and have gleaned tons of information off them as I do off Safehouse and other.<br />
<br />
Be safe and travel quietly...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You sound a little defensive there Yedra... there's nothing wrong with levelling a Twink to play when you wanna switch classes.     There's no advantage to be gained in grinding out levels slowly with bad groups in OT more than once in your life.<br />
<br />
I'm in the process of levelling up a Beastlord myself for something to do.<br />

Since they let a bunch of frogs run them out of Grobb /giggle<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BB has 4 60+ frogs now =/  <br />
<br />
Mine (Kogu 60clr), 2 pallies and a shaman.<br />
<br />
I've been at 60 for about a week now but have been working on critical AA's and equipment instead of racing on to 65.  Nothing worse than a level 65 character with junk for AA's/equipment imho =(<br />
<br />
Although Faahy or whatever there name was done incredibly quick I'll add, although at the complete expense of there characters skills and ability to be useful =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what color bear are ye anyhow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yedra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Classic TROLL Brown /smile<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dem frogs must be color-blind.  Troll bears are not Brown, classic or otherwise.  We get to be Black bears.<br />
<br />
(okies, I mean da Form of da Greater Bear.  Alla us shaman get stuck with brown for the first bearform)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Congrats ;) .. i have a youngin SK i'm working on. Twinks are fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I must admit it makes me feel kind of sick thinking of the time its taken me to make 62 when I see people making 60+ in 17 days, but I have to remind myself that its supposed to be about the journey. I have had fun on my way to 60+, but its just a bit of a bummer when you finally get to the level to get some of the good loot and stuff, and a twink races ahead and grabs it out from under you. Just the way the game works now days.</div></div><hr />
