<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one seems to know what the formula for MAX damage for archery is.<br />
<br />
With melee weapons it is (Skill + Srength + Level)/ 100 times the DAM of the weapon.<br />
<br />
Its usually not till around level 18 that this number exceed DAM * 2 +1 so you never see it going up.<br />
<br />
As is well known normal bow damage is BOW + ARROW DAM, but at some point (I am guessing when Archery MAX is greater than BOW + DAM)  you can excceed that amount.<br />
<br />
Lets try to figure out AMAX once and for all.<br />
<br />
This is what I need:<br />
<br />
Max VANILA  hit with no special tricks (NO TS, AM, Non moving etc, NO Archery Buffs, Not a crit, just straight hit)<br />
Level<br />
Bow DAM at time <br />
Arrow DAM at time <br />
Archery Skill at time <br />
Dexterity at time<br />
<br />
I need these not guessed or aprox, aprox dont help.<br />
<br />
I am guessing that the forumla will be similar in structure to the Melee one so this may be easier.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your participation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a simple formula that works for a sample of one, but its something to work from would be.<br />
<br />
(BOW DAM + ARROW DAM)  * ((DEX + SKILL) / 200 )<br />
<br />
For Tiluvas that gives<br />
<br />
(21 + 1 )* ((92 + 175) /200)<br />
<br />
22 * (1.335)<br />
<br />
29<br />

That works for one example, need others. <br />

LOL, this cant be that easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cant do this very well due to my current level on this reincarnation being below the time Max damage exceeds BOW + ARROW.<br />
<br />
Just while you are walking along pop a cap in a few greenies until you get a decent max, and note the info requested above.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you dont incur anything special, like Crit or AM or TS or NM/NR, or having *-Eye spell on you, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton, I would like to see this formula nailed down so we can make better decisions about Bows, Arrows and Dex items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on that.. (250+255+60)/100 *14 = 79.1<br />
<br />
Just about everyone knows that at 60 with a 14dam weapon your maxx hit is 91.<br />
<br />
So thats not even close.<br />
<br />
Has nothing to do with bow damage, but your example for melee weapon damage is wrong.<br />
<br />
Not 100% sure on these numbers but I think it's correct.<br />
<br />
lvl 60<br />
archery skill 240<br />
bow 33/35<br />
arrows 3dam<br />
dex 255<br />
maxx hit is 428 I belive.  non-crit, no AM.  This is a double damage hit.  Never shoot moveing targets enough to really be sure what the maxx hit is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My example is actually 100% right if you add the Damage bonus, which is 11 at 60.<br />
<br />
The fomula for melee damage is 100% right, you forgot to add the 11 damage bonus, which would equal 11, so its 80 offhand, or with a secondary attack and 91 with main hand. AT 60 DAM bonus in main hand is 11, or (60-25)/3<br />
<br />
That formula i quoted has been established for two years and just plain stands up.<br />
<br />
Now on to bow damage, need more data. My guess for bow formula WAY does not work tho, with your numbers. One of the factors maybe compounded somehow, like squared or double dipped.</div></div><hr />

Then it wasn't 100% right if it's left out of the formula :D<br />
<br />
((Skill + Srength + Level)/ 100 * dmg of weapon) + dmg bonus<br />
<br />
My best shots have always been 380 double regardless of DEX it seems.  DEX seemed to help it happen much more often.<br />
So no double shot it would be 190 max dmg<br />
Level: 56 (at the time of my tests)<br />
Bow DAM at time: 30 <br />
Arrow DAM at time : 3 <br />
Archery Skill at time : 220 <br />
Dexterity at time : anywhere from 168 to 255<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note.  What effect does ATK have if it doesn't increase max damage?  Just higher likelyhood of doing higher damage hits?</div></div><hr />

I see the 380 all the time with TS, so that kinda ruins it.  I don't shoot enough arrows otherwise to give you good data.</div></div><hr />

Max non-crit double damage disc shot is 516<br />
<br />
Take away double damage bonus and trueshot, max shot should be 129 (TS is 2x multiplier even, right?).<br />
<br />
Following the formula below:<br />
<br />
(40 + 3) * ((171 + 240) / 200 )  = 88.365<br />

So unless my assumption is off about Trueshot, or I made some other 'just woke up and am too tired for math' kind of mistake, this doesn't fly in my case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trueshot is advertised as double damage so whether you are using Windsaber or Winstriker it shouldn't matter. It should increase your damage 2x. Archery does not have a damage bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JuliettaMantoya</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following formulas seem to be working for me all the time:<br />
<br />
EDIT: Level 60 - Skill 240 - Str 255 - Dex 255 - Eagle Eye<br />
<br />
==============================<br />
For Bows:<br />
<br />
Bow Max Hit = (Bow Dmg + Arrow Damage ) * 5.7<br />
<br />
Example (Primal Bow with 11dmg arrows)<br />
<br />
Max Hit = (33+11) *5.7 = 250 dmg<br />
<br />
Add AM3 its 2x = 500 dmg<br />
<br />
Add Trueshot its 2x = 1,000 dmg<br />
<br />
Add Crit 1.72x = 1,719 dmg<br />
<br />
Arrow damage doesnt seem to include the +magic/fire/etc damage unfortunately. 5.7 is rounded up to simplify.<br />
==============================<br />
For main hand weapons:<br />
<br />
Wep Max Hit = (WepDmg+MagicDmg) * 5.7 + DmgBonus<br />
<br />
Example for KEC:<br />
<br />
KEC Max Hit = (15+1) * 5.7 + 11 = 102.2 =&gt; rounded up to 103 dmg<br />
<br />
When magic is resisted, its 15 * 5.7 + 11 = 97 dmg<br />
<br />
==============================<br />
<br />
Steel Warrior tested the wep formula a while back, and it seems to apply to bows as well, just without the damage bonus and magic dmg.<br />
<br />

I guess I have yet to hit my theoretical max crit yet.  That's something to look forward to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaffis</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note, the TS multiplier scales with DAMAGE, not delay. Otherwise a lesser quality DN bow would be perform better with TS than the better DN bows. But since they're all 30 damage, they perform equally (on a hit per hit basis), just hit slightly faster with better bows.<br />
<br />
Since higher damage usually goes hand in hand with higher delay, this subtlety often slips by a lot of people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tested this with my 10/17 bow from ToV and my AoW bow and it is flawless. I used the 11+4 and the 12dmg arrow and I cannot find where the +4 is working at all on a max crit, it does not add 4 to the end or make it a 15dmg arrow, this is nothing new just thought I would point it out again.<br />
<br />
My DPS on the AoW bow was almost 3x as much as the NToV bow. From looking at my logs I can shoot my AoW bow once ever 1.9 secs with Epic, DCoS and Fleeting Quiver. I can shoot my 10/17 bow once every 1.1 seconds with same setup. The delay between shots can be brought down MUCH MUCH more with longer delay bows and add that they have much greater dmg you will get much greater dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But none of that applies to me, so heres my numbers in hopes of finding a formula for my imperfect elf. <br />
<br />
Level 51 ranger<br />
203 archery skill<br />
143 str<br />
97 dex <br />
2/125 arrows<br />
<br />
21/39 bow  max damage 49  (bow+arrow * 2.13)<br />
10/39 bow  max damage 28  (bow+arrow * 2.33)<br />
10/50 bow  max damage 28  (bow+arrow * 2.33)<br />
13/46 bow  max damage 34  (bow+arrow * 2.26)<br />
<br />
thats with no archery or atck buffs and no ac debuffs.  Went back and tried another 40 arrows with the 21/39 after I calculated the multipliers, still only hit for 49 - 5 times out of 70 arrows.   The other bows are 30 arrows each and seem to hit for max more often</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;&quot;The ranger's 'Trueshot' discipline has had its damage increased after analyzing data from its fix last week. Prior to the last patch, all bows, while under the discipline, were hitting as if they were 45dmg bows regardless of the delay. Last week's patch fixed it so that damage was based on the damage of the bow. This weeks patch increases damage bonuses in relation to delay (longer delays yield better damage bonuses). &quot;&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">silly question time<br />
assuming my melee multiplier is x<br />
x = (str+level+skill)/100<br />
x= (255+58+232)/100 (for archery change skill cap)<br />
x=5.45<br />
<br />
so my max damage with a 3 dam arrow is<br />

doubled for stationary<br />
doubled for ts<br />
1.7 for crit<br />
= (33*5.45)*2*2*1.7<br />

<br />
assume a 11 dam arrow<br />
=(41*5.45)*2*2*1.7<br />
=1519<br />
<br />
screwy no am3 so i think theres an error? or do you assume ts includes double dam when they supposed to be independant<br />
<br />
assume aow bow shardwing 60th<br />
<br />
=(255+240+60)/100<br />
=5.55<br />

=((43+12)*5.55)*2*2*2*1.7 (double, ts, am3, crit)<br />

so the formula is screwed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JuliettaMantoya</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am afraid the formula I posted hijacked this thread. :)<br />
<br />
I posted it because it works for me, and I hoped it would provide Vodyr with some additional data to try to figure out the full formula. <br />
<br />
It appears that the formula works for several Level 60 rangers, and the similarity to the Weapon Max damage formula might not be coincidental. But aside from this the 5.7 is in no way a magic number. Especially since its really 2.8 if you dont count ranger's double damage.<br />
<br />
So whether the formula I posted works for you or doesnt, dont forget to post the bow data Vodyr asked for originally. Otherwise we never get to the bottom of this intersting question. :)<br />
<br />
A few clarifications for some of the previous posters:<br />
<br />
Ueauvan - My formula already includes the double bow damage, so you dont have to. <br />
<br />
Clarissa - without your level/bow/arrow/skill/str/dex/archery buffs/AM-level info noone can even try to explain why you get 1,789 max hits.<br />
<br />
=======================<br />
To expand on Vodyr's data request, try to post the following info ( I filled in my info at AM2):<br />
<br />
Level: 60<br />
Str: 255<br />
Skill: 240<br />
Bow Used (dmg/dly/bonus) 33/35<br />
Arrow used (dmg/extra dmg/bonus) 11+4<br />
Archery Mastery Skill: AM2<br />
Archery Buff Used (eagle eye etc.) Eagle Eye<br />
<br />
Then using double damage hits post the hits you get:<br />
<br />
Max damage Regular Hit: 400<br />
Max Damage Crit Hit: 688<br />
Max Damage Regular with TS: 800<br />
Max Damage Crit with TS: 1,376<br />
