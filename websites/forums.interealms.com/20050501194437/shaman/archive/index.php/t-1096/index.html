<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question,<br />
<br />
In reference to the last Spirit for the SoF, which port in to EJ is closer to the location, Wizard or Druid?<br />
<br />
Also it has been so long ago, which spirit is it? The one in the water or building?<br />
<br />
Just wondering as I am getting ready to do a Neh'shir and Rak Raid after getting lucky on looting my tear thanks to my friends uber guild :).  Plan on doing Neh'shir then gating out to talk to spirit then gating back to continue raid.<br />
<br />
The above questions will help speed things up hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">According to eqatlas, the wizard port in is closer to both CoM and the spirit pup. But neither port location is that close.<br />
<br />
The pup you want is the one in the lake to the north of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The wizard port in is closer to Com and the last two spirits we go to . The one for the spear is the one in the lake. But actually the druid and wizard port in arent all that far apart and both a little bit of a run to the spirits. Your actually closer to them at Com than either port in in EJ.</div></div><hr />
