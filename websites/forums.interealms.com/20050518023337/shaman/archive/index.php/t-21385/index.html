<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, what new aa skill would you like to see for shaman in OoW?<br />
<br />
Post your idea, then we can assemble them in the form of a poll to see what people in general would like to see.<br />
<br />
The rules:<br />
<br />
1) You get to post one idea only. No page long listings please.<br />
2) Do not attach costs or magnitude to the proposed skill.<br />
3) Be realistic. No DT 2.0 abilities or anything like that. Remember that most aa skills grant small incremental improvements, stuff that does not isnt going to happen.<br />
4) Dont post ideas other people have allready posted. That is not constructive.<br />
5) Don't forget the small convience sort of abilitities.<br />
6) Keep it simple. One sentence will do. There is no need for defence or sales pitches. If the effect isn't obvious from the title, add a brief one sentence explanation of the concept in brackets.<br />
<br />
Examples (these are not suggestions btw)<br />
<br />
Spear of torment enhanced damage<br />
Spear of torment reduced mana<br />
Breath of Trushar enhanced healing<br />
Daluda's mending enhanced healing<br />
Enhanced innate debuff (applies a neg resist modifier to all spells)<br />
<br />
Ideas proposed to date:<br />
<br />
Class A: Offensive abilities<br />
<br />
1) Dire spell casting speed (works for detrimental spells the way Quickbuff works for buffs)<br />
2) Advanced spirit call III<br />
3) Extended Torment AA<br />
4) Pet avatar (invul, on a timer, insta-cast)<br />
5) Enhanced dot crits (every round, on a timer) [Duration timed or applied to the next cast dot?]<br />
6) Innate Rabidity<br />
7) Dire charm animal<br />
8) Pet dual wield<br />
<br />
<br />
Class B: Defensive abilities<br />
<br />
1) Enhanced virulent paralysis  (something to reduce reuse time and/or resists) <br />
2) Some sort of personal defensive &quot;disc&quot; type AA.<br />
3) Reduced slow mitigation<br />
4) Slow affinity (resist modifier?)<br />
5) Group damage mitigation<br />
<br />
Class C: Healing/curing abilities<br />
<br />
1) MGB Radiant Cure<br />
2) MGB HoT<br />
3) HoT adept<br />
<br />
Class D: Buffing abilities<br />
<br />
1) Enhanced buff magnitude (more hp on focus for example)<br />
2) Enhanced max hit buff (on a timer, short duration)<br />
<br />
Class E: Personal modifiers<br />
<br />
1) Hastened Canni 5 (reduces the re-use timer on Canni 5)<br />
2) Canni 5 crits<br />
3) Sacrificial Canni (die, and give mana conversion to another, similar to pally sacrificial heal)<br />
4) enhanced spell casting subtlety<br />
5) Group canni<br />
6) Improved invis<br />
7) Passive canni<br />
<br />
Class F: Misc. abilities<br />
<br />
1) Unstopable spell casting (insta cast next spell, allways lands, long timer)<br />
2) Advanced suspended minion (allow repeated zoning with a suspended pet)<br />
<br />

Heh....that would make it more powerfull than the best equiped tank, and would be available 1/3 of your play time. That wont happen. If it lasted 15 seconds maybe, but not otherwise ;)<br />

We are, after all, a class with a great amount of buffs ... I think this'd be an interesting way of reviving them.<br />

This DoT crit would be a chance to crit on the entire dot.  Meaning that you would Crit every 6 seconds from start to finish on Dot.  This could bring DoTs online with DD crits for mana to Damage.  Its a sad day when a Dot takes 2 mins to do what other classes do in 7 seconds or less for alot lower mana to damage ratio.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye Glori, no stat buffs other than STA. I suggested STA only because STA = HP, and having more HP is never a bad thing -- even if the STA:HP ratio is awful after 255. But *definitely* more HP to FOS/FO7 and more ATK boost to FA. I'd be willing to grind a few AA for those!!<br />

A once every 3 or 6 hr AA that allows the next spell you cast to absolutely go off  (even if you're stunned or silenced) and absolutely land without resist checks (immunities and mitigations still apply).  <br />
<br />
The caster cannot cast any spell for 2 minutes after casting this (ala silenced - he is struck speachless) and this AA can only be used once a game day (3/6 hrs).</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about either not killing you while giving your mana away or make the shaman more useful so that its better to stay alive and keep the mana.......<br />
<br />
I can't ever see spending aa on something that would kill me. If I may ask one thing, it's that we focus on aa that would better us as a class, not enable us to better other classes at our expense. I am all for getting aa to enhance other classes, but not while I sit in PoT waiting to hear if we won.</div></div><hr />

We would be rocking. I could live with this kinda mana replenish to the group, but feeding my mana directly is a bad idea and a AA i would never get or lie about having if i did ;)[/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Hrmm, i just had a thought, a badly timed AE can cannicide a whole group, we would be hated in that circumstance heh. But i do see what you are saying although not a totally bad idea I don't find it being the most useful simply because anytime someone really needs mana on a raid it is usually an AE that does mana drain and health at the same time, at least from what i am expieriencing. it would reeally suck if you timed it bad for that aspect alone and the cleric line sacrifice groups hitpoints for a player, your tank would be alive but you kill everyone else =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure where you are going with this, if it is an activated AA what would be the difference of hitting a hotkeyed spell or gem all the time opposed to a hotkeyed AA?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If it is an activated aa it won't take up a spell gem, leaving you with 8 spells to pick, rather than 7 and Canni IV</div></div><hr />

At times when I'm on healing duty, the wolf is the only thing I have doing DPS, so a 75 point DR nuke going off a few times a minute would at least add something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Disgruntled Sony Sales Advisor VI<br />
Summons a companion sales advisor from the Sony executive board with the following abilities:<br />
&quot;Cut Technical Support Funding&quot; - arbitrarily cancels the accounts of people in a 30 foot radius of the caster.<br />
&quot;Unscheduled Downtime&quot; - crashes the server. Upon returning online (random, 5-10 hours, every 30 minutes a &quot;GM&quot; will spam &quot;Just a few more minutes!&quot; in the chat room) a long-winded apology will be spammed in the chat windows of all opponents.<br />
-&quot;Create Crappyass Expansion&quot; - Instantly charges $30 on the SOE accounts of all party members. Party members are immediately transported to a new zone (roughly 5 cubic feet) where mobs hit for 7000 and you instantly die. Corpses cannot be recovered until the next expansion.<br />
-&quot;Fire Balance Team&quot; - All mobs in the zone hit for 20,000 damage, all your spells cast over one hour and have 1% their original effect. Except Wizards. Wizards can nuke for 9.6x10^26 damage while this is under effect.<br />
-&quot;Hire Emergency Public Relations Workers&quot; - spawns 590 miniature humanoid(?) forms named 'Brenlo' which shout various extremely vague generalities like &quot;It's working as intended&quot; and &quot;We are aware of this but may or may not actually be working on it.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Rybit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Maybe a damage mitigation AA/spell (sort of like a reverse-slow) that works on your whole group and is active for 2 minutes and has a refresh time of 15 minutes (if it is made into an AA).  This would drastically reduce the amount of damage one takes (such as reducing damage by 60-75% and decreasing the chances dramatically that you'll be hit). Useable for emergencies and boss encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">How about an autocast SoW on anyone who sends me a tell.  Level 2 could automatically put on ignore anyone who actually uses the words &quot;sow plz&quot;.<br />

That way I could actually walk through a newbie zone and not have to go /anon and pretend to be a rogue (GM brewer's corker does actually come in handy once in a while).</div></div><hr />

AA to really fix RB? Nah too much to ask... an aa that grants perm double attack with a prereq of RB hmm prolly still wont get it :(<br />
Other classes get a double attack aa it wouldnt break us.<br />
<br />
Some type of group heal...<br />
<br />
Improved Invis -- Way way past due.<br />
<br />
Would not mind borrowing Hobble of Spirits from the BLs either.<br />
Give us a reason to actually want a pet up.<br />

aa for HoT crits and increased amount<br />
<br />
curse adept -- lower the reuse timer on curses<br />
<br />
For spells I would love to see an all-in-one buff...<br />
Focus, sta, str, dex, agi, cha, ac, sow, haste, and attack....<br />
Wishful thinking I know but saving buff slots would not suck.<br />
At least combine SOME of them to make a better focus...<br />
Shoot I would settle for hp, str, dex, sow and attack.<br />
Just combine bi'lih and focus or something.<br />
<br />
A Tigir upgrade 4 target 60% with a -40 resist adjust (Yes an AE version of Nihil)<br />
<br />
A more complete complete heal ;) this should also have already been done as part of the heal balance. Our ratios are now in line on our heals but for our complete heal.<br />
<br />
Abilities... BASH another thing way past due.<br />
<br />
I could think of many more but enough for now ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Would rather see them fix the original than add more aa's to fix it. But something to make RABID BEAR worth using would be nice. <br />
<br />
Seriously, untill you get elemental access and either Staff of eternal flames or sharkspine staff, melee just isn't even relevant with the available weapon choices. Especially if the only decent melee we can push out is using an ability that refreshes every 2 hours and lasts 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

  Feign Death.  And I would glady pay any AA cost for it.<br />

EDIT:  Just to point it out for those reading before morning coffee, this would let us DoT as carefree as a necro does since we could finally DROP AGGRO.</div></div><hr />

Some kind of fast recast stun.  Quarter of a second stun with a 2.2 sec refresh would be fine.  Shaman have next to no recourse for stopping a gater/caster, except hope that dogdog gets lucky.  Shouldn't we have SOME way to stop a caster?  :p<br />
