<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone explain how or who gets the most (or least, for that matter) debt in a near-wipe...first man down? last man down? survivors? <br />
<br />
From what I've read and heard, the debt isn't spread equally among group members, but I haven't been able to find a definitive answer to this anywhere.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To my knowledge it's spread out equally, based upon the level of the player that dies among the group.  A higher level player may not get the same amount as a lower player, though, because the amount of death debt lost at a lower player's level is probably less for them.  <br />
<br />
I don't think it has anything to do with who goes down first.  If it's one death, it's probably based on the penalty for that level, spread among the group.  If it's several, it's probably the averaged based upon the dead players' levels.  Again, the higher player may receive less penalty.  <br />
<br />
You may think that it's unfair, but consider if the group breaks up...you go out and kill 10 blue mobs solo to make up for the debt.  The same mobs could be grey to the higher player, so they shouldn't have to kill  10 blue mobs of a level that could be orange or red to you, which is something you may not be able to do.  That wouldn't be fair either.  Maybe they have to kill 5 blue to him and orange/red to you mobs to make up for theirs.  Works out about the same, in terms of difficulty.<br />
<br />
At least this is how I understand it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It does matter.<br />
<br />
When the first person dies, you all share 1/6 of the debt. But if that first person releases to their bind point, then they won't share in the loss of all the rest.<br />
<br />
If everyone releases when they die, then the last man standing will eat all 5 of the previous people's deaths and SOLO his own Xp debt.<br />
<br />
He will have easily a half yellow bubble more debt more than the first person that died.<br />
<br />
It's really bad form to release when your group is wiping, unless you are near the bind point and can come try to help. (Plus, if you are in the same zone when you die and are nearby, you will still share in the debt.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is this shared debt system mandatory or can you turn it off and use a regular normal system?<br />
<br />
If mandatory, I predict people growing unhappy with it over time.<br />
<br />
The shared debt and the limit of 4 toons per account are the two biggest negatives I've heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is this shared debt system mandatory or can you turn it off and use a regular normal system?<br />
No way to turn it off. It's that way for a reason.<br />
<br />
I will say that it's forced groups I've been in to get rid of bad players, though. In EQ1, there was a tendancy to let bad players tag along and just watch them die every so often. In EQ2, I find that my groups will quickly replace a bad player if they come across one.<br />
<br />
Example: The other night we had a guy who would stop responding every so often. His character would stop moving, no spell casting, nothing. And when he was around, he would pull mobs nearby, regardless of whether we were currently taking on an encounter or not. He finally said that he was getting up and playing with his cat every so often because, &quot;it looked so cute.&quot; We talked him into giving someone else group leadership and kicked him out. He followed us around yelling for awhile, but no one responded to him and we picked up someone else to fill his spot. :)<br />

No I don't have my mind made up. I was leaning EQ 2 but now waffling between EQ 2 and WoW. I don't want to buy both though so expect me to continue nitpicking till I make up my mind. :)<br />
<br />
A lot about EQ 2 I find attractive but I have to say I do like one major thing about WoW: it looks more fully immersed in the core high fantasy genre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My gut feeling is that WoW appeals to those who miss early EQ days when the game was more high fantasy and more stylized. And that EQ 2 appeals to those who feel like EQ1 has grown stale and they want something fresher and more modern. But I know generalizations are not valid over everyone, just saying it seems to be a trend among people I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">*shrugs*<br />
<br />
I am in EQ 2 because of the game immersion. WoW looks cartoonish to me.<br />
<br />
Both games have personal appeal to different people.  Some will think that EQ 2 is visually more appealing, while others will feel that way about WoW.  Some will swear the EQ 2 is dumbed down, while others will say the same thing about WoW game play.<br />
<br />
Whatever you want to find great about each game is there, as well as whatever you want to find wrong.<br />
<br />
I just hope that whatever game people end up playing that they enjoy and leave the rest of us to enjoy whatever game we have decided to play without all the: U sux cuz u play (insert whatever game you aren't playing here) and other random insults for no apparent reason that have been plaguing sites for all the games.<br />
<br />
To each their own and all.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but thats just a horrible story.<br />
<br />
Mind you, i understand why it went down like that, but its horrible cause you were forced to do it. I wouldnt want someone in my group that was potentialy going cause us all exp lose. I have to say this is the first thing in EQ2 i have heard of that really made me step back and go ... omg thats bull****.<br />
<br />
Ill take durability deaths all day over that heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For once I agree with ya Lit.  Main reason I'm not playing EQ2 right now, I think the shared death debt is bullsh1t.  Who came up with this great idea?  Probably some warrior.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">*Shrug* I like the fact that there's a system that forces people to pay attention to what they're doing. I wasn't too keen on the idea from the outset, but they've got it tuned where it isn't a huge issue. If another group member dies, you're looking at around 2-3% of XP debt if they get a rez or recover their shard. That's made up in 3 or 4 group kills. Again, it's very minimal, but it's enough so that it will make people do their best to keep group mates alive, because it can stack up on you if you're not doing your job.<br />
<br />
I've had maybe 1 or 2 groups so far in both beta and retail where I've left with more than a few percentage points of XP debt. <br />

Now all those knuckleheads that kept getting you killed in EQ1 are taking xp hits when they 'forget to heal' or 'accidentally target the mezzed mob'. :)</div></div><hr />

I've been trying to teach some of my friend tactics regarding aggro and crowd control. Some of them are a bit dense. The xp debt problem is very frustrating and means sometimes I just don't have the patience to sit and babysit them while they figure out that nuking every 2 seconds is going to attract the mob's attention away from the tank...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">One death is really not a big deal when talking about shared debt.  Really.  It's not.  It takes like 3 to 5 mobs to make it up.<br />

<br />

<br />
 I disagree with that, the system as it is now stinks and here is why.<br />
<br />
1. And this happened to me. Party in Stormhold, full group we wipe due to a bad pull. When u release u end up outside stormhold, ok np zone back in ........ummm I am in but group is still grayed out. Oh they are in Stormhold2 I am in stormhold3. Cant reach group so can't get any debt payed back, suck up 113% debt have a nice day. And I thought this game was beta tested? I myself hope they fix this one or else your on your own in some zones. <br />
<br />
2. The debt system only makes it so u won't deding you are still losing exp, but I agree its better then dedinging. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. It seams if you are the last to die you get more debt then the rest of the group, my be wrong on that but I asked rest of group what there debt was and seemed to be diff for each member even tho we where all same level.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Last night got group died np got shard back had 4% debt, killed 5 mobs all white con got down to 1% or what should have been 1% but now my debt went up ?????? Check with group Mmmmm same thing , killed mobs got back down to 1% then it took 3 times what I killed to get 3% back just to get the 1% back and get even, all white cons all the same mobs. I think the system has a lot of bugs still and needs lots of work still. <br />
<br />
 I myself like things about both systems but if they ever get it working like it should it would be ok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Your point number one has nothing to do with debt, but a (depending on your point of view) bug with how players are placed in zones with multiple instances.  I personally feel this is a bug, and that members of the same party should ALWAYS be placed in the same instance of a zone.<br />
<br />
Point three, you are wrong.  The difference is that you see greater debt until you recover your shard.  Let's say my party wipes.  I have a HUGE debt at the point we all revive.  Now, a HUGE portion of that debt will be repaid - as soon as I recover *my* shard.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you simply need a little more experience with the system yet.  There may yet be bugs in it, real programming bugs, but I've not seen any.  I managed to get killed 5 times in Stormhold in a 2 hour span, but never saw anything that I can say was a programming type bug.</div></div><hr />

I believe your shard remains in the instance you died in. That's why you can't recover shards from personal instances simply by creating a new instance zone. If you died in instance 2 and then zoned into instance 3, I don't believe you would have found a shard.<br />

For instance, we had someone die in BB3 the other night (late) where we were the only ones in the zone.  The rest of us made a run for the exit and made it out.  We zoned back in and BB3 had closed, gone.  Still got the shard in BB1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummm that is wrong btw your shard will be in what ever zone you died in . Don't matter what instance it is your shard will ALWAYS be there. The problem is that you group which with you where powerful enough to get to where you died at is no longer with you. So now alone you can not get your shard back. The problem is not the zone instance it is that the game on its own has split you from your group there fore making it impossable short of /disbanding and getting a new group to go get your shard</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Try it on level 3 of Stormhold by yourself Hehehehe can't do it with out the group that helped you to get down there. Unless you know something I don't about that zone? <br />
My post said nothing about the shard not being or being able to get to it. It said the GROUP was not there, my point is the game should not split a group between 2 diff zones like that. It should be smart enough to know that a group needs to stay together after a death to get there shards and also to repay debt as a group something that you don't get from the group members who are in zone2 while you are in zone1</div></div><hr />

True and I'm seeing the newer players having to climb that curve more now that the game has been out a few weeks.  Also, what debt does is make people scared of it and once incurred, obsessed with getting the shard back.  However, the same happened in EQ1 regarding lost xp.  Many players would die and then spend over an hour trying to get a 96% rez when they could have just taken a lower level rez and gotten the xp back in just a few minutes.<br />
<br />
I'm finding I just have to be more careful with who I group with and feel very lucky to have a regular duo partner.  The game is still fairly new though and hopefully a lot of players will be through the curve soon. :)<br />
<br />
1. And this happened to me. Party in Stormhold, full group we wipe due to a bad pull. When u release u end up outside stormhold, ok np zone back in ........ummm I am in but group is still grayed out.

<br />
EQ2 needs some more work whenever instanced zones, shards, and groups are involved.  However, your particular problem could have been solved if your group had zoned out and everyone met up outside of Stormhold, for example.  I had that same problem except one of the group members shards had been merged into another one of the instances!  Luckily it was fairly crowded so CR was very easy.<br />
<br />
2. The debt system only makes it so u won't deding you are still losing exp, but I agree its better then dedinging.<br />
<br />
I don't really care much about losing a level.  If you had happened to lose a level, you should still be so close to getting it back that a few minutes of xp will ding you.  We'll have to see how this works out later in the game though with raids and higher level dungeons.<br />
<br />
3. It seams if you are the last to die you get more debt then the rest of the group, my be wrong on that but I asked rest of group what there debt was and seemed to be diff for each member even tho we where all same level.<br />
<br />
Totally!  This has to be a bug and has been brought up a few times on Sony's EQ2 boards.  Not only does the last to die (or be rezzed / revive, forget which) but the shared debt is not calculating correctly either.  Any time my group has wiped I have ended up with a lot more than 2.5% debt.<br />
<br />
4. Last night got group died np got shard back had 4% debt, killed 5 mobs all white con got down to 1% or what should have been 1% but now my debt went up ?????? Check with group Mmmmm same thing , killed mobs got back down to 1% then it took 3 times what I killed to get 3% back just to get the 1% back and get even, all white cons all the same mobs. I think the system has a lot of bugs still and needs lots of work still. <br />
<br />
I have noticed this too, never more than 1% though.  It seems that when debt is calculated it really doesn't like to take tenths into the equation (rounding up) until you reach your debt %, then it decides to round up, appearing as though you have more debt.<br />
<br />
I myself like things about both systems but if they ever get it working like it should it would be ok<br />
<br />
The system should work very well and add the same risk / reward for dangerous encounters, but not the stupidly difficult task of CR'ing without gear in such a dangerous encounter.  There has to be some kind of risk and a smoothly running debt system looks like a good solution.<br />
<br />
I believe your shard remains in the instance you died in. That's why you can't recover shards from personal instances simply by creating a new instance zone. If you died in instance 2 and then zoned into instance 3, I don't believe you would have found a shard.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have seen a players shard be moved to another zone instance, and it's really annoying! :)  My experience was as follows (involves a combination of grouping, instanced zones, and shards):<br />
<br />
Group of 6 in Blackburrow2.  When we zoned in we all got into Blackburrow2 and were the only ones in the zone.  Blackburrow1 had close to 30 people in it.  We had a tough fight with a few pops that added and ended up losing a couple group members.  One of them ended up reviving thinking we had wiped, when we did end up making it through the encounter with a few group members left.  When the revived group member got back to Blackburrow she could not get into Blackburrow2 any longer, so zoned into Blackburrow1 to find she had a corpse trail.  She tried several times to get back into Blackburrow2 so some of the group zoned out, only to find the same problem - no Blackburrow2.  We all zoned out, back into Blackburrow1, got her shard and went about xping in Blackburrow1.<br />
<br />
Instances should remain available as long as there is a single player in it, *especially* if you are grouped with players in an inaccessable instance!<br />
<br />
You can recover a shard in any instance of the zone.<br />
<br />
For instance, we had someone die in BB3 the other night (late) where we were the only ones in the zone.  The rest of us made a run for the exit and made it out.  We zoned back in and BB3 had closed, gone.  Still got the shard in BB1.<br />
<br />
Yup, it seems as though shards can be assimilated into other instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Actually I do.<br />
<br />
You need an INT caster who has Invis and willing to help you.  Seems that EQ2, unlike EQLive,  doesn't make a distinction between alive and undead when Invis is considered.<br />
<br />
He casts it on you and waits while you go recover your shard.  You'll have to group with him temporarily and he has to remain in the zone, best if he stays near the exit for safety.</div></div><hr />

Do not try this in Fallen Gate. The scout mobs see invis and there are a few of them. <br />
On the other hand, Fallen gate should allow the &quot;click on entrance&quot; to recover your shard. Not sure if it was mentioned in this thread or some other.<br />
<br />
The easiest way to recover a shard is to find someone a few levels higher. Chances are that the mobs will turn grey to you when grouped with him. Still I think that there should be mechanisms to summon shards, like summon corpse, or drag corpses. Otherwise a dungeon crawl can become a very unpleasant experience.<br />
 <br />
At level 20+ a group wipe gives me about one bubble (10%) of debt, and it takes at least one hour in a decent group to get out of that. I find the shared debt system to be unnecessary. A priest that lets the tank die is kicked out of group fast, as well as any other char who does not pull his weight. Such a someone is already hurting the group because everyone gets less exp and less loot, thats enough of a penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">There is no difference.<br />
<br />
In a group situation (full group) when one person dies, the debt from that death is split evenly among all 6 players.  (assuming the system is working as intended).  So, if you are the one who dies, you accrue only 1/6 of the debt you normally would.<br />
<br />
If all 6 of you die (you being one of the 6) you would accrue 6/6 of the debt you would normally accrue.  Well, yea, duh, you died.<br />
<br />
Now, compared to the EQLive system, it's the same thing.  In EQLive, when you die, you simply &quot;lost&quot; the experience.  Gone.  You had to &quot;re-earn&quot; that experience.  You lost between 6 and 10%, possibly losing a level in the process.<br />
<br />
Now, with EQ2, you never &quot;lose&quot; experience.  You go in debt.  While in debt, you are still *gaining* experience.  You can level up while in debt, gain spells, etc.  The only difference is that half of your experience goes toward your debt, while the other half goes toward moving you forward.<br />
<br />
So, in EQLive, you had to earn a strait 10% experience to recover from a death.  In EQ2, you have to actually earn 20% to recover from a death.  The difference is that when you pay off your debt in EQ2, you are also 10% farther along toward your next level.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
A player in EQLive is at 80% toward his next level.  Dies.  Now he's at 70%.  In order to get to 90%, he must earn 20%.<br />
<br />
A player in EQ2 is at 80% toward his next level.  Dies.  Now he's still at 80%, but has debt until 90%.  He must earn 20% experience to get to 90% since half his experience goes to debt and half to experience.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, both players had to earn 20% experience following their death in order to get to 90%.<br />
<br />
There is no difference.</div></div><hr />

There's a difference.<br />
<br />
96% Exp rez = You lose ~1% or less than you started with. (I've been 10% into level, been killed, rezzed and came back still at 10% into level)<br />
<br />
The other difference is if you have people that give you a share of their exp loss death then release.<br />
<br />
When people release they don't share in YOUR death, meaning you could wind up theoretically with almost 2 full deaths of debt. (11/6ths)<br />
<br />
Not that I care, because it doesn't bother me a whole lot. I just wanted to bring up some inconsistencies in the math there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure there won't be a % rez in EQ2. I was just pointing out the differences.<br />
<br />
I also think the shared Exp debt thing is working as intended.<br />
<br />
All in all, it's a decent system, you just need to group with people that won't release and dump debt on people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Actually I don't think that part is working as intended.  I think that the debt should be equally shared regardless of release or not.  I believe that was how it was intended.<br />
<br />
My &quot;guess&quot; on how this slid by was that most of the &quot;dumping&quot; is happening when people die, release and the release removes them from the zone.  Since they are not in the zone, they don't share in the subsequent debt that accrues.<br />
<br />
For instance, a party of 6 in Stormhold, the last person to die will accrue HUGE debt if the previous 5 all release at death, since the nearest revive is in Antonica.<br />
<br />
I think that's a bug, and I'm going to bug it every time I log on and every time I die until it's fixed.  I encourage you to do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">K, :)<br />
<br />
I'll do that.. yeah, it sucks really bad especially since my Shaman is the last to die 9 times outta 10.<br />
<br />
But we've stopped people from releasing. It's just bad form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the problem though, there shouldn't be an option.  If the debt system were working as intended then the last person to die in a group wipe wouldn't share the debt for all the previous deaths while the first person to die doesn't.  I'm not sure exactly how it works with releasing and the order in which you die, but I do know that the more deaths prior to your own the more debt you will share, regardless of whether other members release or not.<br />
<br />
Last night I was with my duo partner and zoned into a white^^ in crypt...of something...(off of Vernin Snye) :)  Anyway, it ended up being too much for us, especially since we got jumped but we really tried.  She ended up dying *just* before she zoned (shakes fist at having to click on the instanced zone you want to go to hehe) but I was already zoning when she died.  I did not share any of her debt and she did not release.  I revived her and still did not share any debt.<br />
<br />
That's not working as intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Jaidin,<br />
Were you loading the new zone when she died?  maybe because you werent in the zone yet..  ahh just a thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I've died to a train in Blackburrow before where I clicked on the door and got the message &quot;Please select an instance&quot; I selected one and got the message &quot;That instance is full, please select another&quot; but I died shortly after getting that message.<br />
<br />
When I went to retrieve my shard it was in Antonica, so I'm thinking even though the person was still IN Vermin's Snye when they died, since they were in the &quot;Pick an instance&quot; interface it considered them to be in the other zone, even though it was mobs in the prior zone that killed them.<br />
<br />
It's kinda mind boggling how the process works, but I think that's the general idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">There is one other thing that people haven't pointed out about xp debt in EQ2:<br />
<br />
It goes away on its own over time.<br />
<br />
I know this for a fact.  I was having a bad night with some friends, group mobs that we usually kill without much effort were kicking our rears all over antonica.  In the span of about 3 hours we racked up over 2.5 yellows (25%) xp debt each.  We got fed up, called it a night and logged out.  I logged back in the next morning (about 6-8 hours-ish later) to find my staggering 25% xp debt had dwindled to 1% while I slept.<br />
<br />
A bad day can be completely countered by taking a break and doing something else: sleeping, watching some tv, playing an alt, tradeskilling, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Yes. Exp debt is removed by 1% per hour you are offline.<br />
<br />
So you can just not play and get your debt paid off that way as well.<br />
<br />
Actually I think it's been mentioned in some other threads, but it's a valid point to add to this thread.<br />
<br />
It's kinda nice.<br />
<br />
One thing to add, Exp debt doesn't reduce if you put yourself in trader mode.</div></div><hr />

Were you loading the new zone when she died?  maybe because you werent in the zone yet..  ahh just a thought...<br />
<br />
I was loading when she died for sure.<br />
<br />
I've died to a train in Blackburrow before where I clicked on the door and got the message &quot;Please select an instance&quot; I selected one and got the message &quot;That instance is full, please select another&quot; but I died shortly after getting that message.<br />
<br />
Aye, choosing an instance can be deadly if you are running for your life! :)<br />
<br />

<br />
That's how it worked for me too, her corpse ended up in Vermins Snye but she did for sure die in the Crypt.<br />

2.5 yellows = 25%? :)<br />
<br />
I had no idea that debt went away when you are idle, wow!  I wonder if that's in the manual somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">It doesn't go away when you are Idle (Online in trader mode)<br />
<br />
It only goes away when you are not logged in at all.</div></div><hr />

Ack ya sorry, meant to say offline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Also, Stormhold appears to be bugged. EVERY other instanced zone you can pick which number you want, but not this zone.  Which makes for a pain in the ass when the group wipes.<br />
<br />
  Had a guildy go linkdead deep down in the dungeon in our group, he came back on in a DIFFERENT instance number, there was a full pop in that instance, he died, so did we eventually, and it was a fun time to be had by all :P<br />
<br />
  They need to put some code in to remember which instance someone was in when they went linkdead, and let us pick which Stormhold!  Yes I /bugged it.  Theyve been keeping the patches coming pretty quickly, Im confident they'll fix this.</div></div><hr />
