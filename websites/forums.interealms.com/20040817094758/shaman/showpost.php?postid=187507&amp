	<p>I've actually talked this out with my roommate, who was in the position to discuss this very topic with her guild.  We spent quite a while hammering out a progression, even going to far as to have index cards with mob stats on them color-coded to more cards with loot to build a big progression tower in the middle of the living room floor.  It was almost fun.  Yes, we're mentally ill.<br />
<br />
I'll start where they were at, and run up the scale.<br />
<br />
<i>So, you want to build a high-end raiding guild from scratch?</i><br />
<br />
Starting with a motivated pool of about 25 active players per night, all in the 56-62 range, but with absolutely no raid experience whatsoever, how do you build a guild to rival the giants?<br />
<br />
1. Recruit and Focus.  25 people per night will do for awhile, but eventually that will run dry.  Also, specific class issues (clerics, warriors, enchanters, wizards) are often an issue.  Make sure that your guild has a policy of helping each other, of generosity, and of integrity.  To be a dark horse guild and make it to the top, you need to depend on each other.  If people are in the guild for the personal loot and glory ... now's when they should look elsewhere - this guild stands together as a team.<br />
<br />
2. Destroy Kael Drakkel.  A green guild needs to learn how to raid before it can hit a real target.  Go old school.  Take the Kael Arena.  Drop the named.  Play around with the Protectors of Zek, and the named Clerics.  This isn't about loot, although you'll get some legs and BPs if you are lucky.  Its about learning how to raid, and how to deal with things like pinning and push and aggro control.  It also builds faction, which is valuable.<br />
<br />
3. Levels.  Set aside about a couple nights a week for levels.  Make it an organized thing.  You get bonus points for organized levelling that ALSO gears up the guild.  I recommend Umbral Planes (Moktor armor is passably good, Raldukan BPs are amazing, and Gantru Dralkenr drops nice bracers, even still).  I also recommend Temple of Droga.  There are eight zillion rares in there, and some very solid drops.  Nothing sees invis, so CR is free.  Have the stronger groups farm the big weapons from Droga - the sword off Gamolk and the hammer off Dronan.  Other folks can do camps like the Kingly Boots of Splendor (Japal) and the Enchanted Sash of Wonder (31% haste, Runri).  Make cooperation towards gearing up the guild while you do levels an overarching goal.  Now isn't the time for selfishness.<br />
<br />
4. Questing.  Benevolence is easy once you have the faction and is still easy.  Perform the quest as often as possible.  Put a tracker out in WW for Scout Charisa.  This is monotonous, but it helps build up everyone's gear.  Remember, gear helps morale, and you're going to need it where you're going.  Consider working in at least a few Circlets of the Falinkan as well.  That's a harder quest, but well worth it.  Help the devoted complete their shawls.  Help the OTHER devoted get to at least ring 9.  On many servers, you may be able to partner with other guilds (or announce open support) in order to get folks ring 10.<br />
<br />
5. Selected epics.  If the guild is committed to running for the top, then 80% of the guild is likely to do without.  Clerics, though, are a must.  Make the Chardok Overking fear your coming.  Let Ragefire teach you about dragon casting range, and mobs with an AE.  This will be an ongoing project for awhile, but you'll want at least a cleric epic or 2 before proceeding.  You can also get Shamans, Rogue, and Beastlord epics, because they are trivially easy, and of course complete anyone's who manages to be convienient.  Bard epics are good, too ... but may have to wait, as Trakanon is a tougher cookie.<br />
<br />
5. Halls of Testing.  Don't be like the guilds of yesteryear.  You aren't here to put your guild in solid HoT armor.  You're here to learn about more complicated pulling, dealing with AEs, aggro ranges, and raid encounters that can gate.  At this point, you should be finishing up the last of the Benevolence and Falinkan runs, and say your farewells to the dragons.  Don't bother with Dozekar quests.  They are really good, but he's harder than you're ready for, and, really, you aren't going to be here long.<br />
<br />
6. Derakor the Vindicator.  As you become comfortable in HoT, and start to move towards its close, begin on Derakor.  Kill Derakor daily before you start other events, if you can.  Kill him before you go to HoT.  Kill him before you do a Benevolence run.  Kill him before you send folks off to XP.  If you have a large raid window (weekends perhaps), then come back and kill him again when you're done.  If you aren't sick to death of seeing Derakor, you haven't killed him enough.  Continue this ... until you're done with him, although you can taper off slowly.<br />
<br />
7. Servitor of Luclin.  The int-caster payoff mob to go with Derakor.  While not up as often, she has two drops per spawn.  The common drops are the Wand of Musing, which has 100 mana and FT1 and will be better than int caster epics (except wizards), and the Mask of Pulchritude, which pretty much every enchanter and necromancer in your guild will want, plus a fair number of SKs and other int casters.<br />
<br />
8. Interlude.  Now's the last moment your guild has to turn back.  Finish up recruiting - for now.  Finish the last random quests.  Grab a couple more cleric epics.  Now's a good time for bard epics, too.  Check levels.  If you can get shots at him, work The Va'Dyn into your schedule of kills at this time also.  If you're doing Derakor, you can do Va'Dyn.  He drops a LOT of crap, but his good pieces are worth it.  Post a date that the easy times end and stick with it.  On that day ...<br />
<br />
9. Betray the Dragons.  Put your pulling skills to work with Eashen of the Sky.  Know him, love him.  He's easy to get to, and some of the best loot in Velious.  Try to monopolize him.  Also ... make Aaryonar your enemy.  Your guild WILL hate Aary.  There are lots of guides to him, make sure your members read them.  If you follow directions well, Aary's not that bad, but if you're like most folks at this point, you will wipe, and you'll wipe a lot.  In order to keep morale up during this, hit other targets as well.  More Derakor, of course, but also more Va'Dyn.  Attempt the Statue of Rallos Zek if you can get a shot at it.  Also consider a couple Plane of Nightmare mobs at this point, especially Terror Matriarch and the big croc.  Once you beat Aary, press the advantage.  Hit the easy kills in NToV.  Skip Lord Vyemm.  Skip Lady Nevedaria (at least at first).  Make sure your pull team can split the Triplets.  And fasten your seatbelts.  At the same time, hit anything else you can find in Velious.  First Brood dragons.  Statue.  Maybe even Tormax.  I don't like killing Dain, because of the faction for Ringwars, but your mileage may vary there.<br />
<br />
10. Recruit More.  A successful NToV-raiding guild has more prestige than a wanna-be guild.  Fill in the holes and get the numbers up.  Be more selective about gear and levels, but remember that you will just need more people where you are going.  Help those whose levels aren't towing the line to catch up - if they will be active members.  You're changing the face of the guild, so you should expect some sad goodbyes from those who cannot or do not wish to change.  Don't let it sink the ship.<br />
<br />
11. Xanamech Nexmirthifen.  A lot of people try to put First Brood farming in here, along with a potential run in ST.  Don't bother.  You'll spend forever getting enough keys for everyone (unless you've been VERY lucky in Kael).  It better to make the big jump.  At this point, you are used to big AEs (NToV), and mobs that hit hard (Derakor/Va'Dyn/other stuff in NToV/Statue).  Combine the ideas and work Xana over.  Once you've beaten him, keep on beating him.  His reuse timer is speedy, consider doing him even twice a day.  Every warrior should own a hammer.  Every active melee will need a collar.  Int casters who don't have better will want a Phase Emitter.  Rings should go to wis casters first, then int casters who had better than the Emitter to start with.  This will take a little while, simply becuase of the volume of drops you want, but it does more to speed a guild up faster than anything else in the game.  Only Derakor is close, and he doesn't hold a candle to the robodragon.<br />
<br />
12. Glitz.  Hit some "glitz" targets.  They may not be the best for progress, but they help morale and make you feel useful.  Take Rhag 1/2 if you can get a shot at them.  Do Itraer Vius and Cazic Thule for Flowing Thought.  Consider trying the Burrower Beast (especially later in the Xana farming) and Grieg Veneficus as well as Thought Horror Overfiend (if you can get a copy or 2 of Remove Greater Curse).  On low-turnout days, do other mobs like Rallius Rattican, Vhaksiz the Shade, and the Ring of Slime in CT, to keep momentum going, to add variety, and to help fill in slots that Xanamech doesn't cover.  When you can, take out the Manaetic Prototypes to reward your wis casters (and enchanters) for their hard work.  Make getting a win on The Avatar of War a goal (and hope for at least 1 Blade of Carnage).  Drornok Tok'Vo'Lok in Plane of Storms is another good choice that is often overlooked.<br />
<br />
12. Guild Status Check.  Check your levels, classes, and overall guild health, and address any problems.  By now, you should be fielding a healthy raid force of 35+, and your levels should be in the mid 60s.  You should have a good mix of classes, with plenty of clerics and chanters, dependable tanks, a pull staff, and support.<br />
<br />
13. Decision Making.  Here's when you get to choose.  Do you follow the road to VT, or blaze on past the upper Luclin content?  I recommend skipping VT.  Emperor is easily bottlenecked, as is VT itself.  The rest of this guide will be written under the assumption that you won't be hitting VT, and will give only passing service to Ssra Temple at all.<br />
<br />
14. Encourage a Tradeskill Staff.  If you havent' already, organize the guild tradeskillers.  Show them respect and appreciation.  Components for PoNightmare crafted armors are easily available, PoStorms armor components may be a bit harder to come by but are still out there.  Use these materials, BD cultural, Valor Rings, Nightmare Amulets, whatever else you can get, to fill in the holes in your guild's gear.<br />
<br />
15. Announce the Push.  At this point, you have a practiced, cooperative raid force.  They've lived together, worked together, and equipped each other.  Its time for one of those inspiring leadership posts, where you harkon back to the day you declared Aaryonar your guild's sword enemy (and any other similar mob that gave you trouble, but finally got its just desserts) - but this time, the target isn't just one mob, its a whole chartful.  Get some sort of organized flagging table visible to the member-access section of your board or website. Explain that when the guild starts to deal with each flag, the goal is at least 90% completion - that is, 90% of the active guild mains shouls have the flag.  Start by organizing teams for the Trials.  Its good teamwork, its fairly fast, and it shows folks just how big a commitment 90% really is.  This also gets folks a free AA and some charm stats, so they'll be happy.<br />
<br />
16. XP and AA.  This is the last big chance to rush XP for a bit.  The guild needs to work their way up to 65, and important classes need their key AA.  Work in teams, and target LDoN as a major source of experience, becuase it also provides gear and spells via AP.  At the same time, make sure someone gets a key to Aerin'Dar's lair - before you kill him.  When folks aren't in LDoN, consider focusing on Bastion of Thunder.  Like Droga, its full of great drops that can be passed around to help everyone - including ornate armor that will likely be a much needed upgrade.  And you'll want Tower keys, real soon.<br />
<br />
15. BoT Keys.  Sure you don't need them anymore, really, but its part of progression, a free AA, and more charm stats.  Its also good teamwork.  You're a guild capable of big targets, so don't hesitate to kill the PoS Lords as well as the minis for medallions (and loot) - although the gimmicky Ocean Lord is usually more trouble than he's worth.<br />
<br />
16. Hedge Mazes.  Mix in a few Hedge runs with the BoT keys and the AA push and the Trials and the raid kills of previous steps' mobs.  This flag is an easy one to forget about.<br />
<br />
17. Grummus.  Once you've gotten near 90% on your 3 easy flags (Trial, BoT, Hedge), start actively trying for your shot at Grummus.  Its important to have impressed upon the need for the easy 3 flags first - and keep that table up to date! - or they get forgotten (I'm in an Elemental guild, and its just embarassing when someone's trying to figure out why they STILL need a Visa ... and its the Hedge Maze).  With all the other mobs you've killed, Grummus shouldn't be too big of a challenge.  Put him on farm status, his gear isn't bad.<br />
<br />
18. BoT Towers.  Like Xanamech, Servitor, and Derakor before them, the BoT Tower bosses are farm bait.  You'll need an Agnarr key eventually, but this is mostly for loot.  Plus, the big mobs like Grummus and the stuff still to come won't always be there, and its <i>always</i> about the push.<br />
<br />
19. Terris Thule. Its tempting to want to hit Behemoth early, but he's a much harder target.  TT isn't too tough, but most of all, her encounter is unique.  Unique means less boring, which is good for morale.  She also drops excellent loot for the challenge, including a really amazing mask and bracer - 2 slots that are often crap.  This means, she, too goes on farm mode.<br />
<br />
20. Aerin'Dar.  Get AD out of the way.  AD's loot is the opposite of good.  Use AD to demonstrate how bad backflagging can be and to urge for good attendance.  Don't hesitate to encourage people to get AD flags in pickup raids or flag trading deals, but DO kill him twice or so, he's a "warmup" for Rydda.<br />
<br />
21. Filling in the Chart.  Work on your first "backflagging" as you push for 90%+ completeness on everything to this point.  You'll be trickling new folks in, both to counter attrition, and to build up to the 60+ raid forces you'll want soon.  Make sure no one gets left behind.  Those 2 new clerics, new chanter, and new SK don't do any good sitting outside the zone waiting.  Add the 2 easy HoH Trials to the list of active targets.  You'll want to do Villagers as seldom as possible, but "Virgins" (or whatever you call it) has some decent loot.  Now's a good time to get 2 keys to Saryrn's Tower, too.  You'll only actually NEED one, but I promise you'll want 2.  The key is cursed; if you're guild only has one, that player's computer WILL die, they will get a new job, or they will be hit by a car.  Trust me.<br />
<br />
22. Behemoth.  Name Behemoth as your next guild enemy.  Many do well with this encounter early, other guild fail repeatedly.  You're likely to have some competition, too.  Tactics access is a sweet thing, though.  Its well worth it.  I like farming Behemoth for loot, but your mileage may vary.  Strike for as close to 100% flagging on this one as you can, its too valuable to play around with.<br />
<br />
23. Rapid Progress.  You have lots of targets now.  Make use of them.  Learn Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek and make use of their friendly loot tables.  Hit Saryrn, too, and learn to hate Sorrowsong (unless you have access to someone who has killed Bertox, you'll have to come back for the Keeper of Souls, but its nice to kill Saryrn early for morale).  Don't forget to keep the numbers high on old events, like the (non-Rydda) Honor Trials, and kill stuff like Grummus and Terris Thule for loot when you're out of real flag mobs.<br />
<br />
24. Carprin.  Start doing Carprin runs.  The gear might still have use for a few, but the event is long and dull.  If Ahvi (the mob that spawns adds when players or pets die) is a problem, then use the PoStorms Ocean Lord as a practice dummy (he's harder than Ahvi).  Raex, the unslowable General with the 5k lifetap proc is the first mob that's likely to be a threat of "one-rounding" your tanks.  Get used to dealing with the dangers.  Becuase this is a key and not a flag, you REALLY want near 100% flagging here.<br />
<br />
25. Agnarr.  By now, you should be swimming in loot from the Zeks, BoT Towers, and Tier 1 gods.  Its time for Agnarr.  He's a long, complex event, that's a lot easier than it appears at first.  In my opinion, Agnarr seperates the easy part of PoP flagging from the hard part.<br />
<br />
26. Rydda'Dar.  Work on Rydda next.  For some guilds, Rydda seems easy.  For others, its the hardest thing until Rallos.  You'll just have to find an approach that works for you.  Play up Aaryonar comparisons to the veterans who've been with you the whole time. =)<br />
<br />
27. Guild Check.  Now's a great time for another guild update.  At this point, you're a major player on the server, and one that came out of nowhere, to boot.  Use the reputation that gives you to fill in what you're missing.  You're going to want to be pushing the max raid size of 72 as your raidforce for the steps ahead.  Of course, you'll need to backflag ... but if you're doing it right, that should be one kill of each flag mob to catch you all back up (and flag a few of those slacker 10%).<br />
<br />
28. Two of the Big Three.  Its time to buckle down and hit 2 of the PoP Big Three.  The order doesn't matter, and will be decided by opportunity more than planning.  You want to see Lord Mithaniel Marr and Bertox dead to your hands.  It will take a lot of time and effort, but if you've come this far, your team will persevere.<br />
<br />
29. Solusek's Tower.  Start actively farming Sol Ro.  Encourage folks to hit it on offtimes to spread ornate around.  Destroy the minibosses - they fill in slots that are likely weak or missing in your current gear sets (like the lucky 7 monk stick and the Necro dot-focus range-slot).  Try to play this off as gearing-up and prep-work, more than just more flagging.  You are getting ready for something big.<br />
<br />
30. Rallos Zek.  He's big.  He's bad.  He's like nothing you've ever encountered before.  Just keep focused on the goal ... he's all that's in the way of hitting the Elementals.  If Rallos failures are threatening burnout, take a night off, and do something fun.  Hit an LDoN raid, or go mow down NToV for nostalgia.  Return fresh the next day.  If someone else kills Rallos, use the time between spawns to polish off backflagging, or maybe even hit some mob that you skipped on your race to the top (Cursed is EXCELLENT here, just for the shot at Bloodfrenzy; so is Lord Seru, if you managed to get a key and a couple Bane weapons along the way).<br />
<br />
I won't bother with a numbered list to get you from there to Time ... You'll have to do Sol Ro, of course, and PoE-B keys, and the 4 Elemental Pantheon gods ... but once you're on the Elementals, you're where you want to be, at the top of the game.  Love those minibosses, and gear up like crazy.  It only gets harder from there.</p>
