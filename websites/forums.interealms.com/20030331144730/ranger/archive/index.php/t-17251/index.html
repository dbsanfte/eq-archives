<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Find a group doing blue mobs and ask if you can help beat up their stuff.  No experience for you, so you're not actually &quot;taking&quot; anything from the group while doing crappy damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drunia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to bazaar, buy a Silver Swiftblade. 16/24 2hs RNG only, no stats. Goes for about 50-150pp. Next go kill blues. Ask a group if you can hit their stuff, fear-kite some animals, whatever. Get a dex buff or put on some cheap dex gear, you'll get skill ups faster. Huge difference between 135 Dex and Focused Dex in terms of skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gear kite with the SSB will raise it faster than anything else. Plenty of blues in JPF for you to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) Goto the Bazaar and buy a Silver Swiftblade<br />
2) Goto Velks, talk to the people at either &quot;Eyes&quot; camp or &quot;Frenzy&quot; camp if you can practice 2HS. 9 times out of 10 they will have no problems with that.<br />
3) Swing away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Erryn_On_Prexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do like they said above.  Get a silver swiftblade in bazaar.  Go find a group killing stuff and ask to help them out.<br />
<br />
I would suggest swinging at reds, this will get you more skillups, and preferrably find a group with a chanter and shaman.  Get a dex buff from the shammy and a haste and the skillups will be great.<br />
<br />
For locations ... At 51 I'd go to UP, but crossing ME is kinda dangerous at your level.  I'd suggest UP cause everything will be red and there may be a group without a ranger that will let ranger loot rot.  On second thought, UP may be deserted now that PoP is out so that may not be the best choice.<br />
<br />
If you skip UP you could take a look for zone line groups in PoN, PoI, or PoD.  Or you can skip PoP and go check out ME since it's easy to get to.<br />
<br />
To summarize, the keys I've found are red mobs and dex buffs.<br />
