<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So last night i was a little bored and decided to get my hunter a very rare pet that almost no horde has (well one does cause i saw a high level with one). That pet is the OWL and the only place where they live is on the starting island of the night elves.<br />
Well after dying 3 times and running a ton I finally did it. I got my owl. Everyone has bears and raptors now i got me a cool owl. Thay are on the same damage table as cats but they look 10x better :)<br />
If anyone else needs help gettign one let me know :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good job, it is nice when people get pets no one else has. I have seen the owl just one time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Strigid Hunter models absolutely rock!<br />
<br />
I just wish they had higher HP/armor. My bear can keep agro and take the beating considerably longer than birds or cats while I rain death from a distance. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well for those curious this is how u do it.<br />
First u gotta get to the dark elf lands.<br />
That means boat (fatigue will kill you and it's not worth trying to bring a ton of potions to ge tthere like that)<br />
<br />
Part 1<br />
So we got a boat in Darkshore but it's heavily guarded. Bring a friend with you. Any level really but this works better around level 20. Now swim out into the sea and go under the dock where the ship comes and go under the water about a foot so u beging to run out of air. Good !!! now u run out of air and die :P<br />
<br />
Part 2<br />
Run your ghost from the nearby graveyard ON the dock this time right above your corpse. Yep rez thru the dock and u are now waitign for the boat :)<br />
<br />
Part 3<br />
Jump before the boat stops at the dock and keep a safe distance from the small town where boat lands. Here is where your friend comes in handy. At the back of the small village there is a portal into darnassus. 3 guards are watching over it. Your friend will charge and draw the guards away while u , who are running right behind him enter the portal.<br />
<br />
Part4<br />
Well you are now dead :) Upon arriving in Darnassus u got owned in the face by about 50 zillion guards. It's ok. U will find yourself at the darnassus graveyard. Use the spirit healer to rez. (watch the shocked faces of the NE players there :P) and now get your owl and hearthstone the fook out :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Congratz u got an OWL (MAD DAMAGE)<br />
<br />
<br />
Owls cannot learn bite but they more than make up for it with the damage they do. They make amazing pets :) Cool looking too :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I am SICK of seeing hunters with raptors jesus they are not that good. Get a life :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea I played a Hunter in beta, and I got myself one of them really cool black cats from umm ... Stonetalon Peak. They were really cool!<br />
<br />
Before that I had a turtle from the Oasis. They are awesome awesome tank pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got a monkey!!!  I got him when he was 31 free-range in Stranglevine.  He's a tank model with lower DPS and higher hp/ac.  I had a cat before that and I like the monkey better because 1) easy to buy food for him (bananas hehe), 2) he tanks good, and lasts a good while so I can do real DPS from my rifle-gun, and 3) when I heal him I can actually catch-up.  The cat just wouldn't stay healthy vs. a foe a couple levels up.  But the gorilla has tanked an elite 7 levels over him and I've been able to keep him alive with heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have the same old, boring bear that I first got at level 10 in Dun Morogh.  He tanks ok has that claw ability and is furry and all.<br />
<br />
Best thing about a bear is they will eat darned near anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am usin the 100 resist vs all doggie from feralas.  He is pretty good, but not as great as I anticipated.  I guess it was worth the camp for him.<br />
<br />
Bears are nice.  I used a cat from 30-40 and switched briefly to bear again while hunting my current pet.  They tank much better than cats, and the dps difference is not noticeable.  You never really have to buy vendor food for them either I guess.<br />
<br />
Even on the alliance side, you see very few owls.  Very cool.  Claw eats up focus awfully fast though, needs fixing.<br />
<br />
I see someone with the flying snakes every once in a while, they are pretty cool looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I saw someone with a cockroach last night. That was kinda funny to watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What mobs have claw besides the owl. The Teld owls only have claw 1 ... so how do you upgrade it as you level?<br />
<br />
I went owl - thistle bear - moonstalker (cat) progression at first. Have also done raptor, hyena (great dog pet), spiders. <br />
<br />
Note: if you get one of the younger cats they have a cower skill. Basically it is a de-taunt effect, which is good in groups if you don't want pet pulling aggro from other players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To upgrade pet abilities you have to tame a new pet. Here is a pretty good list of pets and their abilities:<br />
<br />
http://www.goodintentionsguild.info/hunters.html<br />
<br />
You basically have to put your regular pet in the stable and go out and tame a new one and keep it until you &quot;learn&quot; its ability. Then you can let it go and teach the new ability to your regular pet. Not all pets can learn all abilities. I know bears can learn them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">how long until i &quot;learn&quot; an ability from my new pet after taming it? DO i have to take it to the next level? Or the next friendly level (best friend etc)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Make it happy with food, fight a couple fights and watch your chat boxes (General).  usually only takes a couple, though I had trouble with Cower 2 last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My wife had trouble learning Bite R5 from a spider in Arathi Highlands last week. Her main pet (bear) was in the stable, and was still only level 31 (32 is required for Bite R5). Happy as she kept the spider, she never got the &quot;You have learned a new spell: Bite&quot; message, even after fighting with him for over an hour. We usually get that message within 5 to 10 minutes of taming/fighting with the new beast.<br />
<br />
She swapped the spider for her bear, leveled the bear up to 32, then took the spider back out. Learned the spell during the first fight.<br />
<br />
I seriously can't see how learning a new pet ability is tied to any pet currently stabled and their level.<br />
<br />
Probably just a strong coincidence, but goes to show how random learning a new pet ability can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Val,<br />
<br />
Must either be that the higher level abilities take longer to learn, or something specific with the Arathi spiders.  I took a similar route a few days ago and got the Giant spider in Arathi for the same reason, to teach my bengal tiger bite 5.  Yeah, it did take longer than the other abilities, I actually thought something may be wrong.  But during fight 4-5, bam, message went off, spider got dimissed and I went back to my kitty.<br />
<br />
BTW, as far as pet tanking, yes, the bears are a bit better, but as a &quot;general&quot; pet, for solo and groups, I prefer the cats.  Slightly less hp and AC, but more dps and much faster swings (1.3 vs. 2.0).  For groups and casters, just turn on cower and claw and let your cat rip into casters and assist the tank.  Solo, I may get the bear if I'm going to solo a high level elite, but I rarely do that (not a real smart thing to do on a regular basis :) ).<br />
<br />
Also, currently have 3 pets;<br />
<br />
Baloo - Ursol'lok, named Black Bear from Ashenvale<br />
ShereKhan - Durotar Bengal Tiger<br />
Bagheera - Black Panther from Stranglethorn Vale<br />
<br />
See a pattern?  :)  Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ROFL!<br />
<br />
My wifes cat was ShirKhan. Her bear is Balou. :)<br />
<br />
She and I  usually play together, not grouping with many except for the occasional guild hunt/event. The damage she and I put out together is just sickening, so we both keep bears to do the tanking and taunting.<br />
<br />
No need for pets to do massive damage when stuff dies as quickly as it does with two Hunters raining massive death from a distance. :) More often than not, when one of us gains agro (usually me since I'm higher level and do more dmg), whatever it is that's charging me dies before it reaches me. Pet stuns + Concussive Shot + Wing Clip (IF it gets within melee range that is) = dead mob. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">After further review, I am liking my resisty wolf.  He can tank caster adds almost indefinitely in instances.  If they are several levels higher than him, the spells start to hurt him, but he still eats fireballs way better than I do (big fat donut in all resists).  I miss the near instant taunt of the high attack speed cats, but over the course of the fight, pets without claw seem to hold aggro better because they have enough focus to growl when it pops.<br />
<br />
Claw = extra dps, better initial taunt, sucks focus dry so maintaining taunt may be more difficult<br />
<br />
Bite only = less dps, slower initial taunt, holds aggro better after taunt is achieved.<br />
<br />
Before I went with a no-Claw pet, I was considering making a macro to tie Arcane Shot and Claw together, to sort of create an artificial recast delay on claw, which would conserve focus.</div></div><hr />
