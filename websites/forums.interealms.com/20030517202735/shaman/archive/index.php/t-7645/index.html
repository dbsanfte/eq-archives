<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vajra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Shaman Math question... It wil ltake some decent math skills.  Here is the Criteria:<br />
<br />
<br />
Units:<br />
<br />
Seconds<br />
Hit Points(hp)<br />
Mana<br />
Tick(6 seconds)<br />
<br />
<br />
Data:<br />
<br />
Regen = 27hp/tick<br />
ManaRegen = 13mana/tick<br />
<br />
Total Mana Pool = 665<br />
Total Hit Points = 800<br />
<br />
Spell Facts: Cannibalize = 50hp for 20 mana     <br />
                   Heal = 95 hp for 60 mana<br />
<br />
Problem: Here is the scenario, My level 25 Troll shaman is at full health, but has 0 mana. Try to find the most TIME efficient way for him to reach Full Hp and Full Mana, based on the spells and info I have supplied above.  To help you out I have already calculated how long it takes for my shaman to reach full HP(3min) and mana(5min) just sitting down and letting it tick to full.<br />
<br />
I know this is insane, but I tried to figure it out on my own.. and Failed... all I have is a bunch of scrap paper filled with jargon.  Maybe I should have payed more attention in calc class LOL ;p<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heal spell is more lost than gained  when casting 2 canna's... so basically you canna as much as you can then you med... and regen hps.  if you're full life, just canna again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best way...get a horse. you med while canning, you med while healing you are medding unless your moving or attacking. At higher levels this equivalates to over 20% increase of mana recovery. At lower levels would come to about 12% over the best method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try this<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  This assumes you don't want toget jumped by wandering mob or untimely spawn so you never canni below 60% health.<br />
<br />
Canni 6 times to 500 hp's<br />
wait 11 ticks<br />
Canni 6 times to 500hp's<br />
wait 11 ticks<br />
canni 4 times to 600hp's<br />
After 7 ticks you will be full hp/mana  <br />
<br />
so at just under 3 minutes you will be full mana/full hp<br />
<br />
Basically your looking at 29 canni's to equalize the fact that you regen hp's twice as fast as you naturally regen mana.  Use those 29 however you see fit.<br />
<br />

<br />
*****p.s. However, If you are finishing fights at full health you are very fortunate.  As a general rule just try and equalize the mana bar/ hp bar and they will both hit max at approx the same time.  Just never let yourself get full hp's.  At 56th lvl I try to keep my hp bar at 80% at all times.<br />
<br />
Much easier than trying to solve a multivariable equation for a game. :D</div></div><hr />
