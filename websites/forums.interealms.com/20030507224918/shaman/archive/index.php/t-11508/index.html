<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which one is better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wendy could totally whip Ronald McDonlad's ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">McD's is nasty! I have no idea what McD's nuggets are made of, but it sure isn't the same stuff you'd hope it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wendys<br />
<br />
plus you could get a frosty... mmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dip my fries in my Frosty.<br />
<br />
Hey, I learned it from my mom -- evidently it's a normal thing in Holland... but then they eat their fries with just mayo, too.  /shudder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Definitely not McD's .. they're like chicken mush coated with warm chewy plastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dip my fries in my frosty too!! Not all the time, but it's good sometimes :p<br />
<br />
And Wendy's nugs BLOW McDonalds out of the water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">having worked at wendys as a kid .. id have to pick mcdonalds nuggets<br />
<br />
id assume this choice would be vice versa if i had worked at mcDs instead<br />
<br />
<br />
ps .. might want to check the urine content in that frosty /grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/cry<br />
<br />
I love Wendy's... why'd you have to go and spoil that for me Ceno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">out of those 2, Wendys by far, but everyone who has been to chic-fil-a has to admit its way better than both</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wendys nuggest DESTROY all other contenders.<br />
<br />
The best though.. were the KFC nuggets they had like 10 years ago.. man those were uber nuggets.. were awesome to dip in the mashed potatos and gravy.. wish they hadnt abandoned them for the totally ASS strips and junk that they have now. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok flame me all you want.. but mc'donalds nuggets are way better than wendys, as are their shakes and fries.  Only wendy's burgers beat mc'Ds.  On a side note, in a thread a while back on castersrealm about the same thing, a poster mentioned that his cat wouldn't eat mc'donalds nuggets.. probably should tell me something *shrug* but they're good :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Paganstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wendys!!!...Definitely Wendys... <br />
<br />
and ...Eeuuw.. *trying to remember the last Frosty I had*</div></div><hr />
