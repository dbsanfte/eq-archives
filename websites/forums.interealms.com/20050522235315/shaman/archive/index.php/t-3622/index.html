<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Camping RF with a buddy, got quite a gang of guildies there. GW wanders right in front of me, i question the group leader on pulling it and im told 60 shaman needed to slow or enchanter too to tash.<br />
<br />
I said, sod it im trying. Pulled, resist. kited for 10 mins using all mana to slow. Failed. Ran out of aggro range and gave up.<br />
<br />
40 mins later, another 3 have popped. Group of guildies is even larger, so i go hunting again. Slow lands strate away, and we have ourselves a Disntergrate spell. 4 more GW's in the next hour, dropping various spells, all slowed and pulled by moi, a 54 shaman. <br />
<br />
Who said 60 shaman only eh? hehe im sorry for posting but its a fantastic feeling proving someone wrong when it comes to your abilities :) Never be afraid to try young ones, its always possible.</div></div><hr />

Slow has surprised me sometimes.  Red is not always the barrier it seems to be :)</div></div><hr />

people, especially those that have been 60 for a while, get it in their head that you have to be 60 to do anything.  I was in a GOOD pickup group with all level 60's in sebilis, except one enchanter who was level 54 and a normal hunting partner of mine.  Things were dying fast, crowd control was good, experience was rolling in etc.  Now I don't consider sebilis to be a very difficult dungeon for the level 55+ crowd, and neither do most people i know.  But when we made our way down to the chef camp, the group leader and main tank refused to pull the chef room because he didn't think the enchnater could handle it.  I thought he was joking at first, but apparantly he wasn't.  Anyways me and the enchanter droped from he group and pulled the room at full pop.  She CC'd everything, and then we proceded to kill all 4 spawns with just the 2 of us, made for quite a show.<br />
<br />
P.S. guardian wurms are pretty non resistant to magic.  Slowed them plenty of times between levels 56 and 60 and never had tash or malo on them.</div></div><hr />

Tell that poosae of a level 60 to turn in his membership in the &quot;I have a pair of nads&quot; club.&quot;<br />
<br />
Had my Enchanter in Chef at 49. Rough.<br />
<br />
Came back at 51 and smoked the lot of them. <br />
<br />
Wouldn't pull WITH a Shaman AND Enchanter in group?<br />
<br />
Go back to Crushbone son.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Guardian Wurms are pretty wimpy as far as magic resistance goes, I can't think of another lvl 60 mob I could consistently land spells on when I was in my low 50s. <br />
<br />
Having said that, I'll still always debuff one first before slowing, if you get a few resists an unslowed GW can eat a shaman pretty quickly &lt;g&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I made it away alive 4 times after getting in combat too :)<br />
<br />
Debuff never once landed, at least 40 tries.</div></div><hr />
