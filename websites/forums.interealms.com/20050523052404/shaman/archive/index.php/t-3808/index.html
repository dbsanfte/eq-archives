<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
First off after playing pvp for a while I can certainly say its not what it used to be. It used to be you could find ppl around your lv easy and have fun pking and playing with friends...well no more.<br />
<br />
Me and a friend wandered around for 3 hours looking for ppl to pk and only he and I were in oasis no one else that was disapointing as oasis used to be pk city.<br />
<br />
 I also find that anymore rallos(this may or may not pertain to other zeks) is just a blubie server that pretends to be pvp and the server that everyone says has it so hard...YEAAAAHHH right whatever as you get higher and higher no one wants to even pvp, because it ruins their rep and they run away or shout pk or blah blah. Rallos zek players have it hard my ass.<br />
<br />
 I asked some of the higher guilds on that server how its been as well and they said its rare to find guild wars anymore.  Rallos imo has become just another blue server that has the option to  pvp, but for some reason just doesn't its no fun anymore and to even go there for pvp is just not worth it.<br />
<br />
This may not go for all of you out there, because I know of some leet pvpers out there that stomp mudholes and do it well, but for the majority they are just blubies that apparently forgot what server they are on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly, I never cared for PvP much, but your right Rallos has changed alot.  Part of the problem is that pvp in EQ is horribly broken and it just gets worse every expansion (ie. manaburn).  Weapons designed to kill 1 million hp mobs tend own players.  I remember once this Begotten monk just wasted me in Veks. I had about 4 seconds of battle spam and then &quot;Loading PLZ Wait&quot;   :)  I think rogues are even worse.  <br />
<br />
Another problem is that RZ is an old server. It was one of the first ones. I think that by now a good number of the people there are in there 50's and all in nodrop gear.  If your in any size of guild at all you run into weird politics. In general guild wars tend to get ugly(remember AD and FU going at it? That had the GM's on edge ), with that guild allied with that one and such and after awhile people just get tired of pking each other for no reward and want to get back to getting loot. <br />
<br />
Lastly, there is the cheating element. This really sucked the fun out of for me. ShowEQ really sucks being on the recieving end. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just my opinions of course :)<br />
