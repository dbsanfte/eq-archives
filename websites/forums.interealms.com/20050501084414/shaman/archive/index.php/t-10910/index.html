<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I was in a 2 group event, where we utilized the raid function.<br />
<br />
Those of us on 100% AAxp noticed some alarming disparities.<br />
<br />
A level 53 got 6% AAxp.<br />
A level 60 got 14% AAxp.<br />
A level 61 got 5% AAxp.<br />
A level 57 got 10% AAxp, and another got 6% (he thinks)<br />
<br />
I know level should affect how much xp you get, but this seems a little odd. No group had someone in it that was light blue to anyone else, nor anyone over 61. Level ranges were 53-61.<br />
<br />
We were in a quick jaunt into the factory in PoI to familiarize ourselves with the zone, for a couple of hours.<br />
Everyone was there a similiar amount of time.<br />
<br />
All of us utilize a UI Mod by T.King &amp; Remelio, which shows the % amount on both XP and AAxp.  I'll ask Remelio if the disparity could be in the mod. (He happens to be my guildleader =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Request to the Shaman Community: <br />
Take notes when you and your friends are in 100% AAxp + Raid.<br />
Lets see if something's really wrong, or this was just a weird occurance.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Experience in raid isn't distributed evenly between the groups.  The group doing over half of the damage gets nearly all the experience.  The two that got the higher amounts of AAXP were probably in the group that was doing most of the damage to most of the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is this true...cause I have never heard of something like this...but then again...this is what happened to me the other day.  My guild group about about 15 or so was in BoT just killing things around the zone in.  I was on the phone with my RL buddy who is a ranger in the guild...when the mob dies and he says to me &quot;****, I just gained a half blue aaxp&quot;.  He had his aa/exp set to full AA, while I had mine set to full exp.  After hearing this, I set mine to full AA only, and after the mob dies, I think that it increased maybe 1/2 tick if that.  Now, at the time, I was lvl 63 and he was 62, so that could account for a few things, but after the next kill, he says to me that the exp that he got didn't increase as much as it did that first time. <br />
<br />
So, this might have been what happened in this exp. but I'm not sure.  Would like to hear some comments from other people concerning this though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I talked to remmy, he said that the mods most likely aren't the disparity, however Verant has stated that they cannot guarantee that the % the game sends are always correct. <br />
<br />
Someone else suggested perhaps class/racial xp penalties apply to AAxp as well as regular?<br />
Anyone know if this is the case?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the thought Hodur, yes the people who got more were in the primary damage group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make sure you zone before looking at the percent.  It can sometimes be wrong while you're still in the zone where you did the killing.</div></div><hr />
