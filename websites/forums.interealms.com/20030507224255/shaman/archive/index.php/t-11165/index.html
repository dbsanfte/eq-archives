<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering how many people play EQ with their loved ones and/or significant others.<br />
<br />
If you do what do you like and dislike about it?<br />
If you dont why would you want to or not want to?<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I log on for the sole purpose to play with my honey.  The game is just so much more worthwhile when you get to accomplish your goals with the one you love helping or cheering you on.  <br />
<br />
Also I have noted that the guild I am in has like 10 couples playing, yes TEN at the very least.   So it just made me wonder who else played EQ with their signif other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Takhis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I play with my husband.  I usually don't play without him.  It just somehow doesn't &quot;feel&quot; the same without one of his toons by my toons.  If I do anything in Norrath without him, it is usually trade skills.<br />
<br />
It sounds like my husband and I need to leave our server and join your guild.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play with my BF. We make a great duo (in and out of game ;) )<br />
<br />
The only complaint I have is that things are very easliy taken wrong in text as opposed to actual speach. -Which is why when we play we're also on the phone :p<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falmorn Hawkborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My wife and I play.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we have *one* computer and two accounts between us.  So when she's playing, I get to watch, and vice versa.  :(<br />
<br />
I know we'd both like to have an extra computer, but that requires money we don't have.  Ah well, such is life.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've taught a few of my girls to play, and I always get nostalgic when I do.  Seeing the game thru n00by eyes is very refreshing.  Sadly, most havent stuck with it.   Mainly cuz they want to play with me, and I don't want to start over and dont have the cash to twink 2 chars (just hers).  However, my guild has 4 married couples in it, mostly the officers as well.  Personally, I like grouping with them, they work better together than most and are always fun to pick on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have tried to get a few of my ex girlfreinds to play EQ with me, and I understand why it is hard for them to like it. The first few days I played EQ I HATED it and swore I would never play again. Now, all I can think about is getting that next aa. <br />
<br />
Our guild has a few couples in it, and they work well together. It is nice to have people sitting next to each other in RL, because things happen more smoothly without having to type out what you are doing. Only think I could see being annoying is the fact that since you are a couple, you feel like you have to always be together in the game, and that could get old quick. =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Most of the time, my wife and I duo.  My shaman was supposed to be my &quot;solo&quot; character(i get up earlier than her on the weekend) but then her wizard caught up in level and now we duo those two as well :-)<br />
<br />
The biggest problem is that she HATES HATES HATES to die.  She gets crabby when it almost happens and starts yelling at me to heal her or something when I'm already casting the spell :-)<br />
<br />
Other than that, its the best!  I find myself not wanting to solo when she can't play or hasn't woken up yet.  It's just not near as much fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I play with my paramour of 3 years. That is actually the only reason I play.<br />
<br />
I enjoy the partnership (both in &amp; out of game). He plays an SK &amp; I play a Shaman. The 2 classes compliment each other very well, much like ourselves outside of the game.  :)  <br />
<br />
We could banter back &amp; forth without the constant typing. We're more in tune to what each other is doing when we're in a group together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I could never get my GF into EQ. Although sense quitting EQ my sex life has trippled. So its give and take I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The two characters pictured in my sig is my RL husband and I :)  He actually started EQ 6 months before me (with a shaman) but I passed his original main up within 3 months after I started playing hehe<br />
<br />
In game tends to imitate RL for us in that we communicate very well and work very well together.  He gets lost, I tell him where to go ;)  And yes, he's the reason we have the surname we do hehe<br />
<br />
BTW we only play with a couple of other RL couples.  Most of the people we play with ask us to talk their significant others into playing hehe</div></div><hr />
