<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brocht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well they were wonderful for a few hours.<br />
<br />
The Shadel Bandit Ring is now Summoning Haste 2 (changed from Extended Enhancement )and the White Dragonscale Cloak is Improved Damage 3.  (Changed from Affliction Efficiency)<br />
<br />
While not too many Shaman were wearing the WDC the Shadel is a favorite of many and the original Focus effect was a gift from the gods. Oh well easy come easy go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blah.  Well, the one day of longer lasting Celerity was nice I guess. It didn't work on group buffs though, which is what I cast the most.  If they didn't touch Ring of the Shissar I guess I can't get too upset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't understand the logic behind the assignment of these new focus effects - why put a level 2 focus effect on an item you have to be mid 50s to get? I don't want to complain, because no one has lost anything, and no one is forced to use the items, I'm just confused! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They also changed Onyx Gauntlets from Spell Haste 3 to Reanimation Efficiency 3. One day of faster casting Torpor was nice :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jing, I was kind of upset about that change too, Spell Haste 3 was so nice :( Oh well</div></div><hr />
