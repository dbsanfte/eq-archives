<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I was in the Great Divide with Three other members of my guild. Another was in Lavastorm griping about Sol B and Groups. (Sol B is dead on Lanys or filled with people who don't think about what they are doing usually so I don't try and group there). We all then decide to form our own Guild group in Sol B or so I thought. So, I sit down, tell them I'm waiting for them so we can port from GD. (I wasn't grouped, merely in the zone.) The next thing I know, they are all in Sol B, and I'm left alone in GD.<br />
<br />
So, I said screw it, and went to soloing in Jaggedpine, despite the fact it gets insanely boring and can be majorly contested by quadding druids and other Rangers. Anyway, in Jaggedpine I did have fun, the whole zone was filled with people like myself who enjoy chatting around and joking in ooc when there is nothing else to do. If you are that bored, why not?<br />
<br />
My Guild mates then ask me why I haven't arrived in Sol B yet. I was half tempted to say, &quot;Since you guys couldn't think of me when you ported with me in the same zone, I forgot about you.&quot;<br />
I didn't, however, and instead said I wasn't making the run when they ported out of GD with me in the zone, leaving me to run it solo. <br />
<br />
I have POP, so the run isn't long, it was just the principal of the fact they were at Thurgadin and I was at the POK book. In Fact, they were even HEADED toward the POK book before they mysteriously decided to port right away. Thurg was wiped (Zone raid for a bunch of people) and hadn't respawned so they needed to bank in POK supposedly, yet they were then gone. That was why I waited, otherwise I'd have went to them. But, what was the sense in me running to them, to run back to POK, to then port?<br />
<br />
What would you people have done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A simple tell to the druid/wizard that did the port is what I would have done. I would let him/her know that they left me behind and to meet me the dragon circle. If they wouldnt go that far to help me out, depending on how bad I wanted to go to Sol B I would have either Ran it myself via PoK, or if I got the impression that they didnt want me along I would have soloed just as you did.</div></div><hr />
