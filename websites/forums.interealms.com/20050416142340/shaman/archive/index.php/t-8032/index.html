<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Says it cant find the filename/path. Both from CD or from my harddrive. Poked around a little on the eq live boards and seems others were having the same problem. Anyone found a solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Found out it would add folders/subfolders or a WMP playlist.  From what I gather you have to select each file and build a playlist.   So with the 2000+ mp3's sitting on my harddrive , I have to select each one.  At least they could of done was make it be able to read asx files (windows media player - playlists) but nope!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Select the Folder that contains your MP3's and Use  *.mp3  This Got me everything from my main music Folder.  Granted My music is terribly unorganized and all in one folder but that worked for me.<br />
<br />
Y's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It also uses .m3u playlist extensions.  So fire up winamp, make a playlist and save it where you know you can remember the path.<br />
<br />
here is a link to some useful tips:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ahh sweet, WMP uses m3u as well.  thanks for the tips</div></div><hr />

Hi.  We're with the RIAA enforcement agency.  Says here you have 700000 MP3 files and we'd like to verify that you have the original CD's that every one of those songs came from.  If you don't, Guido here will break your legs and smash your cable modem.<br />
<br />
Gee, Mr. Guido, how'd you get my address?<br />
<br />
You play Everquest?<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Guess you used the in-game MP3 player and Sony was kind enough to alert us and pass along your personal info.<br />
<br />
DOH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/sigh.<br />
<br />
If Sony wanted to obtain a list of your MP3 files on your computer, they could have done so at any time wihtout creating an in-game MP3 player.  I mean, come on, they scan your hard drive to verify your EQ files every time you run the game.  How much harder would it be for them to silently retrieve a list of your MP3 files?  Not very.  <br />
<br />
Don't be so paranoid...  or at least be paranoid for the right reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Didnt know about the m3u thing that makes life a to easer...  now is there  way to edit m3u files without haveing all the songs with me so I can make up some playlists at work?<br />
<br />
Y's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, an .m3u file is simply a listing of all your tracks so you can create one using notepad.  Something like this:<br />
<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\04 - Gratitude.mp3<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\05 - Lighten Up.mp3<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\06 - Finger Licken' Good.mp3<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\07 - So What'cha Want.mp3<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\08 - The Biz Vs The Nuge.mp3<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\09 - Time For Livin'.mp3<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\10 - Something's Got To Give.mp3<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\11 - The Blue Nun.mp3<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\12 - Stand Together.mp3<br />
E:\Music\Beastie Boys\Check Your Head\13 - Pow.mp3<br />
<br />
and just save it with the .m3u extension.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How bad is the lag doing this?<br />
<br />
I'm pretty laggy without adding a mp3 player in the background... I've got a stereo in my room because my computer is tapped out of cpu.<br />
<br />
2 1/2 weeks till the blue laptop of shammy goodness arrives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">does it work with an m3u even if the mp3s are stored on another machine that doesnt have a mapped network drive? just wondering as I keep all mine on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ya you can use UNC or you can map to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I havent tested it, but if you can access the other system from yours, without putting in any fancy stuff, it should play them,provided the file paths are correct.<br />
<br />
If the .m3u is on that comp, it might not work right, as the m3u would link to your music folder on that comp, lets say c:\My Music, and EQmp3 player would probably look in My Music on the EQ comp.  So it could get tricky, but if you set it up right, i dont see why it wouldnt work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think if you know the IP address of your server you might be able to do something like this:<br />
<br />
http://xxx.xxx.xx.xx/Music/Track01.mp3<br />
<br />
Not sure though but it's easy enough to test.  Might just be easier to map the drive and call it with a drive letter.<br />
<br />
edit: it shouldn't add to lag at all unless you are streaming your tracks over the network (ie using bandwidth to play your mp3's).<br />
<br />
I did find a bug tho, when I was playing tracks off a shared drive from my other PC and zoned the audio locked up and stuttered, locking up my computer in the process.  Only happened once tho and I had zoned alot before this happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wulfgang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Still...is it that freaking hard to allwo us to Shift Click Multiple files....or Cntrl Click them...Sheshh....has noone at VI ever used an mp3 player?<br />
<br />
and,....It'd be NICE...if the Drop Down window, that shows your files....was smart enough to Drop UP...when the player is positioned near the bottom of the screen...so I dont have to MOVE the player UP on my Screen every time I want to look in the folder of currently playing songs....<br />
<br />
All very EASY things that should have been done from the start...<br />
<br />
Sad that someone prolly got paid for this work too...when they should be DoT'd and rezzed andd DoT'd repeatedly</div></div><hr />
