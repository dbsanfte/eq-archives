<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes we are alchemists folks not just potion makers.<br />
<br />
A potion called &quot;Alchemists cauldron&quot;  made with alchemy skill and maybe a few smithed parts.<br />
<br />
The potion when clicked would turn all avalible gold (With a cap of 1000 gold (100p)) into the apropriate ammount in platinum. Same return rate because the potions would cost. Im thinking around 5p an attempt, caped around 130 skill.<br />
<br />
I can see the monks lining up now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good idea.  Unfortunately SOE thinks there's too much cash in the game already.  I don't see us getting anything like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You miss the point - this wouldn't bring more cash into the game. It would remove it through the cost of the potions and the proposed conversion was simply 1000 gold to 100 plat - ie the normal rate.<br />
<br />
Interesting idea, would have been a lot more use 3 years ago when travel to a bank was slower, and newbies used to ATM for tips :)</div></div><hr />
