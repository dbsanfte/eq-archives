<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the way it works:<br />
<br />
During times of war (WWI, WWII, 9/11), the government takes steps that somewhat undermine our rights and moreso undermine the rights of those that are under suspicion.<br />
<br />
People holler foul, but nothing really gets done about it because the majority of the population is willing to let it slide for the sake of security.  Even the Supreme Court has often dismissed calls for unconstitutionality of some laws or practices by our government during times of war.  (I've lost my examples, but I'm sure someone could dig them out if they care to).<br />
<br />
So in times of war, we sacrifice some freedoms (whether you like it or not) for our safety.  <br />
<br />
In the past, these laws have usually been overturned within a few years when the fear passes and we are willing to look at the constitutionality of a law again.<br />
<br />
We just have to make sure they look at this law in the future, because I guarantee most people are more worried about their own safety and our countries safety than the freedoms of a few unlucky suspects.<br />
<br />
That's just the way it works.</div></div><hr />
