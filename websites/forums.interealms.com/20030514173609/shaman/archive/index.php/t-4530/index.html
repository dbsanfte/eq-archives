<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On another thread, someone mentioned soloing the basement in Ssra.  I'm curious where, how, and how to get there.  Anyone willing to share?<br />
<br />
I've actually got two accounts, and 2-box with my warrior a bit (level 57 and some minor twinkage).  Shammy is 60 with 5 AA to go til MGB (run 3, regen 3, wis 2 - don't ask, MC 3, Canni V, working on MGB), decent gear, full spells (less primal avatar, levitate and everlasting breath).<br />
<br />
Can you invis to the basement?  What is the route?  For some reason, I thought you couldn't get down there invis, but I've really only been there for raids and solid 1-group hunts.<br />
<br />
Anyway, any info you are willing to share would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, no one helped,  but I poked around a bit myself, and thought I'd share what little I've learned.<br />
<br />
You CAN invis to the basement.  From the entrance, go thru the first door, straight to and thru the next door, and that hall will end in a 'T'.  Turn left, then right, then right, then left to the door to the down tube.  Go down the tube, but don't get to the bottom.  Scan out the tube to check out the environment now.  There should be at least one snake in the room the tube ends in, and he does not see thru invis.  There is also a wandering mob, the Taskmaster, that DOES see invis.  He paths in front of the room with the tube, so you want to see him move away before you exit the tube.<br />
<br />
When you exit the tube, you can exit the room, turn right, and run back to the corner.  I stood there for a few minutes, and watched the two wandering mobs, Taskmaster and one other.  The corner appears to be safe, as my invis wore off at one point when the non-Taskmaster was nearby, and he didn't come say hi.<br />
<br />
You can get to a for sure safe spot from there fairly easily.  Continue on that wall to an arch, which leads to the mines.  There is a wandering see-invis mob, the Warden (or something like that), that paths near the arch.  Be careful sticking your nose in and you should be ok.  I once got very close to him, but he did not agro before I could back out.<br />
<br />
Standing in the arch, looking in, you will see a very large mining cart.  That area is safe.  Go in to the cart, go visible, and you are not attacked by any wandering mobs.<br />
<br />
The Warden is NOT slowable, and was a fun fight with a group of 7 of us.  He appeared to warp to the archway just as half the group was running in to the cart.  I wouldn't want to solo him, tons of hit points and not slowable, and hits pretty hard.  I was able to root him, tho, so I suppose it could be do-able.<br />
<br />
I hunted with this group in the mines.  The skeletons are not single pulls, we got 2-7 on every pull, which a monk was able to split down to 4 at most.  Without a monk or SK, be ready to handle 7.  We hunted for an hour, which got us one round of respawns, and did not see any named (which drop the ore for Shissar Bane weapons).<br />
<br />
I haven't yet tried to 2-box anything down here.  I suspect snakes would be possible, but the skeletons would be a challenge to manage while 2-boxing.  The skellies did slow easy, rooted easy, and I could easily see soloing 2 of them.  The 7-pull would get ugly, tho.<br />
<br />
If anyone else has experience to share, I'd love to hear it.</div></div><hr />
