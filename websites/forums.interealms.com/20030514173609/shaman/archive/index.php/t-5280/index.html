<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After making my way to katta I was looking around for a good place to set up a camp for killing Guards, does anyone have any suggestions on where I should set up camp<br />
<br />
I am a barb shaman I have just over 900 raw Ac and a fungi and a jbb. ( Not finished epic yet.)<br />
<br />
Any advise would be appricated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I usually set up to the side of the vendor building adjacent to the Bank.  from here you have 10 guards to choose from.  at 55 I cant pull singles unless i cast cancel magic from max range using a extended range item.  But even if you get 2 its not that big a problem to kill them...just string one along a little while so repops are nice and spread out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I were you I would go and kill in high hold till 57 then go kill Nathyns guards. I leveled from 57 to 60 on them and I am now ally to katta guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I was your level, I set up in the plaza across from the bank.  With fungi and JBB you can probably clear 5, maybe 6 of the guards before repop starts.  Once you finish your epic you'll be able to get the 6 in the plaza easily and the one up the stairs if you're lucky.<br />
<br />
Don't try setting up at the twighlight sea zone.  You won't be able to single pull.<br />
<br />
It's really great exp.  Unfortunately, after weeks played and 6 levels spent in katta, I have muscle spasms whenever someone suggests going there.</div></div><hr />

they are in here i believe..<br />

how is the banking in the place i mentioned above , if this is the right place for those guards , does the banking work like it did in HHK ? just bank fast and far away from her ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">nathyn's guards are up top in and around nathyn illuminous(sp?) house.  You can bank in katta pretty easy because the bankers are not on any faction.  You can invis past the guards and go behind the bankers(unless they have changed it :P)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just fyi, as one did turn around one time and attacked me. I legged it to the zone as I didn't want to foobar any other factions she was on (perhaps some banker faction?).</div></div><hr />

im heading there now , i have the right place up there right ? thats where that name brought me too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i think this was covered here recently, but just in case:<br />
<br />
banker in Katta is not on the same faction as the guards, or the Nathyn's guards.  ya invis in, squeeze past guards, and banking is no problem.  only risk is dropping invis in front of the banker, where the guards can see ya - if ya didn't already kill em  8)'</div></div><hr />

I did it to 57, then I did Laggedpine, couldn't take HHK Anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Crash - there are no mobs in HHK for a level 59 or 60 to hunt for exp.  sorry.<br />
<br />
At 54 you get some light blue.  at 55 you get a lot of light blue.  I left when I dinged 56, but people do stay until dinging 57.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hardback</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dinged tell 58 in HHK <br />
I had a cleric on my other account healing me while I chained cann / tanked / DOTed <br />
<br />
Iksar no JBB but had epic at lvl 57 the casting time o nepic seemed a little two long since tanking / bane knife and dog(buffed) would take them out in less than a min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Where do the nathyn guards spawn that give positive faction with katta?  High hold pass or high keep?  The initials seem to be getting co-mingled, hehe.  Any advice on which part of zone would also be great.  Will they still be light blue at 57?  Thanks everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">nathn guards are on opposite faction of katta. you will raise faction if you kill them. they are right in katta in a masion which is located right on your left the second you zone into katta.<br />
<br />
i was able with my jbb and no epic pull the front 2 guards , the wolfs and 2 guards just inside . after that i either need to sit and med/heal or repops come. <br />
<br />
cool thing is , i havent seen anyone move more effeciently then that. if you DoT harder then you will tank instead of pet. this brings down life with you cant canna back . i havent seen any wizzy or anyone else do more then that. this is good cause if you invis and run inside , you can setup a camp on the inside that is pretty much just as good. pulling the 2 guards at the bottom of the stairs adn the melodic whatever her name is and the lego upstairs. i couldnt split the 2 right before the caster upstaird though , but nothing a lil root and hard work cant fix.<br />
<br />
outside is very relaxed , you move at your pace. inside the pace moves you. its a lil rougher , but a nice back up if someone is outside.<br />
<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">ok, thanks litgruv.  i was reading something about killing in hk or hph before going to katta.  thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">They changed the faction on Nathyn guards in last patch dont get positive faction with Katta anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Nathyn's guards are giving positive seru faction, but no negative katta faction, so I'm happy. I tradeskill in seru anyway.<br />
<br />
At 59, I got a blue in 55 minutes. <br />
<br />
JBB, horse, pet, KEI, but no epic. (Still working on that).<br />
<br />
I was able to do the two dogs - which drop shrieking substance, which will help me when I try to get smithing up to 200, the two front guards, the two guards inside, and one guard from the staircase in the second room before a repop.<br />
<br />
Once I get my epic, I might be able to take another.<br />
<br />
They're db/lb, depending on the pop, sometimes db, sometimes lb. <br />
<br />
All in all I was very happy, I only did an hour there because I am so sick of grinding after a weekend long grind fest to get to 59.... but this means only 24 more hours of grinding till 60, not bad at all. <br />
<br />
Jaggedpine at 58 gives a blue an hour by the way, and great druid faction if for some reason you're messed up there. I'm now allied to the druids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I will try again tonight, but I saw Your faction with the Heart of Seru gets better, Your faction with the Shoulders of Seru gets better, Your faction with the vampires of something Gets Better. Only Nathyn's went down.<br />
<br />
I will reverify tonight, to be sure. But I was not unhappy with this result.<br />
<br />
As a cat, I'm indiff in Seru. It's where I make heady kiolas (one of two places in Luclin you can do it). It's where you buy chainmail aptterns. I'll probably wack Seru someday, and mess my faction, but right now as I struggle through wu's and chainmail, it's a nice quiet zone where I can work without getting harassed for buffs.<br />
<br />
I will doublecheck faction again tonight, and log it to be sure as although I only got 4 faction messages, they changed depending on the mob... sometimes heart of seru, sometimes shoulders, etc. But I didn't see Katta going down.<br />
<br />
Which means, as a person who has nice Katta faction to begin with, that I can grind there and still be able to do the Katta quests... although I've already got a Shield of Bane Warding and Amulet of the Grey Wastes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I did them again last night, got a blue and a half for an hour and a half of work.<br />
<br />
Coterie of Eternal Night gets better.<br />
Heart of Seru gets better.<br />
Shoulders of Seru gets better.<br />
Valadious Somethingortheother gets better.<br />
Nathyn gets worse.<br />
<br />
That's it :) No katta + or -, seru +, only nathyn -. Sweet for the kitty who doesn't want to mess up katta faction. Seems to be a bit camped though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The factions haven't changed.  Validious Custodius is the normal Katta guard faction.  The guards around nathyns mansion are on Nathan Illuminous.<br />
<br />
Coterie of Eternal Night will cover just about all the coterie in Luclin.  I  ran in to a few that wern't on it.  Kill enough katta guards and they will love you.<br />
<br />
The katta guards always gave +seru factions.  Nathyns guards and Validious Custiodius guards give different +seru factions.  By the time I finished 59 in bank area I had maxed out Hand of Seru faction.<br />
<br />
If you really don't care about katta faction then kill the guards in the bank area.  Nice layout, lots to kill, and you can go afk if you please with out worring about wandering mobs.<br />
<br />
Also at your level I soloed Chardok zone in.  XP is about the same but you can get a few decent pieces of loot if you get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You're right about Nathyn's guards. I checked - I am now amiable to Katta guards.  KOS to Nathyn, but he can go blow a big wet one.<br />
<br />
No idea what I am in terms of Seru, but I really don't care... the only reason I care about Katta is it means I can poach katta guards if I wish, without going below dubious... the more they love me, the more I can kill :)<br />
<br />
I'm at 43% on Nathyn's guards though, so probably will continue to work there as long as it's open - Shrieking substances off of the sonic wolves are nice, plus I can do 6 mobs before they start respawning. Probably 7, but I have a hard time getting a single pull from the back room now that they hate me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What level can I start in on Nathyn's guards?  I am currently 54 with JBB, horse, ikky bp, no epic.  I also have a 49 druid that i 2-box.  Could we start on Nathyn's guards?<br />
<br />
The druid isn't quite 49 yet, but I would like to relocate from Toilers as soon as she has hit 49.  Not that the exp has slowed, but the boredom has started to grow exponentially and the loot is non-existent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Tarelan -<br />
54 is probably too low to hunt in Katta solo - but the tunnels may allow you to single pull - by level 56 they wil aggro on line of sight - if they cannot see you, they will not come.  So - learn how to creep up to tunnel to where you can just see one guard - try to hit it with slow before it reaches you (they usually react slowly, and slow lands before they get to you)<br />
<br />
There are 2 roamers though - you want to get them killed and timed (just under 16 minutes to repop), or you will be practicing a sowed run down the walkway to the zone line - safe but frustrating, as the guards are slowpokes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The guards in the tunnel that you are talking about are regular guards, correct?  I don't want to hose my Katta faction, so I would like to keep it to Nathyn's guards only.  Thanks, for the info though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Was doing the Nathyn Guards for awesome exp solo.  Just dinged 60 and now they are mostly light blue and exp is much slower.  Any suggestions on good exp at lvl 60 for solo?  Fungus Grove my best choice?  Have been to PoP for good group exp but soloing there seems frought with getting trained by druids/wizzies quadding.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">&quot;54 is probably too low to hunt in Katta solo - but the tunnels may allow you to single pull&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh. I'm 54 and I solo the bank area. No jbb (iksar). No epic. No horse. No fungi/iksar regen tunics.<br />
<br />
It's not hard.<br />
<br />
Heck I even sometimes get single pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I gave it a try over the weekend.  I had some mixed results.  I was after only Nathyn's guards, as I want to keep my faction.<br />
The 2 guards and the sonic wolves out front are easy.  When I pull from the first entryway I sometimes get up to 3 and sometimes I only get 1.  That is kind of annoying.  Now that my faction with them is getting low (threateningly at the moment) I sometimes get a pretty big overpull.<br />
<br />
It was decent experience, but not much if any better than Toilers.  There were a couple of improvements over Toilers though:  loot and no quadders.  The reason that I chose to give it a try is that when I logged on in ME, there was a bard AE kiting all of Toiler hill.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I will likely go back and try it a bit more.  I want to see if I can get into a pattern with the pulls.  Its kind of annoying to get 4 or 5 sometime for no reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I'm leveling another shaman on Innoruuk server, got him to lvl 52 so far.<br />
<br />
Last night I started doing the bank area in Katta pulling guards.  I get them 2 at a time, guaranteed,  but I can solo the 2 guards for about 70 mana without getting beat up too badly.  I think normally I ended the fights at around the same life I started with, sometimes a tad more, give or take.<br />
<br />
I was just killing 'em both last night with epic and jbb + dog, so I didn't bother with splitting the spawns.  Tonight I might do that to conserve mana a little more.  I'm too cheap to pay for KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I just dinged 56, and went back to good old Katta for some quick xp. But now I have to kill 4-5 guards for 1% of my level, while I get 1% for a swamp rat in PoD. Is 56 the end of xping in kata?</div></div><hr />
