<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I only play EQ with EQW (get some error when I try to log in with SoE client.)  I accidentally had patcher on, and patched over all of my files.<br />
<br />
The main question is, where can I find / download a version of the eqmain.dll and eqhost.txt from the patch before the new log in went live?<br />
<br />
Does anyone here use EQW, if so, could you send me the files?</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW... you had to patch today or else you coldn't play eq with EQW.  I did the same thing you did and held off for as long as possible but today I was forced to either not play or patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And after you patch you can still reapply the old fix and it still works ;P</div></div><hr />
