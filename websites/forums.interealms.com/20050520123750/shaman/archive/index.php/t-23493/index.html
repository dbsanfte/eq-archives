Heh I have the same problem with Sam all the time, I pretty much try to rep-bump him daily. Its a good thing it wont just let me keep pumping em in, or Sam would have 10 green dots, LOL.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My next project, after I finish adding links to the clicky page, is a no-nonsense description of all the AAs (since the crucible faq hasn't even had the GoD AAs added yet).<br />
<br />
I plan to list each AA, very brief description of what it does and the costs, and then columns with separate reviews of its usefulness to soloers, groupers, and raiders.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of categories like:<br />
A+: make it one of your first 23 AAs <br />
A: this is a must have<br />
B: this is very good to have<br />
C: this is good to have<br />
D: this is not too sucky<br />
F: only get this if your XP is otherwise going to waste<br />
<br />
I don't expect us to agree on much beyond Can5 &gt; all, but I think we can get a concensus on general categories like that. Bearing in mind that (for example) MGB might be an A for raiders, a C for groupers, and an F for soloers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Perhaps not only the categories but also tips on how to use them from shaman who like those AAs.<br />
<br />
Many shaman told me &quot;Spirit Call isn't great&quot;. I seem to use it all the time for both extra dps, chasing down gater mobs and most of all for pulling several mobs for example.<br />
<br />
This kind of thing I mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You should update the focuseffects aswell..<br />

In response to the PM's I've gotten:<br />
<br />
Yep, Samanna and I realize the OOW and GOD tables have black backgrounds in the table columns. We just can't figure out how to fix it. The pages have both been recoded with forced-white backgrounds, and it still comes up pitch black. We're working on it, fear not. :)<br />
<br />
If you have any OOW gear drop that's not on the OOW table, I'd appreciate it if you guys could please make a post on the OOW gear thread in the Equipment forums or send me a quicky PM with the item name so I can update the table for Samanna.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Found some more fabulous gems from Snoww, some of them for the first time, and updated the index page.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hey, I'm moving my web stuff off of the computer I normally do it on, and giving that to Mrs. Samanna, and moving my web/email/junk to my EQ box, so I may not be making updates for a few days. FYI.<br />
<br />
/mourn iMac (Tangerine flavor), the first computer I ever bought brand spanking new. I guess I can use it for something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Big paperweight for some really important papers in a gale? /grin<br />
<br />
Top marks on the new frontage by the way - really like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, sorry, but I broke my promise.<br />
<br />
<br />
I reworked the refdesk to include the menu from a single source, so I wouldn't have to update every single page when I added one (by the way, we're now at 25 pages and growing).<br />
<br />
So I relocated the pages, and renamed them to .shtml; however, the symbolic links from the original .html to the new .shtml won't include the header with the menus...<br />
<br />
So I'm removing all the links; this will break all the old URLs. Just go to http://samanna.net and navigate from there for the new ones. THOSE URLs shouldn't have to change anymore, but I'm not gonna promise that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, some members of the community have offered to submit guides or writeups for inclusion; I am more than happy to host them. <br />
<br />
If you have some information that you'd like to share, please PM me for details.</div></div><hr />
