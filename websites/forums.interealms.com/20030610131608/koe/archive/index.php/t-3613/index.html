<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dunno if its an option, but the Radeon's are total junk. I had a 64mb radeon, and a all in wonder radeon. They had some major texturing issues. In eq I got pink squares all over the place, in other games like Quake, the text and crosshairs and other things were badly distorted. Also, they both had the same lockup issues when tryin to use capture or TV.<br />
Ram prices are pretty much bottomed out now, RDRAM isn't very expensive anymore, about 5 or 10 pp more than DDR.</div></div><hr />
