<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just curious if anyone knew whether there was going to be another signup period opening again before the game goes live?  I can't remember whether I managed to get signed up or not for the beta and I was hoping I would have a chance to, just in case I didn't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">recent quote from a Q&amp;A session:<br />
<br />
8. John Smedley recently updated everyone on the status of Beta, any idea what was meant by “Soon” when referring to the lifting of the NDA and the “Open Phase” of the beta? And does “Open Phase” mean everyone who wants in will get in?<br />
<br />
JB – The NDA will be lifted in the near future so that everyone in beta can speak of their adventures in Norrath. The “Open Phase” will still be limited to a subset of those that applied for beta earlier this year. We do not have any plans to open the game up to the public at large before launch day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">After signing up when they first accepted signups, I finally got a beta invite on Friday (girlfriend got hers wednesday....was kinda bummed hehe). Keep your fingers crossed as they are inviting tons for the stress test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The problem is, I don't remember if I actually managed to get signed up for the beta during the short time signups were available :(</div></div><hr />
