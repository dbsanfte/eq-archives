<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cannithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After looking over old threads with the &quot;search&quot; button on these boards...is it still safe to assume that the top 3 partners for a shaman (not 2 box, partner, duo) starting from scratch would be:<br />
<br />
1. Necro<br />
2. Mage<br />
3. Monk<br />
<br />
Thanks for the constructive feedback :)</div></div><hr />

At least until Sony nerfs them.  Who knows what happens then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My favorite partners have generally been Rangers, Paladins, Mages and Bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My wife has a 56 Pally and its a blast to duo with her.  Her stuns mean that agro is never a problem and Im able to better utilize my dots.  She has heals as well which work surprisingly well.  An SK for the snare would be a solid partner as well, but I really cant complain about having a Pally partner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think you’ll find that there is no “best” class to partner with.  We each have our own class preferences in general which will color our opinions.  And how well a character is played is at least as important as the character’s class.  My advice would be to group with several different classes and players and find out what works best for your play style.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i hear ya mike<br />
who cares about single pulls when you can just kill 2 or 3 mobs at once<br />
i love boxing with my warrior<br />
tons of fun<br />
the most efficient group isnt always the best~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman duo well with every class.<br />
<br />
My brother is a beastlord, and there is suprizingly little overlap.  At least, not where it matters.<br />
<br />
I also duo with a warrior consistantly.  <br />
<br />
I could probably give good reasons for shaman+anything combos if I thought about it :)<br />
<br />
Except gnomes.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im all for Paladins. They can stun to get you out of aggro, they can help you heal when a slow bounces.<br />
<br />
They can also buff you almost as good as a cleric. And since you have speed and haste you can kill many many things.<br />
<br />
For instance i usually do a duo or a group up at courtyard in BoT with a pally friend of mine. Easy to slow, good exp, pally can use stuns to interupt gating and healing mobs, and with Can5 we can keep the tempo up even aftet crack fades.<br />
<br />
Paladin pulls with his bow, i Malos on the way in, sic pet. Paladin stuns when i slow it to keep aggro on the paladin.<br />
<br />
If im good on mana i load up on dots, and should i overdot, the paladin stuns a few times :D<br />
<br />
If things go out the window, he can help heal very effectively and he can root stuff aswell.<br />
<br />
While i prefer to have a dedicated healer, this duo is the one i favor. I should also add that my paladin friend is very skilled and has all his spells and good AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agreed, take monks off the list for now.  I'd sub in a knight, if you want a tank-type.<br />
<br />
If the changes for warriors, monks and rogues go through as promised - and if the changes do any good - that list will look a lot different.<br />
<br />
I personally prefer the pet partnership because you have 2 disposable tanks.  Dying in EQ is so much of an annoyance, I'd just as soon leave tanking to the pets.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As said before Shaman are a support class and we mix well duo wise with any class and very effectively imo (except for maybe rogues, but I used to do that in seb!).  For a while towards the end of the luclin era, it was me and my mage friend duoing and we got serious exp for that time.<br />
<br />
As for duoing, my advice would be to find out what the other person is the most comfortable with.  The better they are at their class the more effective you're going to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Reasons I love to duo with a Ranger:<br />
<br />
1. Aggro control.  Rangers can take aggro, or ditch it, pretty much at will.  Sometimes it's preferable for the ranger to tank, sometimes for the shaman to tank while the ranger shoots or plays rogue.  Either way, it's extremely easy to manage.<br />
<br />
2.  Buffs which stack with your own.  Maybe not the best, but can add a few hundred HP, some AC, a Damage Shield, etc.  They can also emergency-heal you... not for a lot but it can be a lifesaver.<br />
<br />
3.  Snare and DPS are among the only things a shaman lacks... Ranger brings both.<br />
<br />
4.  Tracking is awesome, nuff said.<br />
<br />
5.  Can pull single outdoors, can help root-park multiples as well when hunting indoors or when multiple pulls are preferable.<br />
<br />
6. Slumming in places like Droga, ranger's stun proc is actually pretty effective as well, especially when they're at max haste and dex.<br />
<br />
7. Forage.  Laugh if you like... a ranger can easily feed themselves, me, and my horse.  Saves on stat foods, since I have a limitless supply of forage to gorge myself with.  Also some Alchemy recipes (LDoN) require foraged ingredients... all free kthx~<br />
<br />
I spent most of levels 1-55 duo with a warrior. While it's very effective, a ranger just brings so much more to the table in a duo, it isn't even funny.  Shaman + Ranger = synergy.<br />
<br />
Much &lt;3 for Rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shadowknight.  Mage has better offensive power but the pet just can't hold up against elemental mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I still like monks.  If you can find one that will stop whining for an hour, anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zanja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have duo'd with a Paladin for all 65 of my levels and so I am biased when this question comes up. I have duo'd with Mages, Necros and Monks successfully but Paladins are stil my favorite. The vast abilities between the two classes leave very little that cannot be overcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just setup a poll so I can read a few numbers god damn posts.. these always stack up.. all have good and valid reasons! <br />
<br />
My belief is we are so good it doesn't matter.. at 45 I duoed with a ranger.. when he left I found the first lfg monk/sk/paladin/ranger/enchanter anything and duoed to get my levels.. hold aggro so I can jbb is all that was needed mostly.. or ok I'll root you charm I'll pull..</div></div><hr />

Ya gnomes suck :p <br />
<br />
I like both paladins and rangers.... pretty much ranger though, they rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I pull a mob with slow. Mob is rushing to me.<br />
Halfway it gets hit by some paladin stun.<br />
Mob changes direction towards paladin.<br />
<br />
Paladins indirectly increase DPS for other classes simply by having aggro lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Necro all the way.<br />
<br />
- FD splits<br />
- Harmshields (similar to DA).<br />
- Rezzes<br />
- Corpse summons<br />
- roots<br />
- snares<br />
- self evacs<br />
- twitch + canni = best mana regen in game<br />
<br />
I 2 box tho but one thing I really love with this combo over any other combo I had in the past... I have no fear when it comes to exploring unknown places.  Scout with necro who has invis and invis to undead.  Things go bad, FD, Harmshield, gate... you die.. np.. summon corpse and rez it.</div></div><hr />
