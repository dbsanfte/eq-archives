<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I recently traded my fungi tunic for Torpor.<br />
<br />
This completed my important spell needs.<br />
<br />
I must say, however, I sure am missing my fungi tunic.  (Of course I've only had torpor one day and haven't quite gotten the hang of it.)  <br />
<br />
Could someone be so kind as to post some advice as to how to best use this spell to it's fullest potential?  I've tried casting it, then canning, canning then casting it, and doing a little in-between.  <br />
<br />
I guess I just got used to having the fungi's regen for the past 10+ levels and perhapse have gotten a bit lazy, not having to really worry about mana regen other than canning down a bit once I get to full life.  (Admittedly the fungi's regen was beginning to lose it's significance as my hp have increased, but I miss the extra mitigation I got from the regen.)  <br />
<br />
Any tips or ideas you could give on how to improve my use of this spell would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What Litchebane said.<br />
<br />
I wore my fungi for quite some time at 60 as I didnt have Torpor. Soon as I did get it I was determined to get a different BP on and boy did it feel strange. It does take a while to get used to not having that regen but eventually you wont miss it, trust me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nmok Soulblighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still have and situationally use my Fungi.  When doing something mana intensive, the Fungi+Torpor+Regrowth+item/AA regen is invaluable.  With 2 AoB effects, AA regen, Regrowth, lvl 60 regen and Fungi I am regen'ing close to 50hps a tick standing.  Throw in the Torpor and I can Cann4 and 5 constantly.  Makes for a much more efficient everything.  I wouldn't trade my Fungi for anything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Remember there are a lot more fungi tunics in Norrath than copies of Torpor =) Sounds like a great trade to me.<br />
<br />
/sighs at still not having Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd gladly trade my fungi for torpor.  I hardly wear my fungi anymore, except under certain circumstances, anyway.  After I finally get torpor, I can only imagine a couple of situations where I would wear my fungi over my wicked mail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bamana, I had the exact experience that you did. When I hit 60 I traded my fungi for Torpor and it took a while to adjust.  While torpor is great, there are downsides that requires a change in tactics:<br />
<br />
- Can't cast torpor while running. This prevents the tactic of running in a big circle while regening some health. <br />
<br />
- Long cast time == interrupts. This has resulted in 2 deaths for me. I would get down to 40% health or so and start to cast torpor... a few interrupts later -&gt; dead lizard. <br />
<br />
- Fungi does not go OOM. This has only happened once to me so far, but the Torpor mana cost is something to be aware of. <br />
<br />
- The snare of torpor basically commits you to stand and fight until it wears off ( or you click it off ). This can be bad if you are rooting some nasty, you torpor, root breaks and it comes to beat on you. Granted, you are being healed insanely, so the mob should not kill you.. but depending on your circumstance, the snare can be bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never had mana problems while soloing anyway, so while soloing, torpor has not made a big difference. I mean for dull everyday grinding - not for uber mob fighting. I've found torpor most useful for: <br />
<br />
- Uber mob fighting. Here I mean basically anything that can summon you and beat the snot out of you. Read any of 4 billion posts on this board to hear about how to solo these with torpor.  <br />
<br />
- Duo fighting. Where I have fallen in love with Torpor most is when fighting as a duo with my monk partner. Since he usually has aggro, I don't have to worry about interrupts or anything as I canni down and torpor up. Every few minutes I toss a torpor on him when he gets to 40% health or so. We can be fighting 3 or 4 mobs at once and I never get below 60% mana. It's so easy, it's kinda sad actually.<br />
<br />
- Raids &amp; AE mobs. Understandably, melee types do not appreciate being torpored in the middle of a big fight. But torpor is great for casters and healers in a fight with AE mobs. The additional healing helps the clerics concentrate on the CH rotation ( or just healing tanks ) and the heal over time function nicely cancels the DoT function of a lot of upper level AE attacks. <br />
<br />
Some miscellaneous ways to use torpor:<br />
<br />
- Preemptive torpor. A mob is inc and he's big and nasty and your job is to slow him. Cast torpor on yourself right before you cast slow. He rushes to beat on you, but torpor gives you some time for the tanks to get aggro back. <br />
<br />
- Stopping that annoying puller who keeps pulling too much. Keep torpor on him and he can't pull so fast. ;)<br />
<br />
- Healing folks who were just rezzed. Clerics seem to love to heal newly rezzed folks, which strikes me as inefficient. In a CR situation, I would assert that Torporing the newly rezzed is more mana efficient/time efficient for the raid as a whole than having the cleric use his mana to do it. Actually, I would extend that further. Given that we have canni + torpor, shamans are always going to have more mana than clerics. So it behooves a raid to use shaman mana in place of cleric mana whenever possible. Let them med up for rezes ( if not epic clerics ) or for buffs while you handle CR healing.<br />

<br />
My monk twink is still sulking though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks guys, I guess it just takes some getting used to.  I've worn that old tunic for so long I almost feel naked without it.  Relying on a 6 second cast spell (no quickbuff yet) to save me has me a bit apprehensive.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll adjust though, thanks for the advice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I sat my Fungi down the other day and had a nice long heart-to-heart. After much discussion, we both agree that if I am presented with Torpor and I am 59, the Fungi goes. <br />
<br />
It will be hard. We have been together a long, long time. Seen many battles together etc. We have agreed to stay friends. When we see each other at large gatherings we will be polite to each other. <br />
<br />
If my Fungi asks for half my exp I am going to have to get a lawyer though :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Best advice I can give for those with a fungi is to sell it and try to buy a Fungus Patch Vest - Fungi sells for 50k on my server, fungus patch for 10-20 - that nets you a fair whack towards your torpor fund</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Traded Fungi for Torpor as well - never regretted it. You can camp the Caller with your Newfound Torpor powers if you miss your Fungi. I did, but when I finally got it I couldnt bring myself to wear it anymore. :)</div></div><hr />
