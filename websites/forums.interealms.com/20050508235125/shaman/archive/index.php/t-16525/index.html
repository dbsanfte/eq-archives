<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a quick question.  We were having a discussion on my guilds board about the fastest way to find out the next tank on the hate list in a raid situation when the MT dies (the next peep taking a beating) so the clerics could change their cheal targets faster.  The consensus was to click on the mob and /assist it to find its current target but I know that when there is 15 people surrounding a mob it is pretty difficult to target using the mouse, and the F8 key has a limited range (at least with me it does). So my suggestion was this.  You could make a hotbutton that looks like this.<br />
<br />
first command line<br />
/assist *secondarytank_X*<br />
second command line<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
With the push of one hotbutton you could have the mobs current target as long as the person you have in the *secondarytank_X* area is not dead yet.  I think a FD'r would be the best choice for something like this.<br />
Any other suggestions or ideas?  I haven't actually tried this so I'm not sure it if would even work.  You may need a /pause in there somewhere.  Or it may be that the /assist command has the same range as the F8..I need to do some testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i usually do f8 assist... but u can make hot keys (for clerics) the tanks name... like 1 for tank a 2 for tank B 3 for tank c and such... so quick hotkey to target the MT... and u should have atleats MT/SA ready for nameds fight...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm Assumming your talking about Single Raid Mobs.  So would this not work?<br />
<br />
/Target RAID_MOB's_Name<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
That should target the said mob in question and then aquire its target.  Now I understand that the name would have to be changed every time.  The mobs name should be well known before the fight.  Partial names work as well but not sure how well it would work for multiple mobs with the same name.  Though I would guess it would target the closest mob in that case.<br />
<br />
Oh as for the F8 key its wierd sometimes it works great other times I cant target any mob and they are standing right in front of me.  Ussually moving to a new location or use of an alternative selection method is needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hit F4 or whatever person in your group you'd know would have the mob on target (wizzy/melee/etc) then assist them then assist the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/targ name has limited range but works as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my /tar name never works, like ever. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just use /assist mobname.<br />
<br />
If you were fighting aow, /assist avatar works, etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With my guild, we just set up an MT order.  First tank, secondary tank, third tank, etc... usually if it goes past the third tank we're going to lose anyways so it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
If the first tank goes down, clerics start healing the second tank.  He AE taunts to take aggro and hopefully gets enough blast heals to stay alive until CH's start landing.  If you have to wait for a tank to call out &quot;I have aggro, heal me!&quot; then that tank is probably going to die.  People need to start healing before he even has aggro.<br />
<br />
On most raids I blast heal.  F8 + assist has always worked for me.  I have never had trouble with things being too far away for F8 to target them, either.  You can be too far away for /assist, but never F8.  I guess if F8 just doesn't work for you, you could make an &quot;/assist Mobname&quot; hotkey.  It doesn't have to be the mob's full name, just the first word (or maybe just the first few letters?  I'm not sure).  I have only used a hotkey like this once, and it was just &quot;/assist Dain&quot; and it worked fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">this may seem odd but this is how iwork   in my actions window i have assists down the tank line 1-6  basically just if raid leader says assist  (tank 4 les say )   for dps   then illl assist 4  but if MT dies usually but not all the time you can assist the corpse on the target then re assist and youl find the tank or person next on the hate list<br />
<br />
<br />
edit :  ohh also i have malos and a few other keys in my actions window you can use them while casting  like /dismount , malos  ,  i have raibid bear  and spirit call keys  while the ones that arent inportnat like cani 5 / spells / VP and slow msg  are in the hotkey bar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can't officially see who is 2nd on the hate list, you can only see who currently has aggro. But if you are quick with your assist key (bouncing between the mob and whoever it has targetted) you can usually get a pretty good idea of who it is.<br />
<br />
Speaking as a cleric here ~ I have a social page filled with hot-keys with /target tank1 through tank10 on them that never get changed. When the tank list is announced before each fight (we always have three of them) it's easy to swap those keys in and out. I always have my /assist key seperate (even in XP groups). If I'm not in the rotation, I'm clicking through the tank list and /assist healing off of the mob. <br />
<br />
I had no idea you could use the /target MOB-name! I had never tried it...<br />
<br />
And of course rampage is a whole 'nother can of worms. Someone taking rampage damage will never be discovered /assisting off of the mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use the tab buffer alot.  During the fight, I will have the mob targeted most of the time.  If (for some inexplicable reason) I need to target someone else, I'll do that and cast my spell (usually a heal) then press tab again to switch back to the main target.  If I need to perform two actions, on two different people, I'll still switch back to the target in between so that I can quickly /assist the mob to get the new target in case the MT dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for all the input everbody.<br />
Deria can you remember what the command was to release the tab feature.  I will tab between myself and tht previous target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">TAB cycles between you and the mob by default.  That's not the buffer you are interested in.  There's another key that toggles between your current and last targets.  I forget what it is by default (if it has a default) but I use backslash (\).  Go to ALT-O, keys, and map it to something you can remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;o&quot; is the defualt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm usually dual comped with my ranger on raids so I just hit the hot key I have to assist him, then assist the mob. Works good and never fails unless the ranger dies, which usually only happens when enrage hits and I'm chatting.(my attack button is remapped to backspace, kinda sucks for enrage but when I made it I was like level 20, didn't know what enrage was)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dcfix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would suggest healing the SA and not worrying about who has aggro. If a wizzie gets summoned, he'll be dead as soon as you get him targeted and the mob will be moving on to the next one. The SA is the SA because they have enough AC/HPS to withstand the onslaught. If the mob wants to kill peeps until he gets to the SA, well, that's just the way that it goes.<br />
<br />
Oh Ya, I refuse to heal peeps that plow enrage (other than MA, of course) until after the engagement. Not exactly the most charitable policy, but if you can't keep you're MA alive then you're in trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Someting i use is my toggle key ever since thay put it in, toggles between the last 2 targets you had so i just make sure that one of my last targtes is the mob were killing and then just hit assist  i have my assist botton and my toggle button keyd to one of the many buttons on my mouse so dosent take more the a sec to target the next persen and start a heal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My bad.  When I said I used the tab buffer, I neglected to mention that I remapped the &quot;switch between your last two targets&quot; thing to the tab button.  I have absolutely no use whatsoever for the orignal tab function.  <br />
<br />
Like the other posters said, press alt+0, go to keybaord, choose &quot;target&quot; from the drop down list, then map &quot;toggle last two targets&quot; to TAB and UN-MAP the existing tab feature (or map it to something else).</div></div><hr />
