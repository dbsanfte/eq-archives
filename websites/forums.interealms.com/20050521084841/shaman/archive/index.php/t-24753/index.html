<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all<br />
<br />
Well In between raiding I want to Duo my shaman/ranger , Ranger is 70 unbuffed 7800hps,ac 1850, aa's 490.<br />
<br />
I was thinking oow zone maybe NC or blood fields, I really want to get <br />
my shaman aa's up poor guy only has 28aa's  he is lvl 65 aswell i really Don't want to lvl him to 70 till i get some core aa's.<br />
<br />
Any spots in Oow, that mobs are fully slowable for a 65 shaman and worth the aaxp for my Ranger aswell.<br />
<br />
I tried the NC spot but that tends to get pretty busy by the time i log on, and ranger has np tanking these mobs fully bufed he is over 10khps.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for any help :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bloodfields isn't that great of xp.  I get 3% regular per hour in 67 duoing my monk and shaman.  Easy, though, and very little chance of death.  The named in the 2nd field wander so the ranger would be good there to grab them.  Items don't sell well but could make for good tribute.<br />
<br />
You could try the ZI in the Ruined City of Dranik.  I can't quite duo there yet.  But the XP should be better and you possibly can take on some of the easy named.  Dragorn Laborer could provide some good loot and runes if you can take him.<br />
<br />
Other option if NC is full is to grab someone to get you a DS expedition.  They can leave right after spawning it.  I haven't done any of these yet, but from what I've read the 66+ ones can spawn named that drop runes.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />

My experience duoing a 68shm 66 monk:  NC is harder than Harbingers is harder than Bloodfields.  XP and loot follow this difficulty trend.  However, in bloodfields nearly everything gives faction hits, whereas in NC about half does, and in harbingers nothing does.  NC you have the possibility of runes, not in bloodfields or harbingers.  All can drop augment stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lately (at least since I read the RCoD thread) I've been farming RCoD.  The XP is fairly nice (3% aa per kill) and I can tank most mobs reasonable well there.  But one thing that makes it duo'able is my shaman has Breath of Trushar + Yoppa's + Qvic arms (45% heal focus) + most healing AA.  Landing a 5.5k crit heal can make the difference between having to pop WS or saving it.<br />
<br />
You may want try easier mobs in WoS as they dont do too much DPS.  But remember to Cripple asap as it does help reduce the procs/triples.</div></div><hr />
