<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Branston Pickle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm a 36 shaman duoing with a 36 paladin.. i'm lucky enough to own a jbb thanks to a friend who recently quit, when i hit 45 i will naturally be chain clicking constantly when not healing or slowing, i was wondering if a paladin (or my pet when soloing) would have any trouble keeping aggro over such nukage, especially after i've slowed the mob, thrown on a poison DoT and possibly cast some other debuff..<br />
<br />
..i know pally stuns have pretty huge hate, but when i cast winter's roar a couple times in a fight currently i'm damn close to her on the hate list</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi-<br />
<br />
45 Shammy here with JBB.  By 45 the winters roar (263) will not be such a big hitter.  With an 8-sec cast time your Pally should have plenty of time to get hated.  Grouping in KC  I slowed and nuked full time and never got aggro.<br />
<br />
I solo with dogdog, and with a slow and JBB nukage dogdog can usually keep aggro np.  If I DOT the MOB will come to see me, but if I stand there for a sec I lose aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If it's any measure, a pally I've worked with for awhile. At the time he was 58th and I was 61. Drop Slow, Crip, Bane, and proceeded to chain JBB, and reapply Bane as needed. Never once got slapped. Then again, I have also known him for awhile, and kinda trained him to MT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You should have no problem whatsoever keeping agro if you have an even halfway decent tank.  Even if you are like me and reguarly group with a monk 14 levels lower (well, only 9 now, she's catching up), your tank still will be able to keep agro most of the time.<br />
<br />
What I want to know though is how people manage to slow, DoT (I use epic and Bane typically, but even with just epic I still have problems), and JBB, but still also manage to have their pet keep agro?  Even when I alpha pet and buff him with everything I've got, I still can't get him to keep agro.  The only way I can think to increase his agro would be to get weapons with procs from the bazaar, but I don't know of any cheap ones with aggravating procs.  Or does the 61 pet hold agro better than the one before it?  Any help on this would be appreciated, because at the moment I always feel like I have to &quot;waste&quot; something, and I'd like to be able to use my epic, jbb, bane, and pet at the same time, while still having my pet tank, if such a thing is possible.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Yes I know I can just root, but JBB/Bane breaks every root I've tried at least 50% of the time.  If I have to re-root and move away (oftentimes a big pain on my drogmor) after every JBB, this isn't really a good option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mage weapons on Pup-pup, help out alot. Also, root is your friend. Still, expect to have the mob up in your face fairly often regardless. It's why unlike the sissy casters, Shammy's go for AC/HP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Really, I am halfway through 58 and I don't even use my JBB anymore on anything but green mobs most of the time. But if I did, the mob would be in my face, because it breaks root more than half the time. <br />
 But nowadays, when I solo, I am pulling with Malosini, sending in the dog to stop the mob, turning and slowing. Mob comes to me on the slow, I root and back up, then drop Plague, Epic, and Bane. Mob 90% of the time comes to me when Bane breaks root, I just re-root, backup and start to Canni. In 30 seconds Bane drops off, I cast Bane again, root him again when he comes to me, sit back and canni again. I might JBB once or twice near the end, when epic quits working. <br />
<br />
 But I find my time is better spent cannibalizing rather than JBB'ing. If I don't canni during the fight, I have to wait and do it after. If I canni during, I can pull immediately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Velium wepons are cheap in the bazaar, but its easier to just go to the timzak caves in GD and get them yourself.  Look for one with a weapon in its hand and kill it.  Takes about 10 minutes to get a couple of bags of them.  Dogdog keeps aggro from me when alphaed with these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you don't drop that many dots on a mob, your dog can hold aggro while you chain-jbb a mob to death, if that tells you anything. A good paladin or sk should have no problem holding aggro unless you cast several poison based dots right after you slow a mob. Even then, they'll probably just lose aggro for a moment. Warriors, on the other hand.... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I second the advice above--Blades of Walnan or Fists of Ixiblat (the 61 and 62 mage proc weaps) really help the 61 pooch keep agro even when you are using dots.  Buff pet with mortal deftness + HoS to max procs, rather than focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can stack HoS and Mortal Deftness?  /boggle @ spell stacking logic.<br />
<br />
As for the whole &quot;It's why unlike the sissy casters, Shammy's go for AC/HP&quot; thing, believe me I know.  My poor cleric friend has gotten used to healing Loramin the &quot;shaman-tank&quot; because I used to have a habit of slowing multiple things (in places like KC hands) without bothering to worry about agro.  I've since learned a lot about agro control, but the importance of velium weapons for DogDog escaped me.  No more cheap pirate crap for me anymore!<br />
<br />
Thanks all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Only time a JBB has ever gotten me aggro is when I have also DOTted with the epic.  In the last few ticks the epic is doing a LOT of damage; if a JBB blast lands during that time it can peel the mob right quickly.<br />
<br />
Even my pet will hold aggro against epic+chain JBB until the last couple of ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have hardly ever had aggro problems with chain jbb/dogtank.  Once the mob thinks I have been sufficiently pummeled for slowing it, dog takes over and I epic/chain jbb.  No problems at all.  However, if I BoN too quick, I'll be the aggro magnent.<br />
