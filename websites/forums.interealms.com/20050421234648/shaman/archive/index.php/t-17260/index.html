<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any experience soloing CT? I understand you can get single pulls in the maze area, but I'm not sure how easy it would be to get into there. I've hunted in CT just once with my warrior, and that was obviously in a group. I remember there being some mobs who could see invis, so I'm a bit worried about stumbling my way around the zone to get to a good solo camp spot.<br />
Any advice is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the exp in CT is painfully bad.<br />
<br />
The tradeskill drops however are worth mucho platinum. I personally wouldn't solo there until at least level 60, when it becomes a lot easier because of torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo'd the two entrance mobs at 58.  It wasnt easy as you have to keep one rooted--root one at entrance and zone back and forth didnt work for me at all.  They have a substantial amount of hp and hit hard enough that it was awful exp.  Although i was only after blood so i didnt have too long a wait before i could leave.  I have no experience around the maze area, but assume the mobs follow the same as the entrance and are probably more difficult.<br />
<br />
You could try it, but i advise against doing it as a way to level up.  Only do it if you have something you want to get as a drop.  The upside of CT is its an outdoor dungeon so you can use a horse/lizard in it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kinda dissapointing, it could be a great zone. I'm always after a bit of XP while I look for drops, but I'm willing to make a sacrifice to get the tradeskill stuff. I understand that the &quot;brown&quot; lizards drop blood/scales more often and that you find more of them in the maze area, which is why I'm asking about that area specifically.<br />
Anyone with experience hunting in there, please give me some idea of how hard it is to work your way into the right camp, and how difficult you think it would be at 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i dont know if you've done it yet, but try soloing just the entrance mobs.  I dont think you'll have MUCH more difficulty in any other area, although i havent done these areas myself.  If you cant handle just the entrance and maybe courtyard solo..you probably dont want to attempt elsewhere :) .  The zone is always deserted anyhow so you could do it the old-fashioned way..run in and try and if you are in trouble run your butt off to the zone line.<br />
<br />
At 59 (without torpor) you're going to have issues on healing most likely.<br />
<br />
The entrance mobs drop blood about 1 in 5 or so, and if thats all you need (all thats required for shields/chain armor) this is probably not a bad option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did the entrance area as a warrior, the 2 entrance mobs and courtyard mobs have a real poor drop rate. Looks like I'm just gonna have to go and see what I can do.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I finally figured out how to split the 2 entrance mobs without much difficulty.<br />
<br />
1. maloXXX one of them and zone<br />
2. maloXXX the other one and zone.<br />
3. slow the one you intend to pull and zone<br />
4. root the one you didnt slow and pull him back to the zone and root him and zone.<br />
5. zone in refresh root, summon pet and go to town.<br />
6. refresh slow.<br />
6. make sure you give pet a full set of goodies if you are using the lv 55 pet. Its important to make sure he stays on the top of the aggro list if you dont want to be summoned. Its easier to let him do the dps with your dots trailing behind so you can focus on keeping mana up.<br />
<br />
I did this at 57, but I'd imagine it would be a whole lot easier with canni4 and kraggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I actually tried the entrance the other day at 60, just to guage how well spells land and how hard they hit. Very easy to split them, just root one and the other pulls himself. Depending on how long root lasts on the first one, you may not even have to zone. Not much danger in trying this as zone line is right behind you. They DO summon though so you'd have to be aware of that when trying to make an exit.</div></div><hr />

Call me crazy, why not just keep one rooted away from you? Sure beats the hell out of zoning 5 times. Not to mention having to summon pet and buff him while in the middle of engaging mobs is going to drain your mana really fast. Also, slowing and maloxxx and rooting before you even begin fighting would already have your mana low to begin with. And if you med up, then the slows have to be recast, which defeats the purpose of casting it in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I think its a cool way of splitting mobs you came up with, just don't think it's really a viable strat for soloing.</div></div><hr />

The problem was mainly that root would get resisted or would wear off to quick at level 57 (using PE). My 3 or so attempts went:<br />
<br />
1) rooted lizard 1, resist, zone.<br />
2) rooted lizard 1, landed, slowed incoming lizard, was taking it to the zone to park it, root breaks on parked lizard, and he made it to me before i could park the slowed one and get back to reroot.<br />
3) same as 2 but root wore off earlier.<br />
<br />
after this I just wanted revenge, thus the 5 zoneins/outs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tardis420</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 65 I solo the entrance for the blood, you can keep the other one rooted, and slow the other one when he comes for you, sick pet on other one when root breaks and keep that up, but can be a pain.Just got to torp pet or better if you have it.While you take the other one on. Found it easier to just root one and pull other one back to zoneline, root it and zone. Zone back in and kill the one rooted by entrance. Then can take your time and bring pet out and buff up with toys and such before pulling the other one. Now the entrance is split up and can pull at ease.<br />
Pulling from the courtyard is kind hard, the raptors generally add when pulling.Aslo get more than one lizard on pull.If you want to pull courtyard bring along your fav druid to harmony.Use your vision spell to look through mobs eyes in courtyard and have druid assist you and target all to pacify before pulling.Same way if you want to do the maze.Found the best spot to pull in there is to pull from hallway leading to temple, invi and run there conning everything on the way.Can pull lizards from the left around the moniliths, using harmony from druid. and to your right is 2 spiders around some more monoliths. These are ph for 2 named spiders that spawn there.Hope this helps someone...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the warriors and wardens are almost 4aa per kill at level 58- not bad. Having a harmony bot in here would make for a good bit of run for splitting stuff. The best spot (non maze) that I have found is the hole into the sewers (with a harmony bot).<br />
<br />
Go out main doors of the CY, make and immediate right and up the ladder. go through either door on the ledge and go down until you see the 4/5 spawn of lizards (all melee type). harmony and pull back to the hall way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This zone is a good challenge.  I'm not one who gets to solo much, being the main shaman in my guild, so I get a lot of requests for groups.  But that doesn't mean I don't get the hankering to solo every once in awhile!<br />
<br />
I usually do CT, 'cause it's a challenge, and there's a small chance for decent loot.  So far I've only done the entrance/CY.  But I've got it down pretty good.<br />
<br />
The 2 door mobs at the entrance are always melee mobs.  Either a warder or warrior.  Lotsa hps and interrupt casting annoyingly often, but they do not cast any spells.  Get setup in the corner, summon dogdog, buff him, get buffed up, have slow and root memmed (the 64 root is excellent), then root one of them.<br />
<br />
The other will run towards you, so target him and sic dogdog on him before he gets to ya.  Dogdog grabs agro pretty quick.<br />
<br />
Slow the one dogdog is on, or dogdog will meet a quick death.  This will bring agro onto you, but not a biggie.  He's slowed, so you should be able to take his hits.  Then re-target the rooted lizard down the hall, Malosinia him, slow him, then re-apply root.  Now you've got both of them in a very controlled situation.<br />
<br />
Go back to the one beating on you, DoT the shiot out of him, keep you and dogdog healed and he'll go down in less time than it takes for the other to break root.<br />
<br />
Get healed up and get some mana on ya and about that time the other root will break... re-slow him, and do the same thing.  DoT, DoT, DoT.  Soon ya got the 2 door lizards dead and split up pretty good.<br />
<br />
Now the fun part!  Open the door to the courtyard, and there is a campfire right there.  2 mobs spawn here and can be any type of lizard.  Sometimes you'll get 2 melee mobs and if so, then use the same tactic to split them as you did the door mobs.  Not that hard.<br />
<br />
But half the time a caster or 2 will spawn here, and these guys can make life a living hell!  Make sure you have dogdog parked back at the entrance, and be ready to spam the &quot;pet back off&quot; key.  Root one of the casters and RUN back to the entrance to avoid the incoming nukes.  Chances are you will get nuked anyway.  This will 'cause dogdog to go running after the caster, and this will mess you up bad.  The most important thing in this fight is to keep dogdog away from the casters while you are splitting and pulling them!<br />
<br />
These casters dispell, nuke and most of all, poison AoE.  This sucks!  If you're like me and poison resists are your worst resist, these rains will do a good number of damage to ya.  Make sure you have yer best poison/disease resists up!<br />
<br />
Anyway, at this point, you and dogdog should be back at the entrance with *one* caster engaged.  Malosinia and slow him.<br />
<br />
Then!  run back to the mob outside at the campfire, malosinia him, then root him!  Now root should disable this mob for the rest of the fight.  Run back to the entrance, where dogdog is most likely in a world of hurt from the caster rains.  Torpor/Stoic/Q can keep him alive while you do that.<br />
<br />
Casters have less hps than the melee mobs, but do a heckuva lot more damage, and never seem to run out of mana, so the real battle is staying alive and killing the caster as quick as you can.  I usually mem Velium Strike for this, 'cause the casters usually have high poison resists and will resist your poison nukes, even after Malosinia.<br />
<br />
Keep yours and dogdog's health high and then Nuke like a mofo!  Burn him down, and it should only take a min or 2 to kill him.<br />
<br />
Now you still have one mad caster rooted out in the courtyard.  You have a couple of choices here; zone out and clear agro and then come back in and lick yer wounds...<br />
<br />
Or be a man, and confront him!  Make sure you got enough juice to do it, then wait for the root to break.<br />
<br />
Same thing, just keep yourself Torpor'd, and nuke him into the ground.  Like I said, these casters will chain AoE poison rain all over you, and it's not uncommon for me to walk away from those battles minus dogdog, as he doesn't resist the rains very well.<br />
<br />
But once you have those mobs split up, you now have a fairly easy job of doing the entrance and CY now with single pulls, which makes things much easier.  <br />
<br />
The raptors will sometimes add -- these guys are pussies, and once slowed are a cinch.  I normally just make sure me or dogdog doesn't do any damage to them ('cause they'll summon you and annoy the crap outta you) and keep them rooted off in the distance until the first mob is dead.  Then quickly dispatch of the raptor.  They have less hps, so they're much easier to take down.  They're mainly just for annoyance, as they don't drop much of anything and give very little xp.<br />
<br />
I get about 2-3 bloods an hour doing this.  I want to 2-box my monk and go into the throne area to see if I can get a haste belt for him... not real sure of the see invis capabilities of CT yet.. so that might make it tough to invis there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wonder do you think this could be done 2boxed with a lower something monk? and a uppr 50 maybe 60 shammy? The monk to split so no need to zone?</div></div><hr />
