<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is it okay for me to hunt in pog? or is that going to mess up my faction for something else which i'll regret later. little worried after reading a couple of posts from people who didn't understand where they were hunting. and i went with some ranger/druid friends to pog once, just to look around. they told me several times not to touch anything. :) just wanna make sure, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">factions are overrated.  have fun, kill whatever you want.  anything you need to buy in elf-town you can buy elsewhere.  hell, when was the last time you were in Gfay, etc actually doing anything?? prolly been months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree with Wildaar there... heh... as long as you don't lose your faction in each and every place in all the game, no need to worry about it :p<br />
<br />
I think the only good quests in PoG that you might miss out of is for Tunare worshippers, so unless you are a VahShir shaman on Sullon Zek (and maybe Firiona Vie?) there's no real loss at all for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hell, I've XP'd in Felwithe :) (I'm a Barb Shaman, FYI)<br />
<br />
There's a Guild on my Server that only allows Dark Races or Worshippers of Berty, Cazi, Rallos or Inny...   They made it their goal to &quot;raid&quot; every &quot;light&quot; city in Norrath...  Since I'd already hunted in POG, I want along one night to a Felwithe Raid.   Was kind of fun to pull the Paladin Trainer to the zone and lay a smacking on him :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Faction you lose by hunting in POG:<br />
<br />
PoG faction - gone forever<br />
<br />
Felwithe - cleric and paladin guild, can still bank freely, just don't go near the cleric/paladin guilds.  Faction can painfully be restored, not sure how but a cleric in my guild did it.<br />
<br />
Kelethin - druid/ranger guild, can still bank freely, do tradeskills, whatever, just don't go near the druid/ranger guilds.<br />
<br />
Some blue to 60 guy in BW, chases me all the time, I hate him.<br />
<br />
Some greenie mobs in DC on the way to Kedge, they chase me all the time, I hate them.<br />
<br />
Supposedly, some chick on the docks in FV, never had a problem in FV, can bank, go to shaman guild, etc.<br />
<br />
I think that POG sucks, unless my guild wants to go back to lay the smack down on Tunare, I consider my blown faction there a waste (not terribly important, but a waste).  The drops are bad, the annoying every 28 minute POGS are horrible and gating/summoning mobs are irritating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoG would be cool if armour dropped more frequently.  It's better than Kael in the sense that the latter requires gems to obtain the end result; PoG also looks much better.  But the drops are too rare if you're fighting non-nameds.  Plus like rangers, druids and pallies are shafted.<br />
<br />
There's another thing I really don't like about Growth, and it's the layout.  As you zone in, you generally have to clear surrounding mobs on west wall.  Not only is their drop rate ****ty, but you won't find bp's or legs on them.  Basically, those pieces drop on the other side of the river off serenes, sylvans, thiflings, etc.  Unless you wanna risk running your crew invis there to skip the foreplay, you'll have to clear non-bp/legs-dropping mobs for quite a while.  Those PoG's are annoying too and does slow down the clearing process.<br />
<br />
There are some pros to PoG though.  For Tunare worshippers, there are some really nice quests like helm of the tracker.  It's a nice place to farm gems, not only for resist gear, but also to cover guild expenses such as peridot/coffin costs.  <br />
<br />
Finally, some nameds you're sure will drop a piece of armor, and there is one in particular worth mentionning that roams close to zone in: Galiel Swiftfoot.  He always drops a random pair of leggings, and all ya gotta do to find out if he's up is have a non-kos druid check.  Quick and easy way to make one guild member very happy (unless it's bst leggings which would prolly suck :D). <br />
<br />
Anyways, hunting in PoG will only affect your faction with tunare guilds in Faydwer.  There's a couple treehugging npc roamers close to gfay bank, but they're like level 20 max and the guards don't assist.  I think you can fix your faction with them too by doing some sort of muffin quest, but I could be wrong, I'd never be caught dead doing a muffin quest - sounds too much like Little Red Riding Hood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We killed the name Treant there the other day and he dropped:<br />
<br />
:drumroll:<br />
<br />
BST Tunic after a 20 min fight.  Everyone was so pumped up about it, it rotted.<br />
<br />
Great Reward near 2 am after being there 5+ hours.  Oh ya, it was the ONLY thing that dropped.<br />
<br />
Vote NO to proposition POG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">pog can have good rewards for mid level guilds that cant do tov, if you know where to hunt and what mob to kill.<br />
<br />
Nameds are guaranteed drops, and it isnt too hard to clear for treah and fayl that always drop BP's.<br />
<br />
The only problem with pog nowadays is that the tunare killing guilds have to clear all the plane, with the exception of 2-3 mobs they kite, so nameds arent up a lot anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went on my first POG raid recently, it was the best raid I've done for quite a while. Even though we got wiped twice, we regrouped and kicked tree hugger arse.<br />
<br />
On my server at least, the protectors seem to be broken currently, we never had to fight one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hosed faction last night, was a great fun plane, actually had fun :)</div></div><hr />

Elves aren't really aren't bad. Properly cooked of course.</div></div><hr />
