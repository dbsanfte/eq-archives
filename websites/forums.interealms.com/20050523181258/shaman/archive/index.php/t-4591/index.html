<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading the spells forum and came across a list of slowable/unslowable mobs.  On this list, it says Kerafym (Sleeper) is slowable.<br />
<br />
Is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it wouldn't matter either way I think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deacis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is slowable, and quads for 2k...<br />
<br />
Definitely doable with current standards me thinks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ouchy Dathurts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Except he has like a trillion HP doesnt he?=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Would be interesting to know if he was. Like say he was taking out Skyshrine.  Send in a few sacrificial shamans, bards, and enchanters to debuff him, have them die.  The slowed Kerafyrm will continue with his happy slaying fest except he'll be hitting 75% slower and consequently taking more damage, especially from Yelinak :D<br />
<br />
Imagine if Yelinak killed the Sleeper this way, all you'd have to do is hit the Sleeper once (with a spell or melee) and you'd get the exp, and thus his loot :)  Alternatly, you could join in on the fight with Yelinak if you manage to get everyone non-kos in skyshrine.  <br />
<br />
Altho I don't know how long Yelinak would last on DT's, even on on a slowed Kerafyrm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deacis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yelinak lasts 2 mins or a bit less against Kerafyrm with slow on.<br />
<br />
Was done by someone a while back :p<br />
<br />
According to the showeq people, Sleeper had 2 million HP, or 2 billion, cant really remember. <br />
<br />
If comparing Kerafyrm to Emperor for instance, which on average is a 20 minute fight give or take a few, with 2 billion HP would mean a fight lasting 333 hours :p<br />
<br />
Healing would be easier on Kerafyrm though, unless they gave him some nasty AE. DT will be the big kicker in that fight though. But if tanks were willing, and enough where present you could cycle them in theory :p Or aim to get some 20k hp tanks with PoP gear :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After 333 hours of battle rezzing I'd be level -14.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hahaha lvl 14 trying to refresh slow: Drowsy inc!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kerafym??  What is this mob?  Where does it spawn?  Why isn't it on my server.....oh wait, that's right it WAS on my server!!!<br />
<br />
Are there really still servers out there with an unf***ed ST?? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sleeper sleepin on Xev!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">what was the whole deal with ST/kerafym? i know he was gone from quellious before i ever started playing but i've never seen the story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes he is slowable.  I didn't do it cause I got resisted but a shaman standing next to me landed it heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dont mind his DT (stupid mob ability in my book).  If it were to be done, it would seriously take a whole server if you wanted to slay him and not your sanity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Believe it or not, some things in EQ aren't meant to be killed.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know that every time a GM event happens the first thing people do is try to kill the GM, regardless if its a 'blind woodelf' or a 'helpless gnome'.  But that doesn't change the idea that not every mob in the game is a source of xp or loot.<br />
<br />
Everlore is a good place to find out how to kill the Sleeper (and even meet a few people who know a person who is in the guild with a person who saw a person who *almost* killed the Sleeper).;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is slowable, and quads for 2k... <br />
<br />
Definitely doable with current standards me thinks...<br />
<br />
Haha.   Kerafym has 2.14 BILLION HP, thats ~1000x what Aten Ha Ra has and Aten takes ~40 minutes to kill.  Even if he didn't Death Touch it would take you DAYS of non-stop attacking to kill him.<br />
<br />
But yes, he is slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Deacis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Said it was doable... ;) D<br />
<br />
Did also post how long it would take to kill him :p<br />
<br />
Imagine euro/asian/us guilds spending a few weeks nonstop killing him :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No he doesn't have 2.14 billion hps.... we watched the hp bar move a little before he killed us all.  More likely its 2.14 million.  Yes hes slowable.  It took him 2 minutes to kill Yelinak when unslowed, not slowed.  The guy in that thread said he tashed him was all.  Yes he DTs, no it doesn't refresh very often.  The big problem you'd have fighting him conventially is he tends to charm the people highest on the aggro list (more then one at a time if i remember right).  I always thought if you could slow him when he engages yelinak, then go to town with rangers and wizards from a distance, you could at least take a nice chunk off him.  /shrug, think hes only around on 2 or 3 servers any more.  Maybe someday on stormhammer they'll get the gms to reset him a few times so they can practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dunno, normally the mobs who aren't meant to be killed are immune to any type of spell except the irresistable ones.  I can think of the Nexus Scion and I'm pretty sir the same applies to Sirran the Lunatic.  So it strikes as very odd that the Sleeper is indeed slowable.<br />
<br />
So that got me thinking a little as to how you can possibly defeat him.  And maybe SS is not the answer, but how about Western Wastes for instance?  If I'm not mistaken, he bulldozes through that zone as well.  Since he's kos to all, pc and npc alike, I imagine he's insta aggro to all mobs in standard aggro range.   So how about this then? First off, have everyone who plans on taking him down on CoV faction.  Have waves of people tag Kerafym and train him through the entire zone.  As people die from dt or dragon ae, send people in to replace them, and so on and so forth till near damn every dragon in Western Wastes is chasing him.  Sontalak of course would be a huge bonus :D<br />
<br />
I foresee one problem though, and that's maintaining aggro on Kera and distracting him from the other pursuing dragons.  /shrug maybe with  aggro spells chained over and over (ie turgurs tash snare lifetaps etc).  Bah, but he'll eventually end up summoning, thus making it harder to actually move forward.  <br />
<br />
That or slow Kerafym and train him to Sontalak.  I'm thinking Sontalak should last a couple minutes, and in the meanwhile, have all guildies train every mob they could find against Kerafym.  With the increasing amount of tactics needed these days in the high end game, I imagine people can time it so close that 40 dragons can be trained onto Kerafym at once while Sontalak is tanking for a good couple of mins.<br />
<br />
Let's say the average hit of each dragon trained is 300, double (600 per round).  That means for the train of 40 of dragons, that's a total of 48000 damage per round of hits (not to mention ae).  And sure he will probably manage to kill those in time, but in the meanwhile, you keep on repeating the train process, wave after wave.<br />
<br />
Just look at this way.  If you're gunna stand toe to toe alone with Sontalak, you're gunna get so owned it's not even funny.  If Sontalak stands toe to toe with Kerafym, ditto.  But one of the main reasons guilds stand a chance at defeating Sontalak is in large part due to numbers, plain and simple.  <br />
<br />
Maybe just maybe theres a way to keep 20 mobs constantly on Kerafym if you had the whole guild running around WW tagging every possible mob they can.<br />
<br />
Altho I do realize all of this is very far-fetched, but doesn't hurt to theorize, and let the imagination run wild every once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The zone-wide Deathtouch kinda obliterates any sort of strategy you can think of.  <br />
Short of haxoring . . . .<br />
And you know every GM would be there for the sleeper's awakening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Zone-wide DT?  When he was released on Solusek Ro, I happened to be in Skyshrine at the time.  He killed me 3 times, once to dt (I was like 10 feet away from him), both others straight up melee because he was farming wl zoneline.</div></div><hr />
