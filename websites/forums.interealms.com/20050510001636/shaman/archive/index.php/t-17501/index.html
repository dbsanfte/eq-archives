<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">copy this to the bottom of your dulak_1 map, and you'll have the spawn spots of all the good cave rares marked. All of these are confirmed by moi. good drops for alts or farming, and all can be fought without adds, if you're careful. I run between camps with invis and just kill ph's/nameds. start with the luggald assassin (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11658) . pull him/ph to the NE corner after the pathers go away. after he's down, re-invis and head to the enraged soulstealer (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11201)  (there is a pather that comes through here that you need to watch for). kill him and then move to the defiled dedicant (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=13656) downstairs. invis up to the spot, stand a little bit past the statue north of the defiled you can get a root off before he runs to you, and then either root rot him or fight him at his spawn point. There is a mob in the water that will add if defiled gets too far into the pool, and you also have to be careful of the same pather that goes by the enraged camp. after dropping him, invis and run to the fleshchild of innoruuk's (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11282) room. SE corner is safe to pull to. Then it's off to Incantator Cawrolis (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12977) , who is rumored to have one of the better drops in the zone, the bowl of bonedust (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23089) , though I have yet to see it. <br />
<br />
All of these guys are dark blue to 65 and not that hard to handle. Have fun. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have seen the Bowl of Bonedust off of Incantator Cawrolis, keep in mind it's very very rare. He also will charm you if there are more than one in the group. Actually, in his room can be nice AA from 62-64, at 65 most mobs turn LB. You can also get some ok cash there too. All I did was pull with slow, epic, sick pet, and then JBB to death, pulling 2 at a time so they don't run away, and chain pull. Just watch yourself, mobs can still put some hurt on you after time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, this is good info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Having pocket pet 2 now, I'm always looking for stuff like this.  Thanks kindly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you're missing a named or three btw... the one i can think of is a cleric that likes to CHeal itself (about the middle of the cave system, gave me a real run for my money at 63--drops nothing worth camping AFAIK).  The others i forget~<br />
I think the only camp really worth it for the item is the soulstripper camp, and the mobs around here are still somewhat LB at 65.  The cash loot to be had here used to be REALLY good, but its been pretty much nerfed to nothing now :( so if you dont get a named you've basically wasted your time if you arent getting experience...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The blackened cloak of the dedicant off the defiled dedicant is a pretty good cloak for selling, but I have killed him probably 6 times without it ever dropping.  Always get the Medallion of Hatred drop instead.</div></div><hr />

yeah, I left out the ones with the really crappy loot. not that the listed mobs don't often drop crap (unhoy scribblings comes to mind  :(), but in a cycle it's easy to hit those mobs and by the time you get back to the first spawn, they're already popping again. I don't bother with the dog on any of these, though I do save spririt call for Cawrolis, primarily for the interrupts. I get quite a few gems here, mostly sapphires and diamonds, so even without the named drops it still pays off. another tip, don't let the flesh rot. even at 65, I get 2% aaxp for turning them in to Grisk in wfp. not a bad deal imo, for ghetto xp whilst farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Luggald Taskmaster: I dont know the exact loc but he is past the bridge and take your first right (towards fleshchild) he spawns on the steep incline below the phantasmist<br />
<br />
Shrouded Cave Lurker: First mob past bridge<br />
<br />
Linlanik Throatcutter: Past bridge keep going straight all the way until the cavern turns right (towards Cawrolis) he spawns right there.<br />
<br />
Should be noted these 3 mobs drop junk, I wouldn't bother camping them.. but sure.. kill em if they are up.<br />
<br />
With Suspended Minion 2 you could camp Soulstealer, Defiled, Fleshchild, and Cowrolis before they start to respawn again. I had to do this a couple days ago because of a server crash I lost my soulstripper.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the night or early morning you'll probably be the only one back there... most people are there to camp the boats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt that they drop it. After having killed hundreds of them, I would think that I'd have seen it drop by now. I'd love to be proven wrong though :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone know which mobs drop the rare page for GRC?<br />
<br />
Yaeth's 73 dropped for me twice (many months ago), while camping Fleshchild and Cowrolis.<br />
<br />
If it still drops here, thats where you'd find it as those mobs are about the correct level.  <br />
I'd suspect it might drop off of the hard ship captain event... but thats just a hunch</div></div><hr />
