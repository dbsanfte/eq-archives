<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got Disinfecting Aura and was wondering if I can move Abolish Disease and Counteract Poison to the back of my spellbook? I can't find any information on how many counters it removes of each so am not sure if its just a convience spell or replaces them completely. Thanks for any information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, looked around on Lucy and came up with this. <br />
<br />
Disinfecting Aura removes 10 counters of Disease and Poison.<br />
Abolish Disease removes 36 counters of Disease.<br />
Counteract Poison removes 8 counters of Poison.<br />
<br />
Didn't see any higher level poison cures in Casters Realms spell chart. Abolish Poison was listed cleric only. So unless the mob was doing both Disease and Poison I would probably stick with Abolish Disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Disinfecting Aura is 10 counters twice for a total of 20, not just 10 counters.<br />
<br />
There is currently no poison or disease in the entire game with more than 18 counters.<br />
<br />
In other words, if it is poison/disease curable 1 cast of DA will remove it. Period.<br />
<br />
As it stands, DA totally replaces both Abolish Disease and Counteract Poison. Only if they add a Disease or Poison with more than 20 counters will there be any reason to use anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry, Grummus' dot can only be removed in one cast with abolish disease (disenfecting aura will not cure it in one cast).<br />
<br />
From Lucy:<br />
<br />
Stench of Decay<br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 200 per tick <br />
3:  Increase Stamina Loss by 10 <br />
4:  Increase Disease Counter by 36</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yatta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As Gloriana stated, there are some with massive DR counters. However, I prefer abolish disease (when dealing with dr spells) mostly because it's 50 less mana. Plus if you've ever fought shaman mobs, you'll have a tank or some melees with slow + disease DoT etc on them, Abolish cleans them off faster.<br />
<br />
Generally though, yes, disinfecting aura will take care of poison or disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oops. I missed a few because of the way I did my search - 90%+ of diseases/poisons have the counters in slot 1 and the method I used didn't get any that are in other slots.<br />
<br />
In that case, I retract my previous statement about Abolish being effectively obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are a grand total of 7 spells in the lucy database (well as of a Dec 23 2002 export of Lucy) which have over 20 disease counters.<br />
