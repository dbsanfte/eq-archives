<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi its me again, P.<br />
<br />
Money has become the main issue as I have approached 40.  JBB time is close and i have 2kpp. Currently on tribunal JBB goes for around 10 times that much.:mad:  but you can find em about once every month or so around 10k.  But that isnt the problem, the problem is where and how can i make this type of money in 5 lvls, it has become my top priority to get this thing, even though along the way i have been told it is the stupidest idea i have ever listened to, or at least not worth it.  I am not big on soloing because of my mana downtime (which is the real reason i'm looking forward to this...) OK back to the subject. Where and how can i get this type of money on a largely populated server?<br />
<br />
Any help would be deeply appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One option would be to group in RM and slaughter as many HGs as you can. They'll be a bit tough to solo at your level. You can do it, but it'll be painfully slow in terms of downtime. At 44 it'll be much faster as the 44 spells are pretty nice. Just find a good group if possible and pull every giant you can find. A variation would be to find a high level warrior (or any high level) and just serve as slower/healer. I made a lot of cash here towards my jbb fund and exp was decent in RM from 44 to 47,48. After that, it slowed down, but if you're still liking the cash, you can probably stay until 49 (can't remember when everything started turning light-blue/green). Good luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same thing in OOT with seafuries, they are slow and hit like pansies and drop mucho pp/gems.. try to get the gornit camp he's a level 35 ish hill giant you can spank for 5 - 40p per loot<br />

Get a partner at *least* !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very similar question here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3430)<br />
<br />
At your level, the only way you're going to make any serious money is buying low and selling high. Your alternative is just to suck it up and level until you're high enough to start making money that way.<br />
<br />
My take (snagged from the thread)<br />
<br />
It's not the popular answer, but I think it's the best one: Buying and selling. <br />
<br />
You can make more money in a shorter period of time doing that than anything else. Hang out in the EC tunnel, open up the Trade channel, buy low, and sell high. <br />
<br />
Ideally you want to trade in items that sell fairly frequently (so you're not stuck holding inventory for a long time) and for a defined range (varies by server- so you'll have to do your own homework.) For example, buy an FBSS for 3k and sell it for 4k. In my tunnel rat days, I'd often use my own gear as stuff to sell, if I was sure I could buy it back fairly quickly. I knew I could buy a set of JB arms for 500 pp in an hour or two, so if I saw &quot;WTB Shaman Gear&quot; I'd send a tell offering my arms for 700 pp. <br />
<br />
There are, of course, some tricks (don't buy and sell with the same character, prices vary by timezone- sometimes it's better to do your buying early in the morning and your selling during primetime, or vice versa... etc.) but you get the general idea. <br />
<br />
Yup, it sucks compared to killing stuff... but where else are you going to make that kind of money at level 40?<br />
<br />
P.S.  At least on Karana, Gornit is perma-camped.  I've never seen him open.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thank you for your inputs, i have tried gornit solo, but it didnt work out (i was running for my corpse alot) so if i decide to do that again i am bringing a friend.  I have been to crystal caverns and fairly liked it, the exp is slow, but that gives me more time for money before lvl 45.  I duoed with a guy who claimed  a 1400pp in 2 days about a week before so im probably sticking there for a day/week/month/whatever.  I think this thread should be stickied because i know there are gonna be many other shallow pocketed shamans like me coming to this board.  FG's in Fironia Vie also look quite tasty ;)  but im waiting till 43ish.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I spent countless hours killing HG's when I was in my low 40's (enough to amass the 12k it took to get my JBB).  It was pretty dull but very worth every moment.  Even at 60 I pop back to take out the HG's if I am in need of a quick couple of thousand plat as there is nowhere as good for guaranteed income as RM at 8:00am on a saturday morning - normally pretty empty and all the HG's you can lay waste to (that and the fact 4+ at a time is not a problem these days).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">shrug, CC with a duo monk getting velium to sell to a tailor is just as feasible for money as hill giants.  But i think the ocnsensus is that you arnt going to do it solo, you will have to duo and share some of the loot.<br />
(advantage to CC is that no monk is going to want bricks of velium, while tailors and smiths will pay you for them)</div></div><hr />
