<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dunno about you guys, but despite the lack of changes to shamans I like it. A lot. The pet pathing has been much better, at least as far as I have experienced (notable places that have been much better are rockhopper caves and Dulak). <br />
<br />
But my favorite thing is how mob HP updates. I hated how before mob HP would update every tic. Thats 6 seconds. It does it darn near instantly now. Its so much easier to gauge group DPS as well as how quickly a mob is going to die, plus you know when to cancel DD's much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They f'd up the time it takes to update your hp bar after c5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually I noticed that as well with C4 and all of the canni's really. Thats kind of frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know i thought my necro was registering lifetaps on a delay, but i thought i just didnt notice it before.<br />
<br />
Have to check it out on shaman later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, all in all a pretty good patch.  I was happy with group haste being fixed for sure.  I got to use it quite a bit tonite for a 6 group raid with 0 chanters.  Of course very few people knew it was haste and the dex buff icon didn't help but after explaining it a few times I think they got it (dense melees  ;) ).  <br />
<br />
The charm nerf wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Now instead of getting experience 4 or 5 times faster solo than in a group they only get exp 2 or 3 times faster.  I'm not one to call for nerfs but something needed to be done and though I don't know if it was enough it is something.  On a plus side I still won't really be competing for the slow spot in groups since I think chanters will still solo a lot.<br />
<br />
The faster updating the mobs hps was nice and I actually kind of like the delay on canni 5.  It gives torpor time to heal me up a little more before the clerics/druids realize my hps are a little low and heal me.  I swear even using a canni hotkey telling them not to heal me they do it out of spite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Um.. the nerf to Bear form is pretty major for shamen in my opinion.  I used to love Bear Form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nerf to Bear Form?  Weh?<br />
<br />
I thought they changed animal forms to reflect your normal faction, something Bear Form already did (with the exception of screwing up some quests).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bear form used to modify factions quite positively for me.   Went from dubious -&gt; kindly in skyshrine while using bearform.  scowling -&gt; dubious in Nadox.  scowling -&gt; indifferent in Torgiran... etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Strange, I've never ever seen any faction effects whatsoever from bear form.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for patch glitches, there is now considerable annoying delay when opening bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That's weird. I thought, bear form was supposed to not change faction (most times that is, we all know how consistent EQ coding is ...).<br />
<br />
Granted, it will be harder to travel to the mentioned places, but i rather have a clear ruleset for ALL mobs than the old crap, where it seems kind of random, if illusion affects faction of a mob or not. Hopefully this rule is really applied to all mobs and has not again dozens of  exceptions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Perhaps it was just a froglok faction thing.  *shrug* Ah well I had fun with it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am glad the door in Highhold Keep is fixed. I had trouble sleeping over that. On the other hand, Emperor death spawned wraiths no longer drop rifts, zones are crashing left and right, aggro list is F.U.B.A.R., so is rampage and whatnot. But thank God spelling errors are corrected and that door in Highhold ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If they don't slow down, they are going to run out of doors to fix!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">mobs stopped enraging and lost a ton of their special abilities (like banish and AEs) tonight as well.<br />
<br />
people are getting gated to bind when they join raids too, thats fun.<br />
<br />
I love patchday yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was shocked that I didn't get the usual LD every 2 min which follows 9/10 of patch days, but I did get my mouse to lock up and permanently open a fade, tinting, etc window wherever I clicked. :p<br />
<br />
Monks the world over seemed so much happier yesterday for some reason....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You guys forget the real reason this patch was made.<br />
<br />

<br />
TO FIX THE BARD PROBLEM!!!!<br />

Do you know how hard it was to buy that first song???????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">one of the things that I didn't notice in the patch (but is live) is the clip plane. I hated logging out in the bazaar because I knew that I would have a painfully laggy time (eventhough I had set my clip down to 0) of going to options and moving the clip plane bar just so that it knew I had set it at 0.<br />
<br />
cheer verant.<br />
<br />
and all those people who were /ooc;ing 'why is it so foggy?'  heh, I guess they never set their clip plane to begin with :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't think the faction changes affected bear form at all.  I have never seen any faction differences with/without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">No problems with DT'ing and rampaging mobs here last night, all seemed mostly normal. Did notice the c5 update thing. Pathing seems to be greatly improved (AR at least)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I love how the mana bar change shows immediately, but the HP update takes a few seconds after you canni4.  I especially love the fact that you now have to watch the 'mob hits you' messages very carefully, or you could die before your health bar gets below where you could safely start a heal in time to save yourself.  (Yes - this got me last night).<br />
<br />
The bazaar hasn't exactly been stable over the past few months, but it was able to last more than a couple days before crashing.  It's been down at least 3 or 4 times since the patch.<br />
<br />
Pet pathing isn't exactly stellar - had a dog poof in Dulak yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">nice patch ... grrrrr  :mad: <br />
<br />
Mobs like Fenin Ro rampage zonewide (well not really.. but rampage &gt; 200 aka &gt; Tnarg's range for sure), hate list is competly fux0red.. fun fun fun..<br />
Rampage hit the last person that do something to the mob's hate list before rampage round... Even if that person is at 4 miles of the mob and just calling it a wuss in /gu...<br />
Believer it or not but a SK was enable to get rampage chain casting aggro spells when a p00r ranger shooting one arrow got desintegrated by rampage..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I really hope people are just kidding when they make fun of spelling corrections and other such fixes.  Otherwise it&#8217;s really sad.  Normally I&#8217;d take such posts as people just joking around, but I have read several rants in the past by people who were ticked off that Sony was spending time correcting spelling issues instead of fixing &#8220;X&#8221; problem.  What they fail to realize it that fixing a spelling issue is most likely a mater of minutes where fixing &#8220;X&#8221; problem might take weeks due to its complexity.  I&#8217;m happy to see them fix these problems, even if they aren&#8217;t life and death issues for my character.  And I usually enjoy the way they report the fixes in the patch message.  Most amusing.<br />
<br />
As for illusions and faction changes, I agree that bear form isn&#8217;t affected.  I&#8217;ve tested bear form in several places, including Jagged Pine, and it&#8217;s never made a difference in how NPCs or monsters regard me.  Wolf form, of course, is a different story.  But from what I&#8217;ve read wolf form DOES still affect faction.  A couple of people have tested it with the brownies in LFay.  Druid/ranger wolf form still affects brownie faction but enchanter illusions no longer do.  And since enchanters have to buy some of their spells from the brownies, this has made a lot of people unhappy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have spoken with a couple Froglok shaman that have said that bear form affected their faction. Must be a froggy thing, because I tried it right there on the same mob he was looking at, and it didn't change a thing for my barbarian butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Its only certain race/religion combinations it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ndugu Sugarsmacks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Its only certain race/religion combinations it seems.<br />
I can confirm that bearform has changed for at least Froglok Shamen.  My froglok shaman was previously able to go to Echo Caverns, for example, put on bear form, and be indifferent to all the mobs except for the Taskmaster.  It made it very easy to go to whatever camp you wanted, and single pull mobs all day long.  I'll miss that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">if bearform was affecting faction, it was a bug in the first place</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Did anyone notice a change in the slow and DOT aggro last night? I spent the evening in ST and was doing Malo, slow and DOTs left and right and I never got aggro or even got summoned *once*. Usually, I am warping all over the place as MOBs keep playing 'Keep Away' with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I noticed less aggro on both Turgurs and BoN, much more easily controlled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you saying you can cast T of A on groups other than your own?<br />
<br />
It's nice that they fixed all those grammar errors, but there's no need to itemize them all in the patch message, sheesh. Meanwhile, they missed mentioning a bunch of items that were changed:<br />
<br />
Talisman of Alacrity fixed. Resist adjust was removed from 64 enchanter and 65 mage charms, making them harder to land. Damage shields now count as if you did the damage, don't know if this is intentional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I was playing my warrior last night in PoI factory, and over 5 hours, our shaman got summoned in maybe 4 times, all on resists.  I am much more used to 4 summons on 5 pulls.  Before the night was over, he was stacking on DoT's and smiling in a big way.  The downside is that wizzards and rangers are reportedly getting much more agro than they are used to(had neither in group, so cannot say first hand).  The agro change combined with no enrage made the night one of my more enjoyable nights tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Had a couple people get summoned by those ice tents in dain well who didn't aggro the tents at all, one was even invisible at the time and stayed invisible after the summon! Weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">one of the things that I didn't notice in the patch (but is live) is the clip plane.

<br />
(long time reader, hardly post... but I felt I should give you a nice bit of info)<br />
<br />
Shift + &quot;+&quot; (the one next to backspace) increases clip plane, and shift + &quot;-&quot; lowers it.  God, if I had to go to the options menu every time, that would suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Ack I have to add something to complain about though... since patch Tunare's Bazaar has been crashing regularly about every 4 or 5 hours. I hope they fix it soon...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Yes, Nytmare.  You can cast Talisman of Alacrity on other groups just like any other group buff.  The only thing I can think of that doesn't work is group shrink and that is because it isn't really a buff.  It doesn't use a buff slot and there is no way to remove it except zoning, camping or growing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Playin my monk alt in PoJ yesterday, wolf form definitely still changes faction - kos to sentries and rats at least.
