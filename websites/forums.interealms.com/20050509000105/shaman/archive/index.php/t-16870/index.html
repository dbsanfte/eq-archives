<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I love the Cannabilize line but doing a bit of research<br />
<br />
looking at Mage Board http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=7641&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=50<br />
<br />
I have come to the conclusion that Shaman Mana Regeneration is out of date and needs some increasing.<br />
<br />
First, the edge of being a Shaman has decreased with each expansion.  Luclin was the last update (Cann5).  Since luclin bard songs, voq, sd, pot9 have all added mana regen to everyone.  This reduces the edge a shaman had, yet our POP are still more costly/less efficient<br />
<br />
Second, keep in mind that Shaman spells typically cost more mana.<br />
And yet Mage Mana regeneration can approach shaman mana regeneration without health loss.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest fact is the way the mana is regened for a mage.<br />
Because their mana regen is linked to a summon/cann effect they can improve thier mana regen through focus effects and aas that make them better summoners.<br />
<br />
1) SCM AA<br />
2) Pet Focus Items  <br />
<br />
-A mage with Rathe's Son, SCM3, Mana Preservation IV, Conj Spec 200, 5 sec pet will average about 136 mana/tic regen. <br />
-Using the above reported HP for a Prism Focused Rathe's Son, pet canni with SCM3, Spec. Conj. 200, Mana Preservation IV, 5 sec pet should be... 168<br />
<br />
Hence this ldon pet focus adds 23% efficiency increase.  More for the VT gloves.  More for Time item.<br />
<br />
Its amazing to think that by petting canning they are enjoying more mana per tic then a shaman.<br />
<br />
3) Summoning Focus Items<br />
<br />
Basic Shaman Canning is not as easily improvable.  The best we can do<br />
is improve Cann5 by improving Quiessence.  However improvements in Quiessence are mariginal comparatively.  There is not the same ways of improving our efficiency.<br />
Mana Pres items don't help<br />
No Quicker Reuse time for Cans.<br />
<br />
I would like to see AA or Gear designed to improve cann.  perhaps something that would lower the damage you take canning.   Or an AA line.  Like Level 1 all Cann spells 90% normal damage, Level 2 all 80, level 3 all 70.  etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think your example indicates at all that something is wrong with shaman mana regen. Rather, magician mana regen in the very high end game is broken and *gasp* needs to be nerfed. <br />
<br />
I'm not entirely clear on how magician pet canni'ing works, but does it require them to desummon/resummon a pet? Does it require extremely high end rare loot drops? If either is the case, then it's much less of an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ah... so it does require them to desummon their pets. Which means they can't usefully do it in combat, as they'd have to NOT have a pet while they're doing it. <br />
<br />
If they can't effectively do it during combat, because they'd have to not have a buffed pet up melee'ing while they're doing it, then I'm not really that concerned. I think it's unintended, and should probably be cut back in effectiveness, but who really cares? <br />
<br />
On my LDoN adventures, what's the percent of time we aren't fighting, when a magician could be chain-casting and resummoning pets? After we enter the dungeon, virtually zero. It's not like the magician needs to regain mana fast while we're buffing before the adventure. On a raid, I suppose they could do this for more nuking mana, in many circumstances. But they could only do it during downtime of the raid, as they can't be nuking while they're doing it. Since no raid in the history of the universe, barring the COTH tunnel at the start, has ever waited for magician mana, I don't magician mana regen during downtime as much of an issue. <br />
<br />
Seriously... when does this actually get used? I suppose it could be useful for solo'ing in an extremely safe place (no one is more helpless than a petless magician), but other than that, what good is it? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, of course using Suspended Minion 2, they can put their buffed/armed pet in their pocket whenever they want to get some mana back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jtun Nahseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My main is a lvl 65 magician with a full spell book.<br />
Canni petting has been around since Kunark and the original<br />
focus items from temple of sol ro.<br />
<br />
When do I use it? Only after a death to get my mana back in a<br />
hurry. It is not practical to do it during combat, unless it is a long<br />
protracted combat. IMO that means I would need to learn better<br />
mana management, rather than canni petting. The main reason its <br />
not practical, is without a pet, a magician is completely defenceless.<br />
Not good to be in most fighting situations.<br />
<br />
Since our pets are considered 30-40% of our dps output, and that<br />
is one of our roles in a raid/group, to lose that much damage to<br />
regain some mana, is a poor tradeoff.<br />
<br />
As a shaman(only lvl 54 atm) I think that canni is fine. I worked all<br />
my way up with canni2 and have seen very few times when canni'ing<br />
is not a viable mana regen solution, especially with stoicism/torpor/<br />
Quiessence. Although no high end experience with my shaman, I<br />
don't think its a problem.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Their DPS with Pure Nuking is very impressive through pet canning.<br />
<br />
I almost never see a Magician OOM in a boss fight, and even on fights where they cant use thier pet they can put out a lot of raw offensive.<br />
<br />
Basically, imagine your own DPS if you had a 2k Nuke with an Efficiency of 4 or more.<br />
<br />
Not all raids are pets viable.  With Pet Hold, a good mage can still Pet Cann in a fight thats been deemed no pets.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
BTW: my original argument isn't simply mages regen mana better than a Shaman so our mana regen is out of date.<br />
<br />
my arguement is:<br />
1) Our overall mana regen is out of date because EVERY caster (us included) got a mana regen boost with POP.   Since we didnt get a Cann Boost, our edge in mana is fixed and same.  But our PERCENTAGE edge is smaller.  ((Made up numbers.  If our edge was 60% prePOP fully buffed, its now 40% post POP))<br />
<br />
2) Other classes get focuses and items that improve thier attributes<br />
(pets) for magicians (pet cann) that perhaps a set of focus effects to improve Cannibilizes Ratio is justifiable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not sure I would agree with this.  Has the mana regeneration advantage of the shaman eroded vs. other classes?  Sure.  Does it matter?  I don't think that it does.  Just because someone else is good, doesn't make us bad.  Our spells are not as efficient as the could be, but we regenerate mana very fast.  That is our internal balance.  Our mana regeneration is not what it once was in comparison to other classes, but honestly those classes really needed the boost.  Also, all is not roses for those other classes.  Consider the mage; he can get mana back very fast, but only by chain casting/destroying his pet.  Inconvenient and perhaps even unuseable in some situations.  When it works out, though...  grats.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can define a problem in terms of what Shaman CAN'T do that we used to be able to - for example, mitigated slows reducing our utility.  <br />
<br />
Unless and until I start having real problems finding a group I think it's self-evident that mitigated slows, or any other new feature that reduces our usefuless, are not really a problem.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you're PVP you have your own standards for what constitutes a problem.  I know nothing of those.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The problem with Shamans becoming less and less &quot;competitive&quot; is right in this thread and the misconception of the word balance and how it is supposed to work in EQ. <br />
When you talk about balance, you can't leave out what other classes can do, hell, a class is balanced against another class and in refernce of what that other particular class is capable of.<br />
Immagine a libra for a second, to keep a &quot;balance&quot;, you will have to even out both sides constantly, so if the &quot;Shaman-side&quot; retains the same weight, the balance will still shift the second you change the weights on the other side and the balance is gone.<br />
<br />
When you take something away from a class or weaken it, you will have to add something else to make up for it. This hasn't been happening. In theory the Shaman has a higher mana regen than the necromancer, in practice, though, both the necromancer and the mage will find themselves with a more mana over time than the Shaman due to the game dynamics.<br />
<br />
Solution: Add an AA skill with an adequate timer that allows us to keep one of the spells pertaining to the Cannibalize line up full time, as if it was a buff(just like the necro lich form). We would have the advantage to be able to keep Canni and Clarity buffs up at the same time, yet the timer restriction would keep it from putting us too far ahead of the necro.<br />
or: Introduce an item that casts Can IV without a recast time and without the need to equip it(just like the black fur boots). This will give us an edge in terms of &quot;active&quot; mana regen in comparison to other classes, while keeping us last, when it comes to &quot;passive&quot; mana regen, as they probably have been intending.</div></div><hr />

Weisbleu Quote &quot;You can define a problem in terms of what Shaman CAN'T do that we used to be able to - for example, mitigated slows reducing our utility. &quot;<br />
<br />
Reply: this is my thought exactly.  Pre-POP we used to be able to compensate for weaker spell efficiency by significantly outcasting<br />
them since we had a large mana regen edge. <br />
<br />
Compare us Healing vs Druid Healing right before POP and after the new heals.<br />
<br />
We could maintain 3 Kraggs Mendings (2kish) vs 2 Tnargs Mending (3Kish).  Now we can't.  If without increase mana regen buffs druid can cast 4TMs (3kish), we are still only casting 5KMs (2Ksish)<br />
<br />
Same thing happens in DPS.  We used to be able to nuke &amp; dot significantly more often to compensate for the fact we werent as good at it.<br />
<br />
This seems to have happened because other classes gained more efficiency in spells/per mana AND/OR gained an increase in thier self only mana regen.  Including in Self-Lines like +1 for druids, +3 Rangers, +2 Clerics (though not on raids).   Shaman didnt see an increase.<br />
<br />
I could see fixing this two ways:<br />
1) AA decreased Cannbilization AA reuse timer.  Rapid Cannibilization<br />
2) True Can5 Spell level 63/64ish where efficiency was better and the amount chunked at once was better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Those of you comparing the shaman to other classes seem to be of the opinion that if you take something away, you need to give something back.  This is *only* true, in relation to class balance, if the class wasn't overpowered to begin with.  There is no rule that says that we as shaman must be the best class at mana regeneration, or be able to use our mana regeneration to completely offset the penalties of our class.  We are a generalist class, and I think that any sane person would have a hard time arguing that we have ever been weaker than any other class.  We're not as good at everything, but shaman have traditionally been a VERY powerful contributor in every area.  You can team up a shaman with virtually any other class and have a successful group.  That says something about the shaman class.  <br />
<br />
Our advantage may be eroding slightly vs. other classes, but honestly that had to be expected.</div></div><hr />

The only time I feel underpowered is when I play alts.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've given the issue of Canni improvement some thought in the past, and I thought up an idea on how I'd like it to be.  You have to keep in mind, SOE hates making any sort of drastic changes, they prefer incremental improvements simply because they don't want to upset other classes.  With that in mind, my idea is:<br />
<br />
Canni VI.  AA Ability for 9 points. 4k hps into 2.4k mana (same ratio as Canni V).  Refresh, 12 minutes. This would put the &quot;oompf&quot; back into the Canni AA that is lacking nowadays, would increase our mana regen (but not too much), and would give us more choices.  Hitting that back to back with Canni 5 would give serious mana, but you'd actually have to think about before you clicked it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think the popular perception of cannibalize is that it is overpowered.  Not true really, but I think that will probably prevent SoE from doing much with it for a long time.  <br />
<br />
Since LDoN has made us into ghetto nukers, I have been wishing for a reduced timer on canny too.   Reduce it too much though and we can just about chain nuke all the time, which would make the other casting classes unhappy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If we do need a Canni improvement, there's really no reason for any complicated fixes. Just another AA to improve the Canni AA skill, either by letting you do it more often, for a larger amount of hp, or more efficiently (any one). Or adding a Canni V spell that takes more HP than Canni IV and converts it to mana more efficiently. How to improve things isn't complicated. Whether it needs to be done is the hard issue. <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather they just improve our nukes some. That would be very easy to do, without impinging on the nuking ability of any other classes.  They could give us a substantial improvement (eg lower the casting time on Velium Strike to be shorter than a month) and we'd still nuke worse than clerics, on a per-spell basis at least. Just take 2 seconds off Velium strike and it'd be more usable, and provide more time to Canni, and up our dps a little. Or they could give us a L 64 or 65 pet spell from LDoN. That would up our DPS also.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Free mana&gt;trading hp for mana <br />
No way!  There is no way that FT15, a buff or 2 and a few class handouts can compete with cann.  While their mana regen is continuous (a definate pro sonsidering it doesn't kill you, ask necros about this and that you can use that time to cast) there is no way any of these classes can regen mana as quickly for RIGHT now.  We can regen larger amounts of mana in shorter periods.  It would take the mage method noted (one that has been declared unsafe for combat) 8 ticks to match a single cann5 (I can cann5 safely in most group combat situations easily).  Now standing regen, thats a different story.  If standing regen exceeded 80pts per tick (equivelant to cann4) without the health loss, I'd be moaning and bitching.  Honestly though, when another class goes LoM in a bad dungeon pull, they are spent, but when I go LoM I'm still casting and squeeze of a few roots and heals long after the mages and druids and clerics have all pulled out melee weapons or started looking for a safe place to camp/med (when aggro drops enough to allow them to sit).<br />
<br />
While I believe that SoE has allowed our mana regen to get rusty and they've not introduced enough effective AA (IE: SCF? why not a BA based AA for DoTs which is a better and more usefull type of damage for us), I'm not sure it warrants an overhaul.  I agree though that the idea of an AA increasing our mana regen effectiveness would be a uniquely shaman idea and in line with both class balance and class themes.  Our class has in fact been balanced completely on the strength of slow and our mana regen and yet neither skill has advanced in effectiveness basically since Luclin while every other class has been recieving enhancements in mana regen and general effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Heh, 4khps 2400 mana canni6 is a nice thought, but that's a little out of the range of most shamans.  I mean, my gear's not all that bad (magelo at the bottom), but even with focus/BSS/9/kazad and capped sta, I only have 5156 HP, which would relegate such an immense canni to downtime use only, 'cause I'd draw low aggro in a fight.<br />
<br />
We also need to consider if we really NEED more mana regen.  I mean, as-is in a group right now for me, with FT8, MC3, canni5, canni4, and 9 (not uncommon), I seriously have trouble spending the mana as quick as I get it back.  Our nukes are generally slow (can't fit many into one fight) and inefficient (not like they make fights go much faster).  Dotting makes zero sense, and so often times I'm actually having to try really hard just to get below 70m.<br />
<br />
Pet canni, btw, is fantastically useful for mages, especially in situations where they are primary crowd control (they can mez &quot;summoned&quot; mobs, like the elems in BoT, or almost all of Takish dungeon in LDoN), so they can keep their mana up.  A mage in a full group is also better assisting his group by pet canning when oom so he can nuke later rather than just sitting down and letting his pet do damage.  For soloing, it's just insane out-of-fight mana regen.</div></div><hr />

Cann6 ( must have Cann5) a reverse Heal over time cann's at a given rate ie minus 500hp add 300mana per tic for about 6 ticks. Then add a AA 4 pts per lvl that increases mana regained from Cann6 called Cannabalization Focus (must have MC3,Inate Regen3) ie 10%, 25% 50% . making Cann6 (at stated lvls, not sure what they'ed actually have the spell numbers at) 330/375/450. Thay way for a whoopin 28AA we get 3000hp to 2700m at a steady pace reuse time is in the neighborhood 6mins  not really sure. Plus this ability will not stack with topor type spells or mana regen type spells ( yes that means kiss KEI goodbye) making us more reliant on ourselves once again for mana management. So Hypothetically Cann5/Q then Cann6 , wait the 30secs for it to run then Q again. Dunno if it will hold water after testing or thought, just an idea that popped into my warped little skull.

2) Pet Focus Items <br />
<br />
-A mage with Rathe's Son, SCM3, Mana Preservation IV, Conj Spec 200, 5 sec pet will average about 136 mana/tic regen. <br />
-Using the above reported HP for a Prism Focused Rathe's Son, pet canni with SCM3, Spec. Conj. 200, Mana Preservation IV, 5 sec pet should be... 168&quot;<br />
<br />
This is misleading in a few ways, as a 65 mage I have looked into getting my mana regen as high as possible as well.  But in order to achieve 136 mana/tic regen we have to have spent *atleast* 44aa and have the 65 earth pet just into SCM3 and QS3, SM2.  But thats *if* you dont choose to get Improved Reclaim...Which requires 53 aa to maximize the input of the mana, on top of the amount of plat spent to get mana pres4 items/Summoning Efficency4 items.  Even though it sounds like a little amount of aa *I only have 34 myself* we are usually told by our guild to get pet hold, and other more raid suited buffs then go for our own.  <br />
<br />
On top of that, where as you guys can canni during soloing without losing many dps, we have to stop, kill off a fully buffed pet with gear which is 400 mana for Rathes son, 150 per weapon and belt, 100 for muzzle, 150 for burnout and 145 if we ds our pet. Meaning we lose 1.1k mana every time we canni unless of course we have SM2 *which again may not seem like a lot of aa, but thats a lot of extra grinding instead of doing whatever else*  Oh yea and mages that got Improved Reclaim thinking it was better get less mana then what that shows *I have improved because it allows me to chain pets with out losing mana*<br />
<br />
<br />
On top of that I think I only know 1 mage on my server with the VT gloves and 1 mage with the Time focus...<br />
<br />
*Off topic*<br />
<br />
In all honesty, we can summon players, armor, weapons, elementals, npc's, bags, food, etc...We can charm elementals, and mez elementals, we can banish them, hell we can heal em...Yet we cant slow them, root them, snare them, talk through them, see through their eyes.  I guess if you guys are gonna petition about putting in for a new canni add in mages need elemental slow, or the ability to *summon* a horse, which somehow Paladins and Shadowknights can do yet the masters of summoning cant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I like the idea posted bu Giac, but its still prolly better then what wed get.  I look at it like this, I do think we deserve an upgrade to the Cann line, but the only thing that we can really do with more mana is spam Tnargs, this is basically no other situation that will make me go oom, currently, due to inherit limtis in casting times, agro and duration of the other spells we could cast.  This amounts to the same as giving us a better heal, which it is obvious SoE does not want to do.<br />
<br />
Thus an upgrade seems unlikely to me, what I would like to see is a sidegrade of the following type, an AA ability cast time instant that gives us a lichform type buff, that trades hps for mana every tick.  WITH the added restriction that our spells our greyed out like from casting VotB until we take off the buff.  With a slight adjustment to the hp/mana ratio to make it work out the same over time as casting cann4 (Note ull be considered medding too so have to reduce the ratio to adjust for that).  Also the AA hotbutton would act as a toggle to take the buff on or off.  This gives us the ability to cann with all the restrictions, EXCEPT that we can move while canning and without the tedious clicking involved.  Also has a downside of eating a buff slot.  So while it is an upgrade its really only for movement and giving our fingers a break, and Id think Itd make a great AA worth 9 points or so.<br />
<br />
Anyway thats my suggestion, had this idea for long time just never posted it heh.<br />
<br />
PS: Think its a little unclear my idea for the AA above so gunna try and put it a bit cleaner:<br />
<br />
Actually first gunna work out what the hp/mana ratio should be as its a bit subtle to determine.  Cast time of Cann4 2.5 sec refresh 3 sec.  Thus we can cast (6/5.5) cann4's per tick, of that 3*(6/5.5) sec is spent possibly medding.  Thus using 148/82 for cann 4 and approx 25 mana per tick medding we get (6/5.5)*148 hp loss and (6/5.5)* 82 - [25*(6/5.5)*(2.5)*(1/6)] mana gain = 161/79 hp/mana per tick.<br />
<br />
Not accounting for human reaction time here but think its close enuff dont need to get to the 0.1 sec heh.<br />
<br />
<br />
AA:  Constant Cann 9 points:<br />
<br />
1: Has Hotkey that acts as a instant toggle on/off for Constant Cann buff icon<br />
2: Buff does the following:  Lose 161 hp per tick, gain 79 mana per tick<br />
3: Buff up also means all spells are greyed out<br />
<br />
Think thats a bit clearer.</div></div><hr />

44 AA might seem like a lot.  But it's not really for what you get.<br />
Heck shaman are spending 23 AA to gen Cannabilize AA.<br />
So all we were discussing is something like Hastened Cannabilize for  which would reduce Can5s time.   Or add another Cann.<br />
<br />
As for wanting to spend AA in other places first....<br />
So do shaman.  SCM crushes MC (prereq for Cann) in its usefulness.<br />
<br />
On top of that, AAs are simply not as hard as they once were.<br />
Pre-pop I was doing AAs in roughly 5 Hours in Umbral/CT.   With a &quot;best&quot; time of maybe 4 Hours.<br />
<br />
In HOH/BOT alone, your looking at 2.5 Hours easy.  In COD maybe 2 Hours.  With Best Times of 70 Minutes (HOH) and 50 Min (COD)<br />
<br />
At Elemental level.  Normal is AA in 60.   With best being AA in about 30.<br />
<br />
So really, you can AA nowadays from anywhere from 2* to 8* as fast.<br />
<br />
As for a Mage being Defensless without a pet... Huh?  What kind of crappy excuse is that.  Of course you can't pet Cann, in the middle of a fight if your pet is tanking something.  But do you think a shaman can hit Cann5 any old time either?   <br />
<br />
Pure and simple... Shaman could use a little mana boost because our edge has slipped.  A little extra mana means in todays LDON a little more dps which is needed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">ah... so it does require them to desummon their pets. Which means they can't usefully do it in combat, as they'd have to NOT have a pet while they're doing it. <br />
<br />
Actualy... (speaking from experience here, i have inherited a friends 65 mage acct a while back)  This allows the mage to summon a pet, send it into combat, let it tank while they nuke, reclaim the pet just before it dies, and then summon a fresh full hp pet to take its place.. at a net GAIN in mana.  If I have room to nuke from max range, I can have a new pet up in time to intercept the mob before it reaches me in most cases.  This is by no means a safe method (a little lag and you are dead), but is incredibly useful for soloing with almost no downtime.<br />
<br />
Its an interesting technique.. and a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
It doesnt mean squat to me as compared to canni.  i think canni gives me plenty of mana.. I just need something better to DO with my mana.  I can stay nearly full mana in most groups.  Unless i am main healer(and I HATE being healer), I cant find a way to spend my mana as fast as I gain it without drawing excessive agro, or casting dots that dont reach the halfway mark before th mob dies.<br />
<br />
Our spells cast slow, dont do fast damage, and generate a lot of agro...  Thats the issue as I see it.</div></div><hr />

If you want to make that a lot better get Improved Reclaim energy *only way improved gains more mana canni'ing then normal canni'ing*  Usually I summon Rathes son, send it in, gets low reclaim make a new one send it in, nuke for 2k+.  Drops mobs relativly fast that way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Here are some ideas for Canni 6:<br />
<br />
500 hp Canni with an instant cast time and a 10 sec reuse timer.  The 10 sec reuse timer would allow us to cast other spells in between canni's.<br />
<br />
Splurt type Canni Buff.  This would take up a buff slot and be a splurt like canni, something similar to our epic.  This is something you could cast on yourself before a fight, and know that you're slowly gaining mana, more near the end of the buff.  It's not extremely overpowered, because it doesn't provide instant mana, which we would still have to use Canni 4-5 for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I think the popular perception of cannibalize is that it is overpowered.  Not true really, but I think that will probably prevent SoE from doing much with it for a long time.  <br />
<br />
Since LDoN has made us into ghetto nukers, I have been wishing for a reduced timer on canny too.   Reduce it too much though and we can just about chain nuke all the time, which would make the other casting classes unhappy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I have FT15, focus items, 250aa's and I am non stop nuking in LDON if there is another healer type in the group.  Unfortunately I don't get that many OMG's since Shaman still can't put out the smack compared to the DPS classes.  Does it make me feel good to contribute more dps? yes.  Does anyone notice? nope.<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
<br />
PS: Oh the canny thing.  Well, bards have nothing on hard working shaman (carpel tunnel baby).  How about tossing us a bone and doing an upgraded canny4 for 200 hps + so we dont have to punch it so dang often.  Just keep the ratio the same, its fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that the Canni II spell should have its ratio raised a lil bit from leveles 49 to 54 to compensate.<br />
<br />
I can't say much for the 52+ level Canni's because I don't have experience in them.</div></div><hr />

        That probably the best solution ,even if it's not 500hp , 350/400 is still ok.</div></div><hr />
