<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have decided to stay in Norrath...lol.  I got DSL, and yes, I started playing again.<br />
<br />
Now, I have a moral dilemmna..err...HAD one.<br />
<br />
I ebayed...I purchased 10kpp.  I am married with children, and hell, Ive been through the noobie levels TOO many times.<br />
<br />
So, please help me plan.<br />
<br />
If YOU had 10kkpp, what would YOU buy for all slots?<br />
<br />
I really appreciate your help.  Yes, Ive done some searching, and found:<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats the better weapon...what's the better armor chest piece...&quot;<br />
<br />
etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I need to start with everything..so maybe, if you're a mildly twinked Shammy in your 10-30..post your magelo profile?<br />
<br />
Dunno...but thanks to all that care to help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need to post what race you are. I would definately pick up a Iksar Regen BP however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Iksar Regen BP<br />
Totemic/Ry'Gorr for the rest should be good for awhile<br />
Slime coated harpoon, charred guardian shield<br />
<br />
orc fang earings, or forest loops (orc fang earings because they are decent and like 50pp each)<br />
<br />
rings, hpac if you can afford the 6/65 if not just get some junkers till you can afford them (like moonstone rings or something)<br />
<br />
straw spun belt is cheap and decent...<br />
<br />
that will help, and you can save up money and upgrade as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3 items that make an immeasurable difference in gameplay, are fungi, epic, and jbb.  10k will get you close to the JBB price range.  Thats the route i would go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">JBB isn't going to help at all from lvl 1-44, so that would be a foolish investment if he's trying to get gear to help him level from the start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">iskar regen BP. JB armor for other slots. jarcrap or ryggor legs.6/65 rings. good shield and magic piercer 1hb 2 hb weapons.<br />
10 slot packs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol. I got DSL <br />
<br />
please dont get me excited<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
buy the following<br />
ac6 hp65 ring x2<br />
hp65 mana65 neck<br />
paw/cone<br />
sbs<br />
spend the rest on some junky armor so you dont look naked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Check out this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1813) - most of the same pieces will work for you.<br />
<br />
The main ones are an iksar BP (regen!!!), 6/65 rings, JB helm/arms/gloves/boots (cheap, nice AC, right-click buffs later), ry'gorr for the rest, clay guardian shield, nice ratio piercer and basher (to keep both skills up, maybe a slime harpoon and a smoldering brand.)  Since you're starting from scratch I'd also pick up a Rallic pack (85% weight reduction, 10 slots, giant capacity, around 1k) and an EE bag (8 slots, 70% weight reduction, large capacity, few hundred pp) - don't know what I'd do without these.<br />
<br />
Make sure to save some of that money for spells, food, ports, etc.  If you're going to be hunting outside, you might want to think of saving for a horse.  Reference details are here (http://eq.castersrealm.com/editorials/horses.asp) - basically they allow you to meditate without sitting down (while just standing around, casting other spells, etc.)  If you get one, I recommend turning off the horse/elemental models (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1324).<br />
<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Togor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just recently came back to EQ and had a similar amount of cash to spend. Here is what I bought for my shaman:<br />
<br />
Ears: 2x Forest Loop<br />
Neck: Ivory Imbued collar<br />
Face: Mushroom veil<br />
Head: Crown of the Froglok kings<br />
Fingers: 2x 6ac, 65 hp rings<br />
Wrist1: Runed mithril bracer<br />
Wrist2: Totemic bracer<br />
Arms: totemic arms<br />
Hands: Crystal Chitin gaunts<br />
Shoulders: Tattered mantle<br />
Chest: Iksar regen bp<br />
Back: mammoth cloak<br />
Waist: reed belt<br />
Legs: totemic<br />
Feet: totemic<br />
Weapon: Spine chill spear<br />
Shield: Clay guardian shield<br />
Range: slime coated harpoon<br />
<br />
Not all of the slots have an item that is really all that useful at my level (ie. crown of the froglok kings), or some of the items I could have found a better cheaper item. However, I tried to get as much bang for my buck as I possibly could. That means I jumped on whatever good deals I could find even if it really wasn't the &quot;best&quot; choice.<br />

<br />
Can't believe that name was available... one of those &quot;Why didn't I think of that?&quot; names.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Togor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks Bigguss. I was rather surprised the name wasn't taken as well. For both on the server Brell Serilis and here for that matter.<br />
