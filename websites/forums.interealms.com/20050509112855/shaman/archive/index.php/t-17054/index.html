<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read most of the &quot;useless LDoN class&quot; thread, and decided it would be better if we could just take a poll of the shaman opinion on how the situation could be or should be handeled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Improve warriors.  Knights spent enough time pre-Luclin being exp sponges and poor substitutes.  I'm not a warrior and I havent kept up on all their grievences but I think a significant boost in the taunt department is in order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My first character was a warrior and I quit because I was tired of not being able to find a group for days at a time.  This was before the LFG tool, but I don't think that would have helped much.  Only people that were doing high level raids that needed a meat shield would want a warrior.  I wanted a character that would be wanted in groups and that I could solo with when I didn't feel like grouping.  I picked up on the Shaman love, and it is all good.  OH YEAH!<br />
<br />
I don't believe in nerfing any class, unless it is just WAY overpowering.  Level 50 druids tanking Plane of Time mobs for example.  <br />
I would imagine it is painful to pick a class because of a certain aspect that they get, at maybe level 64, and then the day before you ding 64, they nerf that ability.<br />
<br />
We have all said it, the pure melee: monks, warriors, and rogues, need to be compensated for the fact that they have been basically ignored in the last few expansions.  All the casters got new spells and equipment.  The melees just got some new equipment (that a lot of other classes get also).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Simply give the shaman class a line of spells to cast to increase mob hate on MT's.  We can use more class definition and the Warrs need more aggro.<br />

I know how to not get aggro when slowing whne the main tank is a warrior but damn I hate waitng for him to collect aggro sometimes. I don't much care if I get hit a few times even in tier 2 mobs. I can take a few hits. There were times in PoV in inner where I tanked the whole fight cause I stole all aggro from our warrior tank. I just think the warrior needs a better aggro!</div></div><hr />

Tune down knights aggro a little bit. But please, please CAREFUL.<br />
<br />
If a SK (pallies to a smaller degree) can hold aggro against any class, no matter what happens - there is something wrong imo. And i see this happen with 3 of 4 knights every day. Whenever some player makes a mistake and overnukes or overheals for example, he SHOULD get aggro. No pity here for wizzy_01, that feels the need to drop the big nuke at 90 percent health (not only wizards of course).<br />
<br />
Give warriors more versatility and a bit more aggro ability (not much needed, if any).<br />
<br />
Almost complete snap aggro is a bad thing, not a good one (for the overall game).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, there is no &quot;careful&quot; option on the nerf bat.  If SOE goes after knights, chances are they will set those classes back a few years.  It would be much safer to give warriors a teeny bump somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Warriors have an improvement kinda, in that the anger proc is kinda aimed at them. And on Lucy they have adjusted anger 3 proc to 600 hate. And all the others ones by similar proportion. Imo this is good because either (1) warriors now have a dual timer for gaining aggro( ie if they have boc/bow or sews) or (2) warriors now have a addition of a attainable hate proccing weapon that can improve guildless warriors or in warriors that like to group but not raid.</div></div><hr />

SK/Pal are what warriors should have been from the beginning in terms of agro development.  That is what warriors are FOR; they are supposed to be the target and take the beating so other classes can do their jobs, although I agree about letting overnukers take some abuse before taunting off them.  <br />
<br />
But look at the spells that SK/pal get to generate the agro.  SK have direct agro spells, snare, and  fast nukes, paladins have stuns, heals, and root.  All those spells are designed to MAKE agro fast and nasty.  Most of those spells the respective classes get relatively early and most are also pre-expansions.<br />
<br />
Don't ask for the nerfing of any class; SOE never knows when to quit when they start swinging that bat and our class could be next.  Although we havent been nerfed yet to any significant degree we still havent seen a significant upgrade since Kunark/velious.  (Well, I willl agrue that bigger heals were a good improvement for our class.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember Abashi (I think) saying that warriors were never meant to be able to hold agro in all situations - that would make the game too easy. However, that's exactly what knights have right now. I don't think warriors should have agro lock, but neither do I think knights should have it all the time.<br />

<br />
I agree about the SK and paladin spells. The problem to me is that they can use very low mana cost low level spells, which they can cast with significant frequency, and not have to med to keep it up, particularly with KEI or better. Paladins can maintain agro using low level stuns that are too low to actually stun the mob - that doesn't seem right to me.<br />
<br />
I think the ideal solution would have been to make it so that lower level low mana cost spells have less agro associated with them. Especially that stuns that don't affect a mob shouldn't generate agro. Knights *should* be able to create agro lock, but it should be at a cost of mana - so they can't keep it up 100%. But I also believe it's too late for that change - to change it now would be a nerf to the knights, this is how I feel things should have been in the first place.<br />
<br />
So, this is not a call to nerf knights, though I admit it might sound that way. I don't like seeing the nerf of any class, but this is what I see the root cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
Giving warriors better agro would also help balance things between knights and warriors, and would not involve nerfing knights. However, I can't see a way to improve warriors without making raids easier too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thorzion,<br />
<br />
i guess, i have a slightly different view here.<br />
<br />
It's not 'nerfing', it's 'tuning for the better of the game' i would suggest, and yes, i would even support such for shaman (read on before you crucify me  :D), if there was a a serious gamerelated problem behind it and there was no other possibility to fix the problem. That is and was NOT the case for shaman.<br />
<br />
That SoE seem to have problems fixing such things at the first try is no reason to not discuss them in my opinion. Following that logic we should stop asking for expansions and new functions as well?  ;) <br />
<br />
To the spell design: i think (can't really read the designers mind) the spells you mentioned,  except the pure aggro spells, were NOT designed to create massive amounts of chain aggro. The designed effect of a stun spell for example is just that - a stun. The attached aggro was meant as 'punishment' for the caster, not as easy tanking tool. In the case of SK and pallies the obvious problem is, that they are able to cast AND tank,  so the aggro isn't exactly punishing them ...<br />
<br />
Why should a caster or a healer not be hit once in a while (agree, most of the damage should be taken by the tank)? You get a greater variety of combat situations this way, making the fights more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I voted both. <br />
<br />
Warriors need improved aggro control/generation. Knights should have to work for their aggro a little bit at least. I'd like to see them have to use higher mana cost spells so that there is a decision involved in how much aggro they generate. They could still aggro lock if they really wanted to, but couldn't do it flawlessly on every mob at a two-mob-a-minute pace.</div></div><hr />

That is kind of what my other post relates to.  If you give a class an ability and then leave that ability with them for months or years, then you take it away, it is a nerf.  If a patch comes out and two days later the error is found and removed, that is not nerfing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Warriors need some lovin'.<br />
<br />
Easy enough to do.<br />
<br />
First, increase the melee damage of all three pure melee.  How to do such a thing?  Either through innate ability, or through AA, allow pure melee to have a higher base damage on their weapons than other classes that can use those weapons.  On the monk board, where my post is falling into oblivion (1 reply...200 reads...eh?), I suggested:<br />
<br />
1H: pure melee get floor(delay/15) damage added to the weapon.<br />
2H: pure melee get floor(delay/10) damage added to the weapon.<br />
<br />
This would only happen for certain types of weapons for each pure melee:<br />
<br />
Monks:  1HB, 2HB, HTH (only class that hard caps all three skills, deserves to have all three get improved)<br />
<br />
Rogues: Pierce, 1HS (hardly see them use anything else anyway)<br />
<br />
Warriors: 2HS, 2HB, 2HP, 1HS (goes in line with the most common weapon type used by warriors - 1HS - and keeps 2H weapons viable for them).<br />
<br />
Now, more warrior specific:<br />
<br />
Warriors are already on a better mitigation table than knights.  Improve this further.<br />
<br />
Taunt needs an upgrade.  Ideally, this would be something only of use for an xp group, so it would not unbalance raid encounters.  Have an additional taunt, or have the upgrade to original taunt, only function when mobs are &lt;= the warrior's level.<br />
<br />
So, more damage, better mitigation, and improved taunt.  Sounds like a winner to me, and allows warriors to reclaim their rightful position as MA without reducing the power of knights (except relatively).  Right now, a warrior tank in an xp group is usually a liability - this should not be the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Neither, the knights are for fast aggro exp groups and the warriors are built for raid action. Each is setup pretty damn well for their function.<br />
<br />
I dont see why this is so hard for people to get.</div></div><hr />
