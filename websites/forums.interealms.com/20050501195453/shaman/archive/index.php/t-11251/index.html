<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>boogaloo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">been recently thinkin of gettin a horse.  i think the sit aggro thing alone might be worth it, but everyone says how great the regen is, im not really sure what the regen on great bear form is but does the horse make up for the fact that u cant use bear form? i geuss thats really it, might be a stupid question, if it is just tell me to **** and buy the damn thing :) thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well I personally am waving good bye to the hoverbear (outdoors at least) once LoY goes live, im gonna be a Lizard Riding Cowboy.   Quite often I have heard horses being referred to as being equal to Flowing Thought 21, that may or may not be true, but the lack of sit agro, the ability to slow and then immediately go digging in your spellbook to change spells, plus the fact that while you are not moving or fighting you are considered meditating, yes, even while casting spells you can get med ticks of mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>boogaloo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i heard only certain races can ride those new lizzy horses though, can anyone confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bufflo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At this point I'd say any rumors about who can ride a lizard is speculation. Worst case scenario, you save your money for one, you can't get one, and you have to buy a horse. Not a very big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">**** and buy the damn thing :)<br />
<br />
The regen that everyone talks about on the horse is mana regen since you're considered as meditating while casting spells and standing around.<br />
<br />
Bear form gives 2hp/tick hit point regen and even converting this to mana through Cann it doesn't come anywhere near the gain of having a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>boogaloo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok cool thanks all, geuss i will wait for the lizzy horse and if i cant get it i will just get reg horse</div></div><hr />
