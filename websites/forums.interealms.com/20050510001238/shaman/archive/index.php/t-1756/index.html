<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK I know the 8th shawl is good and all, but I just can't help thinking that by the time I get all those trade skillz up from nothing(always found trade skilling a waste of time) and all the quest items to do it, ESPECIALLY tailoring ill have something far better.<br />
And I wanted to go Kael faction because few guilds on my server are kael aligned and well....I want to be one of the few with that armor + the fact that well I hate dorfies.<br />
Not a faction question just really is the shawl worth my time...? could i possibly get something better in the amount of time it takes to even do the damned thing cus i know i can always change factions later.<br />
<br />
Thx all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">bump my question will be answered!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shawl?<br />
<br />
word alone says caster to me ;)<br />
<br />
Obulus Death Shroud<br />
<br />
Now that is a name a shaman can be proud of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's worth it... just finished shawl 6 last night, working on #7 tonight...<br />
<br />
I like the focus on buff length... I hate rebuffing and this will help that at least a little... plus I can be proud of my skillz that I had to raise to get it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I heard buff duration focus items affect only the duration of buffs cast on the wearer, not by the wearer. Is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I probably wouldnt recommend doing the shawls unless you like tradeskills. It is either ALOT of work or ALOT of time to get these skills up high, especially when you have to start camping drops. You can only raise tradeskills so high with storebought components.<br />
<br />
Then again if you have alot of time to waste, and arent raiding alot, etc they can be a good way to do something besides grinding xp. <br />
<br />
I have 5th shawl in the bank. Most of the components for 6 + 7 in the bank. Been at that point for quite a while working up skills to do the next 2 combines.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have some doubts about if or when they will ever implement 9th and 10th shawls and if they will be any good for shaman. The mana regen and extended buff on 8th really dont 'do' much for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Muktuk:<br />
I'm pretty sure it's been fixed to work on others, then I'd read that it was a random effect making it more of a pain than it's worth IMO, and most recently, I asked a mage in our guild and he says it's been fixed to work as intended, but I haven't had a chance to test it yet.<br />
<br />
Kakkaman:<br />
If we were any other caster than shaman, this shawl would certainly be worth the time in the long run, even with the incredible task of raising Tailoring.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, if I didn't enjoy tradeskills and didn't already have it to mid-100s, I don't think I'd do it again.  Really it's just Tailoring that keeps this from being a normal type quest, that isn't too hard to do either.<br />
<br />
I just failed on making the 6th with a skill of 151 in Tailoring, and it'll be a while before I attempt this again.<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer your question:<br />
<br />
A horse.  If you don't have the money for one yet, you could still raise enough through many different means much sooner than you'll ever have Tailoring at a level you'd reliably attempt the shawl at.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either Iksar BP or Fungi, either of those would have similar effects on your mana regen thanks to Cann (or level 52 for Regrowth over Chloro, if not 52+ yet).<br />
<br />
Level 60 and Torpor being the extreme end of an answer to your question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've never worked on the shawls, because they seemed like such a huge time-sink, but considering the stats on the 8th shawl I may do them now. <br />
<br />
I have something of a headstart on the tradeskills already, since I'm already a senior master blacksmith, master potter, and master brewer. I have some minimal tailoring skill from making patchwork when I was a newbie, but getting that skill up is going to suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Borgax, just an FYI, der's now a shortcut frum 5th ta 6th, and methinx it intentional... <br />
<br />
2 small pieces of velium + coldain velium temper, in forge =&gt; 1 velium bit<br />
<br />
2 velium bits + sandalwood (alchemy supply), in forge (Trivial &lt;=173) =&gt; spool of sacred coldain thread<br />
<br />
spool of sacred coldain thread + embroidered shawl pattern + silk coldain prayer shawl (5th shawl), in tailoring kit =&gt; embroidered coldain shawl (6th)<br />
<br />
costs 140pp per attempt but more dan likely worf it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">YZZY!  I love you!<br />
<br />
Is that wrong? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I killed those darn Sirens for a long long time before I got 2 hairs.  It was this part that I wasn't looking forward to the most.  (couple of neat drops, but nothing special or worth the time)<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton.  Going to give this a shot as soon as I get home tonight.  *hug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yer welcum Borgax. :)<br />
<br />
Oh yah, and anudda ting... da wyvern mobs in WW (Wyvern Hunter/Huntress) are like dem in CS... dat is, dem be on CoV fakshun but ya don't take hits fer killin 'em.  Dis a good ting fer two big reasons:<br />
<br />
1. dem on same sporn table as velium hounds; and<br />
<br />
2. dem also drop da same gems as da shimmering geonids.<br />
<br />
Me's tryin ta find out if da cragwyrms also dinna giv hits but am dubious atmo so dinna wanna try it out first hand.  Anyone on kael fakshun confirm eitha way?<br />
<br />
Yzzy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Carpal tunnel via tradeskill has never been a plus IMO.  I would rather play for 3 years as an orc pawn than go after that shawl.  I think that shammys are better off going after things like SoE and the Fairy Hide mantle.<br />
<br />
Dorfs, and all their quests, can rot in Cazic's dung.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wouldnt wear 7, but 8 is very nice, I'd wear it.<br />
<br />
Its possible to stay in good standing with dwarves and be on giant faction isnt it? You just gotta kill CoV mobs instead.<br />
<br />
I don't think I could face doing the quest, I refuse to do the Chardok ones as it is let alone that one. Ive just never been a tradeskill fan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shortcuts!?  <br />
Where is the assault of the righteous?  Sploits! Cheats!<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Heh, Nice work Yzzy!<br />
<br />
I still can't see myself doing this quest though.  I get in the mood to do tradeskills occasionally, but eventually give up from the sheer inconvenience of it.  Not enough bank/inventory slots for all that crap (How many different kits do you use on the shawl, 6? 8?) and too much running around from place to place to get components.  <br />
<br />
Shawl 8 rocks, but I will continue to merely admire it from afar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow great tips on the shawl quests Ysgwyrthyr!  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Made them all first try last night.  Thanks yet again, Yzzy.<br />
<br />
On to 7 now.  Already have over 150 in the 4 trades needed for this one (jewel craft, fletching, pottery, tailoring), so should be a breeze, depending how hard it is to get the drops from the sirens in SG.  Read that they're not no drop though so might be an easy purchase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The 8th shawl is awesome. The effect plain rocks and the stats are also very nice as well. If I didn't have Vulak shoulders the 8th shawl would be something that I would definately be wanting over pretty much any other shoulder in the game.</div></div><hr />
