<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been out of the game for awhile and it seems like people have done their farming of the revamped Cazic and now don't hang there much.  I was wondering what all there is available for shaman in that zone and if anyone could maybe provide any info like item stats, locations and required parties to get this stuff.  Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I didn't see this on the list, but it's one of the more prized items from the zone.  It's not shaman gear, but it's a reason that many people are there, which means that it helps you pick-up a group.  CT on Bertox is still heavily camped.  Great loot and xp has a way of attracting people I guess.<br />
