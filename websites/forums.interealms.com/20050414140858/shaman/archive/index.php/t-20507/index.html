<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, they changed the graphis on EQ and now I can't<br />
play the bloody thing. When I logged in tonight it suggested<br />
I go and update the video drivers for my machine. I went<br />
to www.nvidia.com and installed the graphics drivers but<br />
the system is now so slow I can't even walk.<br />
<br />
I have an nVIDIA GeForce 2 MX/MX 400.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the system is now just too old and outdated<br />
to play or what. I have only the new models I have to<br />
have activated and everything turned down. But it is still<br />
pretty much unplayable.<br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On the official tech forums this is a common problem with gforce II's. As of now the patch coming tonight is fixing many problems but not the gforce II's problems as of an hour ago on test. This seems to be most commonly a problem with gforces II's on pII systems. No idea what it is but those same cards are reported to work fine on later motherboards than PII's. My feeling is its something to do with old agp slots but I'm no puter techie. I'm in the same boat, I can log in fine, no graphic glitches, no messed up fonts, I just get 1 fps or less when more than one npc or character model in in sight.</div></div><hr />
