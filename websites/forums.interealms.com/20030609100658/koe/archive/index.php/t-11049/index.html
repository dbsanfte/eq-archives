Probably the coolest scripted event I've ever seen/experienced in EQ. Can't beleive I missed half of it due to my GUI being a retard. For those of you who missed it, it all started with Mithaniel Marr leading his &quot;chosen ones&quot; from lguk live side (I was in lguk dead side when this happened), then they started moving into to upper guk, then to innathule swamp, then finally overrunning every single troll you can find in the swamp and eventually conquering Grobb and driving the trolls to Neriak to live with the dark elves. Once the frogs took possesion, they assumed their places as vendors and trainers of their classes, guards, and even threw up a stone claiming their presence as an &quot;Outpost of Marr&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to have almost indiff faction with live frogs in gukk maybe higher been a while since i checked.  Do i now have another town i can trade in?  Or are they on a whole different faction now and anyone that is good can go there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2 factions: Frogloks of Guk (Old live frogloks) and Frogloks of Gukta (New live &quot;chosen ones&quot;)<br />
<br />
It really depends on your race/deity though. If you are a non-evil race and deity you start out at least non-kos to the &quot;Frogloks of Gukta&quot;. I also assume if you are non-evil race and a follow of Mithanial Marr you will start Amiable with them. Also if you killed any last night you could have screwed up your faction because I killed a few an lost Gukta faction.<br />
<br />
If you ARE an evil race and/or deity, even if you have Ally faction with the ghoul lord scalp, you are KoS by default to Gukta. Likewise you could work on your Gukta faction and not worry about your Guk faction at all (unless you want the wood elf crown like I do). Next time I log in, I will go back to lower guk and see if I get positive Guk and Gukta faction. I assume if you find/kill trolls you should probably get good Gukta faction. If anyone finds out ways to raise gukta faction, please let me know, I'd like to be on a friendly basis with the frogs.</div></div><hr />

I apologize for the angle of the shot, but as you can see in the hits box, these lil punks were kickin my arse, so I didn't have time to get better shots.<br />
