<br />
Has anyone seen the augs coming out of GoD? The Merchant ones..<br />
<br />
I really hoping there will be <br />
1) Affliction Efficiency 4<br />
2) Mana Preservation 4 <br />
3) 40hp type 7 that can be fit on slots other then Head, Arm, Chest, Leg, Feet<br />
4) IH4<br />
<br />
Another question..<br />
<br />
Am I correct to assume that GoD is just another Wayfarers camp with a couple of city zones? Or are there static old world type dungeons as well?<br />
<br />
I know there's an NDA, but... well.. tell us anyway =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like a nice list of new augs but who knows if we'll get em.  Its certainly possible but with the current trend of new spells/AA I'm not holding my breath.  At the very least they should add an Anger of E'ci aug since there is an Anger of Druzzil augment already.  <br />
<br />
I'm not in beta but I thought GoD was going to be a bit larger than just another Wayfarers camp and couple cities.  Sounds like there are 5-10 normal raid/exp zones in there as well.  Any news of new augs or what kind of content to expect would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">An ID4 aug would be awesome.  Full EP gear and a bit of time stuff and I still cant get ID without equipping some horrible piece of junk.</div></div><hr />

I can probably tell you right now with absolute certainty that you will see no such thing.  Take some time and look over the options, the next best you will find is 20/20 hp augs for either slot 7 or 8 types for the remaining locations.  The standard has already been set and I don't see it changing, with the possible exception of LDoN raid dropped augs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Im quite aware of what is out there, more of a question of whats in GoD expansion.<br />
The list I provided was more of a REALLY REALLY optimistic wish list. Not something I thought could be a reality.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. has anyone seen or care to comment on the augs?</div></div><hr />
