<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">*beats dead horse*<br />
<br />
I got to talking to some shaman friends recently and we were talking about some stuff, nothing major, that we'd enjoy seeing SoE adjust. <br />
<br />
Recently ive been /feedbacking the following when i log on:<br />
<br />
&quot;Due to the current level of spells and gear in the game, I think it would be a nice move by SoE to change the casting time on the shaman epic weapon. The effect is a splurt dot, with a 10 second casting time, and a very small casting range. With our current spells the length seems a bit absurd by today's standards. Please do the shaman community a favor and reduce the casting time on the epic slightly, or change the area it can be cast from.&quot;<br />
<br />
Its not a huge deal, but just something i'd like to see, as im not in an uberguild and dont have access to awesome new gear, or 64+ spells :) With the small range of casting and the 10 second casting time itd be nice to see them  give us a break and revamp the casting on that a bit. It'll never happen, im sure, but just something id really like to see them change.<br />
<br />
Also putting some MR onto our 8th cudgel, that would be a really nice handout :)<br />
<br />
So what would you like to see added/modified for us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our epics DoT is pretty useless against todays mobs. What I see as a larger problem is that there is nothing I have seen for shaman that would replace the epic. Nearly all 65 shaman that I have seen still equip it. Then look around at other classes. Almost none of the other classes still equip their epic if they have been raiding any time at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sad, yet true point 8| Not a wide variety of items available to the non-uber guilded shamans for an epic replacement, but id still like to see the effect changed ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seems like things are really good in eq right now, so people are finding things to complain about.. The epic is SOOOO good that shaman can't find a replacement for it, not until the elementals! So instead of saying wow we got a good epic, they say, damn shaman weapons must suck? My shaman friend has a 25/25 Hammer that procs (very often) a 400mana drain AND it's got 100hps/mana + some other stuff? dunno it's the vt hammer.. and whenever I see him walk around he has his epic equipped.. Please guys, lets keep all the nags down. Epic is fine, even if it was insta cast, it would do 11+22+33+44+55+66+77 (dunno the exact pattern) then mob dead.. so you did an extra 200-400 damage big deal.. at insta cast it's not that much better..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All epics are seriously messed up and need an update but sadly i doubt SOE will ever do anything about it epics are 4 (soon to be 5) expansions old so i think its more a choice of the individual if the time/effort put into it is worth the reward <br />
<br />
me personally i want mine for the status, stats (10 to all resist and 10 stam is nice), and the clicky is semi useful also to use as a weapon? we have the only non-melee epic that doesnt look retarded to melee with (seen an epic cleric melee?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">(seen an epic cleric melee?)<br />
<br />
I hope they are using the proccing hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">khozik, my point was a lot of shaman still arent in VT and better guilds, and by today's standards of spells/dps the epic's effect could use some tuning.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">khozik, my point was a lot of shaman still arent in VT and better guilds, and by today's standards of spells/dps the epic's effect could use some tuning.  :)<br />
<br />
The epic isn't a weapon from current expansions, so I see no reason why it should be tuned as if it was. As has been pointed out, it's Kunark era.<br />
<br />
The epic effect doesn't do a great lot of damage, but it's still extra, and costs no mana. You don't see many people complain about the JBB - 8 seconds cast for 283 free damage. The epic is 10 seconds cast for 1425 total damage. On shorter fights, it's less use, but it's still free damage.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I would like to change the range on it, that can get a little annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i'd like a new slow, ive been using good ole turgur's a while...something like.... 80% slow w/ a -50 resist adjust for the resist purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think giving us a higher % slow would be a weee bit overpowering, though I do think 75% with lower resists would be nice! (63 or 64 would be cool)<br />
<br />
But that slow on our epic? Not a chance!<br />
<br />
I personally fine myself still using my epic, even at 61 in Tier 2, it's free damage with no wasted mana (Zones withough my horsie is a little diffrent story) plus a great farming tool for taking out all those green mobs.<br />
<br />
IMHO I think our epic was done just fine and shouldent be changed one bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The epic isn't a weapon from current expansions, so I see no reason why it should be tuned as if it was. As has been pointed out, it's Kunark era.<br />
- There is one slight problem with this. Quite a few other class epics are still used, even in VT, hell some are even getting to elemental planes and a very few used even in time.<br />
<br />
Awesome epics:<br />
Wizard Epic: free rune, 100 mana.<br />
Cleric Epic: free rez, 100 mana.<br />
Monk Epic: nice self buff, 100 HP.<br />
Ranger/Rogue/BST Epic: 40% haste and okay weapon.<br />
<br />
Then you have the semi useful epics ...<br />
Enchanter: free haste.<br />
Warrior: Taunt offhander (or mainhand, who knows).<br />
Druid: nice Dot, not bad stats.<br />
Mage: okay pet.<br />
<br />
This whole Kunark era mumble jumble shouldn't apply to epics OR should apply to ALL epics. Right now some classes have ridiculously easy quests for an epic that can be used pretty much until the endgame. While others throw it away at the first sign of upgrade. Not to mention that SK/Paladin and Mage epics are a real PITA to do quest while Monk/Rogue epics are a joke to get.<br />
<br />
SK, Paladin, Shaman and Necro epics are POS compared to the others. A bazaar bought 2h is way superiour to SK/Paladin epics, same can be said with bazaar bought 1hers to replace Shaman or Necro epics. You can add warrior epic to list in most cases.<br />
<br />
MUDFlation has killed many epics, but unfortunately many epics still remain awesome. Verant should pump up the power of crap epics. Shaman epic should have some nice DoT on it, 100 HP, same thing for Necro and Druid. SK/PAL epics should be at 40/35 ratio with 100 HP and some AC on them. And so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Our epic is fine, it's god amazing stats, while I was glad to finally upgrade outta mine a couple weeks ago (to the TOT mace outta VT) it's still a great item.  the only stat it really lacks is hps, but given the stats it's definately worth hanging onto for a while, not the mention the click is great when soloing<br />
<br />
I'd sure love an epic2 quest, but the original is just fine as it is right now</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can NOT compare Slam to Bash. Bash does way more damage and hits way more often than Slam. If you've used both, you'd know Slam is a joke. Why should a gnome cleric be better at interrupting a casting mob with their shield than an Ogre Shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">In addition to the already somewhere else stated things (like buff duration or debuff power post 60 ...).<br />
<br />
When in a group, all group members should be shown with lvl and class, that is ANON and ROLEPLAY would be auto-disabled only inside group. What sense does it make for a group member to hide their lvl/class? Other than some low level XP leech of course ...<br />
<br />
A slight upgrade in nuke power past 60 for a bit higher mana costs (for situations, when DoTs are not usable f.e. mobs die too fast). We never will be wizards, but when i have spare time, i want to be able to blast the mob, even if it's terrible inefficient mana-wise.<br />
<br />
And my all time favorite, enable slam for big races, while in bear form. Hello? It is a race-specific advantage, and you cannot use it always, cause some programmer is too lazy to code illusions correctly? Or just get rid of that ability completely for shamans of big races  and come up with something useful (like a small HP bonus).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hmm changes I would like to see;<br />
*No more spell recovery time not yet met crap.<br />
*An added /normalsize command so ability to shrink outside of group.<br />
*Rabid Bear reuse changed or replaced with a remotely useful aa.<br />
*A -resist on poison dot or less aggro.<br />
*Horse bug removed out of PoE.<br />
*Rain bug fixed.<br />
*A Longerlasting Ferine avatar or a group version.<br />
*Group spells affecting pet maybe(or a uprgade to spirit quickening with a decent duration)<br />
*A single version Grp disease spell.<br />
*oh and a Epic 2.0 variety of quests which revolves around pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Wishful thinking:<br />
<br />
*The ability to 'Maul', in bearform and/or rabidbear only. Same as bash but requires no shield equipped and has a 1foot knockback component (that can be resisted).<br />
<br />
*Retune rabid bear duration AND recast.<br />
<br />
*Retuning ALL our poison dots to be disease based instead. Check versus disease on landing and add disease counters instead of poison. Apart from that, same as before.<br />
<br />
*Fixing the auto resist on our rains.<br />
<br />
*Introducing a manacost on bard manadrain song. Ok class 'envy' sucks but there is no bottom to the abyss of hatred that i harbor for this spell.<br />
<br />
That'd really get me going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">As a general wish, I would like a /command to load the spell sets.<br />
<br />
I agree that the shaman epic should have a longer range and shorter casting time.<br />
<br />
I would even argue the the casting range is a bug. I don't know of any long distance offensive spells that has a &quot;buffing&quot; range associated with it. It's clearly either a design bug or an exception to the general way all offensive spells are done. I say design bug :P<br />
<br />
10 second casting time is seriously annoying. It should be 5-8 seconds or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Group buffs to hit pets as well.<br />
<br />
Fix the freakin auto run bug.<br />
<br />
Less reset time on Turgurs, or a new Turgurs with quicker reset.<br />
<br />
Spell success/failure message fix. If you're in range to cast it, you should be in range to know if it worked. Sometimes it's bugged.<br />
<br />
Fix the numerous raid window problems. I know, I know, there is a way to do it without it messing up, but it's still buggy as hell.<br />
<br />
Give us see invisible :)<br />

 I heard when it first came out the epic effect was actually a Heal Over Time, maybe that's why it got the &quot;buffing&quot; range. Why am I not surprised that SOE forgot to fix the range when they changed it to a Damage Over Time effect?</div></div><hr />
