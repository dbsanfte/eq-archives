More Grammar changes (no not Grandma, Grammar)<br />
<br />
<br />
DirectX 9<br />
-------------------------<br />
-We have added more detail to the gamma correction slider, which means you may need to adjust your gamma settings which are located under video options<br />
-All zones will temporarily have the same sky while we refine DirectX 9 functionality.<br />
-Corpses should now be easier to target.<br />
-We have added a new command, /rewind, which should free your character if they become stuck in geometry.<br />
-There are now independent window resolutions for full screen and windowed mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stormhammer<br />
--------------------------<br />
If you are a Legends subscriber you can visit the Lost Pyramid of Galuuk Korr. This midlevel adventure zone will allow you to explore a monument from the lost elvish city of Takish Hiz!<br />
<br />
Now you must find what was left beneath the sands. Good luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Screenshots<br />
--------------------------<br />
-Screenshots will now save to a &quot;Screenshot&quot; folder in your EQ directory<br />
-You can now change the format your screenshots are saved in by adding the &quot;ScreenshotType=&quot; line in your eqclient.ini file, which is in your EverQuest directory. To save in jpg format you would change or add the line to read &quot;ScreenshotType=jpg&quot;. Supported formats are bmp, jpg, tga, dds and png. Screenshots will continue to save in bmp format unless this line is added.<br />
<br />

Windows Update may also have a Direct X package, but it's all the same.<br />

Be sure to update direct X in conjunction with updated graphics drivers for your card... two most common series of cards:<br />

True, but a lot of new stuff is going to require DirectX 9 functionality so might as well get it done now, while they're still patching.  ;) <br />

I don't WANT new graphics, I want STABILITY. One of these days, I'm<br />
sure they're going to make a graphics &quot;upgrade&quot; that makes EQ<br />
unplayable on my 'puter. I've already had to dumb it down since their<br />
last graphics &quot;upgrade&quot; by turning off sound, spell effects, names, <br />
reducing the clipping plane, and I'm using the original models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't WANT new graphics, I want STABILITY.<br />
<br />
Maybe they should redraw all the character models into stick figures so it can run extremely fast even on a 386!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That sounds good to me. =p</div></div><hr />

I thought the same thing...after I patched, I tried EQ Windows and it just sat there and never loaded. After I quit EQ Windows and ran the regular executable, there was a pop up message stating I was running an older version of the NVidia drivers and recommended I upgrade to the lastest. Once I cleared that box, EQ Windows has worked like normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anyone have any opinions on the DX9 change? has it reduced lag? I seem to recall hearing CDX9 would allow them to no render the stuff you wont actually see and render 'on the fly' faster.<br />
<br />
Anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">so far it seems laggier for me and I get stuck on the walls im running on a lot. but there are stars in the sky and the rain looks much realistic. *shrug* =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that's just silly. I'm saying maybe they shouldn't up the graphics <br />
requirements every three patches. They should have learned their <br />
lesson from the Laglin fiasco. Yesterday I could play Everquest, today<br />
I can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">just log in and test, start lagging at charactor screen.  <br />
Beautiful sky with stars is cool.  However,  2 sec delay on every step you move is not.<br />
<br />
Pre - patch:  only bazaar will make me look at ground and moving smoothly<br />
<br />
Post patch:  every wide open zone with sky,  MUST to look at ground to move smoothly<br />
<br />
All tested under Clipper plane from 0 to 50 , 3D sky off, <br />

P2 MMX 300, Geforce 64, 384 ram(works well pre patch)<br />

Test place, South Ro, POK, DSP, CS, <br />
                NL, Feerrott(no lag here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">gameplay is fine for me, but LONG loading times and longer zone times :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm only suffering from lag for the first couple of minutes, as my system caches all the models, etc.  After it gets everything cached, works just fine.<br />
<br />
I must say, some things are nice.  The proper tinting on armor is something that's about bloody time.  The sky is nice, but the slowed animations on some models attacking or moving (DE femme piercing animation, drogmors, horses, human 2HS animation, Vah Shir male piercing, and probably more I haven't seen yet) is a trifle annoying.<br />
<br />
They also seem to have some bugs with new gamma correction and rendering light on fog in some zones during the daytime.<br />
<br />
But all in all, so far I've been more pleased than displeased with this patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think I am in the minority but I am actually getting better frame rates. I had very little lag at full Fennin Ro raid with all models on, full clip plane and personal spells effects set to full. I actually could run through PoK and the bazaar without much lag. I am using an ati 9800 pro.<br />
<br />
Uth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I noticed I am getting better rates as well G4 4800? I am running full on everything, and in crowded places with alot of toons (IE bazzar, wayfarer camps) my computer isnt choking on the models. There was some video lag initially upon walking into each zone, but thats because I have the cashing option set to save memory. Even on my box which is running an old TNT2 on a Pentium III and SDRAM is smoother.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hail,<br />

I'm very lagged now.  I wasn't the day before.  :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The slow zone times could be because your system is re-caching (sp?) the zone textures if you have that option turned on. I've always noticed long zone times after I install EQ on a new machine with cache textures turned on.<br />

<br />
hmmmmmm...doesn't work for me.  But running 2 copies of EQ in windowed mode works very well.  There is only one small problem:  when I zone 1 account, the mouse is locked on the other until the first gets into the new zone.  Kinda minor, except I cant zone 2 accounts into the PoK or out of it at the same time (requires mouse click).  EQWindows does load...but in when switching between accounts, there are 2 eqw sessions and 2 eqgame applications to choose from (I think becuase I had to alt-enter to even see the graphics).  Anyway, it takes 2 alt-tabs minimum everytime I want to switch, and then sometimes the mouse doesn't work.  If I try to alt-enter back into windowed mode, I get the 640x480 black screen.  I run at 1200x1600 btw.</div></div><hr />

You can also use &quot;u&quot; (or whatever key you have mapped the use function to) to &quot;click&quot; books, portal stones and the like. It functions like a mouseclick right in front of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">JustSomeDude - EQW author, has posted on the eqwindows site that he's working on a fix for EQW. So with a bit of luck we can go back to using EQW again soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The proper tinting thing is something that has been in game for ages. It required new enough video card drivers and you had to do /dopropertinting but it was there. This latest upgrade just prompted people to upgrade video card drivers and enabled it by default. Someone else on the safehouse found the patch msg from March 19, 2002 for the do proper tinting command being added.<br />
<br />
Personally I've notice a definite difference in performance. Lag on a raid situation or in the bazaar is alot less even on my second system which is a althon 1200 with a geforce 4. Not a horrible system but definitely not a power house anymore either.</div></div><hr />
