<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a group of friends that I hunt with and I will be reviving either my monk or ranger to finish out the party. Skill wise either char would fit in fine with our crew, but what I was wondering is who does more mele (in teh face) dmg, on average, at level 60, not including AA's.<br />
<br />
The monk would be using a 14/20 mainhand, and a 16/22 offhand, the ranger would be using 12/20's in both hands. Haste and mele stats will be about the same on both chars. I understand that this is not exact, but was just looking for a rough idea to help me decide.  :confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help in advance  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Monks are really gimp now.  Its no offense to anyone who plays one, I used to too.. the nerf really castrated them :(  The ranger, once you get am3, will probably out-damage the monk, from a distance - however you should wait to see what rangers say about the upcoming archery changes.  Ranger also offers alot of utility; snare, soe, ds, etc...  whereas all the monk brings to the table is FD.  Up to you, of course; the point is to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would say that a monk is the better till the ranger can get AA's involved , then its not contest. Dont underesimate the power of mend, you dont have to stop to cast it. Plus monks get a extra attack and i think have better damage avoidance. Im not really qualified sincei never had either at 60 , im just going off their class forums and lower level experience on alts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Straight up Melee I would have to say monks do more then rangers. If you add aa's, there is no way the monk could compete with the ranger shooting. Like someone stated, a ranger can do much more in the lines of snaring, small dd, DS, Harmony.....but for your question, the monk has better ratio weapons in the first place, and IMO would do more dmg anyway even using same ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Monk would do more in teh face damage (triple attack + FK), but will also take a serious kicking if he is trying to tank.<br />
<br />
These days when I duo with my monk I just let the shaman tank, 150 less AC than the monk and he does a better job :(<br />
<br />
Monks are still good for dungeon pulling but with the lure spells the ranger can pull faster hands down outdoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's all dependent on what you want, or should I say what the group wants most. Higher pure dps or decent dps + great utility. Would help if you gave a class listing of the other 4 group members for a better opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Monks are due for a defensive boost in tomorrow's patch. Why not wait and see how it goes?<br />
<br />
But in answer to the question, the monk should do a bit more straight melee damage than the ranger, excluding the archery &amp; spells of course. I have been on the verge of dumping my monk for a while, but am still hopeful that SOE can salvage something from them....<br />
<br />
I duo a monk/shaman too...shaman does tend to take hits a bit better, especially when they have stoicism/torpor cast on themselves before pulling with Turgurs. Once mob is slowed monk is OK at &quot;tanking&quot; if you can call it that when the mob slowed ~70%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry, I just never saw a big change in monk's tanking abilities.  My wife plays a 63 monk with alot of AAs and HoT gear.  Maybe in the Elemental planes she'll get her arse handed to her (if we ever see those), but in BoT she tanks just fine on regular exp mobs and the mini's.  I just toss Q on her now and then and maybe a Kraggs when she tanks a Kriger.<br />
<br />
Melee damage-wise I'd say monks &gt; rangers.  With archery rangers can rock, but that may get hit hard in upcoming patches.<br />
<br />
Rangers bring more abilities with their spells, but monks can take a beating and dish it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've grouped pretty regularly with both, and i find that monks tend to push the mobs a bit more than the rangers do.<br />
<br />
Snare i find more useful than FD<br />
<br />
but then again .. you could make an SK and get both :)<br />
<br />
monks probably do more damage without a ton of AAs .. with aa's and good positioning .. rangers can do quite a bit of damage with bows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Monks still tank wonderfully for grind groups well equiped.  Luckily I noticed no difference in that patch really, and even less now that I've finished off LR5.  Not very hard to get NToV or Ssra(dare I say VT?) gear these days with the massives of people coming up in the game so quickly and the ease of encounters at 65 - I'd go monk if it was me, but ranger is a great choice too... whichever you would have more fun with, although monk is great I would think a ranger would be more diverse to more options of play style. G'luck~!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Monk melee &gt; Ranger Melee if using equivalent wep setups. So in answer yes often monk dps is higher than ranger at least melee.<br />
<br />
Ranger Archery (am3) &gt; Monks melee dps<br />
<br />
Aside from offensive abilities, defensively:<br />
<br />
Ranger tanking ability &gt; Monk tanking ability (which this will likely now always be the case regardless if they get half there damage midigation back later down the road /shrug)<br />
<br />
Monks really did get hit to hard with the nerf bat, which VI even conceded to. Eventually they'll be upped to a more idea level but the days of monks out tanking chain classes &amp; plate classes in some instances is over heh.</div></div><hr />

Your wife's monk is rather hig end and at the time of the big mitigation nurf I was also playing a monk but only in the mid 50s.  The monk comunity had a lot of bad coments about the nurf because it did little to solve the problem of high end monks tanking in relation to plate mele characters.  Monks with a lot of AA and great grear where just simply not impacted nearly as much as monk on the way up with little or no AA and standard bazaar type gear.  My lvl 54 monk went from bing able to solo grind exp to being unable to kill almost anything that was dark blue and not only did I quite playing my monk [ about 4 hours total post nurf play time on the monk ] I quite EQ.<br />
<br />
This was just so typical of SOE, they hit monks hard with the nurf stick and did little to solve the problem of high end monks replacing plate tanks but in thye process they just destroyed the rest of the comunity.<br />
<br />
It looks to me like the changes to charm on test are going to be just a poorly a targeted fix as the monk damage mitigation nurf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With no AA's involved and similar equpment, the Monk will do alot more damage than the ranger. They are on a Higher Damage Table, have better ratio on their weapons and have more offensive /discs than a ranger. <br />
<br />
As everyone else stated, over time with AA's aquired, the ranger will do nice DPS as long as someone is tanking. If the monk is the only melee you have for your particular group, you will run into problems there. Rangers are a chain class and will tank slightly better than the monk that wears leather(According to SOE's &quot;vision&quot;).Remember this is with NO AA's.<br />
<br />
As the ranger and monk aquire AAs, Tanking ability and DPS will substantially increase in both cases. Im not sure how the monk plan out their AAs, but as a ranger I went more offensive oriented(Combat Fury, Endless quiver, AM) in the begining. With those out of the way, I have been concentrating more on Defensive abilities since I tend to tank quite a bit. I just got Lightning reflexes 1 and find that that helps ALOT.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for DPS off the bat, go with the monk. If you want DPS and are willing to work on it, go with the ranger. <br />
<br />
I will also add that if you go with the ranger you will get alot more utility and Im not just talking about snare. Ranger Buffs are nothing to scoff at. Attack buffs(highly sought after on raids), Regen(watered down from drood's line of regen), Skin Buffs(when no cleric/druid is available), Heals(somewhat laughable untill 62), Root(ghetto CC), Damage shields, STR buffs. The only buff I ever received from a monk was a shaman buff from his ToV pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">lol beware buffs that originate from folks pants I say /chuckle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">HAHAHAH, now that you put it that way.... maybe I should edit it some HAHAHAH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Funny you should ask.. I brought my monk to POA last Saturday and purged the log file.<br />
<br />
The 61 Ranger (Ninuvin)has AM3 and other AA's no idea which ones.  <br />
He's also using a nightmare compound bow, ranger epic in main, no idea in offhand.<br />
<br />
My Monk (Moevil) is using a Jade Mace and SoS  Regen3 and Run3, nothing more.  Always thought the ranger would put out more.<br />
<br />
When looking at the data you should add defensive DMG and offensive DMG to get a true total DMG.  That's assuming parser is accurate.<br />
<br />
Lot's of other things to factor in, equipment will make a big difference.    But I vote Monk all the way..  /shrug<br />

Highest DMG total was the Pally<br />

Against a low ac weedy trash mob am3 archery is disgustingly nasty.<br />
<br />
Against something like a typical crazy ac snake in ssra, archery just falls through the roof to the point where its better to just get in there and melee, remember archery has no minimal damage at all.<br />

Walls etc are another issue, but that looks to have been solved and should go live tommorow.</div></div><hr />

Up to 4 attacks with a hard hitting weapon does some pretty good DPS as well. It might not be as much as an AM3 Ranger but its not that far off I don't think.<br />

I think we'd really need someone to parse it to know for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre AM3 days I used to laugh everytime I saw<br />
Your Bow shot has done Double Damage.<br />
Xmob has been hit for 2 points of nonmelee-damage.<br />
<br />
Now that I have invested 45+ AA into archery i just laugh when i see.<br />
<br />
Your Bow shot has done Double Damage.<br />
Xmob has been hit for 4 points of non melee-damage.<br />
<br />
The BIGGEST laugh is when I /disc(which lasts 2 minutes and cannot be used for another 72 minutes)<br />
Your Bow shot has done Double Damage.<br />
Xmob has been hit for 8 points of non melee-damage.<br />
<br />
and these numbers pop up all the time. <br />
<br />
Thats using an arrow that has a base damage of 11 +4 MAGIC damage and a Bow that does 30 points of damage. everytime I swing my main hand weapon(14/24), Im guaranteed to hit for 15 points of damage, and the opportunity for a double attack...<br />
<br />
Lol I just made a little rant thats going up in my guild rant section...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Elemental damage on arrows is broken.  SOE has said that they have no plans to fix it.  Regardless of min hit, sustained DPS over time is greater with AM3 than a monk can achieve.  And if you need to get in close and tank it, a ranger can do a much better job of that too.  As well as cast all sorts of useful spells.  I wouldn't be surprised if they cap monks' ac at 800 or dps at 50, its about all they could do to further screw the class.<br />
Monks really did get hit to hard with the nerf bat, which VI even conceded to<br />
That's like saying Hitler was a little hard on Jews.  C'mon, let's be realistic; SOE gave monks a total and complete telephone pole raping.  Nobody even plays the class anymore, its so broken.  Monks just plain suck now.  Meanwhile even after the charm changes, enchanters will be soloing runes, molds, patterns.. they'll just get a bit less exp for it.  Its been the way it is for 6+ months now (and will continue to be) becaue they were too busy working on LoY and other profitable endeavors to worry about even the most garish imbalances with the game; fixes aren't profitable  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I used to love my monk.  When they got nerfed, I could no longer solo at 52 with a fungi and 1080 unbuffed AC and 34% haste.  Mobs that were blue would kick my ass even with mend, which is pretty slow every 6 minutes anyway.   <br />
<br />
I really couldn't have twinked my monk any more, and he still couldn't solo past 52, so I said **** it, not worth going on with this character if they are gonna nerf him so hard.  <br />
<br />
He tanks like a gimpy ranger with 800 AC, not a monk with a lot more damage avoidance skills with 1080 AC.  It sucks and there's no excuse for it.  He gets his ass kicked by stuff in the lower planes.  It's really not even funny how much monks got hosed.  There are no more monk twinks.  There are few high level monks who still play.  Monkly Business posts are way way down.  It's time Sony woke up and smelled the rotting corpse that is all that is left of the monk class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Rangers are a chain class and will tank slightly better than the monk that wears leather(According to SOE's &quot;vision&quot;).Remember this is with NO AA's.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that rangers tank better than monks has nothing to do with monks being a leather class. Beastlords are also a leather class and were not defensively nerfed. Rangers can also wear a lot of the monk leather (much of which is ALL/ALL) and if a ranger and monk wear exactly the same item the ranger will still get better effective mitigation from it.<br />
<br />
As others have stated the nerf hit the mid-level monks the hardest but the ubers were less affected (the exact opposite of what SOE intended). In PoP duel-wielding monks are raped by ripostes so 2HB is far more popular but duel wield is still fine in old world. T-staffs can be picked up for 20K in bazaar now...<br />
<br />
Overall I would easily go ranger ATM but it is still worthwhile to wait a week and see what the patch does to monks.<br />
<br />
OTOH the original poster specifically wanted &quot;in teh face&quot; damage comparison. If that is his sole requirement (eg. due to group composition) there is only one answer: revive the monk!<br />
<br />
edit: removed a misunderstanding I had</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">gear &gt; class<br />
<br />
gear is far more important than class. i know pallies that can dish out near 100dps. that is a lot the pally class. i have logged rangers doing 188dps with am3...no class came close to that. the best monk we had was the same level as ranger and did 105 dps.<br />
<br />
both classes tank like druids since the nerf. the monk nerf does not effect the high end monk as much, as long as you can get ac over 1400 ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Back to your original question...<br />
<br />
at lvl 60 without AA's and with comparable weaps:<br />
<br />
monk DPS &gt; Rangers DPS<br />
<br />
Monks get a new attack table at 60, along with triple attack.<br />
<br />
Rangers get some nice ATK buffs, but not enough to make up for the lack in damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as class attributes for melee, the monks were proclaimed the &quot;best at non-situational damage&quot; by SoE (as opposed to rogues who are the best overall damage when attacking from behind).  There you have it straight from the horse's mouth.  :)<br />
<br />
My guess is that his group already has a tank, or he'd be asking a war/pal/sk question.  So tanking abilities are moot.</div></div><hr />
