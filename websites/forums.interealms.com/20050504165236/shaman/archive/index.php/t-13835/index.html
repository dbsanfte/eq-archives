Really doesn't matter much at all.  Trolls have pretty damn good STA to start with and by the time you're actually getting enough hp/sta to be noticeable, you'll probably be close to maxxing STA with gear and buffs.  Stats are most definately NOT something to sweat, IMO.  And if I were making a troll, I probably would in all honesty put points into WIS and CHA for sell back prices and just to say I put points into CHA and meant to! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>antisocial86</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys. I played EQ a few years back, just now getting into it again after playing every other MMORPG. And a bunch of my friends are playing on Xegony, so I'm joining them. =) Thanks again! Still trying to figure out everything again, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bolest Mysticmedic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Welcome to Xegony</div></div><hr />

<br />
Charisma is nice to have, but not vital.  At lower levels, the price differences are negligable.  At higher levels just buy some charisma gear, put it on, and buff your charisma those times when you buy and sell.<br />
<br />
Charisma only helps when you are buying or selling from vendors.  Stamina means extra HPs, which will come in a lot more handy a lot more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't listen to them CHA I tell you!!!! CHARISMA!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure Sciek's kidding here, but the +20 (or is it 25?) cha steins are so readily available, even this ugly iksar can get decent prices. <br />
<br />
Sta is (at least mid game) one of the hardest areas to raise. As you move up in levels most of the gear you'll get will already have some wisdom on it and as you progress further, you'll actually be trading a lot of it out for sta/hp gear. All that to say, focus on sta after you bump your wisdom up enough to be comfortable. You might want to decide before you create your shaman what your starting gear will be. If you have enough wisdom items available, sta might be your better bet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>antisocial86</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for help guys, I started with as much into WIS and then the rest into STA. Another question, though..<br />
<br />
Neriak foreign quarters has to be the worst spot to start EVER! Would it be wise for me to run to where the ogres live? Or is there a better noob area for troll shammies then the darkelf town? It sucks, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Click on ogre, put it into wis, if anything is left throw it in stamina. hah</div></div><hr />

Well, the Ogre newbie area was never that great and now (as of a year or so ago?) it has been nerfed even further due to the addition of random level 4-6 agro bears.<br />
<br />
However, if you have PoP, the world is your oyster. Some people like the kitty pit for 1-4, but the mobs there have way too many hit points for my taste. West Freeport or even Qeynos would be better as long as you stay away from those nasty human guards. After 4, the pit in the Field of Bones is a very nice level 5-17 area (and Kurns has an insane XP modifier for 9-17) and lizard guards-free and the FoB PoK book is very close to it. Get a bind from the PoK Soulbinder and off you go :)</div></div><hr />

That's not a nerf! That's so that you can make your own armour without having to avoid giants and cyclopses!<br />
