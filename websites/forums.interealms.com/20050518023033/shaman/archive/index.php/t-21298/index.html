<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gloria, please lock/delete this thread if you want. I know its redundant. I only made it so that people would see that line in the title.<br />
<br />
If everyone who ever quit EQ REALLY and TRULY quit, SOE wouldnt have any customers left. Heck I have taken MONTHS off at a time myself. <br />
<br />
I realize these recent &quot;Last Straws&quot; are really big, and that this time SOME might not come back, but come on, this game is the best thing that has happened to my computer in 5 years. I am certainly not going to COMPLETELY give up my Number 1 hobby on some if-come. I have a whole shelf full of &quot;EQ Killers&quot;. <br />
<br />
EQ has given me a TON of entertainment, DIRT CHEAP too. 13 bucks a month? I cant even go to a 2-hour MOVIE for that unless I want to bring my own popcorn. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I whine and complain just like a lot of people. Yeah, the game has huge glaring faults. Yeah, Gates was a piece of garbage. But until I find something better, EQ will be on my HD, up to date expansion wise, and ready to log in. They got me 5 years ago, and they probably have me until they pull the whole damn plug out (if they ever do)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its the whole grass is greener on the otherside complex.<br />
People need to keep in mind the grass needs mowing over there too.<br />
<br />
EQ frustrates me but bottom line in my opinion its still the best game out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">People said the same thing about UO. They will say the same thing about whatever the next big MMOG is. It's human nature. You can never please everyone all the time, not possible.</div></div><hr />

My wife quits between every cigarette</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haha...my mom didn't raise a quiter!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think lots of ppl are leaving, granted some come back, in the past 6 months I've had almost all of my eq friends quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When a game just isnt any fun any more do you keep playing?  When that T.V. show you used to love adds a stupid like brat puppy dog that freaks out every 10 seconds do you stop watching?  <br />
<br />
I did.</div></div><hr />
