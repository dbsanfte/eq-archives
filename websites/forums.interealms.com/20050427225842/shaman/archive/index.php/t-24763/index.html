Heh - yeah, you'll be staring at your screen while the Bit Torrent downlader sucks down the final 1 gb of updates to the Gold CD - you and 100,000 of your closest friends!<br />
<br />
Can't wait!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The downloader does suck but I doubt anyone will have to download anywhere close to a gig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The whole BT thing has just been a way for them to save money during beta.  Even if they do use it in retail you will be dealing with SUBSTANTIALLY smaller DLs for patches than the 2-3gig DL for the entire game client.  So I would not sweat it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unfortunately it definitely looks like they are going to stick with it in retail.  Most patches will probably be in the 50 MB range which with BT will take 30-40 minutes for most people with cable/dsl.  At least everyone I've talked to said they only got 10-12 kb/sec on average.  The larger patches, while hopefully somewhat rare, will probably take 3-4 hours of downloading with BT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BT is not limited by speed, its limited by people downloading from it. Simply the more the better cause there is no server per say, you just download from each other. Im downloading on BT right now at 360kb.<br />
<br />
Just FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually Blizzard has not said anything final about their plans for patch downloads in retail yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There have been quite a few posts lately requesting that Blizzard change their downloader for retail because it is so slow.  Blizzard's only responses have basically been, &quot;Come release you won't have to download the entire game, only patches so it shouldn't be an issue.&quot;  Sounds to me like BT is their current plan for the release downloader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's going to be SLIGHTLY different - people downloading patches vs. 2.5 gig of the entire game for beta...<br />
<br />
But mmorpg's messageboard posts are complete raving lunacy 99/100 times.  (crucible excluded, for the most part)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LOL. The forums over at the community site are currently a frothy cess pool of venemous spewage.<br />
<br />
There were some things in the patch that, IMHO, should have NEVER made it into the game, but time will tell if they stay I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Blizzard is TRYING to fix their previous F.uckup namely the no consequence death. Now you lose 10% durability of all items equipped upon dying. THAT is decent. I don't know why the ppl are crying. DON&quot;T DIE OR DO YOUR BEST NOT TO. Before it was a 5 minute run or a mild xp penalty. Some kind of penalty needs to exist. As for the regents for spells hmmm I really don't think we needed THIS time sink. <br />
<br />
A meaningful death penalty was needed. Needed to respect the world and to fear death. Not a quake 3 style death die and respawn and there that's all.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the penalty should be reduced for pvp. Maybe 3% durability lost per pvp death. Or eve 2% since ppl die on the pvp server a lot more than on a PVE server.<br />
Problem SOLVED.<br />

<br />
Does this mean that given enough deaths your equipment falls to pieces?<br />
<br />
Interesting to link character death (penalty) and item decay.</div></div><hr />

I understand the need for a death penalty, but geez!<br />

This patch will be forever known as the &quot;Un-fun patch&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Apparently they also upped the required amount of exp per level after 30. They say it was to balance the now higher amount of exp that mobs in dungeons give. Even if these two things do equal each other out it is still a nerf to how much questing can contribute to levelling.<br />
<br />
So there will now potentially be some EQ-style &quot;grinding&quot; required. I dont know if this is good or bad. I can live with it but I could also have done without it.</div></div><hr />

They upped dungeon experience by 10% and the required amount per level by 10% after level 30.  While I don't really like it, it shouldn't require any extra grinding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also spend as much time as possible in dungeons (need a few runs to get those elite quests done, anyway, round 20), and it just so happens that the exp whooshes right by in there.  In addition to getting to meet some fun folks.  Maybe I'd mind the change more if I were 30 instead of 20.  *grin*</div></div><hr />

And I died three times last night, due to serious lag, affecting all of test-server3 (not sure if it accected all the test servers), so as a poor level 6 Dwarf, this patch cost me more than half of my bank balance. :(<br />
<br />
There was no lag what-so-ever in last weeks Final stress test, but last night, it seemed whichever server controlled the looting/quest completion for Test-server3 was completely fubarred.  Fighting and running around were fine, but if you tried to loot an item, woah, 2 to 3 mins of lag.</div></div><hr />

I can't get to blizzard's site from work, but from what people were saying on the blizzard forums, blizzard is still touting their casual friendly style as a feature of the game, including not having horrible death penalties.  Then a day before open beta and 2 weeks before retail, they completely reverse the system.  I'm pissed and I haven't played yet, I can see how those that have been playing in closed beta as well as others are furious.  A minor death penalty was a feature, not a f.uck up as you put it.  A minor death penalty that encouraged trying things you might not think you can do or exploring new areas made things fun for people.  Now the drudgery of grinding low blue cons (EQ terms) for hours rather than fighting difficult things becomes the norm.  Farming for gold to keep up with item repairs, talent costs, spell costs, reagents, whatever now becomes the norm and the economy will still get screwed anyway.  So 2 weeks before retail they take the worst aspects of every MMORPG every made and add it into the game that wasn't supposed to have it and well... everyone is mad.  Just because they will become like every other game and lack enough things for the uber power gamers to do when they get to 60 with thousands of gold, they make the rest of us suffer.  The powergamers will feel nothing still.  Anyway, guess i'll know more as I experience the game, but I can understand the resentment from the community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmmmm see but you are missing the OTHER side. People would die to clear off bad long term spells that affected them for let's say an hour. Hmm let me just jump off that cliff to clear that bad buff. There was something wrong with the old system. It was too easy there was no risk involved whatsoever. Death didn't matter and no risk =easy game that gets boring fast. People have to respect the world and fear it. you did in eq. When deep in a dungeon and cleric goes ld or dies u are shaking in your little bear boots. But that made it FUN. Fun cause u were scared to die so u devised clever and well sometimes not so clever ways to ger past a difficult spot. Here you could go anywhere hey guess what you died? No problem run 5 minutes and u are back in action. Such a death &quot;penalty&quot; is better suited for games like counter-strike where you wait when you die but not a Mmorpg. They are on the right track. A penalty needs to be there. I am playing wow right nwo and having died i have to say it's NOT THAT BAD at all. I am level 7 now with my warlock. The price for repairs does scale with levels but it's not so horrible. The spirit healer penalty DOES need to get ajusted but the 10% on death is FINE. When you will play the game you will realize that too. I can't speak about regeants because I have not played a regeant class yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ahh, correct :).  I see your point with that.  Using death to counter in game effects and for free rides back to the bind point is absolutely wrong.  From that viewpoint, I can see why they added the death penalty as far as durability goes.  It still penalizes you for exploration and experimentation though.  Yes, it made things exciting in EQ sometimes, but I also recall never leaving the newbie lands until I made my monk and could FD all over.  I also recall horrible wasted nights of corpse retrievals in L Guk or Kaesora or something (I played on Test Server in the early days and L Guk wasn't exactly cleared out of spawns, since it was usually just you and your group down there hehe).<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the counterpoint, I see what you are saying.  I stand by my reagent stance though for now hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On test 11 as of last night I hadn't seen anyone over 35.  I paid for the second stress test so I've been playing for a week pretty heavily and only concentrating on one character and I'm level 21.  I would say come retail for someone who has never played it would probably take 4-6 weeks if you played 10-12 hours a day.  For your casual 2-3 hour a day person I would think 3 months to reach 60.  These of course are just my estimates and being only level 21 I'm no expert.  Also, levels 18-21 took at least as long as 1-10 for me so it is likely it will continue to slow down.  Blizzard is happy with the experience rate so nothing will change in the immediate future in regards to that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think all of the servers are experiencing quite a bit of lag right now.  Test 11 was pretty bad yesterday too.  Hopefully the server maintenance today will fix most of it.  As to the duration changes on death I agree they are too harsh.  I'm fairly confident Blizzard will tone down the durability losses on death and they've stated they are definitely looking at the current numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Blizzard is happy with the experience rate so nothing will change in the immediate future in regards to that.That's what they said up until the patch Sunday night too. Note they upped the exp requirements in the 30+ game? They also upped the dungeon exp by 10% to counter, but where does that leave the outdoor hunters? 10% slower, that's where.<br />
<br />
With the last patch they proved the don't necessarily hold to their word. They'll do what they want to do regardless. They live by the &quot;ask for forgiveness, not permission&quot; adage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">They finally woke up and realized that the leveling is a little fast.<br />
I don't expect horrible grinds like swg and EQ but the speed for NOW at level 7 seems pretty good although it COULD be slower. I mean some quests give SO MUCH xp i did 2 quests and i was done with level 5.<br />
Some quests give you half of an xp bar at this level.<br />
I did the undead pumkin quest where u collect the pumkins and run the to brill. Well that gave me half my experince i needed towards level 6. And i killed maybe 5 farmers to get steal the pumkins.<br />
<br />
<br />
The changes they are making are in the right direction. I have a bias againt regents because of eq. THAT change i do not like but durability and slowing of xp is a good change. <br />

<br />
Yeah, they did slightly change it this patch.  Nothing that will change the rate at which players hit 60 by more than 2 days for hardcore gamers and no more than a week for casuals.  I meant that the numbers I estimated in terms of time to get to 60 won't change by release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The lag was due to some tests they were running on the item database.  The exact problem was it would lag severely whenever you attempted to interface with the items your character had &quot;stored&quot; on the database server (on server 11 at least) Testing things like that should be included on every Beta test.  It was all fixed in about 3 hours.  Some of my quests were messed up and some items got screwed aroudnd with but this was a beta, so all to be expected.  if that happened retail i'd be pretty upset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Lag actually took several days to fix, but that is besides the point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Solo is still the fastest way to level, they just made it better to group a little, no biggie.<br />
<br />
I am catching up on sleep big time in preperation. Woot!<br />
