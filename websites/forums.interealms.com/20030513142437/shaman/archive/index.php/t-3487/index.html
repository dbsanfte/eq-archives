<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally got the tear (after four months or so of Fear raids) and have my Rak raid scheduled for Saturday.  I have three mages, plenty of melee and clerics etc, so Rak shouldn't pose any problems.<br />
<br />
One little question though, as I really don't want my tear to get eaten.  I have done the quest all the way through in the right order and without skipping any bits, but is it worth doing a Ghisok books turn in to ensure that my faction is OK?  Or would this actually have the potential to do harm?  I know that in theory if you have done it all properly your faction should be right, but I REALLY don't want to takoe any chances!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just recently completed my epic and did everything in the order as written in Belgar's walkthrough. The only thing I did twice was giving the gem to Bondl as I screwed up on my first attempt at the Test of Patience. You shouldn't have any problem getting the spear if you've done everything correctly and in order. As a side note, I only conned &quot;ally&quot; at the final turn-in. Hope this sorta helps. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, the raid went extremely smoothly.  Had 3 mages there with their pets, and four clerics.  Also a load of melee and other support.<br />
<br />
I buffed up, got a Rune V before turn in, had time to pull Rak outside the castle to the waiting pets, then gate to the zone.  He only managed to do 1500 damage to me.  Only death was one fo the clerics who got a bit close while trying to heal the pets.<br />
<br />
I now have a feather stick of my very own!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congratulations, Grimthor!<br />
<br />
I am wondering why you have to gate to the zone, instead of just backing away from him and letting pets take agro?  Does he hate the shaman too much to let go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah every shaman that gets their epic should see it as a challenge to try and last as long as possible vs RAK :)<br />
<br />
I tanked him for about 25 seconds I think.  No cleric heals, but dang that AE is mean.  It makes the whole fight so much more intense, sitting in the nexus nekkid while you listen in a raid channel how the outcome of your epic fight is coming along hehe.<br />
<br />
If I had more than ten fingernails to chew off during those six or seven minutes I think I would have.</div></div><hr />
