<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is there any good hunting guide to this area?<br />
<br />
I went there one time at about 38 with the warrior and 44 with the shaman, and I don't think that I was high enough yet and wussed out and went back to solb (that and I had no idea where to go), but there was no one there.<br />
<br />
I have recently been reading a little on the druid boards for some fresh ideas on where to go, since the places offered here are unfortunately well camped, even the higher level areas of solb.<br />
<br />
so after reading I have decided that poachers in JPF may be a good idea at this level, word is they drop decent loot and will carry me to about 51 or so.<br />
<br />
the thing is, I have no idea where that is, I have no idea what to be warry of in zone. in short I only know that this should be a good zone for me now, and that there is no one there on my server.<br />
<br />
can anyone give me some advice please?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tried Poarchers solo around lvl42-44.  I ran far far away.  They all were blue, but had TONS of Hp.  Fully buffed I ended my first fight with 20% hp and no mana (dogdog was down to about 30% health too).<br />
<br />
I thought I had bad luck so I tried again.  This time 3 poachers came.  I sicked dogdog on them and RAN!!<br />
<br />
Poachers should be great exp if you can join someone camping them.  I know bards and rogues like to camp them for one of their illusion masks (Burnoose of the Half Breed).  But solo, it's TOUGH going (they hit hard and have tons of Hp like I said).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">duh on me *hammer*<br />
<br />
I did a search and got nothing returned, but lo and behold down the page a bit there is a thread on JPF :(<br />
<br />
sorry for the double post guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">update to JPF.<br />
<br />
poachers suck at 44-46. exp is decent, but fights last way too long (have high hp). no resists, and they do drop HQ pelts often (so maybe a good place for higher levels to farm). they hit hard and it just generally sucks.<br />
<br />
I made 3 blue in about 1.5 hours playing here.<br />
<br />
so I went back to solb, did my thing and got 2 yellows in about the same time. <br />
<br />
dinged my warrior 45 and another group came in and I was on my way out, gave them my rotation order and wished them fun and went to bazaar and logged for the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I duoed poachers in jaggedpine with a warrior or a beastlord at 43-46 quite well. Here's how i did it:<br />
<br />
1. Camp the middle tent on the lake side. There are 6 total in the tent. Pull the one in the door first with slow. you shouldnt get any adds. <br />
2. Target one of the two inside the tent and use root on them. The other one will come running. Have warrior/beastlord get agro and sick doggie on it and slow it. When root wears off, root again then slow unless the other one is dead.<br />
3. do the same with the next two inside the tent.<br />
4. Pull the last one with slow.<br />
5. If you do it enough you should be just finishing the last one when the first one spawns again. Make sure to pull far enough back so you dont get agro from the first one. The rest of them should be spread out enough on respawning making it easy to just pull with slow. I seemed to make about a yellow every 45 minutes or less.</div></div><hr />
