<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those of you who enjoy the Lore surrounding LoY, please goto lower guk. I really would love to get my faction up on the live side of lguk because I have a feeling that some amazing things are happening there right now.<br />
