<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So last night i'm raiding fear, and I say &quot;man, I can't land crap on this mob.  Is he like undebuffable or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, I know it was a silly question, I was being more dramatic then serious, but I bounced slow 6 times and wasn't getting any immune messages (can't remember the mob though).  Anyway, that's not the point of this post.<br />
<br />
The thing that caught my attention was that some of my message got edited.  The interesting thing is that it was not the word crap.  It was undebuffable.  I will be the first to admit that it's not actually a word, and that I pulled it straight out of my rear end, but I still can't wrap my brain around why that would not make it through the language filters.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it got me to wondering...  Whats the weirdest word that you have seen caught by the language filter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">***************<br />

 Damn...this one caught it too.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol ignore me. couldn't get this right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I see more amusing edits by this board's filter than I do with the EQ one (which I have turned off).<br />
<br />
For example, re****l.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hey valgoth, if it's not obsceene, use - in odd places to get it past the filter<br />
-**************<br />
<br />
 Nope. This filter is either really good, or the word is just really that bad. Then again, maybe it's a joke? :) <br />
<br />
LOL</div></div><hr />
