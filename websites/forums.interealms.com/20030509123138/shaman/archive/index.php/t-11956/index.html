<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guess whoudl be to turn the slots back to white but i think that will just make armor bright white :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe setting all values to 255 lest the original color show through, if not, the left box of the columns shows what the original color for that item should be, and display RGB values as well, you can just set it as that, though you'll have to change each upgrade</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Umm...there is a set to default button located on the dye menu.  I have never actually used it myself, but I'm assuming that it lets you  change it back to the default.  I've been meaning to do this with my roommate and another friends' characters.  I'm going to dye both of them pink and purple and send them the pictures in their email.  Assuming that there is an easy way to turn it back that is..IE the default button is just what it is advertised as</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">just look up the pieces of armor on http://lucy.fnord.net has the 3 digit color code of all your items<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Setting the color of the boxes to white does not change the color of your armor to it's original color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you set them all to 255, then log out and back it it will be as if the armor was never dyed... the loging out and back in is the clincher heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Setting all 3 colors to 255 will restore the color back to its original color.  Setting all 3 colors to 240 makes it white.  <br />

You do not have to spend the money on dyeing and dyeing the color back to take pictures.  You can take pictures from the dye screen, and you can change angles and turn the character around.  Just dye the armor pink and purple, take your pictures, then hit the cancel button when you are done.</div></div><hr />
