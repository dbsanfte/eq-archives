<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">And now for a bit of out-of-the-box wishful thinking...  <br />
<br />
I think it completely logical that the Shaman, liaison for the Spirit World, have abilities to summon the aide of spirits... hence Spirit Call, wolf spirit, Focus of Spirit, Voice of the Berserker, etc. .  Along that line, here are some newer creative ideas to flesh out ye ol' &quot;debuffing battle voodoo priest with buffs and a pet....&quot;<br />
<br />
Bind Spirit -- similar to the cleric's Divine Intervention (the spell cast on a toon before he dies, which instantly restores full health and life when victim dies).  Either cast, triggered as an Active AA (or as a passive AA for the shaman himself), or imbibed in a potion, this &quot;binds&quot; the victim's spirit to his body keeping the victim in the zone when he dies.  Remaining in Spirit form, invisible to most NPCs, the victim can move about freely, explore, and drag his corpse wherever.  When he loots his body, he becomes corporeal.  Depending on how the developer's wish to balance this ability, the victim would either  1)  have 0% mana/health and depend on others to get back to full (perhaps with the new shaman AA reverse cannibalization where the shaman infuses his target with the shaman's own health and mana), or 2)  have some mana/health depending on the level/AA ability of the shaman who bound his spirit, or 3)  have full health/mana but no experience regained.  <br />

<br />
Summon Spirit -- As a shaman can be seen in the light somewhere between a cleric and a necro, Summon Spirit would simply recall a slain ally's spirit to his targetted corpse -- no exp regained -- but again, in spirit form undetectable and invincible to NPCs until corpse is looted.  <br />
Graphics rendition -- translucent toon with a radiant aura<br />
<br />
Free Spirit -- as a corollary to the above, and related to the shaman vision series, this allows a Shaman to go into a meditative trance and disembody his spirit from his body and therefore freely explore and scout up ahead while levitated.  The witch doctor then could target a MOB and cast any shaman spell upon it.  The MOB would not aggro anyone in particular, as it cannot determine who cursed it so, but it would largely increase the aggro range of the MOB.  In effect, the shaman extends his powers uniquely and helps the group by pre-emptively debuffing incoming MOBs, thereby mitigating the problem of shaman de-buffs taking too long to cast in battle. Graphics rendition -- pulsating, translucent, floating shaman<br />
<br />
Burning Spirits -- calling on his spiritual ancestor's aide, this buff/AA enshrouds the shaman and pet (and maybe others to a lesser degree) in a spiritual aura, granting a Damage Shield and increasing AC, ATK, Haste, and Inspired Weapon ( increased procs, double attacks, and crits) all rolled into one.  <br />

<br />
Spirit Double -- a self-only buff intended for the Battle Shaman and his pet, akin to the Rage series, this creates a translucent, exact double of the Shaman or his pet, granting double attacks (exactly, that is 2 hits for 48 or 2 hits for 82), reducing aggro in half as the MOB aggroes the double as well, doubling the Dodge skill by 2, and mitigating damage taken depending on the level of the shaman.  The Spirit Double has no hitpoints, vanishes when timer runs out, and prevents the shaman from casting any other spells (triggered AA abilities allowed) until buff is gone. <br />
Graphics rendition -- side-by-side, translucent copy of shaman and/or pet<br />
<br />
Essence of Mana -- this potion will absorb any one spell and hold it until it is imbibed, thereby allowing the drinker to &quot;store&quot; any spell for later use. The potion can be thrown at target if it holds a detrimental spell (throwing skill applies).  Single dose only.<br />
<br />
Spirit Shift -- this AA or spell will cause the target to temporarily shift into a spirit form, removing all aggro and causing a mem blur on the MOB that was attacking it.  Target cannot cast or attack when Spirit Shifted.  Has a chance to cause pet to vanish.  Intended to save casters or melee types near death.  Target can receive spells, such as heals, buffs, or damage spells, while Spirit Shifted. <br />
Graphics rendition -- target becomes translucent with an aura<br />
<br />
Spirit Weapon(AA) -- twofold effect -- cast onto an enemy's weapon, this will have a chance to either disarm the opponent or render the weapon less effective, decreasing damage output for a short time.  Cast onto an ally's weapon, this will imbue it with a proc that will deflect the MOB's would-be damage into a heal for the ally. Later AA levels transform this ability into group/AE form, and eventually MGB'able.  <br />

<br />
Spirit Trance -- What are the other shamen to do during a raid? A single Shaman does a battle dance, bringing about an Area Effect Spirit Trance, and thereby enters into a frenzied state (cannot cast, move or attack; AA abilities allowed).  Within the aura of the trance, a portion of the MOB's attacks are spiritually deflected in effect becoming &quot;splurts&quot; of group heals.  The AE trance also has a Damage Shield component. Perhaps a group health and mana regen.   The trance has an aggro-reducing component for the shaman only. Multiple shamen can enter the Spirit Trance, and their dances combine to increase amount of &quot;splurt heals&quot;, DS damage, and regens.  <br />

<br />
Spirit Grok (concept borrowed from a real-life Hawaiian Shaman, author of The Urban Shaman) -- Grokking is the shamanistic practice of &quot;zoning into&quot; an object and fusing with its essence.  Grokking fire enables you to control or influence fire and to become infused with the properties of fire.  In EverQuest, a highly developed Shaman with the ability to Spirit Grok any other class or race can partially embody his target's characteristics. Spirit Grokking an animal in a pack allows the shaman a chance to &quot;become&quot; that animal in its eyes, adopting its faction and eliminating aggro, perhaps leading the pack in a certain direction away from the shaman's group.  Spirit Grokking an EQ race allows the shaman to temporarily mimic that race's unique ability -- Vah Shir safe fall, Ogre stun immunity, gnome tinkering, etc.  Spirit Grokking an EQ class allows the shaman a chance to mimic a percentage (30/50/70) of that classes unique skills -- a Wizard's evac (50% of the party safely evacuated), a Cleric's rez, a Necro's Feign Death, a Warrior's Riposte and Triple attack, having the Shaman pet proc when a Mage or Beastlord pet is near.... The Spirit Grokking is limited to mimicking only what is in casting range, and disables the shaman's natural or inherent abilites while in Grokked form.  The grokked shaman is only a partial rendition of his target.  Spirit Grokking is of limited usefulness, save that of offering multiple raiding shaman other contributions to the raid when multiple shamen are present.  <br />

<br />
Spirit Twisting -- cast as a buff on the shaman's target.  With a Spirit Twist buff, an ally that receives a damaging spell or attack from a MOB or opponent will receive the opposite effect... a lifetap becomes damage to the opponent; a DD becomes a heal; attacks become damage to the opponent itself.... While the Shaman is maintaining this spiritual link with his target, each successful &quot;Spiritual Twist&quot; drains a proportionate amount of mana and health from the shaman.<br />

There, had my say....lol... I missed the chance Brenlo offered us to suggest alternative AA's for OOW... the thread was locked by the time I read all suggestions and was ready to offer my own. I'm rather surprised by this impromptu list.... I may have gotten a bit carried away but the point is that there is plenty of creative room to open the Shaman class up, while sticking true to the concept of the Shaman as a liaison of the spirit world.  I feel that some of the ideas here subtly address many of the class balancing/requests throughout shaman posts -- improved DPS. aggro, shaman effectiveness endgame compared to other classes, actual useful buffs, multiple shaman on a raid, pet power, group heals, etc...<br />
<br />
Then again, if we had these suggestions, shamen would maybe be TOO powerful....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't sweat it.  The Ranger's blinked and missed theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just wanted to say that you had some impressive and interesting ideas.  I am happy to see that people are thinking of new ideas.  Who knows, maybe one will eventually get picked up.<br />
<br />
That being said, I don't imagine a single one of these being implemented.  Both the programing involved and the fact that other classes will, yet again, b-tch and moan that shaman are over powered.<br />
<br />
Alas, I do salute you for coming up with some great ideas and, more importantly, taking the time to write them down for us all.  I do like each idea...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">with spirit Grok we could heal 50% as much as a cleric...that would be game breaking :(<br />
<br />
<br />
that said nice list, some cool ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Keep in mind that with Spirit Grok, your target would have to be within casting range.  In order to Grok a cleric, a cleric would have to be nearby, likely already in your group or raid.  Kinda like being near a bard to get any bard buffs.  Naturally, any new abilities gained would have to be offset by some type of balancing figure, such as limited duration or longer recast timer, etc...<br />
<br />
The EverQuest developers have a new, fertile set of role-playing and class-balancing spell suggestions here.  I wonder how to get their attention on these?  I'd be stoked if any of the suggestions made it in some form to the new AA's... they wouldn't have to be implemented exactly as suggested, as long as they capture the &quot;spirit&quot; of the new ability.....lol.  I'd hope if they're gonna dedicate some programming muscle to develop new AA abilities anyway, that at least several of the ideas are entirely feasible to code... after all, like in Spirit Trance (one of my favorites), the variables involved are already in game -- DS, aggro, regen....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My thoughts:<br />
<br />
Bind Spirit -- this &quot;binds&quot; the victim's spirit to his body keeping the victim in the zone when he dies.  Remaining in Spirit form, invisible to most NPCs, the victim can move about freely, explore, and drag his corpse wherever.  When he loots his body, he becomes corporeal.<br />
This is a good one - fits the shaman flavor, I cannot find any abuse with it, useful but not overpowering, fixes rez dependancy.<br />
<br />
Free Spirit -- as a corollary to the above, and related to the shaman vision series, this allows a Shaman to go into a meditative trance and disembody his spirit from his body and therefore freely explore and scout up ahead while levitated.<br />
I am not so sure about this one - seems like it would be too much effort for all but boss MOBs.<br />
<br />
Burning Spirits -- calling on his spiritual ancestor's aide, this buff/AA enshrouds the shaman and pet (and maybe others to a lesser degree) in a spiritual aura, granting a Damage Shield and increasing AC, ATK, Haste, and Inspired Weapon ( increased procs, double attacks, and crits) all rolled into one.  <br />
I am not sure I would be willing to spend AAs on something akin to rabid bear. It would be much better if it buffed our pet like you suggested and gave the shaman a focus effect (cold/poison DD focus, burning affliction or the like).<br />
<br />
Spirit Double -- a self-only buff intended for the Battle Shaman and his pet, akin to the Rage series, this creates a translucent, exact double of the Shaman or his pet, granting double attacks (exactly, that is 2 hits for 48 or 2 hits for 82), reducing aggro in half as the MOB aggroes the double as well, doubling the Dodge skill by 2, and mitigating damage taken depending on the level of the shaman.  The Spirit Double has no hitpoints, vanishes when timer runs out, and prevents the shaman from casting any other spells (triggered AA abilities allowed) until buff is gone. <br />
Coding difficulties aside this one sounds like it would be useful for everyone (half aggro is good) and fun. I like it, although I am not sure if that is implementable.<br />
<br />
Essence of Mana -- this potion will absorb any one spell and hold it until it is imbibed, thereby allowing the drinker to &quot;store&quot; any spell for later use. The potion can be thrown at target if it holds a detrimental spell (throwing skill applies).  Single dose only.<br />
I adore this idea. And I know it will not be codeable :( . Bleh.<br />
<br />
Spirit Shift -- this AA or spell will cause the target to temporarily shift into a spirit form, removing all aggro and causing a mem blur on the MOB that was attacking it.  Target cannot cast or attack when Spirit Shifted. Target can receive spells, such as heals, buffs, or damage spells, while Spirit Shifted. <br />
Whoa, a targetable improved FD? This sounds way too powerful to me.<br />
<br />
Spirit Weapon(AA) -- twofold effect -- cast onto an enemy's weapon, this will have a chance to either disarm the opponent or render the weapon less effective, decreasing damage output for a short time.  Cast onto an ally's weapon, this will imbue it with a proc that will deflect the MOB's would-be damage into a heal for the ally.<br />
Ok, this one confuses me. Examples please.<br />
<br />
Spirit Trance -- A single Shaman does a battle dance, bringing about an Area Effect Spirit Trance, and thereby enters into a frenzied state (cannot cast, move or attack; AA abilities allowed).<br />
This is where it stops being a good idea - abilities that stop you playing the game are not fun, even if they are useful.<br />
<br />
Spirit Grok -- Spirit Grokking an animal in a pack allows the shaman a chance to &quot;become&quot; that animal in its eyes, adopting its faction and eliminating aggro, perhaps leading the pack in a certain direction away from the shaman's group.  Spirit Grokking an EQ race allows the shaman to temporarily mimic that race's unique ability -- Vah Shir safe fall, Ogre stun immunity, gnome tinkering, etc.  Spirit Grokking an EQ class allows the shaman a chance to mimic a percentage (30/50/70) of that classes unique skills -- a Wizard's evac (50% of the party safely evacuated), a Cleric's rez, a Necro's Feign Death, a Warrior's Riposte and Triple attack, having the Shaman pet proc when a Mage or Beastlord pet is near.... The Spirit Grokking is limited to mimicking only what is in casting range, and disables the shaman's natural or inherent abilites while in Grokked form.<br />
I am not sure what to think of this one. Potentially fun and useful. Also potentially utterly useless, utterly overpowered and very likely to step on everyone's toes.<br />
<br />
Spirit Twisting -- cast as a buff on the shaman's target.  With a Spirit Twist buff, an ally that receives a damaging spell or attack from a MOB or opponent will receive the opposite effect... a lifetap becomes damage to the opponent; a DD becomes a heal; attacks become damage to the opponent itself.... <br />
I see two problems - 1) overpowered. 2) not fun for the shaman at all. Now, make it a 0 cast time AA and have it apply to the next single attack/spell only and you have a skill element, you do not lock the shaman out of playing his character and it is not overpowered anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is a good one - fits the shaman flavor, I cannot find any abuse with it, useful but not overpowering, fixes rez dependancy.Would likely never happen.  Anyone could get themselves killed and scout out every inch of a new zone in a new expansion without any risk.<br />
<br />
I adore this idea. And I know it will not be codeable :( . Bleh.Entirely doable with EQ's system.  This is just changing which spell is cast from a potion dynamically instead of when the potion is created.  It would require refactoring of code, sure, but not impossible at all IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">as innovative and great as some of those ideas are, i really dont see any of them as a possibility for going into a effect, but that is great thinking man.</div></div><hr />
