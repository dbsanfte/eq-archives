<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The usual server interguild drama, two guilds going after the same mob, resulting in trains, wipeouts, and GM intervention.  Nothing you haven't seen before.  The thread (http://pub148.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm5.showMessage?topicID=228.topic) it produced was long and disgustingly predictable, but had some great individual posts!  The first one is hilarious, but this one takes the cake (it's from Guild A's main tank, commenting on Guild B trying to claim a spawn when they're not ready for it):<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me put it to you this way~ Lets say I'm at Galyans Sporting Goods looking to buy an XXXL jock strap to contain my 14&quot; cock but to my surprise there is only one XXXL in stock and some other guy is walking around the store with it on his head even though he knows and I assume he only has a 5&quot; pecker and would be better suited with the XSmall, anyway the jock costs $23.95 and all gimp dick has on his person is $3.04...while I'm packing well over $800 with another 6Gs outside in the Lambo (its my story, ****), so whats he do??<br />
He stalls...yes in hopes that I will lose interest and go home to bang one of my 9 supermodel hoe's or that his &quot;partner&quot; Steve will hurry back with penny jar and bail him out so he aimlessly wanders the store with his chest puffed and a jock on his head. At this point it getting close to closing time and I am more than fed up with this bull**** (apparently the guy is doing this out of spite on account my Lambo{****} embarrassed him in his phat-tricked Civic at the stop light just as he was laying the smooth smack on a couple highschool chicks, so he followed me to Galyans in hopes that he could key my **** while I was in the store but his Nickle-plated pos snapped in 2 upon contact with my Zerconium paintjob and oh boy is he PISSED so he goes into the store and overhears me asking the dead****ingsexy 24yr old supermodel clerk where I might find something adequate with which to contain my Massive Member at which the clerks leads me in my surprise to the nearest dressing room and slams down the freak on me........<br />
So anyway I quickly snatch the little fugger up and remove the jock from his head but in a last ditch attempt at revenge (or pure terror/confusion) he sadly urinates himself and unfortunatly gets me as well, the store manager over hears the ruckus and tells 5&quot; to immediatly remove himself from the premises. I then purchase the XXXL and happily drive home with the knowledge that justic once again was served.<br />
