<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started a new character for smithing, im at 115, and only used about 400pp, but i dont know how much money i need to throw in, because it looks like everything i can make at this skill level just burns a hole in my pocket.  My questions are how much money will it take to get up to artificers level, and, is it worth working for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want artificers to wear it's gonna be cheaper just to buy it. To make it you need to be well over 200 skill, the closer to 250 the better. If you really wanna do it yourself check out www.eqtraders.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Getting to the 220+ range for smithing where you ahve a good shot (which is to say, better than 1 in 5 success rate) at artificier mail will cost you one of the following two things:<br />
1) 150-200,000 platinum<br />
2) 3 months of constant farming<br />
<br />
Or some combination thereof. Your pick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye.... too true.. too true...<br />
<br />
193 Smithing here... holding out for a +10-15% Smithing mod so I can cheat by making ethreal essence rings...<br />
<br />
Too bad the Tae Ew market is shot to hell, I know 6 different smiths that constantly have a storehouse of Tae Ew selling in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I've started to just sell my Tae Ew bloods, lol...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup before you could get smith to 175 for about 500pp and to 242 for 50k or so. <br />
<br />
Now its a lot lot harder to do. <br />
<br />
Depending on your server prices you could probably buy cultrual armor for yourself and all of your twinks at the cost of GM'n smithing in one race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's an easy way to get to 250 and spending very little cash. Just a ton of green farming. It's the Shar Vahl smithing quest. Here's the link:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/luclin_sharvahlsmith.htm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm a GM barbarian smith and it took me like 2 MONTHS of pharming to do it &quot;the cheap way&quot; (i.e. Shadowscream). That meant no exp time.<br />
<br />
Here's a rough guide for your percentage chance to make Artificers....<br />
At max modified skill (252) you have a 40% chance of success. That would be 240 raw skill + geerlok.<br />
For each point below 252, subtract 1% but don't go below 5% as there is always a chance to succeed (or fail!).<br />
<br />
If you are in a big raiding guild you can score a +15% smithing item maybe and &quot;shortcut&quot; from 192 to 212 (on Ethereal Brick combines) and then be on max skill at 219.<br />
<br />
Or you can try to get the +10% belt I got (massive girdle of the forge from Praesortium Bikun in Santus Seru) and shortcut from 200 to 212 on Ethereal Brick Combines.<br />
If you find a guild camping Seru keys maybe you can ask nicely for a belt if no one else needs it....<br />
<br />
Eventually you can make Mistletoe Cutting sickles for skill ups and break even on the sell back but they need like 320 subcombines for 20 attempts! And at 1 skill up per 20 attempts-ish you are looking at an assload of clicking!!!!!<br />
<br />
Not trying to discourage you, but I am just saying smithing is a Massive time-sink and maybe that time could be better spent leveling up (and therefore getting better gear/plat anyway etc etc).<br />
<br />
Btw I sell bugger-all Artificiers or Tundra Helanic plate. Most of what I sell is Tae Ew and/or Hurricane armor. On some servers the Tae Ew Market is wrecked so bad you almost have to sell it at COST. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm having a heck-of-a hard time finding a GM Smith on Terris-Thule.  I want to see if I can get one to do some combines for Tae Ew armor (I will donate materials and plat of course).  But after hearing what some of you are saying, maybe I should just suck it up, and pay the 9k pp for the shield.  Any comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you can find a smith to do the combine, do so. For Tae Ew, success rates seem to be better than cultural. (For example, I got a guildie smith to combine 5 shields at skill 210 (+ geerlock), and he succeeded on all 5.)<br />
<br />
On Xev, there's quite a few smiths making Tae Ew stuff - particularly the tunic, legs and shields. The shields can sometimes be seen for as low as 5000pp. If your server is anything like this cut throat for Tae Ew, a smith might well be prepared to do the combine for a fixed profit rather than just rely on sales which aren't frequent for not much more profit. (Minimal profit if they buy their bloods, that is.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With many deaths of our group, I managed to get 4 bloods and a friend of a friend did the combines for me this weekend.  I’m a 250 brewer so I bought the two manna vials in the bazaar, 300pp each, and did the brewing combine myself.  Then I gathered the other materials and handed them to the smith.  She had 250 skill and a geerlok.  She succeeded on the chest combine but failed on the leg combine.  I gave here a 500pp tip, so the tunic cost me just a bit over 1100pp.  When my friends and I gain a few more levels we may attempt it again.  Not only is Tae Ew armor much nicer than any armor I’ve ever had on any of my characters, but it looks very nice as well.  On my kitty shaman it looks like black chain.  Its really very very dark green, but it looks black unless you zoom in and look really close.  I can’t wait to get the full set.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if the helm has a graphic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Finding a specific GM smith to make cultural armor (artificer, darksplint, etc) can be nightmarish, depending on server...but finding just any old GM smith to do things like Tae Ew combines really shouldn't be that difficult.<br />
<br />
Check the marketplace forums for your server on eqtraders, or possibly your servers own boards for a trading forum.<br />
<br />
On Luclin, our marketplace forum has a stickied post where 200+ skill tradeskillers can submit their name and race for inclusion so if you are looking for someone to do work for you, it isn't too hard to find them. If you have all the ingrediants for Tae Ew stuff ready to go, I wouldn't pay 9k for a pre-made shield. Get 2 sets (for fails), let the smith keep the second set if the first one succeeds. It will be cheaper than buying the item made already, and will get you a friend in that smith.<br />
<br />
Just make sure that you really do have EVERYTHING that is needed, and that the things you bring are the right things. Nothing bugs a tradeskiller more than someone who purports to have done all the work for you only to find that they are missing half the stuff, or a couple of crucial items are the wrong thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">do you know what lvl i have to be to get the ingredients?<br />
what i have to camp? so far i think if i get this characters skill high enough i may be use to other people, or at least if i dont get high enough for artificers, i can still make my own armor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">there's an AOC barb warrior that's a GM on terris, I forget what his name is though... it took me a while to find cultural wrists and he's the only GM barb I know of on the server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">After the fine plate and ehtereal ring nerfs, its infinitely faster to farm cash and buy your armor than gm smithing yourself. Or farm components, get everyhting ready, and find a smith of your culture to do the combines in exchange for some plat (some may do it for free even). If you want tae ew, its even less fo a joke. It will take you several hours farming shadowscream for a skill gain.... you do the math. I mostly gm'd the easy way back in the day, and got in on the tae ew/mistletoe gravy train (lol I sold my first tae ew tunics for 45k)... if you were asking this question a year ago, the answer would be completely different. The market is saturated... by the time you can do it, the prices will have fallen even more.</div></div><hr />

Yes it does.<br />

This is Tae ew Helm, Breastplate, Sleeves and Boots, they have all been dyed to the colours shown.  Red boots are my guilds uniform :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for posting the picture.  I have since dyed all but my helm and boots the same dark green as the tunic, so I’ll at least have part of the look until I can manage to farm some more blood.  I’m trying to push for some more levels so that will be sooner instead of later.  Those lizards hit hard.  :p</div></div><hr />
