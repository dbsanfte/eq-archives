<br />
As you may or may not be aware of, the monks of Norrath and you now share a mob in common, The Spectral Courier in City of Mist.<br />
The monks need those illegible LORE scrolls that he drops.<br />
As a recent camper of this mob, I was hoping to tap the vast knowledge you may have of this particularly evasive mob.<br />
<br />
2 days ago, myself and a shaman were camping the stables in hopes of getting our respected items from this mob.  Things went well for us both, and we got him to pop several times.<br />
<br />
Fast Forward a day. The next day I come back, and I am doing the camp. After 6 hours of being here.. No courier popd' at all.  I had to leave, and another brother monk takes over the camp until the patch on 5/8/02.  After the patch he logs in and is there for about 4 hours, when I show up.  0 spec couriers have pop'd since I left. <br />
<br />
Is this normal for this camp.. Where he pops at an expected rate, and then all of a sudden disappears from the face of the earth?<br />
<br />
Any help you folks can give on this, would be most appreciated by the myself and others monks of norrath.<br />
<br />
Your brother in war,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's a random spawn. Your luck can vary wildly, I had him spawn four times in 20 hours while a guildmate got him three times in a couple hours. Just stick with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He only spawns in three different spots in the stables. Someone used to have a map...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">completely random spawn...its just bad luck..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have had to camp himseveral times to get my note. A couple of times he never spawned after several hours of camps. Then a got him once but he only dropped the monk scroll (seems to drop it everytime). When I finally got the note I needed he spawned on the 2nd round of kills. <br />
It's all luck.</div></div><hr />
