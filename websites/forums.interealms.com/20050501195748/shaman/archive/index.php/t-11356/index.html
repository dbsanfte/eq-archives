When you go to buy stacks of stuff from a PC trader, it doesn't work, says price has changed or quantity has changed. You have to buy stuff one at a time. Annoying.</div></div><hr />

/filter badword</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah tried to bring a few unflagged guildies with us to storms last night and none could get in. Had plenty of people in the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think a lot's messed up.  My video (after resetting all my options) is still really messed up.  In addition, myself and many others are crashing everytime we quit out of the game or /camp desktop.  Also, there's a problem with lots of people not being able to buy more than one item at a time from vendors in the bazaar.  All of these seem like they would have been easy catches if the expansion had been tested to any extent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">horses are messed up now.  Had to delete and redownload a .dll file originally as well.  Not nearly so bad as the Luclin &quot;upgrade&quot;.  I literally had to go out and buy the cd before EQ started working for me again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They reset everything back to default .. filter, spell effect, sound ... <br />
The system for having unflagged player in a raid is not really tested (for example: as unflagged player in such a raid, go LD, die, have active char bug, log in later, raid is gone, have 5 mins to get a rez or be ported out. No idea if you can ge rezzed in)<br />
<br />
I really expect further patches.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yah I think they're just taking the patching slow.  sounds like they need to do a patch at least by next week.  Hopefully sooner.  I want more VT dammit!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In their defense... for as many changes as there were... there are relatively few problems. I think it's gone rather well considering the past issues there were with patches.<br />
<br />
The single purchase of items is annoying, but I can deal with it until they fix it.<br />
<br />
Bringing non-Flagged people on raids isn't a problem. It works.<br />
<br />
Just be aware that this is intended for areas that you need a flag for, and not a key. If you need to have a key to get into the area you cannot bring non-Keyed people into the area for a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy i think BoT is a flag , cause you dont use a key to gain entry everytime , its just flagged that you will gain entry.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think he is talking about the towers inside of BoT which require a key to gain entrance.<br />
<br />
However, you could always get others into the towers as long as one person in group has key.</div></div><hr />
