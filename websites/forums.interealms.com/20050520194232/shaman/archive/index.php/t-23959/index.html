<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone found a spot to solo that has decent exp?  Just wondering...<br />
<br />
O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Otani to properly answer you we will need to know level, gear, etc...  But as a lvl 67 shaman I can solo in NC safe easy exp.  If you are looking to grind tho grab a group.  If you don't have time to group, just kill the jelly fish in NC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Easy-ish to solo the 1st few zones.....but is it good?  thats for you to decide i guess<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guess I should have been more specific:<br />
<br />
Lvl 68 Time/Uqua geared (9600 hps full raid buffed).<br />
<br />
The reason I'm asking is there are times, early in the AM when I have an hour, maybe hour and a half to play before work....hardly time to get a grp togather and go camp a site.  Was looking for a spot where I could go and grind a bit of exp.  Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i soloed many times when i was waiting to get a group, (self buff at 4000 hp)  and about 1280 ac.<br />
<br />
easy camp is near WOS zone(in noble causeway) they can be single pullable,well i killed there when i was lv 66.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Laopan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The discordlings in PG are easily root rottable  with VP. You can camp them at the entrance, i would imagine same  exp as  soloing in fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I experimented with soloing, found the murkgliders in Noble's Causeway good targets.  You can single pull in many places, and slow lands quickly on them.  They're pretty good xp soloing, and the murks in NC can very rarely drop an EE5/FT2 EP-quality belt (which is why I experimented with soloing in NC, hehehe.)<br />
<br />
Only drawback is they have an AE proc that DoTs dogdog and they have a TON of hp.  Soloing them is mana-intensive, but perfectly doable for anyone who can buff to 4khp.  Just expect downtime between pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have soloed murks pretty easy even for a gimp-ass ghetto shaman such as I. They dont solo so root rot works well. They have low disease resists. They can also drop an awesome shield, although not, so far, for me. In Noble's causeway, the trench next to the zone in from Draniks is a good place to pull to - plenty of room to run around if necessary and no wanderers.<br />
<br />
However, the exp and loot is sucky compared to grouping or even duoing, imo this particular soloing is only worth it if you cant get a group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm only 67 at the moment but I was duo'ing in the Dranik's Hollows zone, Murkglider Hive with a 70 necro the other day.  We would just root rot, hp's arn't terrible and with him having got the exp as a 70 I would get about 5% aaxp a kill duo so probably about 14-15% solo just guessing.  If your not 68+ you need someone higher level to get the harder one for you but it's pretty safe easy xp as nothing I know of summons in there other then nameds and they only hit for 600ish with a slow base attack speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im going to have to say nobles causeway also, safest place and decent experience... however when i am waiting to get a group, even if it is OoW group i usually solo in plane of fire until i get a group</div></div><hr />
