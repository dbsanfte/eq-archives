<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got my corroded chain bracer in Kael last night so want to get my Rune Crafters bracer.  Just wondering what I have to con to Dorfs to be able to do the quest?  I take it if they will give me the quest then I have enough faction to complete it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To do any armor quest, you need to have ALLY faction with the group.<br />
<br />
(At least that's what I thought... Seems I'm wrong.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only need Ally for giant and CoV quests...<br />
<br />
For Thurg quests I believe it is warmly...bottom line is does the NPC give you the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">could swear kindly was Coldain.  Have to check it out later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail Wildaar,<br />
<br />
Its Ally, you can CON warmly, but mostly its Kindly and Ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">huh??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Swyrlyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The faction you need for Thurgadin quests is kindly. At least i did my thurg leggings few weeks ago conning kindly to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Haha warmly.. no ally.. no kindly.. WHy? b/c I said so nah nah nah.. thats how I did my quest so that how its got to be.<br />
<br />
I think Tannas said it best..check to see if you get quest. If you do then you have enough faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't remember what faction is required for the dorf quests but it isn't ally. I'm still not ally on my enchanter but I did the dorf robe quest with out any problems. Just make sure they will give you the quest and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mairi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you walk up to the guy and he gives you the quest, then you have sufficient faction. If he says something like you still can't be trusted...then turn in more toes and kill more giants. I went from KOS to the dorfs to at least warmly before they would give me the quest...but I got those leggings.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thurgadin - Kindly.<br />
KD/Skyshrine - Ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the replies - I will try and get to Thurg soon and give it a go.  Was just checking that it wasnt definately Ally before I made the run over there as it is such a pain in the ass to get to half the time and I dont wanna waste 50pp on a port for no reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did the Thurgadin BP and arms two days ago.  When the quest NPC conned warmly, he would tell me he could make armor (after ensuring I was a shaman ;) ) but refused to respond further about &quot;what tunic&quot; or &quot;what arms&quot; (i.e., to tell me what stones to get etc).  I didn't risk trying the hand-in.  When I got to &quot;kindly,&quot; then he responded with the rest of the quest info.  He took the stones and chain piece, and gave me the BP in return. So what I can say for sure is that I  didn't have to make &quot;ally.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Patch message from last May (2001):<br />
<br />
** Quest Changes **<br />
<br />
- We've made a change to the Velious armor quests. The folks in Kael and in Skyshrine that give out rewards for these quests are now being stricter about who they will reward quest items to. You will have to be considered an 'ally' (see Features section below) by these NPCs in order to be able to complete these quests. If you are doing quests for the Coldain, however, they are somewhat less picky, and they only require that they consider you 'kindly' to reward you for your labors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the last few are....<br />
<br />
Kindly, warmly, ally... in that order.</div></div><hr />
