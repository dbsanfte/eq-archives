<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so here's something weird.  I do the epic step by step exactly the way it's designed.  Get the ring off Kirn in the Hole.  Go on reaver raid, pop Neh'Ashiir.  Everyone buffs up, all good to go, we're ready.  Con Neh, she's warmly (according to the thread on faction for each stage of the quest, true spirit is warmly from turning in Ghiosk's books until AFTER I kill Neh.  All is well.  Then things get weird.<br />
<br />
I give her the ring, she GIVES IT BACK!  ***?  This is new, everything I've read says that she either eats it and laughs, or eats it, dies, and I loot her for the diary.  Has this ever happened to anyone?  I petitioned, and all I got was some guide telling me to con her to see if I had good enough faction (my response, how can I tell high warmly from low warmly?).  So now here I am, not sure if I'm high warmly or low warmly, with Kirn's ring in my bearskin potion bag.  Should I:<br />
<br />
a)  try giving her the ring again and pretend nothing happened<br />
b)  do the test of patience until I have ally faction (definitely better than I need), then try again<br />
c)  just say fuggit and get to max ally, then just give Rak the tear that I had long before I got the ring from Kirn<br />
<br />
Has this happened to anyone else?  Just looking for some collective shammy wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Double, double check you havent missed a step. you handed in Ghiosks books, yes?<br />
<br />
http://www.easttown.co.uk/Epics/epic.php?Class=13<br />
<br />
So if it's not that then somethings gone wrong, a bug with your faction or you've taken a hit you've forgotten about. Have you helped with any other epics that could have hosed your true spirit faction? Shadowknights include a truespirit hit or two I believe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Positive that I've done it all, it was a point of pride with me to do my epic step by step and to not skip anything.  I haven't helped with ANY parts of the shadowknight epic.  Two other circumstances that I failed to mention:<br />
<br />
1)  Rak'Ashiir was up when we got into the zone.  I strongly suspect that perhaps this caused some sort of zone bug that caused this attempt to fail.<br />
2)  Immediately after she gave me the ring back, she aggroed us, and we began beating on her.  Long story short, she ended up falling off the skywalk (stupid pets, but I still love mages), gated to zone, and started summoning our raid one by one.  We all evac'd and aborted that attempt (since I still had the ring, it was better to just try again than it was to fight her only half prepared).  Because of this, we didn't bother to kill her, and have whatever additional faction disaster added to the problem (if indeed faction was the problem).<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm off to post some raid plans on the old guild message board.  I'll try again in a couple of days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It might be a faction thing.   Coming from working in the computer world, I know of some of the &quot;uncertainties&quot; of data over time.  I made sure my faction was maxed before I did Neh'Ashiir and Rak'Ashiir (Yes, I know I didn't have to do Neh'Ashiir, but getting my epic early, I wanted the pride of saying I did it the right way).<br />
<br />
What I'd suggest is 1) Make sure its the right ring, and 2) Go max your faction with Woe and Envy, then retry Neh'Ashiir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) Rak'Ashiir was up when we got into the zone. I strongly suspect that perhaps this caused some sort of zone bug that caused this attempt to fail<br />
<br />
Doubful.  SOP for my guild doing multiple bosses for shaman is to pop Rak, leave him standing, go do Neh, come back and get Rak.  He was up when I killed Neh and looted her diary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Your faction can be too high or too low for specific steps.<br />
You say that you haven't skipped any steps.  For that I applaud you. :cool: <br />
<br />
But have you repeated any earlier steps at all?<br />
Maybe turned in a few extra tiny gems?  Grabbed an extra envy/woe for shield turn in?  Two sets of Ghiosk books possibly?<br />
<br />
Back when we had server GM's, I was able to work on this with my server GM, who came to HATE our epic after faction changes.<br />
If you do an epic faction search, you can find my story in this forum somewhere.  It is long buried now, &amp; I'm frankly too tired to hunt it down. :p<br />
<br />
With the new cluster GM's, getting a response will be tough.  But you can have a GM check your faction level.  He won't give you a #, but he can say &quot;too high, too low, etc&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'd say the recent problems with the wizard Truespirit faction might (who knows?) have done something also.  Have you done anything in guild that would result in a non-shaman epic NPC battle that caused you to take a Truespirit hit, either positive or negative?<br />
<br />
Those are just some ideas off the top of my head.  Hope it helps.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As far as I know, I've done everything perfectly, not one more or less thing than I've had to do, altho I've helped other SHAMEN with their epic.  Could I have too much faction from helping several people with Kirn?  If that's the case, and I have TOO MUCH faction, this quest has a really crappy design.  I'm gonna have to really beg for a GM to check my faction.<br />
<br />
The thing that really confuses me the most is that she gave the ring back (Engraved Ring).  From everything I've read on every other post on these boards is that she would eat the ring either way, and that whether or not she dropped the diary would be dependent upon my faction.  That's what led me to suspect that there was more at work here than just bad faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vauk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have helped kill the truespirit wolves.....way back when. How am I suppose to know where my faction is for which hand in.....especially if I followed the steps exactly. <br />
<br />
I was apprehensive when I started the quest. I did the initial step (tiny gem) severel times and did severel of the other quests severel times....because I knew I had to be at least ally by the time I was ready for rak. <br />
<br />
I am ally now with truespirit, but if you're telling me that I have to be ally.....but not too ally..........gah, *** am I suppose to do.....try turning in the tear....if it messes up....kill a dog? <br />
<br />
/boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok, I had my faction at ally before doing the Nek hand in and she went off like a rocket. I don't think you can be high for that step at warmly.<br />
I had a faction issue early in the quest (the wandering spirit would not stop for me when I hailed him; he does if you are max ally, so no to high there either) and did a couple extra books and marr/woe/envies. Maxed after Nef's  diary and one more m/w/e.  I tell you what it does to Rak tomorrow.<br />
<br />
P.S. VI screwed around with the wizard epic which is on true spirit faction too, so maybe some requirements where changed for the shaman faction hits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just putting some closure on this thread.  After taking advice from you all, I went out and just did woe/envy 2 more times, and got my faction to ally.  Went to CoM, got into a raid (that's another story, they could make that nite into a movie), and to make a very long story very short, did my turn in to Neh'Ashiir and killed her, she dropped the diary, all is good.  Ally faction both before turn in to Neh, and Ally after giving diary to lake dog in EJ.  Got my tear in hand, ready to fight Rak with Ally faction.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story:<br />
<br />
If your faction is too low to do part of the quest (first hand proof of this with Neh'Ashiir at least), and you turn in an item before your faction is high enough, you WILL get the item back, and not be forced to repeat earlier parts of the quest.  I'm BEYOND happy that I didn't have to redo the Hole portion of my epic, which was by FAR the hardest part of the shaman epic.  This makes questing MUCH less frustrating for those of us who have minor faction problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the wandering spirit thing is not faction problem&gt;&gt;&gt; i had the same problem, however i actually had a gm on the line at that moment.  he told me the spirit is hard of hearing and u have to be INFRONT of it when u hail it.  It just doesnt work if ur from the side or rear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">eep...I helped with the SK epic in OT a while back.  I'm up to the point where I turn in the ring to Neh...should I go check my faction before I go do this?  And to whom do I go con to check this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just completed the Hole this weekend and now see that<br />
I have to go to CoM and turn the ring in to Neh.<br />
<br />
How tough is she? Can a single group of 55+ take her<br />
and the reavers? I haven't done much CoM in a while and<br />
it's pretty empty nowadays so how prepared should I come?<br />
<br />
Also, do I just kill Reavers until she spawns? Where does<br />
she usually spawn?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the questions, but I'd just totally forgot about this<br />
part of my quest. I thought the next part was Fear until I<br />
re-read the guide.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any help.<br />
<br />
BTW, The Hole was done with a group of 8 since we were also going after an enchanter's quest piece. All level 60 except me and it was a piece of cake and a lot of fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">a group that can do the hole can easily do neh. She spawns from a specific reaver,the one at the very top of the city, usually referred to as the &quot;last reaver&quot;. She spawns every time from that reaver, so just have to kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just handed in the Ghiosk books and I'm currently sitting at kindly faction.  I started the epic quest with indifferent faction and completed every step in the guide so far.  I'm a little worried that killing Kirn, Nehashir and Rak  is not going to push me through warmly all the way to ally.  Should I make sure I hit ally before doing the final turn-in for the spear?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I did Neh with no problem, although I had done woe &amp; envy a bit so I was ally when I greeted her.<br />
<br />
I did not reach max ally before the final turn in, but I got my epic, so all is well.<br />
<br />
Neh did mez me... ouch! :) I couldn't do anything for a few minutes. 2 fire pets and a 60 necro took her down easy. She took my ring.<br />
<br />
I wonder, if she returned the ring, if she had already been the product of someone's failed ring turn in? Did you pop her?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I suggest you get more faction by turning in woe and envy a few times, and then try again. You're lucky to get your ring back :)</div></div><hr />
