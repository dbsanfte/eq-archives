<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone has ever compiled a list of what is expected of a given class. That may not make a lot of sense, so let me explain.<br />
<br />
I don't have a unresistable mr debuff yet. When fighting harder LDON or when I am lowest in group, I frequently need as much MR debuffing as possible to land slows on even and higher mobs.<br />
<br />
With an enchanter in a group, tashing (being cheap and unresistable) would help a lot, to let me land Mal-x, then the slow.<br />
<br />
I asked for every mob to be Tashed, but the ENC kind of blew me off.<br />
<br />
The question is; is it a appropriate to &quot;call&quot; someone on someting like this?<br />
<br />
It seems that there are certain expectations for given classes, and I would think that on harder mobs a Tash, given the low cost and unreistability, would be an expectation of a chanter, just as people expect a shaman to slow, or a cleric to heal, etc.<br />
<br />
Any insights?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could always start dropping hints in group chat, such as announcing every time that one of your MR based spells are resisted.  Pretty soon the rest of the group will be asking the enchanter if he is tashing and you won't even have to say another word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If someone asked me to Malos every mob in an LDoN group, I'd probably giggle and ignore them.  However, that's only because malos is really annoying to cast because of its long cast time and high mana cost.  I don't see why an ench would refuse to tash unless they are just lazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">tash = agro.<br />
<br />
If I'm getting a lot of resists on that particular ldon, I would start asking the chanter(if we have one) to tash. otherwise, I'll just deal with it. imo, all a chanter needs to do is mez adds and nuke some and he's doing his job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally it sounds like you're grouped with people that are significantly higher in level, which isn't really a good idea unless they're friends that are having mercy on you.<br />
<br />
Slowing is usually our primary role and is usually critical to group success.  If you can't reliably land your slows then you're in over your head, IMO.<br />
<br />
There are occasions when I need to malo before I slow to ensure that slows land regularly (and malo delay sucks bad) but I don't think you should be in a position where you rely on someone else to MR debuff for you.  Consider that often an enchanter is gonna need to be mezzing and won't have time to tash for you - you need to be able to take care of your business yourself.<br />
<br />
If you need someone to tash for you and you need to land malaiXX before you can slow then you are fighting beyond your means, IMO.  It can be done, but what a hassle!<br />
<br />
Anyways, just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At lower levels, you're going to find a lot of people with some idiotic views of their class.  When playing my paladin alt in a pickup group (variety is the spice of life and all that), the conversation went something like this:<br />
druid: shammy, take over heals<br />
shaman: kind of busy slowing and keeping the buffs up<br />
*a couple of group members chime in for the shaman - including me, imagine that - and she shuts up*<br />
*2 mobs later*<br />
druid: OOM, shammy take over heals<br />
shaman: fine, I'm on heals<br />
*I start healing the shaman, because he's cann'ing like a madman between and during pulls*<br />
*couple mobs later, druid starts nuking*<br />
shaman: druid ready for heals again?<br />
druid: no, I can't, I'm snaring and DS'ing<br />
shaman: alrightie, then.  druid, you're on heals.  chanter, you're on slows.  shaman is getting a new group.<br />
*disband*<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the druid was a little worse than your chanter who thinks that *guffaw*  tash isn't worth casting.  But the principle is the same.  Unfortunately, all the lists in the world aren't going to help these people realize what's best for them to cast - it's going to take time and experience.  At this point, if I feel the need for a pickup group, I'm able to pick from specific guilds, to lessen my chance of getting one of these Special players.  All I can do is wish you luck and patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have to agree with the little commentary by LaughingWoman. So many groups I've been in like that. The druid is main healer, but would rather nuke. They go OOM and the shaman steps up to heal, but as soon as druid gets mana back they begin to nuke. Their excuse is that the shaman is doing fine on healing and they would rather do some DPS...I see, the druids don't want us to step on their toes with healing upgrades, yet they prefer to nuke and do DPS while we Malxxx, slow, canni, etc. How is that right? But, we are overpowered already for having slow....yeah, right. Let's face it, druids (most I've grouped with, not all) HATE to be main healers, but have a problem with shaman being as good as them at it. /boggle<br />
<br />
As far as Tash goes, chanters don't Tash because of the agro involved, so if you NEED that Tash, get a Journeyman's Walking Stick and use it during slow recycles on a resist, it usually has a pretty decent proc rate IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I also suspect that chanters get used to grouping with shaman who have malo/malos and do their own MR debuffing, so they get out of the habit of feeling like tash is an automatic responsibility.  They may be focused on mezz and nuke, and want to avoid the agro of tash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was wondering if anyone has ever compiled a list of what is expected of a given class.<br />
This is what I consider the minimum I should expect out of any other class on a standard &quot;grab-some-buddies-and-kill-stuff&quot; group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bard - Be able to twist 3 songs.  Know when resists are needed.  Over-cap haste. Regen between pulls. Immediate crowd control.  Slow if no chanter/shaman/beastlord.<br />
<br />
Beastlord - Pets and DPS. Keep his own warder under control, healed and buffed as needed. Spiritual Radiance for anyone with a mana bar. Melee when he can but if he has to med a fight or two that's fine. Slow if no shaman/chanter.<br />
<br />
Bezerker - we shall see.  I'm guessing DPS similar to a ranger; either mele or ranged.  Not a tank but can take a hit or two.<br />
<br />
Cleric - HP buffs. Heals, res. Ocassional paci for pulls. Stuns for mobs that gate or cheal.<br />
<br />
Druid - Damage shields. Snares. Dots and nukes. Cabbage. Be able (and willing) to hold primary healer role. Evacs and ports.<br />
<br />
Enchanter - Mez, haste, slow if no shaman, and crack.<br />
  <br />
Mage - DPS. Damage shields. Pet toys. Arrows.<br />
<br />
Monk - DPS.  Know how to FD pull.  Be able to dump aggro.<br />
<br />
Necro - Subversion. Dots. Pets for damage.  Mez.<br />
<br />
Paladin - Brell's.  Stun casters, especially healers and gaters. Hold aggro and tank.  Know how to paci-pull.  Emergency heals.<br />
<br />
Ranger - Predator. DPS either ranged, melee or spells.  Be able to identify named mobs in his tracking window. Snare running mobs. Aggro control.<br />
<br />
Rogue - DPS.  Pick locks.  Scout.  Drag corpses.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knight - Hold aggro. Damage. Snare. At least know how to FD pull.<br />
<br />
Shaman - Slow. Focus. Haste if no chanter. Be able to hold primary healer role for short periods.<br />
 <br />
Warrior - Hold aggro.  Know and use disciplines and new melee skills. <br />
<br />
Wizard - Nukes including mana management so they have the mana to burn something down when needed.  (Nothing like waiting for the big guns to reload because they pissed it all away on yard trash).  Evac. Ports.<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Note that the only debuffing listed is slows.  Mages will usually malise (unless they ask the shaman to malise) because it helps thier spells to land.  Enchanters will usually tash a hard target if you ask them.  Asking them to tash every mob is a little overboard. You might as well ask them to find a higher level shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I expect bards to know how haste stacks.<br />
<br />
I expect that casters with beneficial group spells to keep them timed and up.<br />
<br />
I expect all melees and hybrids know how to get aggro and off tank quickly.<br />
<br />
I expect everyone to be able to speak english.<br />
<br />
I expect everyone to use helpful macros when they are really needed for stuff like off tanking, root parking, multiple slow bounces etc (unless your group can just flow).<br />
<br />
I expect people to know how to be able to manage aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
that about covers it. Why I'm still searching for these smooth fun groups of people in BoT pickups is borderline insanity.<br />
<br />
edit: great thread idea Yedak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I keep Focus, Boar and PE up on all group members...that only takes a minute.  Melee get FA instead of PE, that takes a bit more time, but still not much.<br />
<br />
I Slow every pull.  Sometimes I Malos every pull also, depends on what I'm asked to do.  If I don't need to help heals, I'll Malos as it comes in and follow that up with Slow.  Helps minimize my Slow resists and increases caster DPS.  The additional mana cost is negligible, I haven't had OOM issues in many months.<br />
<br />
I sic my pet on the MA's target.  Pet is alpha'd with walnans/ixiblats and  haste mask, hasted, focused and usually FA'd.<br />
<br />
I nuke and/or dot as time permits.  If mobs are dieing quickly I just cast Spear of Torment a couple times.  If they last longer I'll use Bane and/or Tears.<br />
<br />
In between I cast Q and Canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bearchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From a lowly 33rd LVL Shammie...<br />
<br />
First thing I always do when grouping with people I am unfamiliar with is ask what they expect of me.  Am I the primary/secondary healer, do they want me to slow, malos etc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I have only been playing this game for a few months (yes im the proverbial noob) but the biggest thing I found for a successful group is Communication. If ya dont talk about what each person's task/job/assignment is then it's going to go south quicker than you can say ZONE!! Like I said I'm a noob and you all know this is the key..hehe<br />
<br />
Maybe I am just lucky but for the most part most of the groups I have attached myself to have been great at working together. Well there was that one LDON adventure where I was main healer, but thats a different story  :mad: hehehe.<br />
<br />
So whats my two cents. Talk it out before you go off chopping off heads. It usually works. Sadly though some people in EQ think they know everything and are above listening to other,  but well  :p there are ways of dealing with them...<br />
<br />
Player: I need a heal....<br />
<br />
Shammie: Inc heal on so and so..<br />
<br />
Player: DAMMIT IM GONNA DIE...<br />
<br />
[Casts levitate]<br />
<br />
Shammie: Did you say you want me to fly...<br />
<br />
Player: Can someone rez me...<br />
<br />
Shammie: Sorry man my spell fizzled.</div></div><hr />
