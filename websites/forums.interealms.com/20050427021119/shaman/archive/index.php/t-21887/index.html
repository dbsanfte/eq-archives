<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was a doozy to say the least.    I had been at the first ship, and it was too easy for my 53 monly and my 53 shammy.   I found I had alot of time to sit after the dock and the boat had been empty.<br />
<br />
SO  I made a point to go for a different ship,  I was told by a few people to try ship 2, but there were people at ship number 2 and 3.   I wasnt about to go back to ship number 1, I wanted more exp then it ws giving.  I asking in OOC if ship number 4, the Oceancrusher could be done by a 53 shammy and monk,  they said....... possibly.  <br />
<br />
I was determined to do it with success, but the method I got on the ship was nearly suicidal.  I attempted to invise, both char,  run onto the ship,  find a safe spot to get my shammies pet out and buffed and start my attack.  Heck why not.. It worked for the first ship right?<br />
<br />
Well HELL broke loose once my shammies invise went down to cast a pet.   The first 2 mobs aggroed from the middle of the ship,  I thought NP,  I can slow them both , then cast the pet as the monk attacks them.  But wait,   I was getting double hit for 100's by one of the mobs, the 2nd one was hitting hard.  I knew my shammy could take some pounding, but I also knew that either i had to get a pet out or get some slows out QUICK.<br />
<br />
They kept dogging on my shammy and finaly my monk with her tranquil staff proced, turing one of the 2 mobs off of me,  then my monk turned on the 2nd mob.  My shammy still coudln't get a slow off, they were hitting hard and fast, bashing me left and right, till my monks weapon proced again.   <br />
<br />
At this point I had 2 choices.  Start slows or get a pet out.   My monk at this point was taking a beating,  I went with the pet, but if I had it to do all over, I would have slowed.   Anyway, the pet got out,  I gave the pet  HoI, and haste, and threw her into the fight.  I healed me monk who had already used 2 of her Discs and also her mend.  Her health wasnt looking good, and when this thought entered my mind, a 3rd mob aggroed.  &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
AAAAAUUUUUGGGHHHHHH,   WHY ME,  What kind of range do these things HAVE!?!?!?!   I healed my monk since now she was at 1 buble of health, and 2 mobs came to my already beaten and bashed health.  Atm I was 50%,   I knew thie wasn't going to end pretty, so I ran my monk to the other mobs and got agrro, and moved my shammy, alittle ways off, then a 4th mob agrroed.    THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ERROR on this ship,  I bet every space on that ship has a mob that can and will aggro to that space.   Anyway.  I got my monk to run away from my shammy and FD , then all the mobs ran to my shammy, I dissmounted my lizzy,   and high tailed it throught alot of mobs on the bridge.  Luckily my sow held and as I cleared the dock and got into the clearing,  the mobs seemed to loose interest in me and seemed to find another target to pick on.   YEP,  my trustly ole pet.    It at this point had been beaten to a bloody pulp. and had less then 2 bubbles of health.   After it died, I watched all the mobs as they went back to the spawn points.   They didnt chase my shammy again much to my surprise, and much to my advantage.  I sat my shammy down, and medded, and put regrowth on me, THANK GOD FOR THAT SPELL!!!   I noticed that my mend was up again on my monk after a small amout of time so I used it and made plan for escape.<br />
<br />
My  shammy now had a pet out, and buffed but no weapons yet.   My monk was 60% health, and I did the Run and scream shuffle combine with FD when I could and got my monk to my shammy in no time.<br />
<br />
When I had all healed, I took out the mobs near the bridge, taking there weapons for the pet,  and continued sending my monk further and further down the bridge pulling the mobs 1 at a time with great success, untill I got on the ship.   My monks FD did a good Mem blur, none of the mobs remembered me. But 2 mobs did aggro on me once I was on the ship again.   I pulled them to my shammy, and made the pet attack one of the mobs, and my monk taking the 2nd mob.    I slowed the pets mob first then my monks mob.,  it was all smooth from this point on.<br />
<br />
I never was able to clear the ship at all, even after 5 rotations,  I could only clear the dock ramp,  both ship stairs and the main  ship landing.   The higher landing I couldnt clear.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I thought I had bought it for a second, but now I thin I'll make the Oceancrusher my new spot for lvling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It sounds like you may have picked the wrong place to setup. My shaman soloed on the Oceancrasher fine when he was around that level, although I'd probably pick Lady Di or Dandulak if they are available.<br />
<br />
Run down the dock onto the ship and hang a right. Setup on the wall near the barrels/ballistae (I can't remember which it is on that ship) where nothing should agro on you. Just make sure the captain is not spawned, since I think he spawns near there. Summon pet and give it HoS (or hp buff and Str buff), Alacrity (or similar haste) and two weapons (Shivs are good for this). Make sure to keep HoS (or other hp buff), Sta buff, SoW (if you don't have Run3 AA) and Regrowth (or similar long term HoT) on yourself. <br />
<br />
Pull the mobs closest to you first. I usually start at the bow and work my way to the stern, using slow to pull. Use Turgurs if you don't have a spell haste item, otherwise Torgors is fine. If it is resisted, just sick dogdog on him, wait for him to establish agro and step back a bit. You should have more than enough hit points to handle this once or twice. When slow lands move back in to melee range and maneouvre yourself so you are opposite dogdog to maximise his DPS. Unless you have an uber weapon, do not turn on autoattack as you will lose the mana regen benefits of having a mount. After it is slowed, you should have few problems timing both an E-Both and an Envenomed Breath between swings. You'll need to reapply the DoTs once. If hit points are getting low, use Stoicism to heal yourself. Keep a root memmed because these guys run on low health. After it dies, Canni and Stoicism yourself back up and you are GTG again. If things do get out of hand, let dogdog be the speedbump and run for the Gunthak/Dulak zone line. It is a bit of a run but, with SoW or Run3 and 30%+ health, you should make it.<br />
<br />
I've soloed levels 51-52 and 6 AAs while I was in Dulak, mostly at the fence but often on the boats. Once I got the hang of the zone, the only time I ever got adds was when either I was trained or I screwed up. My gear was mostly bazaar level, although I did have a Fine Antique Ring (Mana Preservation II), the PoK Spell Haste II mask, Canni II and Stoicism. I also had 200 Defense from getting beaten up by Erandi Nataasu (the guy outside the entrance to the warrens in Paineel).<br />
<br />
This is a great zone for Shaman at that level. The loot is excellent, the XP even better now it is a hotspot and, with the recent addition of the PoK portal to Gunthak, there is no excuse for a shaman to not go there. If you have a mount, you can do fine with just self buffs. In your case, Sudancia, with the addition a monk you should be tearing this boat apart! Good luck although I don't think you'll need it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The more I have done this ship the more it seems good to fight your way on board and not try and invise-run to a good spot on the ship.   If you fight your way  onto the ship your chances are better to not get as many aggroing mobs.  Every time I tried to find a spot with invise without getting aggors I have failed on this ship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tekmojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First of all your first and largest mistake was not slowing...and getting dogdog out... those mobs not only hit hard, they hit fast, you need a good 1k+ ac on the shaman for break in cause no matter what there will be adds....   dogdog can barely hurt these guys so dont do that again...  Me (a 54 shaman, a 52 shadowknight, and a 57 mage got bored of that boat, and did the windscorn *hardest boat?*)  slow is the most important thing....shame on you for not knowing that<br />
<br />
*p.s*  i solo oceancrasher when my beastlord friend isnt on... but JBB is needed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whoops. I meant Venom of the Snake rather than Envenomed Breath in my post before.</div></div><hr />

I strongly agree with your point on slowing but disagree with your point on dogdog. Use your pet at this level! I think of dogdog as a mana-free DoT. You tank and sick dogdog on the mob to add DPS. The DPS isn't great but, assuming the pet is hasted, given two weapons and buffed, your level 49 pet can easily exceed a permenant E-Bolt on Dulak mobs. Having the pet out is also a great way of handling mobs that resist slow or keeping mobs entertained while you make a break for the zone line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tekmojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Granted I use a pet..but in that situation slow would have done more...<br />
<br />
slow &gt; pet<br />
<br />
<br />
with BA item im pretty sure ebolt would do more dps then pet....who dies in like 30 seconds of tanking those mobs unslowed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went onto Oceancrasher with some lower level guildies over the weekend. I was level 58 and they were 52 and 48, and found they drew a huge agro radius. Rather than setting up quietly and single pulling, I found it was an exercise in crowd control, root parking and off tanking. Nothing we couldn't handle with Virtue and Turgurs but a surprise nevertheless. <br />
<br />
If you are going there with lower level friends, I'd recommend clearing off the dock first and getting higher level characters to pull to there with low agro spells or, if high enough, proximity agro. Turgurs and/or Torgors work fine for this. When an area on the ship is cleared, move the party up to there. When mobs run, root them or tell the lower level characters NOT to follow it. Otherwise, you'll get more adds then a math test :-).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oceancrasher and Windscorn are the two toughest boats.  Oceancrasher mobs seem to have a HUGE aggro radius (bigger than Windscorn).<br />
<br />
For your level, Dando would be fine.  With the &quot;hotspot&quot; xp modifier, it wouldn't be worth it to handle the hassle of the last two boats at your level.<br />
<br />
another good option would be to go to the Lugguld caves.  Very good xp, and you'll pick up quite a few upper end gems (diamonds and BD's).</div></div><hr />

Where is this cave that you speak of?</div></div><hr />
