<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finadorfa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I found this forum from eqshaman.com and am looking for some advice. I have been playing EQ for about a week and my first character is Barbarian Shaman, currently at level 9.<br />
<br />
My concern is that when I made the character, I didn't know much about EQ and I fear that I didn't increase my wisdom stat at all. I now know from eqshaman that I should have used most of my points on wisdom to give me the most mana possible.<br />
<br />
My stats are something like this -<br />
<br />
Str - 107<br />
Sta - 102<br />
Dex - 95<br />
Agi - 92<br />
Wis - 80<br />
Int - 75<br />
Cha - 75<br />
<br />
Have I made a big error here, or can this be corrected at higher levels? What I mean is, do these stats go up as my character levels up or are they fixed? Can they only be increased by new equipment etc? Is there a way to improve my wisdom in the short term?<br />
<br />
Ok thanks for your help. I know that there are a lot of high level players on here, and I hope you can take the time to help out a complete inexperienced player who is totally new to EQ.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say go ahead and re-roll him. As you level you will understand that getting from level 1 to 9 is a easy stroll. You can get wis items as you progress but it is always easier to start off with the extra 20 some points in wisdom. Most other stats you will be able to self-buff but wisdom you have to buy/find stuff or pay for enchanter buffs to raise it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that I am going to have to agree with Largus.  Getting from level 1-9 is nothing compared to what you will be doing later.   If I recall correctly I used a guide that suggested putting most in wis and the remainder in sta (maybe 25wis and 5sta...cant really recall offhand tho).  Forget about any of the other stats in my opinion...Good luck on whatever you decide :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess it depends with how far you take the game.  In later levels you will get gear with stats so insanely high that you'll maxx out in almost every stat including wisdom anyway.  If you're being PLed, thats a few weeks, if your working through the levels that could be a year.  The only time your low wisdom is an issue would be in the 34-52 range IMHO.  At your level I'd consider rerolling, but I doubt it's critical if you don't.<br />
<br />
Some shaman on this board, including myself have done much less enlightened stuff with our points.  I didn't get any racial points for 36 levels due to a bug in the character creation screen.  When I clued in, I petitioned and got my points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First, welcome to the crucible  :D <br />
This is one of the best spots to learn about everything shaman.<br />
We do have trolls though so don't get discouraged if someone's a smartalek.<br />
<br />
Now, go read the Sticky (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13787) at the top of the forum. Pretty much everything you need to know is in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I mean is, do these stats go up as my character levels up or are they fixed?&quot;<br />
Your stats will fluxuate dependant upon your gear. They dont automatically increase with level (str, sta, wis, etc)<br />
<br />
Should you re-roll your shaman? <br />
Personally I'd say no probably not, but others might argue with that. It tends to all work out in the end, but your path to 65 may be a bit harder than someone who distributed their points differently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a way to improve my wisdom in the short term?&quot;<br />
Yes, get buffed by a enchanter. It's not a permenant fix though. You can also try to get +wis gear.<br />
At Your level you should be looking for +wis / +mana gear as well as AC. HP won't do you a lot of good till you reach canni level.<br />
<br />
Keep this in mind:<br />
A shaman is a completely different experience at various levels. Pre-24th, 24th-34th (or whatever level we get the pet), 34th to mid-50's, then 60+<br />
Cannibilize changes everything. So does the Pet. Mid-50's we start getting some really good group buffs, and then Torpor/Quiescence changes everything again.<br />
Shamans are VERY versitile, we can do just about anything in a group, depending on where you're at in your spell progression.<br />
Most shamans love their toons fiercly, and keep coming back to them when they try other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Finadorfa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok thanks a lot for the tips everyone.<br />
<br />
I really appreciate your help!<br />
<br />
I'll have to give it some serious thought and decide what to do.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Reroll.  Put your points into STA and WIS.  All other stats are irrelevant and unimportant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Finadorfa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can someone explain what Power-Levelling is?<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm really new to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Powerlevelling is when someone else, usually much higher level, helps you level up much faster than you normally would be able to.  It can involve buffing you, healing you, debuffing mobs, pulling things for you, etc.  The key ingredient is that they are doing things for you that that are far, far beyond what you would normally be able to do for yourself.<br />
<br />
As for stats, I can't remember what all I put mine into (looong time ago hehe) but I know I didn't put anything into wis.  With the chance to do it all over, I would probably focus on agility and stamina, in that order.  Shamans are relatively easy to play up until we get canni, and once we have canni mana is a lot less of a problem for us than for most other casters.  And wis is much, much easier for us to max than agi or sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Level 9?  Yeah, go ahead and reroll.  There's no real reason not to, it'll take you a couple hours.  Misallocating your starting points is pretty innocuous in the long-term but heck, level 9 will just zoom along.<br />
<br />
Putting money where my mouth is: What server are you on?  If you're on Bertoxx, I'll help you get back up to 9, shouldn't take more than 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The time taken to get to level 9 is small compared to getting a single level later on: so reroll now.<br />
<br />
Also have a good look at whether you might find a beastlord better than a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Finadorfa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hi Rorgg! I'm on Venril Sathir (English UK) Server unfortunately, otherwise I would have gladly accepted your offer.... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Also have a good look at whether you might find a beastlord better than a shaman.<br />
<br />
Heh, when I first saw the stats I thought those were pretty good stats for a BL. Yes, go for the re-roll. Drop all you have into the shared slots and when you make the new shaman you have ready gear and money. This way you will only have to work on saving for spells again and not worry about equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, I would say re-roll, and go 25 STA and 5 WIS. Unless the starting AGI for Barb Shaman is &lt;70 (Ala Dwarf Cleric and Erudite -) in which case 5 AGI, 25 STA.<br />
<br />
Look around this site. There is a slew of information. Be sure to check out Ugzug's alchemy guide. ( You may get the itch). Look at all the stickied info - they are stickied for a reason.<br />
<br />
Be safe, have fun, enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This exact same thing happened to me.  I was level 9 and realized that instead of putting 15 points in to int, I should have picked something else.  However, I said &quot;What?  I have to level 9 again?  F that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Learn from my mistake:  Reroll and spend the points right if you are only level 9.  Also consider going for a better race, like ogre.  Race (like the 25 wis difference) doesn't mean much at high levels, but if you're going to reroll you might as well go for the gold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I dunno about 25 sta/5 wis.  I'm 280 STA easy now self-buffed, but only 255 WIS.<br />
<br />
Though, granted, I'm an Ogre with 97 base wis.</div></div><hr />
