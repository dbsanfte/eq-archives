<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently lvl 40, got to the underwater part of the epic, (thaks Babazu for the loc) and i got to abe the abandoned in the epic, and died.  I got mauled to death by a killer shark...  I had invis to animals on, because many posts i have read said Invis to animals works.  I know that it is tecnically cheating, but i want to skip this part, because, i also died during first CR underwater too.  If there is another way to get around the killer sharks while still doing that quest part, great, but otherwise, how does faction have to be to turn in woe, envy and marrs promise? (have envy and marrs promise on alts, so i can turn in envy to check faction and always get another when camping woe)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">invis to animals worked for me...did this pretty early dont remember what lvl. one red killer pathed right through me (yikes!) but all went well...even went LD and when i got back there was the spirit, waiting to give me the gem.<br />
guess you COULD skip this part by doing the drunken shaman over &amp; over, if thats what ya gotta do more power to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Odaya -<br />
a technique that works well is to get to the loc (now that you know the correct one lol) and stay up top, levved.  You should hear the various spirits casting when they spawn.  Invis to Animals should help, but it is not a guarantee.  When I did this part, I had to run to shore and camp out to clear aggro from a killer shark - and scrolled back up to see that invis had dropped just before he attacked!<br />
<br />
I have not had much luck trying to look down between the waves, although I do get glimpses and believe the method works.  It does gie you something to do while you wait - patiently - for the spirit to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Noob question.  Doesn't normal invis work?  If so is that better than invis to animals?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Normal invis won't work, 'cause you can't speak with the spirit(s).  In previous threads on this subject (do a search?) I recounted how I did this around 40-ish using invis to animals and Flash of Light to blind the killer shark when he attacks..letting him flee and then re-ITA, he wont' re-aggro.<br />
<br />
Another alternative would be to ask a nice elder shammy to help out..we all had to do it...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">paineel fear neckalace works like a charm too =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks.  I new there was a reason but I forgot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks for the help, i appreciate it, I am going back as soon as i get my opaque gem again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This a part of the quest that I also do not look forward to. yeah it's early in the quest but I'm not good with using /loc and I have never once done anything underwater.<br />
<br />
I won't be rude and do the /who all shaman 55 60 thing and start sending tells begging for help but if you are a shaman that has done the quest on the Povar server and wouldn't mind helping me out with just this part please send me a tell in game. I'll drop whatever I'm doing and hook up with you.<br />
<br />
/tell Kinring or /tell Fenring the only toons I play at the moment.<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bleh.  I'm sorry this happened to you, You are the first person I've heard having problems with this since they changed the Killer Sharks to 'animal' type (they weren't for the longest time).  I hope this doesn't mean that they got changed back in one of the many patches.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could try staying above the water, I never could do that (too big I suppose, I keep sinking).  I would suggest taking along a friend.  I took a 51 necro for two reasons 1) somebody to talk to while I was waiting, and 2) somebody to keep an eye out for the sharks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rebul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just attempted this a couple hours ago, right after abe swims away, iva drops and i get mauled by a killer shark, caught me off gaurd.  my question is, does this affect the faction in anyway? since i have to turn in another opaque gem to ooglyn and do the drunken shaman part again..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">did the same..friend told me not to sit..seemed to work then..anyway..have lev going..get attack..surface and run from shark..might have to restart epic..but better than deing and cr<br />
<br />
(DO NOT SIT)they see sitting ppl for some reason</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>rebul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">for some reason, lev must not like me, i cast it and i just start sinking when im surfaced. it's also pretty hard to run from the shark heh cuz underwater i have no idea where land is and it hit me way too fast to even think of which way to start running..=\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sarekren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yep, I tried this step today too and got whooped by the killer as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">use sense heading and loc's to know which way to run.  also use straffe when above the water with lev, ie push forward  and (right or left dir key), and right click.<br />
I had a friend use the looking at the water right at surface and he can see the whole area around you.  the person looking needs to have lev and he can float at the sweet spot to see the whole area.<br />
if nothing else have someone who can fd with you and should any sharks get close have them train them away and fd.<br />
or u could just get your faction up and skip that part.  :)<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When I did this part of the quest I had invis to animals on and I didnt get attacked and the spirits talked to me.<br />
<br />
VI probably screwed up a patch somehwere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">when i did the test (at level 39) i kept IvA up but it was actually pretty pointless as i did not see a single killer shark the whole time... one regular green shark and a pirhana were the only critters that pathed within sight of me.<br />
<br />
i'd say just try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Balthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did this part of the quest at around 30-33 (cant remember which, was before i got my pet) and had no problem whatsoever with killer sharks attacking.  just kept EB and IVA up when they started fading, if i thought a shark was too close, i'd swim away a bit to recast IVA.  As snapdragn has stated, it may have been before killers were considered animals.</div></div><hr />
