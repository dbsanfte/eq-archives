One intended effect of the 7/15 patch (v1.0) is that INT casters have had their research rolled back to 200.<br />
<br />
Now I know what you're saying, &quot;People already  have the spells that you can research,&quot; &quot;So what,&quot; &quot;It was expected.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, the raising of that skill to 250 did not come free. AAMOF it cost 4,910 pp with max CHA. Again, that may be chump change to a lot of you but it is not to me.  So while I DID get my 50 training points back (whoo-hoo back to 124 with NOTHING and I mean NOTHING to spend them on) I am still out the platz.<br />
<br />
Again, this was a bug of SONY'S making.  I didn't use a 3rd party program or hack something to raise my skill.  Furthermore it's not like smithing where you can make serious bank with a TS of 250 (as opposed to 200), Research is more of a pride thing.<br />
<br />
Additionally, Research is a skill designed to HELP OTHERS.  The Research =&gt; spell was designed in part (later on) to help people who were having trouble obtaining their spells. (Malo, Pox, Torpor, Bane come to mind)<br />
<br />
It's just proof positive of many things that is wrong with the Sony mindset despite their &quot; forums,&quot; &quot;summits,&quot; &quot;Class representatives,&quot; et al.<br />
<br />

I missed the memo regarding this issue.<br />
<br />
To be more blunt, how do we know its a bug, unless it is spelled out for us to read by the powers that be?<br />
<br />
ie:  It is unintentional to have the research skill progress past 200, do so with the knowledge this very well could be changed in the future, and any skill over 200 could be lost.<br />
<br />
Was this announcement made, and I just missed it or something??</div></div><hr />

 You knew it was a bug...you skilled up anyway. Now you are upset that they fixed it?<br />
<br />
To add to what Ronax said - if it was a bug - why was I reimbursed my training points?<br />
<br />
To clarify, if it was a bug and I exploited it - then why was I reimbursed 50 training points instead of losing them and getting a dock of some kind on my account?<br />
<br />
Or if it was a bug on Sony's part - why was I reimbursed said training points, but not my platinum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think it would be very hard for them to reimburse your platinum, as they won't know how much you paid per point (it varies with CHA doesn't it?). That said, if they reimbursed training points, how do they know how much of that skill came from combine skill-ups? Do they actually know, or do they just assume all your post-200 research skill points came from a guild trainer?<br />
<br />
It annoys me that there's quite a few significant changes they didn't mention at all in these patch messages.</div></div><hr />

Just read this on the runes. I guess you can get research skill up to 250 now. Been wondering if its for oow expansion to make some of the new spells obtainable by non ubers? <br />
/Cry I recently blew all my extra training points on languages and 1 hand blunt after I got the fabled spider leg thingy. I'm glad to see it anyway, does this mean the 1750 club will be the 1800 club now? <br />

My understanding is that this is a bug.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was quoted from another message board (prolly eqtraders which is blocked at work for me).  So, they did say something~<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: as for not soulmarking your account and giving back your training points...  It was a bug that SoE was aware of and put in by mistake.  It was not a straight exploit.  It would be pretty silly of them to further alienate your customer base my soulmarking them for an error that was their fault, don't you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, there it is.  Back in March it was called a bug by absor.  The Newbie Zone (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;message.id=90550) <br />
<br />
How many people read the Newbie Zone at the sony website?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All I know is, I don't tradeskill so I don't frequent those boards.  I don't ever read the sony forums so I didn't see it there.  And still, I knew it was happening and a bug.  Now, that doesn't mean everyone should know...it is impossible to tell everyone about everything.  But, the fact still remains the information was out there.  Moreover, when suddenly something is working differently or more effectivly than it did before...I make sure it isnt a bug.  I don't want to waste pp on a bug as I am sure none of you do either.  In an instance like this the word BUG should have been screaming in your head.  Sorry, it was obvious, addressed and fixed.<br />
<br />
edit: spelling &gt; me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There should be a better way to convey some types of bugs other than stumbling across it on a board that not many check.  Even reading that post by absor it really isn't apparent what he is calling a bug.  Is it the fact that you can go over 200, or the fact that you can train it at a guild master?<br />
<br />
I don't know a better way, perhaps  if they maintained a list of bugs like this or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't be stupid how the hell did you find out about raising it past 200? most likely not a lucky skillup on a non trivial combine. Every one of those posts mentioned nerfage and you tried to take advantage of them not retro nerfing.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;bug&quot; went live June 16.<br />
Absor's comment is June 25 (not March) and appears to be the first unofficial comment.<br />
To my knowledge there has not been any official comment about it at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">205 Alchemy skill -- Today it's still listed as 205 in my skills window and at the guild trainer, but only shows 200 in the alchemy bag tradeskill interface.<br />
<br />
I guess they re-capped it but didn't reset our skill level? I sure wish they'd tell us what's going on in the patch messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For those who 'dont read &lt; Site X &gt;', it was mentioned here on July 2 in the thread discussing alchemy going over 200.<br />
