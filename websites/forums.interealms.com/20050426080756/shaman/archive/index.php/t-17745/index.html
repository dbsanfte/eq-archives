<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shinianad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">None ever mentions this zone. Anyone hunt here?<br />
<br />
I started a necro and levelled him from 4 to 9 just at the entrance..<br />
<br />
I'm going to bring my level 16 Frog Shammy here too. <br />
<br />
Not hard to get there. Take the POK book to Paineel. Wander in past the skelly guards. They ignored my level 4 goodie (not the necro) so should be fine.<br />
<br />
Now walk around the corner to your left.. watch the Hole!.. and head in. Run pas the guards quickly.. also didnt have problems with these.. theyt dont even help Paineel residents! Just invis if you are not comfortable with them.<br />
<br />
If you run across the newbie zone slightly to your right you will see the entrance to the Warrens. There is sometimes a Necro here so watch out if you are a goodie..<br />
<br />
Keep left and enter the tunnel to the Warrens. <br />
<br />
Only problem is LOTS of adds. Probably better if you can get a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just invis if you are not comfortable with them.<br />
Most folks at level 4 can't invis...<br />
<br />
The two guards in Paineel are KOS to start to goodies, but killing enough in the Warrens will get you faction with them.  They're also only level 12.<br />
<br />
This is where I've brought my last five alts... Warrens to ten or twelve depending on class, then Najena or Paludal, again depending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, those &quot;level 12&quot; guards also hit in the 80s and are horribly underconned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shinianad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Funny.. I've brought several low level goodies past the skeleton guards in the paineel newbie zone and they ignored me every time..<br />
<br />
Invis is level 4 for most INT casters IIRC.. could be wrong..</div></div><hr />

Only enchanters get Invis at level 4.  Magicians get it at level 8, wizards at 16 and necros get Gather Shadows (instead of Invis) at level 8.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there you go, I was wrong. Thanks for the correction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think he's talking about the guards at the entrance to the newbie area rather than the guards at the Tox entrance to Paineel. The &quot;guards&quot; at the Tox entrance aren't guards at all but miners. They are indiff to pretty much everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I only ever brought snaring alts to Warrens.  They ALL run, and they run FAST.  You can camp at the Stonebrunt zoneline up into the mid-teens I think.  It's good newbie cash (used to be anyway), fast exp, good faction - hard to wish for more.  Oh, and beating up on kobolds is just more satisfying than skeletons in Kurn's or anything else in comparable-level dungeons. *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Warrens is a great place to level 5-20ish.  You do have to be careful with runners, but if you are a snarer it's easily solved, and even rooting can handle most of the problems.  A more practical solution may be just to go tag a 2d or 3d mob; they don't run when there's a group of them.  There's a saferoom that's good to pull to across the bridge from the Prince's room.  Loot, xp, faction, and fun.  It's a great zone for that level.  Interesting drops from the Muglwump too.</div></div><hr />

No, I mean the guards in the newbie zone across from the Warrens/Hole entrance. They have never bothered me. (shrug)</div></div><hr />

Hmm. I tried taking a level 14 wood elf warrior past them once trying to get to the Warrens, and they smacked the crap outta me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think they only attack if you get close to them.<br />
<br />
If you run through the in the middle they dont attack, but if you run past one fairly close they'll attack.. I've run past them many times, trust me you can run past them ok if you run in the middle. just don't get too close.</div></div><hr />
