<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that it's been about 2 days, and the shock of the server merge news has started to wear off, how is your server taking the news?<br />
<br />
Mith Marr and Saryrn, for the 1st 24 hours, were at each others throats.  But most agruements consisted of &quot;Your mom's fat, but I still did her last night&quot; lines.   Now the animostity has worn off and they are now comparing who's got the bigger asshats.  (No pronounced winners yet)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, the &quot;server boards&quot; are not always an adequate picture of the server in general, just usually a fairly vocal segment.<br />
<br />
Are your general server boards amiable, hostile, indifferent?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like no one really cares either way on quellious, at least the flame boards arent stuffed full of mindless and incoherent ramblings of &quot;screw you guys my e-penis is way bigger than any your server has&quot; type stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My current server's not merging with anyone.  I was hoping for a free transfer back to Povar.  I guess I'll just have to stick with Stromm for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bert and Karana seem to be getting along just dandy. We have had combo-channels to &quot;meet and greet&quot; every night. Many karana members have come to the Bert boards (linked in my sig) and vice-versa. <br />
<br />
I think a lot of the reason this seems positive is that Karana seems heavier in the aisian-euro time zones, and Bert is mostly a US based server. This creates a situation where the ACTUAL competition for mobs and events wont be as huge. I feel sorry for the servers who have 4-5 active Time raiding guilds, and are adding 4-5 more. Currently, it looks like Karana and Bertoxx are gonna fit together like peas and carrots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/wave Blazz<br />
<br />
Agreed, seems to be a pretty good rapore building between the Bert/Karana folks, and should be a fairly seemless fit....<br />
<br />
There's always gunna be that reluctant and vocal minority that make it sound like the sky is falling, but given time I think it will all smooth over, even for those servers who aren't coping well with the change at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rathe and Tholuxe is a battle of Rotations vs. FFA.<br />
As it looks right now, FFA has won.<br />
That's going to be a culture shock for us, and the flame board lit up like a christmas tree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bertoxx and Karana would go together like peas and carrots, except I seriously hate peas. Nasty, mushy little green things. Blech! Choose new vegetables!<br />
<br />
On every server, there are the &quot;get the hell off our server&quot; idiots, and the &quot;this is our sandbox, our rules&quot; idiots. To them I say ... scooch over in the sandbox, there's a new kid in town. Might's well make the best of it! Plenty of sand and toys to go around. /metaphor off<br />
<br />
It's honestly a really great opportunity -- especially for the smaller, &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; guilds. Maybe some new mergers and alliances can be formed, and maybe those guilds can get together and see content they wouldn't otherwise have been able to see. The meet-and-greet cross-server channels have been really great as far as I'm concerned. The Bertoxx folks I've talked to have been really welcoming and seem excited about the influx of new people. <br />
<br />
I'm getting excited about it myself. Time for some new faces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Saryrn is just having to listen to Mith Marr whine about looseing their server name and about how much more of a raid oriented server Saryrn is.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, no server merge flames can match whats happening on The Rathe.  For those who dont know, every mob on The Rathe is on a forced rotation thanks to the Rathe Travel Agency.  From what I've read, the heads of the RTA treat the Rathe server as their own fiefdom.  There are no open raids, there are strick rules for raid mobs about who can participate.  And now Rathe is mergeing w/ TP, a server where guilds will take the RTA and **** all over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">every mob on The Rathe is on a forced rotation thanks to the Rathe Travel Agency.<br />
This is incorrect.  For a list of rotation mobs, check http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/rotations.asp<br />
The only real rule for rotation raids is that you have to do the first kill with only your guild and apps.  After that, whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am from the Rathe. The RTA will not last at all when we merge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We thought that since we were one of the older servers we'd actually have someone merged into us and we'd keep the server name.<br />
<br />
but then again i guess Karana was just too tasty and nasty lil Bert just had to go eat some of her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like they trimmed some Kunark dragons in the past few months.  <br />
<br />
The main problem w/ rotation rules it kills any public raiding.  Additionally, this type of rotation is tantamount to government regulation in that its proping up guilds who cant really progress while hamstringing guilds who are ready to progress at a rapid rate.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Let me be the first to tell you that every person on Veeshan hates you and every Luclin *** with a passion that burns like the flames of hell.

<br />
/shrug, won't affect me. I have /shownames 1, which is JUST first name (no last names, no titles, no guildnames), and I only turn that on during non-raid hours (I know my guildmates by their armor).<br />
<br />
Personally, I have a crazy idea, thats going to be TOTALLY unpopular with half the people, and TOTALLY supported by the other half.<br />
<br />
New names for all servers. Bertoxx and Karana become Koa'Taz. Veeshen and Luclin become Riwwii. Xev and Whoever become Proving Grounds. <br />
<br />
EVERYONE loses their &quot;server identity&quot;, and we all start with a fresh, new name to call our homes. Heh, kinda off the wall eh, especially since my server is keeping the name I have known it as all these years.<br />
<br />
Heres a quote from Brenlo I got off my server boards, pretty damn solid post, actuually:<br />
Originally posted by Brenlo <br />
So there is one hot topic out there in the community today and it's not &quot;Is Brenlo feeling better&quot;  (I am thanks for asking). <br />
 <br />
Server Merges.<br />
 <br />
While I would say that I am shocked at some of the reaction to this announcement but you folks rarely shock me anymore.  I guess befuddled would be a better word.  One of our board posters expressed it well when he stated that in engineering they had a term for this, NIMBY (Not in my back yard) which seems to be the case.  Folks wanted merges, couldn't find groups, guilds were falling apart and the only way to save EQ, according to the many posters on this topic, was to merge servers NOW!  Well we watched and waited and decided that this was the time, some 4 months later and now the reaction is &quot;HEY!  No one wanted this&quot; which is far from true.  You may not have wanted it but many did.  Many on this forum and in emails, petitions etc . . . wanted servers merged.  I kind of liken this to a home that the owner claims is on fire.  He has called and called and called the fire department to put the fire out and when they arrived and whipped out the fire hoses, he is upset that they are spraying water on his furniture.  (Yes I know this analogy can be torn apart just as any other but the analogy is not the point). <br />
 <br />
Server merges are necessary for the health of the game overall.  They are inevitable my friends.  They are going to happen.  Our goal is to make sure everyone has a healthy server population to play with.  A good solid community to interact with.  Some servers were doing okay and to those servers we are adding the smallest influx of people from servers that were not okay.  Some servers were sort of inbetween and those servers we are putting together to bolster the community, add new guilds and more importantly potential new guild members.  More people to group with, more people to buy and sell, more people to tradeskill all of which you have been telling us you wanted and needed and we agree, it is needed.<br />
 <br />
So now I will talk a little about legacy and heritage, which is the other argument that keeps popping up.  The legacy and heritage of EQ are not on some hardware that happened to have a name to make it easier to choose when logging in.  The servers could just as easily been numbered.  They are just hardware.  The legacy and the heritage of EQ resides in you and in me, in our guilds and groups and friends, no matter which box we log into.  The server name of Veeshan going away does not take away that FOH was the first guild to conquer Naggy and Vox, it does not diminish what Cestus Dei recently accomplished.  Those live on in each of us.  Those stories will continue as long as EQ is around and even longer, as long as we continue to tell them.  FOH could have been on any server and they would have still taken down those dragons and many other mobs first.  It was not the server, it was and is the people.  It is all of us that make the EQ community and not the hardware that hosts it. <br />
 <br />
Yes, I do agree that this can be upsetting.  The server I was first a GM on, Innoruuk, is going away.  The server I first played on, Veeshan, is going away but my characters, my friends and my stories are still here.  No matter which server I log onto tomorrow.  The same is true for you my friends.  The same is true for you.<br />
 <br />
I am off to get some coffee now.  Have a good day.<br />

<br />
P.S. My latest theory is that the way SOE decided which server names will go and which ones will stay was by looking for shorter and easier to remember names. The hardware theory is not credible unless SOE developers are unbelievably inept.</div></div><hr />

But Germany and Austria DID merge.  Germany kept its name and everyone in Austria welcomed it because they all loved Hitler...</div></div><hr />

oh yeah, that's like claiming all americans love pres. bush (btw, i am NOT comparing bush and hitler, would never do that, but claiming that ALL austrian's loved hitler or even stood behind his &quot;ideals&quot; is kinda ... screwed?).<br />

<br />
Well, it was a joke by the looks of it, but many Austrians did want to unite with Germany in the aftermath of WWI for various complicated political and economic reasons. Britain and France wouldn't let them, though, for reasons of their own.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was using Austria and Germany as just one example of two societies where the language barrier is minimal, but the cultural divide is significant. Their attachment to the name, which stands for shared history, is quite real. You could use Oz/NZ or US/UK instead, if you prefer.</div></div><hr />

My biggest concern, back before GoD came out, I was in the more hardcore guilds.  We had 9 guilds in EP/Time, and it was virtually impossible to get targets then.  With the level of guilds already exsisting on Saryrn, add in MMs.... nothing will ever be available.  And my current more casual guild is in EPs, I dont even want to imagine what it will be like for those doing GoD, OoW+ stuff.  Inny have mercy of the poor bastages.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, that guild has now movelogged to another server, that guild leader had to be one of the most prize retards I have ever met in EQ to make his first !! post on his new server board that.<br />
<br />
He even had the cheek to complain about the hostility he received in game later on :)<br />
<br />
If you ignore the USA bashing that goes on in there, (most server boards have their extremists) can you imagine what the reaction would be on a USA based server board if a Euro guild movelogged in and started with that post (substitute Eurotrash for &quot;American trailerpark trash&quot; to get an idea) :)<br />
<br />
The good thing, Evolutia have left AB - the bad thing, they may be moving to YOUR server :) :) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">i am sure every single server has its own set of completel retards that only play that game (or played) for flaming around on the boards. best bet is just to ignore them, every server has its own set of kickass players as well, and those are certainly way way more than the first group :)<br />
<br />
heck, i even had some very very nice guys from the tribunal come to my guild's board and we are fooling around already :) that merge will be fun, whatever some idiots say on the open server boards (and there are some threads about that already on the boards :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Vazaelle is...not happy.<br />
<br />
Our major hangup isn't being merged with MS, it's losing our server name to a much younger server.<br />
<br />
The main issue most of us have is the idea that the &quot;larger server population&quot; concept is being used to cheat us out of our name.  Quite a few people, myself included, believe that the zillion free 1-month subscriptions is the direct reason that MS was tagged as the more crowded server.<br />
<br />
We believe we have the larger actual userbase of consistent players, yet we're losing our name to a horde of free subscriptions.<br />
<br />
Many also don't like the idea of merging with a green server, but this doesn't really bother me.  Actually, I'm looking forward to the idea of being able to actually group with my mid-level alts.  Vazaelle's age means that 95% of the people under level 50 are simply twinks, and they're not grouping, they're being PL'd.  Getting a group at lower levels on Vazaelle can be tough.<br />
<br />
But it still should not cost my server its name.<br />
<br />
Most servers will probably peacably merge and be all fine and well, but don't expect to see that on the &quot;new&quot; MS/Vazaelle.  There will be ugliness, I guarantee it.  The top guilds on Vazaelle are openly contemplating warfare over the loss of our server name.  I honestly expect to see quite a bit of downright meanness.</div></div><hr />
