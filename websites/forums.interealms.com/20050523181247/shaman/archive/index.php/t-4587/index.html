CH Test - Shaman  Detail | History  <br />

08-13 00:05 Initial Entry <br />
<br />
<br />
Opinions?  I'm all for adding new elements to the class, but this seem to be a tad much, even if only 75% of max.  Druids have a similar spell on test as well.  I think this drifts dangerously close to the cleric's realm of power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think naming it complete heal is a very good idea. If you look closely it's capped to 1950 at level 54. At those sort of levels lots of classes are routinely breaking 4k+ hits, so it's still quite inferior to a cleric complete heal. Indeed I suspect the percentage health entry is a limit rather than a bonus in most cases.<br />
<br />
Still, it marks a substantial jump in the ability of a shaman to heal in an XP group and I would hope that clerics would also be getting something in return.<br />
<br />
Interestingly it would also seem to make Torpor a bit less vital. Sure Torpor is much better for soloing, but it would mean a non-Torpor shaman could still be a solid healer in an xp group.<br />
<br />
I will be extremely interested to she the clerics take on this though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And it's level 54?  with that in play, the only person we'd ever Torpor is ourselves after Can V</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With that spell, why would I ever cast Torpor again?<br />
I'm sure there will be times I'd rather use torpor than that cheal, but why bother.  Instant heal vs heal over time?  Instant wins.  And the mana efficiency of each is almost the same, unless you have the AA points into extended buffs.  And, you can use this spell 6 full levels before torpor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Torpor heals more efficiently. Torpor doesn't take 10 seconds to cast. They balance out quite nicely.<br />
<br />
It might be that this is how they respond to the issue of Torpor being a &quot;neccessity&quot; for a shaman. Make it so that the spell still has a use but isn't so obviously superior to all other possibilities.<br />
<br />
Good change, I really hope they do this. This will mean that spot healing will be a lot more viable on raids. And suddenly having multiple shaman's and druids is a good thing, especially cause the clerics are all in the CH chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">CH Test - Shaman:<br />

At least we could heal people outside our party now, and on raids the tanks would rather expect the Druids to heal them then us :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm Verant is trying too plz everyone and in the end we dont have different classes, since too many people wants the ability to do everything.<br />
<br />
Why do we really need a healing spell that heal 1950hp at lvl 54? In the group(not raid) we dont need the cleric anymore. How fun is that for the cleric?<br />
<br />
I belive classes should be distinct from eachother and our strength should be different.<br />
<br />
Anytime now Verent is going to give us double attack and dual wield in our normal condition just to plz the Shamans, after that? well since people wants everything, we will have rezz 99%, Port, evac, succor and CoH. Mana free lure nukes that does a zillion of dmg and so on and so on.<br />
<br />
Dont give us a stronger heal. Give us bettter buffs, and more versitile slow and stronger DoTs. Make the shaman more shaman not more Cleric or more fighter!<br />

If they want to do anything make our smaller heals more mana efficient and faster casting. Give us a special heal niche. Fast, small heals, enough to save a life but not enough to be part of the melee healing cycle. Upgrade to regrowth and what I would like is longer lasting regens, I'll pay the mana cost.<br />

<br />
I didn't make my shaman to be the big healer in groups, this is just a little bit to cleric-like...If they give this to the druids, well i dont care, i'm not a druid let the druids and clerics battle it out.<br />
<br />
This is just a little over the top.  For a new shaman heal (if we even need one), why not a mini-torpor, at 49?  Like 175mana for 800hp with big slow and snare effect.  Remove the group only restrictions on torpor.  Something like that would be neat...  This is just a little over the top...<br />
<br />
Maybe i'm alone here, but i dont want healing to ever be my main spell that i'm casting, to be my main job.<br />
<br />
Kinda hope they do give this to druids though...would shut them up forever....heh...<br />
<br />
For my shaman, the thing i'd like to see most is dots have their resistability checked a bit :P</div></div><hr />

Another thing they ought to consider is another self bind point. I know you can get gate hammer, spiritstones and potions but with 4 separate areas now at least let us bind in 2. I'd even settle for a self-port home for all classes, not usable in battle to put you back in your starting city.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I personally think this is a bad idea....why they hell would you want to get a cleric in an xp group if a druid can heal almost 3k hp?  <br />
<br />
Am also kinda curious as to why druids suddenly get to be able to heal 50% more than us, but there ya go.<br />
<br />
Edit: I also think that 54 is a tad too early for this - it should realistically be 58+ (although I would rather 60)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think the shaman numbers, allowing for a 2K heal, are reasonably balanced. However if it is balanced I have no idea what to make of the druid 3K heal. Nor am I sure why they gain a further increase in healing over shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Mixed feelings about this.<br />
<br />
It's always nice to get something new, but like a lot of people I don't think of my shaman primarily as a healer.<br />
<br />
I agree with what Armak says - Verant seem to be diluting the difference between classes too much. Mind you I'm sure I remember an interview with Brad where he said he thought it was a mistake to have so many different classes - maybe the current designers agree and that's why everyone is getting overlapping abilities.<br />
<br />
Still - I'm certainly not going to complain if this goes live - my guild currently has ONE cleric capable of casting CH, and 3 or 4 50+ shamans.<br />
<br />
About torpor - Juujuu said the instant heal beats heal over time. Well, I don't have torpor but I always got the idea that a nice way to use it was to cast it before taking damage, so the heal was already happening as you got beat up, or cast canni 5, or whatever. Certainly this spell would make torpor less essential, but I still see it having its uses. It might cease to be the make or break spell that it is now though.<br />
<br />
And a final thought - the naming of the new spell suggests it won't be affected by casting haste items or AA - so even though you can get a 3 second torpor, this so called &quot;CH&quot; will always be 10 secs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">complete heal made the game what it is today.  High end encounters are completely dominated by the warrior cleric complete heal chain.   Verant has said in the past this is not what they intended.<br />
 <br />
so lets add it again for more classes!<br />
<br />
Clerics are clerics because they have massive heals.  I am so tired of the blurring of the class lines.  I hope that it is as it says, a test spell that wont go live.  Not that there is a part of me that doesn't want more better healing.. because I do.  I play the only main, active, non 2box *priest* in my regular group/guild.  No main clerics or druids that play often.  I do a lot of healing. But giving out cheal/ massive heal spells to other class is bad for the already poorly balanced game, imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
anyways-  We can almost heal for that much now, if you tried hard enough.<br />
<br />
Superior Healing = 583 hp healed<br />
add in 10% for healing adept and 15% for healing focus 3 item, throw in crits and you got crit heals for nearly 1500 as of now.  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just been to EQ Clerics to see their reaction: it was pretty balanced, with a lot of them hoping this means their class will get some nice stuff to compensate, and thereby make them a more fun class to play.<br />
<br />
Apparently some druids (according to EQ Clerics) are complaining it doesn't heal enough, and is too slow.  Actually they do have a point: how many tanks would like to rely on a druid timing a 10 second heal correctly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Another random thought:<br />
<br />
A 2k heal isn't enough to get you put into the CH chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think we should get a 600 hp 100 mana torpor at 49 insted of that spell whould be better good down time healer for groups and a good solo spell before you get torpor. And give us big heal that is not so mana effective like 1500 hp for 750 mana or somthing like that casts fast with a long recast.  Still problem is that almost eavry class can be replacet with a other class in a group enchater can be replacet with a bard and so on still nothing can replace a cleric if you nead big heals.<br />
<br />
Galdir 54 shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Interesting, seems VI are plowing on with priest balancing. I hope that if this does go live, or a version of it, that clerics get some nice upgrades to accompany it.<br />
<br />
1950 hp isnt a CH for me unbuffed, isnt even half HP raid buffed, its only just beyond what Torpor with SCR1 does and its double the mana and a big cast time, I know what I would be casting on myself.<br />
<br />
The only major problem I have with it is I have no clue what the hell I'm gonna drop from my spell line up to mem another heal, I very likely wouldnt have it memmed on raids unless I'm playing healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think that this is a VERY GOOD idea. Shaman is a priest class, and while not as powerful as a cleric, a shaman still should be able to heal quite well. The Superior Heal what we get now at 51 sucks, even by the time we get it. I do small teaming with 1-2 friends often, and they are melee people. After they are fully buffed, my &quot;best&quot; healing spell heals barely 75% of ONE BUBBLE of their HP. Bah. About time we got a better heal, and at the same time it in no way get's into clerics way. On many raids, where I am grouped with cleric, I often am the one who - in case group/raid tank gets too low - throw in a heal before cleric, to win those &quot;precious&quot; few moments what it takes for cleric to cast CH. My heal is the thing which may win that crucial moment, just enough to &quot;avert&quot; the death blow on the tank and give the much needed &quot;second&quot; for the cleric to land CH. I can't keep people healed with my heal - too crappy - but I can help cleric to keep these people alive.<br />
<br />
What I do not see reasoned is why the heck druids can heal for more, they aren't any more &quot;priestly&quot; then shamans are. In fact, shamans deal more with &quot;body&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; then druid, who only dabbles in his weeds and messes with his trees and squirrels.<br />
<br />
I do hope that they give something new to clerics, too. NOT because of this spell, it doesn't bother clerics that much, but because it's BORING for clerics to be there only to CH/Ress/Buff HP. Clerics want something else, totally different from heals and such, to have more interesting life. Whatever these spells will be - better smite/DD/stun spell, flying holy hammers or summoned mices who smite undeads - whatever, but something different, useful for a single person and group, to make their life interesting more.</div></div><hr />

The only reason I have to have a Cleric in most groups now is for Rezs.  Until I get Torpor I can't keep up with the damage output of mobs deep in Chardok or CT; but I probalby could once I get Torpor.<br />
<br />
I don't know that this is the heal that I wanted however.  I somewhat bigger, more mana, but just as fast as Cholorblast is more what I was looking for.  A 'Save the Enchanter' heal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Qhue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A 2k heal IS enough to get you on the CH chain!  Most CHeals in a chain land for &lt; 2000 hits anyway, quite a few land for zilch!  Cheal chains are not about always healing the tank for 4000+ hit points, they are about timing of large very mana efficient heals.<br />
<br />
These new spells solve the problem when you have a mob that, due to his erratic and potentially high damage output, you want a a 2-3 second spacing on the chain to kill.<br />
<br />
Problem : you dont have enough clerics to get a 2-3 second spacing with a 10.0 second casting spell! (takes 7 clerics to do this well, by the time the first cleric is finished with her CH then she needs that 4.0 second gap to grab a mod rod and rod a bit before she has to begin recasting.  If one of the clerics dies that drops to 2.0 seconds and lag can easily eat that delay up until you are left with ClericA due to start casting his CH and he hasnt finished the last one yet!)<br />
<br />
Solution : instead of having 7 clerics in a CH chain you have 4 clerics, 2 druids and 1 shaman (or some other mix) The druids and shaman in the chain arent there to do the 6000+ miracle heals, they are there to keep the tank alive and keep the TIMING of the chain going.<br />
<br />
This also allows Clerics to do things like rez, rebuff, cast fast-casting spot heals and in general get a break from doing the Cheal chain that has soooo many of them weary.<br />
<br />
By having more clerics than shamans/druids in the chain you can have an effective heal chain but using fewer clerics.   <br />
<br />
As far as the magnitude of the heal and torpor...well hell I'd use BOTH of them!  Torpor, CH, Torpor, CH.  Thats why the Shaman one is much lower magnitude because the devs know that you already have Torpor to do most of the day-to-day efficient healing, but its nice to have something else to cast that is also fairly efficient while torpor is cooking away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">biggest problem i see with this is its' nice but it's not far enough to even remotely gap the healing problem.  1950 heal on myself is far less than even HALF my hp buffed on  a raid. Heck it's only barely half my SELF BUFFED, and you cant even use 2 of them in a row because that puts you above 75% of your hp.<br />
<br />
At 10 seconds and 400 mana quite honestly it's not worth it. torpor is better, at least you can garuntee you're gonig to heal x ammount for y ammount of mana.<br />
<br />
as it stands before any possibility of these spells going live druids can out nuke, out dot (yes please look at resists on our dot lines they're rediculous, druid with their weak dots will do more damage with dots than a shaman becaues more than 3/4 of our dots bounce even with debuffs) and out heal shaman.   Shaman are by no means lacking at all, i think we're currently quite balanced, but giving druids a 3k &quot;ch&quot; and leaving shaman with one that's under 2k still just furthers this healing disparity between the classes.  Yeah torpor is nice but i cant count the number of times i'd have traded it in an instant for natures touch or whatever that 1k heal that druids get is. <br />
<br />
A group only heal that slows melee and movement limits shaman healing duty on a raid to modrodding mages and clerics and that's about it.  Popping chloroblasts on a 7500 hp tank even with crit heals maxed is like trying to fill a bathtub one shotglass at a time while the drain is unplugged.  if you're goign to give shaman a bigger heal make it just another constant dmg healed for constant mana in a set amount of time and i'll be happy.  <br />
<br />
 As it is basically the only reason people think of shaman as &quot;too powerfull&quot; is because of our soloablity for single large mobs, and that's not because we're good dps'ers or anythign either, we're just able to do a very low amount of consistant damage over a long period of time while keeping ourselves alive.  This does not help stackability on raids, does not affect groupability etc.  Creating a heal that caps at 75% of their hp or 1950 whichever is LESS does not adress stackablity at all, you CANT depend on that sort of heal on a main tank.  If the highest a shaman can heal the MT is to 75% of their hp and they have 7500 hp buffed then the tank might as well have 5625 hp only, which is just a couple hundred more hp than i have buffed and probably less than Jenamdar has buffed now.  That's not sufficient hp to be able to depend on the above sort of heal on a main tank.  You have to heal for the WORST round you could get from a mob and with many mobs currently one round can do over 5k with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Maximillien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Atleast it would give lower level Shaman something to do on raids besides buff &amp; cripple..  The diffence between a 60 Shaman and a 54 Shaman is HUGE! Lvl 54 is a good level for this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Tharkis - I'm not sure if you're right about the 75% thing.<br />
<br />
It could either mean what you said, or it could mean that the amount healed is 75% of your total HP or 1950 whichever is less.<br />
<br />
Therefore casting this heal on someone with 500/2000 HP would put them at full health. Casting on someone with 600/2500 HP would heal 1875 (75%) and put them at 2475/2500 HP.<br />
<br />
Of course we don't know for sure until we get to try it out :)<br />
<br />
Saying torpor is better is all very well, torpor probably is better and should stay that way - but torpor is also level 60 and rare, this spell is level 54 and hopefully will be on a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I can't decide whether I like this change or not. My preference would have been to give druids the 2k version of that heal and give Shaman something similar to Cel Elixer. That would be more in keeping with my picture of how the two classes work (druid-less mana efficient, quicker acting spells than shaman).<br />
<br />
Speaking as a torpor-less Oracle, I do think that our heals are sub-par at the high lvls. Not being able to keep an enchanter or cleric alive against exp mobs (200 hitters) has been showing me just how far we've fallen when it comes to healing. <br />
<br />
As to how it affect clerics, I dunno. A huge balancing factor will be the agro from the spells. Up the agro on all 3 versions of CH (and giving clerics a spell that reduces their agro) and you could easily balance them. ... verant doesn't have a very good track record in that department though. <br />
<br />
It will make exp groups w/o a cleric more viable, any drood could keep up with healing in a single pull situation were agro management isn't a problem but is that a bad thing? Time will tell, I guess.</div></div><hr />

All I can say is Clerics are SO one functioned it is silly.  <br />
<br />
If we get this spell, why would anyone except a primary raider want to play a cleric?  <br />
<br />
At level 60 it is CH, GAego, MoK (from BP), and MoRetribution (oh and clicky stick if someone dies).  <br />
<br />
Sorry, if druids end up with a 3k almostCH, not much point in playing a cleric any longer except rezes and raids.<br />
<br />
Clerics basically can't level up by themselves.  They always are in need of a group.  The fact that they have CH makes them an indispensible part of a group, but the group is an indispensible part of thier career too... So, I don't see this as all bad.<br />
<br />
:sigh: I agree everyone is going to end up with everything if this cross class stuff continues much longer.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
I will happily go back to playing my shaman even if I don't get this spell.  I just really feel for those clerics who we are going to be displacing out of groups when we can solo or duo so well compared to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">This is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the way dungeons are designed clerics are already feeling useless. The number of places where you actually NEED a cleric for the group are extremely few. CT is one of the few that comes to mind.<br />
<br />
In a raid perspective clerics will always shine due to Verants inferior programming that centered the whole game around a MT and Cheal cycles.<br />
<br />
While perhaps not coming close to he clerics ability for fast and big heals, these spells certainly infringe further on their very specialized domain. I've seen druids asking (whining) for such a spell as this, but in the end I do not think this is what either class really needs.<br />
<br />
Give druids more specialization toward atk/ac debuffing. And if shaman should receive something then perhaps that poison nuke we never got, but even more so a torpor that is castable OUTSIDE of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Qhue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Clerics can sit around and wait for en exp group like the rest of the players of the game.<br />
<br />
If they dont want to wait for an exp group then they can go solo.  Yes virginia clerics CAN solo and quite a few of the more creative clerics in the game have BEEN soloing for months now as their primary means of exp gathering.<br />
<br />
It requires more concentration than watching Buffy and clicking the CH button every few minutes but it can be done and done well (and not just by the folx who abused refresh bugs on Turn Undead although that is how many of them started out soling and quickly realized that they <br />
<br />
A) can tank pretty well being a plate class<br />
<br />
B) can heal themselves and<br />
<br />
C) have some farily creative ways to do damage<br />
<br />
<br />
Rather than grouping with a cleric because the cleric has an indispensible ability why not group with the cleric because the cleric is a good player and maybe because you LIKE the cleric!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Apparently some druids (according to EQ Clerics) are complaining it doesn't heal enough, and is too slow. Actually they do have a point: how many tanks would like to rely on a druid timing a 10 second heal correctly?<br />
<br />
Lord knows I wouldn't want to depend on a druid's ability to count. I wouldn't want to have to depend on the selflessness of a necro, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Hmm as a 58 shm without torpor:<br />
<br />
Usual trash mobs xp grouping (velks) then chloroblast normally is fine. I don't have a regen bp or mana regen items, yet with a ODS and the removal of the 10% penalty I find myself keeping up except for the mana used in buffing.<br />
<br />
For more nasty situations such as CT sewers etc in normal xp groups - I can't keep up with the damage but I can do some good towards covering the gap for the CH to hit.<br />
<br />
At 10 seconds, this is not going to save a tank all by itself - by stacking torpor and this, it may provide a closer alternative to the druid's higher HP version.<br />
<br />
Yes I think the druid version is a re-invention of nature's recovery. Druids don't get heal over time so this would make a good replacement for them.<br />
<br />
I think an upgrade for heals will benifit if benificial spells can stack - if you have multiple shaman casting torpor on a tank that could make up for this 'insta-heal'. Torpors stacks shouldn't stack the negative components as this would have the effect of dropping the agro generation on the tank.<br />
<br />
Multiple Shaman groups/raids will get a lot of DPS increase from the stacking change that rumoured to be in the pipeline.<br />
<br />
The only problem is the slot limit/stacking - removing this and allowing shaman to stack offensive and benificial non-buff spells will cause a big change in the way shaman do their work. <br />
<br />
By adding a mini torpor at 54/55 these level shaman can help in groups and raids - especially if the stacking blocking is removed.<br />
<br />
Shaman, to me at the moment, heal by mitigation of damage (slow), regeneration and just topping off with highly effective heal of time then small insta-heals (chloroblast).<br />
<br />
Druids don't mitigate the damage but rather add more damage with DS and have larger heals to compensate for heal over time.<br />
<br />
Clerics don't migiate or DS, they just rely on the brute force approach of bunk up the HP of the player, let them take the full damage and then heal the full set of HP in one go.. (i know aego has AC but... it's the HP that make the difference). With SS leg heal giving a 105pt heal.. I know clerics that can run velks groups and not use any mana.<br />
<br />
So that leaves the dilemma - either allow shaman to mitigate more damage, or, bunk up the insta-heals.. the trouble with more damage mitigation is that it would require some serious rebalancing of some top end encounters and it would add to the shaman's soloing ability.. so really it's either better heal over time or better insta-heal.. to be more imaginative would take some serious work.<br />
<br />
You can see how much of a balancing headache trying to work out taking these three forms of 'healing' of the priest classes causes for xp, large xp groupings and raiding encounters.<br />
<br />
So... insta-heal it is.. /yawn.. I think allowing shaman to work together with torpor/mini torpor..<br />
<br />
edit: perhaps one way would be to ensure there are some undead zones in PoP to give necros, clerics and pallies some new perspective to playing rather than MBG aego and CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ginslunger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">My first char and my main for two years was a 53 shaman.  My current main is a 55 cleric.<br />
<br />
These are GREAT changes for the shaman and especially, druid communities.  It will make them more viable healers in both higher level exp groups and give them more of a healing role in raids.<br />
<br />
However, I'm already finding my cleric unwanted in more and more in exp groups.  This isn't necessarily due to improvements in other priest classes, but the ability of melee characters to take less damage than they have in the past, either through improvements VI has made to those classes or the increasing effectiveness of equipment that is getting added to the game with each expansion.  This change will only exacerbate this problem.<br />
<br />
Why would an exp grinding group want a cleric  vs. a shaman/druid both in the group now?  A shaman or druid can handle the heals plus everything else they bring to the table and you could add another damage dealer instead of the cleric.  I'm expecting it to become more and more difficult to find an exp group which will only increase the number of cleric bots out there.<br />
<br />
I'll withhold judgement until I see it go live and see what they might add to the cleric class to offset this change, but unless they make clerics more versatile I think they're going to see more and more clerics leaving the game or switching to other chars as their main.<br />

I kinda freaked out when I read that this morning....<br />

They have to have one of the most boring roles imo. Now they don't even have that with these spells. And while yes they can solo somewhat, they solo like **** compared to practically any other class in todays game. They better get some real offensive power if we get these spells. Yes I know their nuke does more damage than ours but I think we all pretty much agree our nuke should get an upgrade and that's about all a cleric gets. We have tons of other ways to generate damage.<br />
<br />
As far as the spells themselves, I thnk 54 is way too low to get that kind of healing power, I don't understand why Druids would get a better heal than us, and what good is their level 60 heal compared to this? I always kinda looked at Druids as the most offensive oriented of the priest classes and the clerics as the most defensive with us in the middle. With this, Druids would have the best offense and arguably the second best defense. <br />
<br />
Not saying a 2000 point heal wouldn't be cool but I would like to see some balance. Only needing Clerics for complete heal chains and resses will mean you will see a lot less Clerics. Maybe that's the point, the less Clerics, the less able people are to kill the big mobs, the less competition at the higher levels, the less people get into fights over the big mobs.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Clerics are clerics because they can Rezz.<br />
<br />
There are 15 classes in EQ, only one can Rezz at 96%.  <br />
<br />
When I started my Shaman, I wanted to be able to Heal...had no clue I would be so lousy at it in the high-end game.   At level 29 we could heal one-third of a tanks hitpoints.  Now I do less than one-tenth.<br />
<br />
I for one love the idea of being able to help out a lot more in exp groups and high end encounters.   I've been wanting this for a long time.  We NEED a high-level heal other than Chloroblast and Torpor.  <br />
<br />
Please stop griping---they are finally throwing us a bone, even if it's not the EXACT bone we wanted.  Remember, some of us may never get to scribe Torpor in our spellbooks--still goes for 50K on my server, and I can't remember the last time I saw it for sale.<br />
<br />
IMO, Clerics are overpowered, anyway.  You can bring level 39 Clerics on major raids because of one spell.  Name any other class you can do that with.  <br />
<br />
Heck, make it a heal over time, if you think it's too imbalancing...10 second cast, 1900hps healed over 4 ticks, just like Torpor.   Now it becomes a little trickier to use in combat situations, and the clerics shouldn't feel so threatened.<br />
<br />
Clerics will still have the best HP buffs, AC buffs, and Heals in the game.  And they get Rezz.  Plus, they are a plate class, and their uber gear (epic and Trak BP) have much better right-click effects than ours.  I'm tired of being a third rate healer.    <br />
<br />
And I don't want to hear how Turgurs makes us equal to clerics because of damage mitigation...Turgurs can be resisted, CHeal cannot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Sherazade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Qhue, yes Clerics can solo.  In highlevel game there are basicly 2 spots I know of that they make sense for clerics to solo. One is in the Grey other in Acrylia. As a moderately equiped, and i'd say quite skilled cleric I decided to try soloing for a change.<br />
<br />
I tried the one in the Grey and found the snakes all camped by necros. I moved to the skellies near SD zone and found out they are way to resisty to our root.<br />
<br />
So I moved to Acrilya, near HP room. I had KEI and was hardly able to clear 4 spawns. (no complications - root dot trying to use the most mana efficient way)<br />
Necro shows up. Hey can you clear all 8 spawns here? No, I can't, I can hold 4 and would like to keep them. Hehehe how can 4 spawns be good exp??<br />
Paladin shows up. Hey can you keep the room cleared? No, I don't have KEI anymore and I can hold 2 spawns right now. Hehehe. Paladin invites me and clears 10 skellies in a row.<br />
<br />
So much to the solo-abilties of clerics :) <br />
<br />
As for the changes, I am as many other clerics happy if they will go active,  we hope that some of the burden of the CH will be taken away from us - and we are looking forward to see the new druidish and shamanish healrotation :)<br />
<br />
All we hope is that in exchange we get to bring something special into exp-groups or would improve our abilty to solow. As e.g. some undead-snow/snare or beter ratio on our nukes.<br />

Any raid where the mob AEs, the Cleric would get roasted instantly because of their level, not to mention their mana pool is so pathetic, their 5 cheals they might could get off wouldn't really help a ton.<br />
<br />
They do have the best HP and AC buffs, however that will hardly get them a group. Just log in yer friendly cleric bot, throw aego on the group, and log him out. Or just not even worry about it anyway because in most exp groups you aren't testing the limits any more where you need the extra hps or ac. Especially AC, I see Paladins strapping on the AC7 FT3 boots from CT because their AC is so high.<br />
<br />
Yes the effects on a couple Cleric items are nice, but again that won't get them a group. Not to mention the epic is a BIOTCH to get. Ours is a complete joke to get compared to theirs and it is useable in raids AND exp groups. But they can summon water with their boots!<br />

I have no idea why anyone would be jealous of Clerics, especially Shamans. You know what a Cleric does when they get attacked by something and they are not prepared? Hope they have SOW up so they can run for it or hope they have Fear or root memmed along with their 5 different heal spells or the DAs. What does a Shaman do, a chain class, with less hps most likely self buffed, totally unprepared? Well they always have SOW up so can easily escape or they grunt in annoyance, slow it, and kill it.

My first impression is that 3k is too much for the druid heal, but I'm not absolutely certain of that. I know my old druid (had a L 50 druid when Kunark came out) was basically a gimp in the post-50 levels because he coudn't heal worth a damn. But 3k seems like a bit much. For exp-grouping pre-60, 3k IS a complete heal, especially without a cleric to hp buff. 2k for a shaman sounds right to me, and maybe the druid # should be closer to that, but still higher. <br />
<br />
The only big danger in doing this is that they MUST give clerics something GOOD to compensate. Clerics are godawful boring and one-dimensional compared to either druids or shamans. If this goes live without clerics getting something substantial to compensate, then it'll be a disaster. The cleric class will become nothing but a rez'N'buff bot, and a L 60 raider - but almost no new clerics will ever GET to L 60. The solution? The clerics need a real pet. All the exp groups that will be kicking clerics out because they don't add DPS to the group will still want them, and a cleric without L 60, a Blackstar, 1300 ac, FT 10, and a pile of DS pots will be able to solo if they want to. Nowadays almost everyone else can (twink a melee right and even almost all of them can solo), they might as well also. <br />

I think that everyone can agree that clerics need some more flexability in the game.  God, how borring must it be to just heal and med and once in awhile buff.  That sucks.  They should make clerics the undead bad ass killers of the game.  Low mana high damage nukes to undead.  Insta kill undead skill.  I don't know what the answer is but they need something.<br />
<br />
I kinda like this spell but at the same time I see this spell as a raid spell and not much else.  <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Last night I'm in BW helping a mage with his epic.  We had sham, mage, wiz, druid, druid.  Only had the druids to track the named wurms btw.  Only person I healed the entire 2 hours we were there was me and one of the druids as he was getting chain cast on by the wurm.  <br />
<br />
Now CT is different I know but I can't go there until at least 58 becuse of resists so what good is CH at 54.  I dont want to heal on raids,  I have enough to do.<br />
<br />
We need a better heal,  but this is not what I was thinking.  Heal over time is what I want.  Not a DD heal.  I love Cele Elix.  And I would love that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I think one of the reasons that Druids heal is set up higher than ours is for two reasons. <br />
1 - They don't have slow<br />
2 - They don't have as much to offer to a group as a shaman or cleric and would give them a, honestly, slightly needed boost to group desirability.<br />
<br />
With our Slow, that heal is MORE than enough for most encounters.<br />
<br />
I hope they do give Clerics something else to do, as long as it isnt' slow ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I think this is a horrible idea.  Not because I pity clerics but because I don't want to have to heal. I want to purify the soul, not mend wounds.  I want to unleash unearthly forces into my enemies, not count to 7 and click a button.<br />
<br />
Granted, we do need a better heal between 54 and 60.  I would love to see a mini torpor at 54 and a torpor without the restrictions gained at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I just think it's kinda interesting...of all the stuff we said would be nice for the shaman class in that last big thread before the Fan Faire, a better heal wasn't mentioned much at all.<br />
<br />
I'm torn about it...<br />
<br />
1) No spell slots to keep this up really, with a 10 second cast time it wouldn't replace torpor as my can 5 heal of choice<br />
2) Better for assist healing main tanks on big raids...but I'm usually pretty busy doing other stuff<br />
3) Infringes on the role of the cleric, especially in exp groups, in a big way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Druids are more versatile healers than shaman as it is now.  Do we need to widen the gap by giving them a larger heal spell?  If this goes live with them healing 1k more than our spell, then why shouldn't ours use less mana and/or have a shorter cast time.  Don't make the penalty the same if the reward isn't.  Or balance it by giving us a divine light type spell.  Let's not forget that Torpor takes 24 seconds to reach full duration and during that time, whoever you healed is doing much less damage to their opponent and cannot run should they need to.  I have seen cases where Torpor got group members killed during trains.  Another option would be to remove the downsides of torpor.  Get rid of the group only portion and the snare/slow portion.  It would still take 48 seconds and 400 mana to heal what a cleric and now a druid can do in 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I don't like this very much.<br />
<br />
1. Maybe I'm bitter because I just spent 40k on Torpor, because it's a VERY NICE heal spell I can use.<br />
<br />
2. I hate healing anyone but myself. bye bye dog dog :) If I wanted to be the 'cleric' in a group I'd go start a Cleric.<br />
<br />
3. If this does go live, make it be semi-rare, somewhere between the drop rates of Cripple/Tali of Jasinth and Malo/Torpor.<br />
<br />
As much as I get annoyed at rebuffing people that can't understand gather your group for group buffs, I really do ENJOY being a shaman. I enjoy the slowing, buffing, canning etc. That's what makes me, ME!<br />
<br />
Last night, I was the only shaman with Torpor at a Telk fight. I was in the group of clerics on the CHeal rotation. Chloroblast kept nearly all of them alive *except the cleric in AE range that modded themselves to death*. I was placed there in case they needed Torpor. This isn't the first time.<br />
<br />
Even though I couldn't Malo, or do anything really effective against Telks it was kind of lame being the healer for the healers :) It happens so infrequently that's fine.<br />
<br />
I do agree if this does go live...Clerics better get some very nice stuff in return! :D Though, I doubt it'll be enough for my hubby's 56 Cleric to come out of retirement. *sides, his monk is more fun to duo with ;) *<br />
<br />
Bottom line: I don't wanna be a group healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Pre-60, the only class with adequate healing in full groups right now is a cleric (unless you're doing easy stuff), and there aren't enough clerics to go around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you continue in your raiding shaman career, against bigger and bigger mobs that reqire clerics to maintain an adequate mana supply for fights that last 20+ minutes, you will often find yourself in the role of healing the healers or healing the mages.<br />
<br />
Anything that allows me to contribute to the success of the raid, from the lowly task of healing the mod rodding clerics to the hot shot &quot;Uber Mox X is slooooowed!&quot; is okay with me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Sikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Save the chanter heal is definately something needed moreso than a single shot long casting big heal. <br />

If we want to start blurring the lines lets blur the lines between druid and shaman a bit more and give us some type of group &quot;get out of jail free card&quot; like an evac  ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">this is an insult to shamans.<br />
<br />
first of all, druids get a higher max than shamans.<br />
if they were going to give us the same spell, then give us the same spell. don't nerf us off the bat.<br />
<br />
second, i don't think shamans lack the ability to heal. in fact, we are arguably the best healers depending on the situation. Torpor is so powerful a spell they had to put negative aspects of it just to balance it. 1200hp heal for 200 mana? that's insane effiency as long as u don't mind the adverse effects. <br />
<br />
third, shamans are the only class that hasn't had dmg upgrades. our nukes and dots have not been looked at since kunrak.<br />
<br />
make torpor heal out of group.<br />
give us a new line of dmg spells - curses.<br />
give us lure slow.<br />
don't give us a fake CH to try and make us something we've never wanted to be, faker cleircs.<br />
we are shamen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Why do shamans only look at the RAW numbers before saying, wait we need to have same max healing power as a druid?<br />
<br />
Basically, truth is for balance a Druid would NEED a higher heal than a Shaman, because we are SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL<br />
that it isnt even funny.<br />
<br />
I can see this spell in 2 ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
XP Groups,<br />
Currently in an XP group in EQ, you can take any knight in most zones, so why not any priest?<br />
<br />
Now, if the justification is to lean it that way, lets face it, we DO NOT need as big as a heal to play healer, as a druid does for 2 reasons.<br />
1) Better Main regen (we could cast the smaller heal more times than they could the larger)<br />
2) Slow (we can slow the mob and reduce the damage immensly.  In some ways we can heal fights that Im not sure a Cleric could heal on)<br />
<br />
And you got to admit, balance wise they are going to watch CH for shaman because we got Cann.  Remember the reason mana stone does not work?<br />
<br />
ultimately having both a druid and shaman.  The shaman can main heal in many situations that the druid would be OOM begging for a break.   Slowed Mobs can be healed quite fine thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I assume healing gift/adept will affect this heal, meaning we could crit heal for nearly over 4k with both skills maxed. Throw in a Phara Dar shroud for even more.<br />

On one hand I would love a better spell than chlroblast or sup heal for healing outside of the group.  But on the other hand, I am not sure I really want to heal more(although on mobs where its melee/clerics, this would at least give me something to do)  I am sure this spell is far from being put live anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>jmizzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I think that this is a great idea. . .until level 60.  Currently (according to castersrealm), an Oracle can Canni V 1924 hit points for 1200 mana every 69 seconds.  If he has Torpor, two casts can replenish the health lost over one minute (6 second cast time, 24 second duration) for the cost of 400 mana.  Total mana earned: 800 mana.  Total time elapsed: 60 seconds.<br />
<br />
Now, let's look at that nice new 1995 point heal for 400 mana.  Total mana earned: 800 mana.  Total time elapsed: 10 seconds (the cast time of the heal).  Even though the Shaman has to wait 59 more seconds to do this again, he can still Torpor and Canni IV for yet MORE mana.  Or he can just sit there, waiting for Canni V to refresh, content in the knowledge that he is effectively regenerating mana at a rate equal to Clarity II (800 mana/70 seconds = 11.4 mana/second).<br />
<br />
Aside from the obvious benefit of less work, the new CHeal also works instantly.  With Torpor, hit points regenerate slower, providing more of a danger when Canni V is used in a combat situation.  And need I mention the lack of Snare on the new CHeal?<br />
<br />
So, while I agree that this spell would be wonderful pre-60 (as our heals post-50 are wholly inadequate in keeping people alive), at 60 this spell will be seriously overpowering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think of it this way....Verant wants to see the impact of both the 2k (roughly) and 3k (roughly) heals. They have two choices. <br />
<br />
1. Give all priests (non-cleric) on test the 2k heal, and a week later give all priests the 3k heal-and check the numbers. <br />
<br />
2. Give half of the Priests (Non-cleric) the 2k and the other half the 3k and watch both now. <br />
<br />
Don't get uptight and take it as an insult that &quot;OH NOS Verant likes Druids more!!!11&quot;. They're just testing both options in the same environment at the same time to weight them against each other. <br />
<br />
Do I think at low 50s either spell would be imbalanced? Yeah. I would say raise them to 58-60....OR.....make a lower mana consumption version and Make it an Ancient Spell (puts on Asbestos suit).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">While I would love such a spell, I'm not so sure it's a good idea from a balance standpoint.  For your average exp group, it'd make clerics needed for rezzes only.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for those saying it further increases druids lead in healing over us, I'd argue that it catches us up.  For conventional heals, currently their best does 978 versus our 583... 68% better.  With these spells, theirs is 50% better, and it's only 50% better on PCs with over 3900hp, lower than that, the difference drops, down to even at 2660hp.  Sure ours isn't as mana efficient, but hell, we never run out of mana anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">A 2k heal IS enough to get you on the CH chain! Most CHeals in a chain land for &lt; 2000 hits anyway, quite a few land for zilch!<br />

You have no clue. Please wait until you have experienced a ch chain(on the receiving end) before you comment about it in such a matter. 2khp is often less than 1/3 of a decently equipped warlords hp.<br />
<br />
As for the spell itself- having played both druid and shaman, I can say that without a doubt neither class deserves nor needs these spells.<br />
<br />
Implementing them would be a major mistake. Which of course means VI WILL implement them and BREAK yet another class(and move still more classes in the wrong direction).<br />

KKTKS VI, in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Have to agree with Tulkor, I'm not a huge fan of this.  I also feel it infringes on the role of the cleric outside of the BGH.  I don't mind being an AE healer (for Sonty I filled that role just fine using Chloro/Sup on the cleric keeping the MT alive) but unless the clerics are helped as well, this is going to trivialize them in XP groups.  <br />
<br />
Better fast casting stuff for Druids, a lower Torpor for Shaman IMO would be a much better way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I myself don't want the heal.  Give druids theres and give us the poison nuke they showed us for luclin  =P<br />
<br />
Normally I group with a rogue and a monk.  I hardly ever heal as it is, why do I need a new heal?  For raids I guess it could come in handy but I really don't see it as a save all spell mainly because of the 10 second cast time, it costing the same as CH, and not healing near as much.    <br />
<br />
But I also HATE being a group healer also.   I could never stand being told (specially when grouped with a druid) to heal.  (cept of course if I'm the only healer...)   So maybe I'm biased and don't want a healing spell...   but I still don't have to like it  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Maybe it's just me, but I think a 1k or 1200ish heal around level 54 would be plenty sufficient.<br />
<br />
Chloroblast is a pretty lousy upgrade to Sup Heal, just change chloroblast to be a REAL upgrade to sup heal in terms of cast time/and or amount healed and that would be plenty IMO.  Remove anti group crap on torpor and we all agree we pretty much would be set.<br />
<br />
Druids *might* need a little larger heal.  Whatever our max instant heal is, druids should probably be 2-300 more.  Not 1k more.  That's assinine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">I only dabble in alts - my shaman is my main, and I've played it for over 3 years.  I won't even try to speculate what impact this could have on Clerics (had a 14th lvl alt), or Druids (have a 35th alt taxi).<br />
<br />
Speaking as a Shaman, about the Shaman spell only, I don't like it.  Torpor, if the drop rates were decent, would be plenty for us.  (Yes, I know - drop rates are whacked, not everyone has it)  I look at this as yet another dumbing down of EQ, a continuation of the blurring of the classes...  Why not just cut it back to Cleric, Mage, Fighter, Rogue, and the heck with everything else?<br />
<br />
What I would prefer to see instead of this Shaman heal (hint hint, devs. ;) ):<br />
a) Take a serious look into the drop rates of Torpor.  There's a reason the avg price on many servers is 100k.  Compare that to the projected availability of your new Shaman CH.<br />
b) I would rather see a unique spell (line) for us, instead of cloning another class spell onto us.  As I've mentioned before, my proposal is a new buff line - Totem buffs: attack buffs that add an attack bonus and proc, for certain weapon types.  Example - Totem of the Serpent, piercing weapons, +xx attack, +poison dd proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Sure, its a decent spell and we could really use a heal upgrade with more and more clerics not wanting to play their chars becuase they are bored to tears.  This pretty much means you can take 4 spell slots away from a cleric and all they'll need to mem is Aego, the 2 DA spells, and CH, meanwhile your friendly neighborhood shaman is opening and closing his/her spell book like they are expecting candy to pop out of it.   Clerics no longer need to mem CE, or remedy ... screw it and let the shaman with their wicked mana regen take it all.<br />
<br />
Although I would like either a very fast heal or a decent sized 59th lvl heal with a slow cast, I don't like or want this spell.  If we get it, I'll get it, but I'm sure as hell not keen on it.  I have no desire to outheal anyone as I have lots to do with my mana already.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">This looks basically like two Torpors to me.<br />
<br />
Torpor is a five second cast, 200 mana, around 1k heal (yeah yeah, I know it's a little more- work with me here.)<br />
<br />
This new spell is a ten second cast, 400 mana, around 2k heal.<br />
<br />
No snare component, no attack slow, works out of group, and not a heal over time... so once it's finished casting you can cann/regen for more mana.  Wow.<br />
<br />
Do I think it's overpowered and unbalancing?  Yup.  A 5:1 HP/mana ratio spell of this magnitude is a mana MACHINE.<br />
<br />
That said, the more I think about it... the more I'm drooling.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">On the long drive to work I had an idea that seemed silly to me, but upon closer examination could be fun.<br />
<br />
The druids' 60th level heal spell, Nature's Touch, heals 978 points for 400 mana.  With AA abilities, druids also have a chance for a critical heal.  Torpor heals roughly 23% more hitpoints over 24 seconds for half the mana and several detrimental effects.<br />
<br />
My idea, in short, is that the druids should  have the 2925 point partial CHeal for 400 mana, while the shamans should not have a partial CHeal at all.  Instead, while keeping with the same ratios as with the existing spells, the shamans should gain a new torpor-like spell that heals around 3400 hitpoints (roughly 16% gain over the druid CHeal) over 24 seconds for 200 mana, with 8 second casting time and no detrimental effects.  In other words, it would be an improved Torpor.  AA abilities would of course apply to this spell, as they do for Torpor (Nature's Touch crits and is affected by Improved Healing 3, Torpor isn't).<br />
<br />
This might be a good compromise, because it would focus on the shamans' ability to heal over prolonged periods of time, reducing the burden on the other healers while not reducing their usefulness.  The clerics would be wanted as primary healers while the druids would augment them and thus be more wanted, while shamans would take some burden away from both of them by lessening the effective damage taken by the tank.<br />

I think this is a terrible idea as a Level 54 spell. I'm not saying that overall this spell couldn't exist, but at such an early level it will mean no use for Clerics in experience groups (other than parking them nearby for rezzes). At this level, figuring average equipment, the spell will serve as a Complete Heal for most melees classes.<br />

Please keep the classes separate and distinct. If we must get a new spell, a debuff or damage spell would make more sense.</div></div><hr />

From the standpoint of a more casual player in a smaller guild, once you reach the 50's it gets harder and harder to assemble the group needed to explore 50's level zones if you are just logging on for a few hours in the evening.  I think it is good that groups can exp in challenging, interesting zones without having to have a cleric.  It is not good for the game for one class to be absolutely essential to play.  Anything that increases flexibility will encourage more exploration and more fun.<br />
<br />
As a 53 shaman, I certainly dont feel comfortable now taking a group of melee characters into a 50's level zone with me as the group healer.  The risk of many deaths and no rez is way too high.<br />
<br />
Shaman is a priest class and should be a viable group healer, albeit a weaker healer by far than clerics.  Clerics should get other fun stuff to do to improve their soloing ability.  This blurs the class lines a bit, but if you are a casual player with a 50's character, there is a good chance it is your only high level character and the main thing is that you can have fun with it--even if you are a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">I see us a tad differently.  Buffing and debuffing are roughly equal as a grouping shaman.  What's the point in providing str/sta/dex and then not slowing the critter?  I frequently end up wasting mana DoTting, since things die so quickly.  Soloing, I agree with you completely, Krelic.  I want that critter slowed, crippled, and dying ASAP.<br />
<br />
A new spell line or two would be incredible, and would enrich the game for everybody.  I would love something along the line of the Totems noted above, or nicely inventive Curses (spell fizzles, interrupts, melee misses, take more damage from melee, stuff like that).  Lev 58-ish Lure-based slow?  /drool<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Yun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Cleric proposal that is totally different from the generic clerics:<br />
<br />
If druids were to get the above, clerics should probably change roles a bit.<br />
<br />
*  Clerics get double attack at 51 and caps at 100 skill at level 60.<br />
*  Clerics no longer need to sit to meditate at level 51.<br />
*  Clerics get a direct target heal &quot;ability&quot; with a 10 minute timer. Heal amount scales depending on level. Increased heal amount at &quot;significant&quot; levels (10, 25, 40, 51, 55, 60).<br />
*  Clerics get a group heal &quot;ability&quot; with a 30 minute timer. Heal amount scales depending on level. Increased heal amount at &quot;significant&quot; levels (15, 30, 45, 53, 58).<br />
*  Area effect mezmerize spell or ability (no single target mez) on a long timer. Only useful for emergencies.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the above seem very in line with clerics from a role-playing perspective. It would also give the cleric &quot;something to do&quot; if there was a druid or shaman in the group using their new complete heal spell and in my opinion would make the game much more fun for the cleric. The cleric would not be doing &quot;significant&quot; damage that would impact a group's leveling performance and a druid or shaman could even potentially take over the healing for the group if the cleric chose to be an &quot;offensive melee&quot; cleric that day (in an xp group).<br />
<br />
What do you guys think? This is what I've always wanted from my cleric when I first created her. I never wanted to be reduced to the &quot;press one button then sit down&quot; class. Please take this into consideration.</div></div><hr />

You know every time I try to heal my warrior I'm painfully reminded of my first days of EQ, when I was running through Runnyeye and I soptted a warrior that was low on HPs, at the time I think I had heal as my only heal spell.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">I've always felt that druids and shaman needed better heals at the higher levels.  I for one would love to see this go live even if they reduce the healing amount.  My friend plays a 55 druidess and she was pretty much forced into retirement at that level because she was not wanted in groups very much and she hated soloing.  I play a 55 shaman and while I find that I am still highly desired in groups it would be nice to have a little extra healing ability, as it stands now if I try to heal a tank with aego I barely move his HP bar 3/4 - 1 bubble depending on the tank.  I'm happy with the shaman class but I see this as a nice addition to our spell line.<br />
I forsee that this will reduce the general need for clerics somewhat but it will far from eliminate their need.  They still have the best buffs / heals and rez spells.  I think the clerics will whine because now they will be pushed closer to the spot that the rest of us are already in when it comes to finding exp groups at 55+ (Nobody likes to LFG for 50% of their playable time), but they will still be a very valuable member of any group and still be a desired class.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, that aside, I don't think we need this.  Make Chloroblast a better spell (read: heal more for more mana with the same cast time) and increase the drop rate on Torpor.  Maybe a lower level version of Torpor as others have suggested; in fact, I think I like that idea a lot. :D</div></div><hr />

Since pets dont catch agro anymore walking around, they could forage within their limited range and bring me rabbit meat, water, etc.<br />
<br />
I feel for druids.  I cant begin to estimate the numbers of times I have seen 60 druids with epics lfg getting passed over for hours. They just dont contribute enough.  I would really like to see them become an realistic replacement for most low risk exp grind groups where people dont normally need rezzes.<br />
<br />
I am still unclear why balancing any other class upwards always requires giving clerics more. Cause being a cleric is boring?  Well casting Cannabalize a half a million times is no fun either frankly.  Cause they are so one dimensional?  They are victims of lots of poor content design.  And I have no clue how to make clerics more interesting without giving them too much besides what has been mentioned already. They are way too indepensible now and are very easily broken. Some form of pet with short duration (angelic intervention with a cool graphic based on their diety?) could be a dot with a graphic form. But they dont really want gimp pets.  Sounds like too much programming anyway.  A upgraded banishment type spell line with level restrictions (w/o a component) could give them a real group control aspect.  (poof the added mob goes away, no exp, no loot, maybe they take damage casting it)  The ability to cast a frenzy type melee spell on themselves could be amusing. They get friggin plate armor so why not let them get hit some.  I have absolute faith that the cleric community will come out of this just fine regardless.<br />
<br />
For myself though, (L60 w/o torpor) it is tiresome to be the 4th best healer now after paladins. Since most don't expect to visit VP any time soon and torpor doesn't drop in reasonable rates anywhere else, a mini torpor really seems to be in order until the <br />
&quot;fixed&quot; drop rates catch up with reality.  A 4-1 ratio seems to be about right (200 mana for 800 pts). this allows for a profitable cannabalize conversion but not like the 6-1 with real torpor.  A 3-1 ratio is better served as a straight heal Chloroplast upgrade. <br />
<br />
I have not ever wanted to be the main healer, but I would like to reduce downtime better than I do.  Without repeating earlier suggestions, I would suggest as a unique spell line, shaman should be able to make sacrifices to the &quot;spirits&quot; to help people repair damaged faction. (to a max of dubious).</div></div><hr />

If torpor was non group heal alot of shamans would take advantage of that in PVP, thats why thay removed the effect on the robe of living fungus and put the staff to self only i think it was. since alot of monks snared people in pvp and such.</div></div><hr />

 If they would make Topor work outside a group then there would be no need for this spell.  Hell I would take the snare/slow off Topor (still group only) and be happy.   Still when Topor came out it was so broken in pvp. If you wanted to kill a person just cast it and its was a unresistable snare.<br />
<br />
I would much prefer more work on our dots resists and DD  but that just me.  <br />
<br />
Still a L60 paladin can Melee, Rez, and heal 700hps with a 1.5 sec. cast.    I dont see cleric's complaining about that one.<br />
<br />
Over all it would be a nice upgrade to the other Priest classes.</div></div><hr />

2) Half of the shamans don't want this heal, mostly cause they don't want to be made to use it in groups or on raids.<br />
3) Clerics want to be more rounded.<br />
<br />
Well hey that's kewl.  Personally I can think of many ways this heal could be applied by Yours Truly to make exp faster and better, to make raids on hard stuff go more smoothly, and to bring home more uber lewt at the end of the day!  That's positive . . right?  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if this goes live, clerics need FUN and interesting and more powerful upgrades to their damage capacity.  A useful pet is a step in the right direction.  More undead dots with better ratio . . more live-based dots, snare, and a decent root.  I dunno what they need for specifics, but they need something. <br />
<br />
finally, I'm interested in almost ANY change to the game at this point.  It's getting boring for me again, same old routine day in day out.  Dunno why I bother.  If they shook things up a bit it might change and get more interesting.  So yah I hope they keep these changes and add even MORE changes!

Clearly it is *WAY* too good to be level 54...Level 60 would be far more appropriate. 54 is probably because of the lack of 60s on Test to actually be able to scribe it.<br />
<br />
If I were a cleric (and I've spoken to serveral on the issue), I'd scream bloody murder about this. Cleric is THE most boring class in the game, and this spell would trivialize them straight out of it, except in very high end raids. What kind of game is that?<br />
<br />
If this does go live, clerics had better get some REALLY juicy upgrades...castable invis, undead killing AA (better than paladins), bash skill capped at 150, double attack capped at 100,  2-3 seconds taken off the cast time of CH, drop 50 mana off the cost of Judgement, and up the damage by 200 points, while making it a lure resist check, add 5 more mana/tick to the regen of blessed armor (and have FoS stack with blessed armor)....and a bunch of other stuff too.<br />

Verrant is doing this to cater ot the incessant verbal barrahe of whining, bitching and moaning coming from Druids. This is their way of politely saying shut up. if this *does* go live then it's pretty much advertising 'if you complain long enough, we'll give it to you' ... even if it blurs class lines and begins an unbalancing process. <br />
<br />
For a Shaman, I love this spell. It's a nice thing to have if you're on one of those Servers where Torpor is in a price range you'll never achieve. At the same time, they can remove all need for this spell by fixing the bloody Torpor drop. It's *that* simple. No need to unbalance the game. No need to cater to whining children. Any Druid worth their licks should know this spell is a little overpowering. The Dr00ds can take a long walk off a short cliff without lev.<br />

<br />
How am I supposed to make room for yet another spell, much less a heal spell that torpor + mage focus ring cast twice for same mana will accomplish?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Rashaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">I am personally shocked at all the Shaman out here that are opposed to this spell.<br />
<br />
Let me give you my background (54 shaman, 53 cleric, 53 druid)<br />
<br />
Here is the way that I see things:<br />
<br />
1. Shaman healing (pre-torpor) is not adequate to be considered a &quot;priest.&quot; Yes, we have slows and buffs, but we are by designation a priest class. We should not be the &quot;best&quot; of the healers, but IMO 2 druids or 2 shaman *should* be able to take the place of the &quot;best&quot; healer.<br />
<br />
2. Torpor is a myth for most people. It is over-priced, rare, and level 60 required to the point that 99% of all Shaman will never own this spell. AND, even with this spell, 2 shaman or clerics cannot heal the same as 1 cleric.<br />
<br />
3. This heal would be VERY difficult to be used in the same fashion as CH since it has a LONGER cast delay and heals for less total (more risk for less reward).<br />
<br />
4. Clerics will *still* be desired for all the things that they bring to the table (CH, celesital heal/elixir), buffs, rezzes, stuns). At least, I for one will continue to play my cleric if this spell goes live and will be SUPREMELY happy to have a druid or cleric cover my butt when I am OOM, LD, or getting beat on :)<br />
<br />
5. Why are class upgrades always bad? Who says this spell will be the last step in the priest class balancing act? Give VI some time and credit. I would fully expect some kind of balance for clerics.<br />
<br />
6. Honestly, would people be so up in arms if they had NOT reffered to the spell as Complete Heal? I think this only adds to the controversy less so than the spell stats.<br />

<br />
&quot;this wont make much of any difference for me.<br />
10 sec cast is simply too long, i am already busy enough as it is on raids and in grps, i will use it about excactly as i use superheal now(heal rampage/clerics/ripostes/ae), minus that i cant use it for healing mt, sure, a 2k heal might save him, but in the course of 10 sec's 3 sheals will have a larger chance of doing so i think. <br />
of course you could theoretically use 2 of us, dru/shm in that case to simulate a ch, usable for some mobs mebbe, but i dont see us doing this much.<br />
<br />
xp grps? hah hah hah, if i find myself with a full 10 secs to spare on a tank who really needs those 2k hp i'll be really surprised, it's just not feasible, we slow, then if noones died, we try to keep them alive, but by that time it's sheal or torpor, 10 sec wont make a slot for me often i think. of course, you could stack 2 shm's in a grp using this. 1 ch'er 1 slower, so in this case it's a good thing.<br />
<br />
torpor without limitations however..<br />
new spell or changes to old.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
notice this thing is on test tho :) theres no knowing it will go live in it's current form, or at all, they're simply /gasp, testing it out, which is a good thing, shows they are trying to fix things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">i wonder if any of the people saying they don't want it have ever been lacking clerics for a raid and had to call it off.....it SUCKS, and it's one of the worst things about EQ that you simply need clerics on boss mobs or it ain't happening. even vs. ST mobs or zlandicar you can't do it without clerics unless you have like 10 shamans/druids. it's stupid, and hopefully this will go live so that people won't be so bound to clerics.<br />
<br />
this won't even allow people to do even mobs like tormax without clerics, maybe not even vindicator....what it'll do is remove the 100 year old cleric requirement for an xp group (in a tough area) and make more raids happen.</div></div><hr />

Giving druids something like this might be ok, but not a 3k heal...give the druids what we would get, and give us a mini torpor.  <br />

It basically gives shamans a place in a cheal rotation as an insurance policy.<br />

Some parts of CT still require clerics, HoT/WWing armor farms also. If this change goes live, they won't be required anymore. Hell even solid AE groups won't need more than someone with access to a cleric for buffs/rez if something goes wrong. Druid will be good healer AND can cast a few good AE nukes/rains.</div></div><hr />

druids can no more be on ch rotations for big mobs with this than they could before, our 7k warriors routinely gets 6k+ cheals.<br />
smaller mobs, yes, maybe. but for the real ones? not a chance.<br />
<br />
and no, druids will not be more critical to raids than us, they will have a 3k heal, WE have a 75% damage reduction.</div></div><hr />

I think a few of these people who are screaming that its gam breaking and shouldnt go in arent reading the fine print. 75% max, big mana usage, 10 sec casting time? ROFL that is not going to replace a cleric EVER.</div></div><hr />

While its nice to Shaman and Druids, it might well invalidate Clerics, especially in single groups.<br />
<br />
I might get flamed for this, but in light of Druid and Shaman abilities and Clerics lack thereof, I think that is a stupid idea. <br />
<br />
True.  I play a 60 cleric.  I think this might be a big help on raids though.  <br />
<br />
I would think they're probably going to give some interesting new abilities to clerics.  It's about time.  Clerics are quiting in droves or switching to other classes.  A level 60 cleric main is becoming a rare find.<br />
<br />
I've often thought there's just too many classes in EQ, at least amongst the casters.  There's only so many useful things you can do on raids or in groups and you've either got to make classes really narrow so they don't overlap, then you're stuck a lot of time without a key function you need in a group or raid.  And really narrow classes are boring to play.   Having more overlap between classes gives you lots of flexibility and lots of roles to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">A common comment in here is that people won't need clerics anymore in XP groups.   so what?  XP groups don't need a druid or shaman either.<br />
<br />
Why should a group depend upon getting any one specific class?  XP groups need adequate healing to heal whatever damage is not mitigated by the other people present while the mobs are being killed.  An enchanter can handle the slows just fine in an XP group as long as the healer is not asleep at the wheel.  If you have a cleric or druid and a chanter, you don't need a shaman.  If you have a high taunt tank with a fungi tunic, 4 rogues and a bard, you probably don't need a conventional healer at all to do an xp grind.<br />
<br />
Any change that allows me to form my xp groups quickly and go hunt somewhere without stressing about getting any one particular class is an excellent change in my book.<br />
<br />
Many groups need a healer.  If you need one, there should be ways of forming your group such that whoever is available will be ok.  If you have a cleric, you can probably form your group just fine without a slower, so don't need to find a chanter or shammy.  If you have a shammy, you can probably do without an enchanter.<br />
<br />
The reality is that if you're forming a group with your friends, they're not going to tell their friend the cleric that they aren't welcome because some random shaman can do the healing and add a few DPS with their pets.  They're gonna invite the cleric to come do the healing since it's their friend or guildie.  If there's any change in group composition, it's going to be in pickup groups only.  If your friends tell you you're not welcome in their xp group, you need some new friends.<br />
<br />
The proposed spell is level 54.  How many people really are doing pickup groups as their primary form of XP at that level?</div></div><hr />

<br />
On one hand, I totally agree with you, one class should not have a reserved spot in a group that only seats 6 when there are 14 other classes vying for a spot.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, currently, clerics are group dependent.  I understand a cleric's point of view.  If a group takes a cleric and a druid or shaman are left out, oh well, off to solo, we at least have that option, clerics do not.<br />
<br />
I don't think it was ever a good idea for the game to have evolved where in a 50s exp group, one slot must be reserved for a single class. I was there, at level 51 (pre 51 sup heal) my little gheals could not keep up with the monster damage and in order for my group to continue doing the tough dungeon fighting we enjoyed, we HAD to get a cleric. It worked out well that it was a fun guildie who also needed a group, but we had to have a cleric. <br />
<br />
If they are working to re-balance the game so that groups do not NEED clerics (anymore than a group needs any other class) and clerics do not NEED groups (the same way a shaman would have the option to solo) I can only see this as a positive thing. <br />
<br />
I do see these proposed changes as an infringement on a cleric's role and I hope that clerics are recompensed accordingly. New nukes, new root that nukes can't break, the ability to silence, the ability to med standing up, the ability to give OTHERS the ability to med standing up, a lull line that actually worked...it will be interesting to see what they do. <br />
<br />
Any change that allows me to form my xp groups quickly and go hunt somewhere without stressing about getting any one particular class is an excellent change in my book.<br />
<br />
Once again, I do agree with you in theory, but I'm still not going to be happy about jumping up and down in glee on the toes of my cleric friends until I am reassured that they will also be balanced accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">Druids can have their 3k heal.<br />
<br />
I'd rather have DL at 58 than this joke of a spell, though.<br />
<br />
As for clerics, I stopped feeling sorry for them some time ago. Which isn't to say that I don't agree that their role is crap, and that they have a hell of a time soloing, and that their place in XP groups is getting reduced. But they aren't loud and whiny about it like necros, wizards and druids. Squeak + Wheel = Grease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">XP groups don't need a druid or shaman either.<br />
<br />
The point is that if an XP group doesn't need a druid or a shaman, the druid or the shaman can go solo. The cleric can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">I'm acutally for this change although I think the cap for both the druid and the shaman should be the same. Otherwise, it will result in more nerfing as time goes on...<br />
<br />
On the whole, shaman in early life was a viable healer as he started to get to 40's it was very clear that he was a second rate healer that should slow. Since shaman, druid were originally intended to be healers, it makes sence to give them that ability.<br />
<br />
On high level raid where some mobs are totally MR, it becomes clear that as viable healers, they can contriute more to the raid. I can see chain CH cycles where shaman can cast inbetween the Cleric  CH. Overall, I'm for it<br />
<br />
As for soloing.... Druid are king at outdoor kiting, Shaman can kill larger non MR mobs, clerics can kill undead mobs effectively. Of course if you don't pick the right mob to solo your one dead SOB but that goes without saying...</div></div><hr />
