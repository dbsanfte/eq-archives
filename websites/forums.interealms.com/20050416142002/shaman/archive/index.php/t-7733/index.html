<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried a lot of stuff with my Virus programm and a specific remover tool from symantec..it kept coming back or didn't go away:(<br />
<br />
The Virus name is: W95/Klez.H@mm<br />
<br />
And it does the following: It sends various eMails a day to ICQ or outlook adresse with virus attachments.. and i receive every day about 10 mail returned messages, because some of those adresses don't exist anymore. So this is my problem I run Win2k<br />
with the Outlook in it. I have a 2nd computer on a local network with cable, maybe that's interesting to know as well..<br />
<br />
Can someone help me out anyhow? I really need to get rid of this annoying bugger.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
allll the way at the bottom there is a removal tool, and manual instructions if the removal tool doesn't work. i am (was) in tech support and i have to say, i hate this thing. i have a friend who could not get it off her system and we had to format! manually removing this bastard takes editing the registry, so if you are not familiar with that, and the automagic removal doesn't work, you should seek out someone who can help you locally. or, if you have backups of stuff, just format.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately i tried actually those 2 removal tools already, both didnt find something to clean...the &quot;funny&quot; thing was that when I 1st ran the Symantec remover like 1-2 months ago it had detected a few infected files and repaired them.. since then when I run it it says clean, but it isnt..Maybe thats another Input for all you Virus experts out there:)<br />

Thanks again for your time!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rule #1 for virus avoidence: DO NOT USE OUTLOOK (express or normal)!<br />
<br />
there are many many many other tools out there, Netscape 7 being my favorite and what I have everyone on my networks using.  The only person that continues to use Outlook is the one person that is constantly getting viruses.<br />
<br />
On another note. Klez is very strange in that it's most visible symptom (the returned emails) can hit people that are not infected by the virus itself. I have had a number of people with clean systems get these for a few weeks when they never actually had the virus. My theory is that the virus tells SMTP servers that the from address is sometimes just an address on it's list not the originator. If this is the case it would explain why people get these returned emails when they were not infected but someone that knew them were, or after the virus has been removed from a given system.<br />
<br />
The best way I've found to keep your system virus clean is to format the machine and install Norton Anti-Virus 2002 or newer before doing anything. Then get all updates from MS.  After that download/install anything you need from known safe sites only and NEVER run any version of OUTLOOK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's spoofing, and klez does it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">try this online scanner,  it's pretty good one<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, if I had a penny for every tech call I got in the past few months that started &quot;I got an email from this guy I never heard of, that says I sent him this Kelz virus thing&quot;... well I probably would be able to play EQ full time. :p  Their systems invariably  check out clean.  It pulls a random address from the Outlook address book and spoofs it as the sending address. <br />
<br />
Good luck removing it.  If you've tried the removal tools and edited the appropriate registry keys already, I would just format (fdisk) and start fresh.  :p  <br />
<br />
To echo Mwinda, Outlook BAD.  Use Netscape or Opera or just about anything else.</div></div><hr />

Rule #1 for virus avoidence: DO NOT USE OUTLOOK (express or normal)!<br />
<br />
<br />
Bah, the #1 rule for virus avoidance is: DO NOT USE A COMPUTER OF ANY KIND.  I personally guarantee you will never get a computer worm, virus, or trojan if you religiously stick to this program.<br />
<br />
I use Outlook all the time and I have never had a virus problem.  I was infected once, it tried to send mail out using my address book, and I stopped it before any damage was done.<br />
<br />
If you do use Outlook,<br />
<br />
   1. Get rid of the &quot;preview pane&quot; and the message preview features.  They can prematurely open a message and give a virus a chance to run on your machine.<br />
<br />
   2. Turn off the option that automatically opens the next message when you delete a message.  Same problem as #1.<br />
<br />
   3. Get a virus scanner that works as an Outlook plug-in.<br />
<br />
   4. Tell Outlook never to mail anything to the server without you expressly hitting the button.  That way you can look at your Outbox, and if there's anything in there that you didn't send, you can delete it.<br />
<br />
If you're really paranoid,<br />
<br />
   5. Delete mail from unknown sources with &quot;suspicious&quot; titles without opening.<br />
<br />
Finally, DO run current virus software (I would avoid Symantec, I am very unhappy with their marketing scare tactics for their virus software) and DON'T open cutesy little attachments like Elf Bowling or whatever, just return to sender with a note saying you don't open executable attachments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kagbok Smash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've never had a problem using Symantec's removal tools.  You did run them in safe mode?  Also, what operating system are you using?  Win ME and Win XP may need system restore disabled otherwise the OS will put the virus right back in for you.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
McAfee also has a program that removes several of the more succesful viruses out now.  I don't know if this page is general access or not but I got it from http://vil.nai.com/vil/stinger/<br />
<br />
Klez is a mean one, but you should be able to get rid of it without wiping the drive.  Good luck.<br />
<br />
Edit :  Oops, missed where you said 2K.  Anyway, running symmantec's tools in 2K's safe mode has worked at my company without exception.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also if you want to remove klez you have to make sure you disable the system restore thing that windows me xp and 2k have. If you do not do this after the fix tool goes and does its thing your system will nicely make back up copies of the virus which will then reinfect your system.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fix klez tool on the norton site works for about 90 percent of the cases I get at work. Also run the fix klez tools in safemode there is a good chance if you are just running it in normal mode you have some applications running in the background that are always active hence non cleanble. Running in safe mode should guarantee that when you run the fix tool that is all thats running.<br />
<br />
<br />
Klez is pretty damn evil and I have run across about 10 instances where the system was simply not cleanable even after doing everything by the book and we were forced to reformat the hd and reinstall.<br />
<br />
I feel for you at the height of the klez outbreak I was cleaning about 20 to 30 puters a week with this and it is just a bugger to remove.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SimcimaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had this problem with Nimda.  What happens is that Norton detects the virus and then quarantees it.  The file is still there on your system.  Even when you tell Norton to delete it.  What you have to do is go into your Quarantine folder and manually delete all the files in there.  In W2k it's in your profiles folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Format your hard drive and start over.</div></div><hr />

Anyhow, we have 1 machine out of like 200 successful cleanups that simply will not clean up.  None of the Klez Tools detect it but our Corporate Norton does.  It has no registry entries or win.ini entries either. <br />
<br />
We had to reformat this one as well.  It is probably in your best interest if you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mythus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All good info from the previous posts but I'm curious about something.  You said you have 2 systems networked but you didn't say if you scanned the other system.  Klez very well could have spread to the other system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Good Point actually about the 2 systems, I will check it up right away. I never came to that idea because this is my Gf's Computer that she uses and we dont transfer any data. But I will look into that, thanks!<br />
<br />
What now if this system would be infected as well, disable Cable Connection and clean them both then reestablish conn?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with everything  weissblau typed.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mythus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Disconnect her system from yours and do a scan on each system.  Chances are one of her drives is infected and it keeps reinfecting your system.  It's a pain the the rear to do but I've seen Klez and Nimda sit on an unused system for months and then reinfect the network.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the most important thing is to be careful about what emails you open, or even view - there's a bug in outlook express that allows emails with certain scripts to run themself by just getting viewed. nasty bug, you should immediately check if you have the latest security updates and service packs (SP1, SP2, etc) installed from<br />

Norton antivirus did the job for me removing such a 'self-installing' worm. when i started certain programs it'd pop up an annoying meaningless box with some garble info and i couldn't run several programs. norton AV found all the infected files (had to be deleted/quarantined) and i haven't had a prob since.<br />
<br />
it has automatic updating of virus definitions and scans mails (in- and outgoing if you want) fairly fast and doesn't slow down your system or conflict with any programs i've tried so far<br />
<br />
i personally got a warez version off direct connect (good peer 2 peer program, www.neo-modus.com) but you could also buy it if you want (heh). comes with a year of free updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Phern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The problem is probably originating from your other networked computer. You Do not want to have an open share on a network this day in age. That includes your home network that &quot;should&quot; be safe. Klez, Nimda and other virus's look for open shares and install themselves on any computer that hasn't been infected and has an open share to the infected computer.<br />
<br />
In your case the 2nd computer probably got infected. Everytime you clean the first computer, the second computer checks the open share, sees it is not infected and reinfects it. This is how these types of virus's spread so fast in work place environments. It only takes one person to open a dubious piece of mail and wham, it spreads through the network.<br />
<br />
1) Change your shared to drives to password protected shared drives. Only share what you NEED to share. If it is your internal home network you can use super easy to remember passwords. I am unclear whether you can allow the computer to remember the password in the future. Knowing Microsoft, that will allow the virus to still access the share !?? The password protection will stop the virus and stop or hamper anyone who hacks into your system.<br />
<br />
2) Once the shares are password protected, reboot each machine, scan each computer and repair anything the scan finds. Reboot and rescan until you are satisfied each machine is clean. Since you have had so much trouble you might want to try scanning with multiple programs to verify the virus is gone.<br />
<br />
This worked at work when we got hit with the first virus of this type last year. We have had no problems since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Klez cracks me up because it randomly grabs a subject name and a sender from your system, then mails away.  I tend to get about 30 copies a day from people who have me in their address books (thank you IMAP based mail, shew); and because it randomly selects a name as the sender, I've gotten copies of Klez from my own address before, rofl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Unfortunately i tried actually those 2 removal tools already, both didnt find something to clean...the &quot;funny&quot; thing was that when I 1st ran the Symantec remover like 1-2 months ago it had detected a few infected files and repaired them.. since then when I run it it says clean, but it isnt..Maybe thats another Input for all you Virus experts out there <br />
<br />
<br />
Well the fact is that klez pretty much disables and/or hides itself from Anti-Virus software already loaded.  You should ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS re-install your anti-virus software after a virus has been found and removed.<br />
<br />
Like someone said, you should be running the removal tool in safe mode only.  I'd say un-install anti-virus.  Boot to safe mode.  Run the removal tool.  Running the removal tool in normal windows is your problem if that's what you did.  Klez is a very clever virus, and it works around things like that.  If you boot to safe mode, which loads with no drivers or software, the virus won't be running (since no startup operations are done at all in safe mode) and you can run the tool successfully.  After all that, it should find and remove what's left of it.  If not, then format.  That's the ONLY option.  If it does find it and remove, re-install norton, update, and off you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Klez will try to disable your anti-virus software if you try to remove it - I had 2 or 3 machines at work that got infected (rule 1 - machines don't just &quot;get infected&quot;, numbskulls cause them to become infected).<br />
<br />
If you download a new copy of your ant-virus software, it is vital that you boot your machine into safe mode before you install the software and it is important that once you install the software, you run a full anti-virus filescan before you reboot.</div></div><hr />
