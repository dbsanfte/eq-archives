<br />
Nobody is sure, just a lot of rumour. Has to be something big to be down this long. I wont panic too much about it or even get too mad if they at least give an explanation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's looking strongly like some database corruption.<br />
<br />
They are trying to restore previous database backups to try to fix the problem. When they get to the MOST recent database backup that isn't corrupted, they should be able to bring the game back online.<br />
<br />
Originally they said it would be a rollback to 7am PST yesterday, but if it was that simple it would already be done.<br />
<br />
I just hope it doesn't go back too far.<br />
<br />
There's mention in the chat rooms at SOE that they'll be reimbursing some time for all the players, and that they are eliminating XP and Tradeskill debt to compensate as well.<br />
<br />
Of course, I didn't have Xp debt or Tradeskill debt heheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://tinyurl.com/62sk6<br />

Apparently, looks like the rollback is further than expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL...One person's guess off the Torv boards:  <br />
<br />
&quot;SOE posted a job opening for a technical director of database managment thursday.<br />
<br />
Then, suddenly, on Friday the database is completely fuXX0red. Can anyone say disgrunteled employee?&quot;<br />

How so?  The devs have been posting updates just about on the hour since yesterday at like 1pm.  Now, that doesn't excuse how poor Sony's EQ2 forums responded to the traffic caused by every server being down though.</div></div><hr />

We wanted to thank you for your patience with the issues that we've needed to deal with over the last several hours. As a small token of our appreciation, we have increased experience gain for both adventuring and tradeskilling. This additional bonus will continue for 48 hours, starting with our normal update on Sunday morning at 7AM PST, and last until our update of Tuesday morning. Once again, thank you for your patience, and incredible support. <br />

<br />
Hourly updates for over 24 hours strait doesn't exactly scream poor communication to me.<br />
<br />
The fact that they chose to be vague about exactly what happened is certainly their own perogative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WaringMcMarrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that there was also a problem with HO's when I was playing on the test server during the down time there was a MoTD saying to not use them. However a lot of people still wanted to use them and the zones would constenly reset kicking everyone to the char select screen. This was also reported to happen when ever you tried to harvest tradeskill items but wasnt confiremd. I think that part of the reason the servers where down for so long was because one person could affect the game for so many people they just didnt think keeping the servers up would be  worth it.</div></div><hr />

That's a test server only issue with the big patch (TM).<br />
<br />
What happened on Thursday - I was unlucky to be on when it happened - was they put in a small patch in the morning.<br />
<br />
Well, if you logged in/zoned in to Antonica, Commonlands, or any other instanced zone, you instantly lost all your spells (except app 1)'s, your recipes, all your quests, your racial traits, your Call of Qeynos/Overlord, your racial bonuses....<br />
<br />
It was bad. Real bad. People were very unhappy and were unable to play.<br />
<br />
So they dropped the server about 2 hours later. Now I had been merrily doing alchemy and was fine, so I didn't realize there was a problem till right before they dropped the server - bah! <br />
<br />
They had to rollback, because those who had gone into Antonica/commonlands were totally screwed. Their database entries were just corrupted. <br />
<br />
I don't know why the rollback took so long. We were told in the beginning, 4 hours. Well, it took 26 for Unrest, and Perma was down another day after that... but at least everyone is intact and relatively okay. The happy fun extra xp day is quite nice, I've gained 1.75 levels  so far, plan to grind till the sun comes up tonight and see if I can get one more level. <br />
<br />
So far I've been fairly happy with this. In EQ1 we were mostly told &quot;tough&quot;. Well, this time, every chat room was moderated and moderators were trying to let people know what was going on. There was trivia sometimes. Hourly updates to the website. This moderator called Blackguard didn't go to sleep until about noon the next day, based on his posting times. Poor guy. And now to get 3 free days, and 2 days of happy fun extra xp - well, it's very nice way to make up. Because free days mean little to me- the time I didn't get to play is worth more than the cost of my sub. But extra xp, means I can accomplish over these 2 days what I didn't get done during that... well not questwise, but xp and levelwise and tradeskill wise.<br />
<br />
I think they did a good job this time. I'm usually all for Sony bashing but I've been fairly happy with the way they handled this crisis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That's very interesting.<br />
<br />
The &quot;resetting&quot; issue was something they saw on Test.  In fact, it may have been something they did on Test on purpose.  Not sure how that snuck over to the Live servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It was a pretty nice thing for me overall. Since this is the busy holiday season the wife and I haven't have time to logon all week, so we lost nothing.<br />
<br />
Then we logon yesterday and get bonus XP! After a few hours we dinged level 22 AND level 23 and 50% of the way to level 24!<br />
<br />
We'll logoff at level 25 tonite and probably not get on for another week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>WaringMcMarrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lol well I guess my trip just came at an unlucky time then since I will miss that nice XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The extra XP is great for adventurers who are also tradeskillers since each equal level final combine gives about 1.5yellows! :)<br />
<br />
Funny though that there were actually a lot of people saying thanks for the downtime since it gave them some time to go do other things.</div></div><hr />

I think it says more about the relative maturity of the average EQ2 player when compared to...competing titles.<br />
<br />
*Ahem* :)<br />

<br />
<br />
I must say I've been really impressed not only with Sony's CS with EQ2 but also with the community. Reading most EQ2 boards anytime there's someone whining about something they're going overboard about it's always responded by at least 10 other people telling him/her to shut up and enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
As for the screw up on Friday, it sucked but well I just went out and got part of my Xmas shopping done. Then yesterday with the XP bonus I managed to go from levels 21-23 just soloing/questing. Gonna log in in  a bit and see if I can get to 25 before the XP bonus runs out tomorrow morning. :)</div></div><hr />
