<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stanton Bowmaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This next sunday I will be leading a raid into the Hole for myself and a few other Rangers to do our turn in to Jaeil the Wretched. I'm expecting 2 to 3 groups of 50plus folks with a few 60s helping out as well. I've also got a little Brell-worshiping Rogue running around in there scoping out the path and the mobs and trying to get an idea of how to pull this off.<br />
<br />
There was a great guide on the zone that was posted on our guild website some months ago, but it seems that the page is gone now. It had great information on pathings and pull spots and good info to keep everyone safe during the crawl. Does anyone perchance know of a repost somewhere, or perhaps a guide comparable?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
