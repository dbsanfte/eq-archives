<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to start by saying that I really hadn't planned on buying this game.  There really is no specific reason that I chose to try it out.  In fact, the very fact that I couldn't really find anything besides the one post on this board from a couple weeks ago is what prompted me to write out my feelings- to help people make an &quot;informed&quot; decision with their money and time.<br />
<br />
I will also preface this by saying that I cancelled my EQ account around march of this year, although I did continue to log in every few weeks for a couple hours to chat with a friend that had taken over my account.  So I wasn't &quot;driven&quot; to WoW or anything silly like that.  My intent isn't necessarily to bash EQ, although I WILL  bash EQ.  If my EQ-bashing is going to offend you, just click back now and save us all the time.  I will be doing constructive bashing, but it's going to be bashing nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Finally, before I go into discussion about WoW, I want to say that when I first started EQ, I was impressed by the game.  It was about the beginning of 2001 that I started, and the newness really drew me in.  However, as time went on, there wasn't anything new about EQ to me.  Encounters were roughly the same, although there were different MOBs and different group compositions, but the overall theme was pretty much the same.  This repetition is what ultimately drove me from EQ as it just wasn't fun anymore.  I'll go into a better discussion about this later, but for now, yes, I DO realize that WoW will eventually be the same way (at least, I assume it will).<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
I bought the game last night.  I debated between the collector's edition and the regular box.  The price difference isn't a huge drawback, but I couldn't justify the extra $30.00 for the pet.  I'm sure the other extras (map/artbook/etc.) are nice, but the only long term benefit I saw was the pet, and I don't know if that will be as big of a thing by end-game anyhow.  I've seen one person with a mini diablo pet so far, and they were running away from me towards another town, so I can't comment on what benefit (if any) there is to pet ownership.  Also, for my night elf, I am able to purchase a pet owl for 50 silver (which is a steep price currently - level 11).  So, while it might not be as good as a zergling, at least there are options for pets in game without the extra $30 expenditure.<br />
<br />
When I got home, I installed the game, which actually took quite a bit longer than I expected.  I guess 4 GB of files being installed on your computer via (4) CDROMs takes a while.  It did give me time to peruse the manual a bit and decide upon what class/race to choose (more on that later).  I then created my account and signed onto the server.  At this point, there was a patch, but it was only 19.2 MB.  Since I have dial up and because it was late, I decided to let it patch while I slept for the night.  I think it took an hour to download the patch.  When I woke up, I logged back on and chose my server (normal server - PVP servers were VERY crowded by the way).<br />
<br />
This brings me to my first EQ vs WoW moment.  Load times.  There isn't any load time.  Well, okay, there is, but I haven't noticed more than one minute of load time upon first logging into the game.  After that point, I don't think you ever load; I haven't in the 9 hours of play I've had.  Even after you die you don't load, and you will die, but I'll discuss that later.  Conversely, EQ has the most horrendous load times of ANY game I've ever played.  I guess the higher polygon count models and other stuff makes for this, but really it gets to be excessive when you run from point A to point B and spend more time loading than actually running.  Some zones are almost instant load, but others (POK anyone?) can take more than a few minutes depending on the number of people in the zone or what trees the zone has.<br />
<br />
When I first arrived in the game world for the first time, I was actually pleasantly surprised.  I've been expecting cartoon world, but other than the PCs and NPCs, everything is pretty realistic looking.  If nothing else, the graphics for the landscapes are ON PAR with EQ, although I think they are better.  As far as the PC and NPC animations, who cares?  The humans in EQ don't look human just as much as the humans in WoW don't look human, and there aren't elves, trolls, ogres,vah shir, tauren, erudites, high elves, wood elves, etc. in real life anyway.  The whole &quot;I can't play a game with 'cartoon' graphics&quot; argument is pretty BS anyway.  I found the graphics to be relatively high quality in any case, and the main thing is they do the job and they don't detract from gameplay (for example in EQ, the 3rd person rotations where you see inside your head if you are too close to a wall).<br />
<br />
Speaking of gameplay, this is the one area that really shines.  First, the game is FUN to play.  You don't just hit auto attack and then eat lunch/watch tv.  Well, okay, you COULD do that in WOW, but battles are over pretty quickly (solo), and every class has unique abilities that they can employ (casters cast, melees have special abilities).  I'm still pretty low level so things could change, but I really think that battle length will remain about the same throughout the non raiding portion of the game.<br />
<br />
Second, quests are integrated into leveling.  Yes, you can level up to 60 and probably never do a single quest, although I think you have to do a few to advance to new areas.  In any case, there are always tons of quests that you can take on at any given moment.  I have yet to not be involved in at least one quest, and as I advance in level, NPCs start getting new quests for me to work on.  Most of the quests so far have been collect items or slaughter X-number of monsters or find the NPC.  However, quests have been very straight foward so far.  For example, in EQ when you get a collect X-number of items quests, how many hours do you spend killing until you finally get ONE item to drop?  Anyone who's ever done the coldain prayer shawl quests, how many wurms did you slaughter before you got your glowing wurm biles?  Yeah, we all know those lucky SOBs that found them on the first kill(s) (maybe you ARE that lucky SOB), but the rule of EQ is quest pieces are rare.  So rare, in fact, that you are likely to spend more than 2 hours to complete a simple quest where there is NO reward whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The opposite to the EQ quest is the WoW quest.  First, you KNOW what reward you are going to get in WoW, it tells you when you first sign up.  If you don't want the downgrade piece of cloth armor or the shoddy beaten up hammer, you simply don't accept the quest and save your time.  EQ?  Yeah..you don't know what the quest reward will be.  Usually its an amount of experience that you can't even tell you got and probably an item that is worse in quality than what you got when you first created your character in 1999.  However, EQ did get better after Luclin as far as quest rewards go  Second, you know what you need to do for a WoW quest.  The downside is it does take some of the mystery out of the quest (perhaps more advanced quests aren't quite the gimmies?); however, at least you know the quest is either working or broken.  In EQ more often than not, the quest is probably broken and that is why you can't figure it out.  Third, there is a story line tying all the quests together.  Does EQ even have a storyline?  In fact, the storyline is good enough that you don't really think about how you are leveling.<br />
<br />
This then is my third gameplay issue.  You aren't playing the game to get level-X, you are playing to advance the story.  Leveling is a by-product of your time in the game.  EQ is the opposite of this, you log on specifically to gain a new level or AA point (or raid).  EQ becomes a job that you pay to have, and this is where a lot of people become disenchanted with EQ I think.  Every race in WoW has a different storyline to follow (possibly different classes have different storylines within those races, though I'm guessing this is only at the upper levels 30+).  This means there are at least 8 times to play the game before you will be done with the storyline.  Then there will be raid events to participate in.  Frankly, I'm a little wary about this part of the game as I think it ruined EQ when you started getting the disparity between the haves and have-nots.  In the end, its a necessary part of the game; I just hope blizzard does it better than sony.<br />
<br />
Fourth, equipment.  In EQ you have no chance to upgrade your equipment outside of loot camps or raid kills (quests in EQ, by nature, ARE one of these two categories).  Before the tradeskill revamps, you could either buy from a vendor or buy the exact same item from someone who tradeskilled it.  If you wanted a good item, you had to camp somewhere and loot it, although this has slightly changed in EQ today.  In any case, in WoW, you start with a weapon that is good enough to fight off the low level monsters.  You then upgrade that weapon within the first 5 levels with a quest to prepare you for the next 5-10 levels.  During this time, you may find a weapon that will be even better as loot, but you can count on quests to provide your weaponry.  Also, Tradeskills represent logical upgrades in WoW already!!  Granted I haven't seen end game gear, but EVERYTHING is level restricted  or soul-bound (no-drop) anyway, so it hardly matters if better gear exists at the upper end.  The game is meant to be played with what you can get by playing it (not by farming it and twinking).  I think this is a great balance concept, and it should lead to less mudflation in WoW.<br />
<br />
Fifth, tradeskills offer advancement for your character and gear upgrades or beneficial effects.  Combines are skill restricted.  For instance, you need level 45 tailoring before you can make a bag (this is the level at which you are trained to make the item).  Recipes are either bought in this fashion or found as quest rewards (all upper end recipes are quest rewards).  The interface is almost exactly like the new EQ interface, but slightly better.  I don't think you can fail a combine.  Therefore, the only limitation on WoW tradeskills is you need to have a certain level of skill, be a certain level and have the necessary components.  The only other factor is time as all combines have a casting time during which you cannot move.  The glaring downside is you can only master two tradeskills in addition to cooking and fishing(you ARE able to unlearn a skill though).  As a certified tradeskill masochist, I'm disappointed in this decision and I hope they reverse this stance, but I will survive if they keep it as is.  Tradeskill gear is also soul-bound on equip (attuneable).<br />
<br />
Sixth, death is only temporary.  You don't lose levels.  I don't think you even lose experience.  Resurrection spells are simply a way to gate back to your corpse rather than run back.  Trust me, you will die.  You will also be glad that there is no EQ CR.  I don't care if people think it dumbs down the game, CORPSE RUNS ACROSS MULTIPLE ZONES ARE NOT FUN!!!!!  Why should there be an unfun aspect of a game??  I would describe death in WoW as a learning experience or a minor inconvenience.  Death in EQ goes from a minor inconvenience to a major catastrophe depending on what zone and where and who you know and what time it is.<br />
<br />
Finally, everyone can solo!!!  My night elf priest has no issues soloing monsters his level or lower, and sometimes can take monsters up to a couple levels higher one on one.  If the healer class of the game can solo, everyone should be able to.  Downtime, what's downtime?  Yeah, I know you were thinking that there has to be a catch, but there isn't!  Downtime is a max of 18 seconds, and that is going from 1hp/1mana to full.<br />
<br />
Now for the bad.  There are moments of lag lock up for me.  This is probably because the servers are being crowded by hordes of people wanting to try the game (and also due to my dial up :) ).  However, I lag worse in EQ.  Its only bad because its an annoyance at times.  I've only died once due to lag related causes, and there were two on me so I was probably going to die anyhow.<br />
<br />
Monsters are mostly variations of the same model just slightly bigger with a different name.  However, I've been in only one area of one race's starting position on the map.  This doesn't bother me; I could handle it if all the NPCs were human models (ala EQ glitches) though, so this might bother other people.  It's too early to judge this though; I'm sure things change past level 20.<br />
<br />
Hard to find groups.  Its still early.  Every class can solo.  People like to explore without the limitations of a group and get the maximum loot.  Frankly, to me this isn't a problem yet as its easy to solo (hoping this is true to 60).  This doesn't imply there is no risk, but one of the advantages is that risks are more of an annoyance than say...breaking into plane of fear when fear was an endgame zone of EQ.<br />
<br />
$14.99 a month charge.  These seem to keep getting higher as time goes on<br />
<br />
My final thoughts are the game is definitely worth a try.  I have yet to run into anything that isn't fun about the game.  Everything runs smoothly.  Quests are integrated seamlessly into leveling, and often you are more concerned with finishing a quest than finishing your level.  There aren't spell levels like in EQ, you usually get a new ability every or every other level.  There are also quite a few dungeons that I've come across.<br />
<br />
I did choose a priest and love it.  My reasoning was that I wanted to be good aligned, and I wanted to have a place on raids assuming they resemble EQ (not taking any chances!).  I think I've covered my experiences up to level 11 as a night elf priest pretty well.  If anyone wants more info/sys req's/advice/etc.  I will answer any questions posted or PMs.<br />
<br />
PS  I will be ignoring flames.<br />
PPS I won't be returning to EQ.  In fact, it was deleted off my HD last night!<br />
<br />
*Note:  I was told by a friend that EQ2 is almost identical to WoW.  The main differences are every race can be every class, more micro customization of your character, steeper system requirements, more &quot;polished&quot; graphics and you can die doing tradeskills! (no, I'm not making the last one up!)*</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought zone times used to be reasonable (cable connection) but they got broken with the infamous DX9 patch from 8 months ago, especially PoK, Bazaar, Emerald Jungle, Trakanon's Teeth. The worst thing is, they've never even tried to fix it.<br />

<br />
<br />
There is sort of a death penalty where you loose about 10% of durability on your armor per death (not in pvp), but that is still OK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The best thing about this game from a fun stand point right now is the complete lack of downtime. After spening my first 30 whatever levels staring at that damn book in eq I would never start another game with tons of built in down time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good post, Ruatonim, thanks! I was going to buy the game based on the bet afeedback, but hesitated on Wednesday while reading about the launch problems. Installing it as I type :)</div></div><hr />

Low downtime and small death penalty encourage exploration and 'risk taking'.  As mentioned the multizone/ near impossible CR's often took the fun out of a days play.  I recently watch ~30 folks spend an afternoon and lose a couple of rezes doing CR's in fear due to the irebound imp and company camping corpsed at iz.  Was not fun for anyone.<br />
<br />
Waiting to see if WoW is still fun a month from now or just boring.  I have high hope that it will be  fun.</div></div><hr />

Yes, EQ2 has a great tradeskill system.  It kind of follows the class/subclass progression.<br />
<br />
1-9 Artisan<br />
<br />
At 9 you can chose a &quot;class&quot;<br />
<br />
10-19 Craftsman, Outfitter, Scholars<br />
<br />
At 19 you chose a &quot;subclass&quot;<br />
<br />
20+ Craftsman can go Provisioner, Carpenter, Woodworker.  Outfitters can go Tailorer, Armorer, Weaponsmith.  Scholars can do Alchemy, Sages, Jewelers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, say i'm smithing.  I'm in the middle of a combine (these take a few minutes sometimes) and I get a flare up.  I have to combat the flare up with a certain skill relative to blacksmithing to put it out.<br />
<br />
You can get minor, major, etc. flare ups and such.  I was smithing earlier, and went to get a drink, and I came back dead after taking 500 damage from my forge exploding or something.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, seeing a gnome's charred corpse fall to the floor behind you makes the 50 dollars for EQ2 soooo worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This then is my third gameplay issue. You aren't playing the game to get level-X, you are playing to advance the story<br />
<br />
<br />
nice comment.  going through the game the first time, wow feels half-like daoc, and half-like you're playing Warcraft RTS through the storyline.  blizzard has certain strengths and among that is their ability to immerse you into what is honestly a very shallow story.<br />
<br />
in short, warcraft stories have always been pretty hack.  completely derivative from all sorts of sources and not very consistent, but because of such excellent presentation, you really do end up giving a damn about the plight of the fallen kingdoms, the struggle of the orcs against the darkness etc.<br />
<br />
it's the same playing wow, as you level up, the quests are integrated into the storyline.  the quests themselves, pretty much suck.  if you're alliance it's very very easy and quick delivery quests over and over.  horde side it's all about stalking and killing 50 creeps in the wild by yourself to get 5 rare drops... wow contributes nothing to the genre in terms of innovations for quests, but you do them anyways just to read the story when you complete it.<br />
<br />
some of the races are done better than others... due to the fact that blizzard lost so much of its team during development of the game (and all tge original team leads... leading to new leadership in programming, design, AND administration) so some of the content is far superior to others.  ive leveled both alliance and horde to 60 in various closed, stress and open tests and i'd say for a competent gamer with knowledge playing alliance should yield you about 25% more levels across the board.<br />
<br />
some of the storylines are quite good... tauren actually aren't bad, obviously human and dwarven plots are good.  trolls have basically nothing, and orcs imo are sadly weak in plotting.  however for my money the best storyline by FAR is the undead... there's a lot about how these survivors have had to leave their humanity behind.  they have memories but no emotions.  they can feel the loss of their past lives and loved ones but cannot grieve for them.  there's a lot of really cool quests driven by revenge, lost loves, torn families and a number where you can see that as undead the race IS losing its humanity and will eventually turn completely to evil despite whatever free will they think they have.<br />
<br />
... as a word to those out there.  there's been a lot of PR out there about how wow is all about quests, how you get a quarter to half your exp from quests etc.  wow IS a normal MMPOG with more dressing and polish than other games.  the fastest way to level IF THAT IS IMPORTANT to you is to grind.  the fastest levelers by FAR in both stress tests and open beta were people who did only the most basic quests for key upgrades and otherwise grinded creeps 95% of the time.  the difference is dramatic.  you had solo mages and warriors lvl 40, 45 while people who did quests had a median level of around 20-25.<br />
<br />
it's a boring way to play.  but if you want to get through the content to doing actual instances and raids (BRD, BRS, Strath, Scholo, molten core and onyxia) that's the way to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">about tradeskills... they are important.  and leveling them is completely integrated with exp.  just killing the appropriate level mobs or running around doing even level quests will necessarily lead you past the appropriate resources.<br />
<br />
for example around lvl 10-15 runnign around in the barrens you'll see a ton of copper and tin veins right by the named mobs you're supposed to kill<br />
<br />
furthermore, tradeskills in WoW are very simplistic and shallow.  compared to other mmpog it does NOT take a lot of effort outside of plain exp.  other than engineering it doesn't take a lot of money.  I'd recommend picking up 2 trades by the time you hit your second town (around lvl 7-8) and running with it  first aid is a must if you're a melee class and it's retardedly easy... with runecloth you can heal thousands of HP in 6 seconds.  get that unless you're grinding trying to be the first lvl 60 &lt;class&gt; on your serve and absolutely have no time<br />
<br />
the items you can create in later levels (with alchemy, blacksmithing, enchanting, engineering) are quite good.  eventually, once servers are mature, EVERY developed character will have 2 maxed tradeskills, might as well do it as you go and enjoy the benefits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">also unless yer gay play horde.<br />
<br />
in every stage horde players were 10x better across the board than those alliance zerg<br />
<br />
as they used to say on the pvp server... &quot;people who want easy things play alliance.  people who want to kill those people play horde.&quot;<br />
<br />
i think it's the ease of the early alliance quests and the proximity of all those other players that teaches alliance players crappy playing habits.  compare that with horde, where the land area is huge and empty, and you're forced to go out on your own and survive on your own killing mob after mob to finish your quest.<br />
<br />
i dont know how many times ive seen a horde member sneak into a camp, kill a quest npc and his guard then sneak back out, meanwhile the same quest with alliance involves 30 minutes of spamming for 8 people to do the same quest then it's a mass of people training, zerging and dying to kill the same mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can die doing tradeskills in EQ2? That's the coolest thing I've ever heard about the game, they should put that on the back of the box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So, which is which?<br />
<br />
The differences I listed were what EQ2 does differently, although I'm sure I didn't list them all :)<br />
<br />
I wanted to add just a little more of my experiences with the game so far.  First, my friend started on the server that I started on just recently.  He started off as a gnome warlock, so I decided to run to gnome town to join up with him.  Travel can be pretty lousy in the beginning of the game.  The nice part is roads are (mostly) free from enemies in friendly territories.  As you travel around, you unlock &quot;waypoints&quot; that you can use to fly from point to point for a fee.  I believe mages can teleport you to certain zones as well, and I'm sure there are other methods of transportation (such as the tiger mount I want to buy for my night elf :) ).<br />
<br />
I ran for about an hour and a half before I realized that I was going the complete wrong way.  Hearth stones- LOVE THEM!  Basically, its a device that allows you to gate back to the city that you bound at once every 60 minutes.  The good part of my exploration is the fact that you get experience for discovering new zones.  So my hour and a half wasn't completely wasted.<br />
<br />
The one thing I've noticed is group experience is somewhat dismal.  You get around 33% of the normal experience, but you kill about 50% faster (this was as a duo).  So you're losing about 33% experience per unit of time invested.  I guess it is nothing new that you get less experience grouped than solo, and this was only as a group of two, maybe groups of more is better (I don't know).<br />
<br />
I did die once near the orc starting city (during my wrong-way run) and spent about 10 minutes running back to my body since I was so far from the nearest graveyard, but that has been the worst thing that has happened from dying.  On the bright side, you are free to explore as you wish while dead as nothing can see nor kill you, although you usually cannot see monsters or players either- just the layout of the land.<br />
<br />
The one game that I'm reminded of as I play WoW is Baldur's Gate.  So if you, like me, have played this game and loved it, you will enjoy WoW!  I'm still having a blast on WoW and can definitely see myself starting a new race after I hit 60 and finish the quests with my night elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">wow contributes nothing to the genre in terms of innovations for quests, but you do them anyways just to read the story when you complete it.<br />
Not true.  Check out the quest from Ratchet to retrieve Tubers for one of the goblins there.  Although I have yet to go out and do the quest (I'm level 24 and it's an elite red quest to me at present), the description of it and instructions to accomplish it are nothing like any other quest I've ever heard of.<br />
You have a crate with a pet pig inside of it.<br />
You use your control stick on the piggy to tell him to go sniff out tubers in an area of the map.  Doing so will make the pig run off towards the nearest tuber assuming one is within 50 feet of you in game.  Using the stick again will make the pig return to you.<br />
You have to wander the area, making your pig sniff out the hidden tubers in the ground, while avoiding/killing the enemies, and keeping your pig from running off too far into trouble.<br />
<br />
I've also participated in a raid of NPCs on a night elf encampment in Ashenvale.  There's an orc leader and his 3 lackeys hiding in some bushes that are just about to attack a small fort across the path to kill the leader.  You can choose to join them, and doing so, they run across the path and engage the camp.  You clear out the building, only to find the leader jump you from behind with some reinforcements.  You end up having a 5 on 4 or 5 on 5 fight between the orc NPCs and the night elf NPCs.  I haven't tried it, but I bet that I can cast healing spells on the orc allies during the fight, if you want to do something other than nuke or try to CC some of the enemies.  I know that if I do the first damage to the mobs, and the pack of orcs kill the mob I get the xp still.  It's kind of like the Ring War, but you actually participate in the battle, as opposed to just invising through the whole thing and ganking the named solo *yawn*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This morning, i met up with this dude, we talked about weapon training and decide to have a adventure and take a run across 2 continents to irforge where we could train. It was a exciting and dangerous run where we met up with a mage that escorted us through some of it. We go to ironforge and took a tram ( very cool ) to stormwind ( sp? ) and from there took a griffon ride for a mere 50 cp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Absolutly adventurous and fun, this land of WoW is very large and can accomidate much wandering and with being able to fight for contested land i dont see myself getting bored soon. I just hope we can build fortresses and defend them, i know warmachines are coming soon. Things look very promising for this game to do well, i mean its only the first week :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The biggest &quot;innovation&quot; to me in the quest system is the UI.  It's wonderful.  Everything is right there; it's customized to show you your current progress; you can tell where to go to do the quest, who to see, everything.  And if you highlight the quest in your log, the relevent NPC is highlighted on your local compass-map.  Amazingly great UI design on someone's part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you're talking about the tuber collect in RFK.  again, it's just window dressing.  in wow, the game engine treats quest objects as non-mobile mobiles.  in other words quest items spawn just like mobs when certain triggers or met or in time intervals.  for example, if you have a quest where you have to go draw water from the well for an npc.  when you arrive at the well, you'll see a &quot;bucket&quot; or &quot;well&quot; stationary NPC that you can click on.  when you click on it, the mob basically &quot;dies&quot; and you loot the item off the corpse.<br />
<br />
the tuber quest uses the gopher to trigger spawns of the tuber mobs but other than that it's a straight collect.<br />
<br />
in wow there's a very limited number of types of quests:  kill missions, item collects, escort and delivery<br />
<br />
that's more than EQ, because due to EQ's MUD engine basically quests are all about invisible flags but it's not innovative in the category... for example city of heroes, swg, even daoc have all had elements in progression of the above.<br />
<br />
in fact, I'd say in terms of drop rates and particularly collects, wow reminds me VERY much of daoc.  i believe some of the designers from daoc did a lot of alliance quests</div></div><hr />

yeah i like wow.<br />
<br />
how's is it that in your book knowing what the quest reward is is somehow innovation?  that's like saying a quest is innovative because they grey out when you're too high for them...<br />
<br />
the most innovative thing has to do with UI but it's not anything blizzard programmed.  it's player run<br />
<br />
if you haven't already go right now and download cosmos.  it's a player-developed UI tool that makes everything in the game completely customizable.  even the devs use cosmos on their own toons<br />
<br />
second.  thottbot.  this is an incredible data mining tool that plugs into cosmos to pull exact information from the game as you encounter people and items.  it tracks drop rates, mob locations, quest triggers and dialogue, maps, everything that you encounter in game.  it's developed by an old friend of the Crucible and a number of players on the pvp server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well coming from eq I never knew what i was getitgn for a quest. Not exactly anyway. You would not know intermediate rewards and saying that i will receive a &quot;Great Sword&quot; doesn't help. Here we see if the quest is worth doing. For example when i run into quests that offer very little cash and only cloth armor i write down the place for my warlock but i skip the quest on my shaman. In eq you would have to do the quest.<br />
<br />
Also<br />
<br />
Thottbot is a bad idea. I mean listing items is one thing but it's starting this whole number crunching business that ruined some aspects of eq. We do not need to know drop chance as a %. But sweatshops that farm in other countries do. You see where this is going.<br />

It sounds like you are trying to draw a line between quest content and quest mechanics.<br />
<br />
Coming from a simple EQ background, the things you mentioned were innovative.  Listing rewards up front, greying out to indicate a trivial quest...those are all new to me.  As well as the way they handle quest objects.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they existed in other games first, I dunno...but new to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Knowing the quest reward and some description of w.t.f. you actually have to do is a blessing.  If you don't think so, there is something wrong.  In other games you were simply forced to look at a 3rd party site to find the needed information anyway, WoW simply saves you that step.  Even with this knowledge, I'd have to say that I've still spent a lot of time trying to figure out exactly where it is you have to go, etc., it's not like there is a glowing path like in the bazaar to help you.  <br />
<br />
Btw, I am finding a lot of the collect quests to be quite annoying in terms of drop rates.  Particularly doing collect quests as a group, sheesh :-\.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think I've spent more than an hour in 18.5 levels of doing collection quests actually trying to collect the pieces.  Now this was all done solo, so I imagine a group would have to double, triple, etc. the time needed.  I was somewhat surprised when I did a collection quest with a friend and we both had to collect the pieces; I was under the impression that a shared quest would share the collection, but maybe its too hard to code for the contingency of a group member leaving a partially completed quest with none of the items needed.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that the drop rate is reasonable as long as you don't spend more than 2 hours solo or grouped to do a collection quest.  However, this is coming from someone who did the shawl quests in EQ.  I farmed pieces for about a week for the sixth shawl only to fail the combine.  I did this FOUR times (that is a month of farming), before finally giving up on the game.  There were also quests that you paid an NPC to do the combine for you and the NPC could fail!<br />
<br />
On a side note, I think the AI is pretty impressive in WoW.  I was rooted by an archer MOB who then proceeded to run out of melee range and pelt me with arrows.  Of course, she didn't fare too well in her strategy since I was a caster and just rained starshards on her head, but she put up much more of a fight than if she had stuck around in melee range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Odd...the drops have always been pretty quick.  For the quests I've done it seems like at least 1 in 4 drop whatever we need, respawns are very fast, and there are a lot of mobs.  I don't think my group of 3 has ever spent more than 30 minutes killing mobs to get all of our drops.<br />
<br />
Of course, it may vary based on zone/level/etc...we're in the mid teens now playing Horde races.<br />

hey bro<br />
<br />
if you're talking about coming from eq, then the most innovative aspect of wow quests is the fact that they aint busted!  they work lol<br />
<br />
what's great about wow quests is just how they're implemented.  man you spend a couple minutes with npcs and they're your friends due to being so well written<br />
<br />
there's one quest in the crater off tanaris where this goblin has passed out near a volcano and you need to get him back to town.  it's a straight escort (pretty easy too... compared to similar level escorts which I sent a couple feedbacks on).  what makes it great is the goblin's personality.  he's very weak so he keeps passing out from the heat as he's walking.  before you can trigger the quest you need to get a canteen off another npc.  so the escort consists of him constantly passing out, and you have to feed him water to revive him.  he's very nervous so the entire way he's &quot;are we there yet?  I'm too weak can you carry me???&quot;<br />
<br />
whereas in eq, a similar sort of quest would be tedious, blizzard makes their quests fun with real personality.  you feel like you're getting to know the world as you do the quest.</div></div><hr />

collect quests are the most painful.  typically, there are 4 types.  first is the rare drop like the tiger/shadow panther quest in stranglethorn.  rare drops are 2-5% i'd estimate.  for that quest people kill anywhere from 20-100 (literally) tigers before they get the drop<br />
<br />
most commonly, there's the uncommon drop.  it's hard to estimate but i'd say 1/2 or 1/4 of mobs drop this.  typically these are the collect 10-15.  these are the fastest.<br />
<br />
then there's the high collect/uncommon drop.  these things demand lots of drops 20-30 but typically this quest is meant to be done over time and overlap with other quests you're concurrently doing.  for example, in your 30s you'll have 5-7 troll-killing quests you work on, all the trolls have a chance to drop teeth.  you need to collect a buttload of teeth, but the quest itself is a sort of bonus for completing the arc of quests<br />
<br />
finally there's the imobile mob collect.  this collect requires you to explore/infiltrate an area and collect items off inanimate objects guarded by creeps.  for example, when you need to collect eggs from the glass spiders in lower blackrock spires in your high 50s.  these collects are anywhere from 5-15 or so.  but typically each inanimate &quot;nest&quot; will yield from 1-3 individual drops<br />
<br />
couple other things.  blizzard improved the looting system so that if grouped, you have a better chance of getting drops, so that each mob will be eligible to load a drop if anyone in the party is doing a particular quest.  for me however, it's more efficient to do collects solo.  in general it's best to group up for higher con kill/delivery/escort quests and go solo on even/lower collects.<br />
<br />
of course if you play horde just about every quest pre-20s is a collect... even after 3 revisions of barrens.  you'll definitely level slower than alliance side at those levels... but in the long run I think it's okay.  you'll end up better at your class and probably ahead on tradeskills by the time you hit contested lands</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm that's a sort of specious distinction.<br />
<br />
even when there were 1000 people playing the game, I dont think anyone ever went through all their quests alone.  although I'll admit at times I was ahead of the curve and it did seem like there was no one else in the world had done the my quests.  like the time I spent 3 hours looking for the npc for the call of water shaman quests in blackthorne ridge.  what's worse is, at that point in development... I'd spend hours not knowing if I wasn't able to complete something because I was ****ing up or if it was because the quest WAS NOT DONE<br />
<br />
point is, everyone uses thottbot, if they cant figure something out in a couple of passes.  everyone asks in /general or in guild about stuff.  I played EQ since day 1 of release and I'll confidently say there wasn't one quest that i was FIRST at in 4 years or more.  I had help or a spoiler at some point in every eq quest i did.<br />
<br />
i do have to give credit to blizzard.  they definitely know how to strike up a balance between help and handout.  your example of the glowing line in bazaar is perfect.  that's the prototypical sony &quot;solution&quot; to a problem.  it's completely immersion-breaking and just sort of cheesy.  blizzard's quest utilities are seemless and I'll admit very helpful.<br />
<br />
the directions in most of the quests are VERY exact.  north of something versus northEAST of something are distinct instructions in your quest log.</div></div><hr />

Good quest, Counterattack is better. You get involved in a defense of a town against centaurs. Your side spawns guards and you and they have to defend the town against the centaur hordes until such time as leader is called in with final reinforcements (u then have to kill him).
