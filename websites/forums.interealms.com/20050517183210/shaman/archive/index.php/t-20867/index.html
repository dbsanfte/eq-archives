<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chooie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 65 war with 55aa and I seriously dislike having any class slowing other than a shaman. Maybe it changes in the highend game, but for example I was grinding some aa's in PoV today with a shaman that was mh, slowing, and managed to throw the ruj curse dot on every mob...and we were chaining.<br />
<br />
I'll take a shaman any day over a chanter who has to tash, still gets multiple resists on slow before the mob picks their teeth with them because they grab aggro.<br />
<br />
I'll take a shaman any day over a bst who has no clue how to manage aggro who slows and instantly starts meleeing with some crazy procing weapon then throws a weak dot on just because they think it's cool.<br />
<br />
I might take a very good bard slowing over a shaman depending on the situtation (ldon) though. Good bards are just damn good players :)<br />
<br />
Just my .02 whatevers</div></div><hr />

Constantly tried to offtank stuff I had root parked and run the cleric dry of mana.  Sometimes he did it before I had a chance to slow it, or slowed it first without saying so, making my slow kind of a waste of mana.<br />
<br />
Goes to prove the old adage that I made up -- just because you CAN doesn't mean you SHOULD.<br />
<br />
Never much liked that offtanking when you don't have to business.  It's so much more mana efficient to have the cleric/druid CH the main tank and not heal anybody else; and when I'm the only healer plus I'm slowing(cleric had bathroom problems) and even pulling, then there's no excuse for wasting my mana.  Mobs die faster when everyone is on the same one too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, the post is appreciated, but shaman can be just as crazy as those beatlords. I used to play Aggro games with my MT on VT raids all night long.<br />
<br />
 I can say this much, i used to put on LFG and get a group in 10-20 min, now i can sit LFG all night long and not get a single invite, i think that alone accuratly shows how much less we are desired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok after doing time for some time now i really really REALLY find phase 1 boring as hell, yes i know when mobs can be mezzed but if i cant have either a good agro fight with the MT over the named or try to keep all of the mobs dotted, then i get really really bored. <br />
Also the cleric/druids should havde enough mana to heal me once i gain the agro, i dont give a rats arse about how mana efficient stuff is im here to have fun, this is what i do in my spare time its NOT my job.<br />
I know there is a good way to play the game but its also very boring, i need to find ways to continue to find fun in the game. and agro is a great way of doing this.....</div></div><hr />

Disclaimer<br />
The following is my personal analysis of the current state of the high end shaman. It does not necessarily represent the views of other shaman who post here or of the Crucible as a whole.<br />
<br />
It is written from the point of view of a post-time shaman. As such it deals mainly with high end issues. Please do not attempt to apply my conclusions to such places as BoT, Cazic Thule etc.<br />
<br />
It is applicable for parts of PoP, hard LDoN adventures, LDoN raids and GoD, especially the single groups trials.<br />
<br />
Yes, shaman do fine in Plane of Valor. Or rather, shaman for whom Valor is appropriate content contribute adequately compared to other classes with similar equipment.<br />
<br />
Now imagine that the shaman grouping with you had their heals halved, their heal over time spells cut by a factor of 5, weren't casting slow because it is mitigated to worthlessness, could not buff stats and could not cast DoTs.<br />
<br />
Would you still think they do fine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman are a priest class and thusly a healer , the least of the three in healing yes but a healer still . Shaman heals have been balanced around slow . Where slow works well we are able too be just as effictive as any outher class .<br />
the problem seems too arise as slow becomes less and less effictive . Becase virtualy every aspect of a shaman has been gimped becase &quot;we have the best slow&quot; . we become very VERY weak if slow is weak . And if , like in GoD slow becomes useless ... shamans become useless as well .<br />
In PoV slow is still a very effictive tool . Few mobs midigate it and those that do so only slightly . Hence shamans are quite effective . Shamans IMO are not broken in PoV , in fact were quite balanced .<br />
In GoD however many mobs are IMMUNE too slow and those that arent immune midigate slow so much as too make slow useless . Thusely shamans are useless totaly .<br />
GoD content has been designed too be fast paced fights &quot;60sec or shorter fights&quot; and in edition too that all mobs midigate slow highly . When it takes you 10-15sec too slow a mob that leaves you contributeing a 12% DPS decrese for 45 seconds per mob IF your lucky .<br />
<br />
A beastlord or enchanter reduces the mobs DPS by basicly the same amount AND do outher usefull things ... While our secondary function &quot;healing&quot; we dont have the tools too contribute with .<br />
<br />
Again i say , Shamans are not broken in PoV but in GoD we are about as broken as possible .<br />

Now you get to GoD and it's a completely different ballgame. (Like going from little league to the Majors in baseball or from Cricket to Rugby for you overseas types. Maybe club team to Manchester United).<br />
<br />
And SADLY I agree with Litgruv's assessment. Shaman are about my last choice (when on my Enchanter) for a group. This is regardless of what role they are supposed to fill. <br />
<br />
Healer? Cleric, Druid, Shaman<br />
Slower? Got me for that.<br />
DPS? Please.<br />
<br />
I've beaten this to death but Shaman NEED SOMETHING. Now we can all argue until we're blue in the face about WHAT Shaman need, but certainly there is a near concensus that the class is near dead last on the totem pole, <br />
<br />
 regardless of what role you are asking them to fill.</div></div><hr />

Well, this is not entirely true.  You're much better off if you have a good bard to slow for LDoN easy adventures.  A shaman lucky enough to get in such a group should just load up poison rain spells and spot heal if needed.  Keep slow up for the occasional mob that needs it, but don't try to slow everything.  Bard pulls 4-6 mobs in, sings his/her DoT song, and the rest just contribute whatever DPS they can.  We did a collect 28 LDoN easy adventure in 20 minutes last time I did this.</div></div><hr />

So true, when I'm on my shaman the only tells he gets are for buffs from twinks in PoTranq.<br />

I personally think a shaman makes a great puller for Normal Adventures.  Pull with Turgur's (or root pull) and with a good tank you can have Bane or Blood running all the time, always have 1-2 in camp, tossing a Tears of Saryn on almost every mob.  While the shaman isn't acting at peak capacity (in terms of DPS), the key is that the rest of the group spends almost all of their dungeon time engaged on a mob.<br />
Bards can make amazing pullers (definitely better than shaman if both are skilled)), but good  bards in my opinion are in short supply. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I can slow almost as well, slow resists are pretty low even without a debuff, and I provide SD and a decent pet. We never use shm for GoD trials either, since they don't add enough DPS.<br />

I have a 65 Shm who is pretty much retired.  There is no point in getting him flagged, since he will have a difficult time getting groups, even guild groups.

As a L59 Shaman, I feel very useful and in fact desired.  At my current level and content, I can contribute meaningfully in many roles in any group.  It is exactly what I had hoped for when I rolled up my Shaman.<br />
<br />
I simply know what is coming in a few levels, and I hate it.  I want to continue to play my Shaman, but it appears that my Bard may be on his way up soon.  ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This is how I always saw it: anywhere a shaman makes a viable main or backup healer), the shaman is fine.  It's as soon as we cannot (even backup) heal that we start having major problems.<br />
<br />
The only two options I really see are increase the burst DPS capability of shaman or increase burst healing capability.<br />
<br />
Shaman in POV are capable main healers and (group dependant) adaquet damage dealers.  <br />
<br />
Here's my question to you though: if the shaman was unable to slow any MOBs, would you have invited him along?  What if no one was able to slow the MOBs (i.e. slow immune MOBs)?  What if the MOBs hit 2-3+ times as hard.....and weren't slowable?...  Now to top it all off, what if the MOBs hit 2-3+ times as hard, were immune to slow and died in 10-20 seconds?<br />
<br />
This is where shaman are dead weight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I agree with you chooie.  a good shaman may be the most capable healers in teir 1&amp;2 and normal ldon.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunatly the tables begin to turn in healing in tier 3 and by ep/hard ldon we are just about useless.  now throw in god where our slows are also just about useless and you have our problem...  Overall for the non endgame seekers shaman are still a vialbe class but for those looking for time and god we are nearly useless by that lvl.  <br />
<br />
Course we are by far not the only class with this problem, and soe seems to refuse to fix this.  all you really need in a group now is 2 clerics and 2 chanters and you can take most tier 1-3 named as well as any 1 groupable god and ldon zones.</div></div><hr />

Including Tier3 planes shaman can function as healer of a group .. after that it gets messy (Tier4 and LDoN Hard), after that it gets impossible. All the other stuff shaman offer are stuff we can be botted for.<br />

<br />
Speak for yourself.  I have absolutely no trouble getting groups inside or outside of guild.<br />
<br />
You also don't seem to use your shaman correctly in exp groups.  In a kite group I can maintain over 200dps without a problem even on chain pulls.  Even when I was only mostly EP equipped, I could do that with C5 and 9.  And you don't even have to slow in a kite group.<br />
<br />
In hard LDoNs I cast Malos, click TA, cast Bane, click pants and then chain Velium Strike.  With all the foci I have I can keep my damage near 200dps.  Bane and Pox are ~100dps and chaining VS is ~100dps.  There are only a few mobs in ldon that are consistently resistant to cold or disease.  After Malos most stuff doesn't resist MR-based spells.<br />
<br />
With Balance of the Nihil shamans are now our preslowers of choice on raids.  And altogether shamans have far more utility than beastlords will ever have.  Beastlords have no other debuffs than a slow and a weak cripple, they can't heal, they have limit crowd control ability and SD is their only decent group buff.  Paragon is nice, but it's only 1200hp and 480m. I am in no way jealous of beastlords.  The classes don't overlap that much and they serve different purposes.<br />
<br />
You also forget that beastlords were a pretty useless class when they were created, whereas shamans were not.  Beastlords originally had no utility at all and were just a dps pet class.  Beastlords got the attention they needed to catch up with the rest of the classes in the game (GoD didn't give beastlords much of an upgrade at all).  Shamans have been neglected some lately with regard to healing power since the devs insist on keeping a stupid 100/75/47 (or whatever is it) balance between the priest classes even though GoD strengthen the absurd dynamic of high dps mobs and unslowable or high mitigation bosses in group trials.<br />
<br />
I think they're having a problem upgrading our healing power because if we were equivalent to druids all of the sudden to balance us in GoD groups and raids, the group dynamics in PoP zones and everything before that would change.  They could just give us a 2k+ heal spell that works only in GoD zones if they wanted.  Call of the Hero can be restricted by zone, so they have the coding to do that.<br />
<br />
There are so many interesting things they can do to upgrade us (and other classes) without making older content (more) trivial, but they simply too stupid, too distracted or too lazy to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is nowhere near 200 DPS.<br />
<br />
It's about 110 DPS, assuming the mob lasts 40 seconds.<br />
<br />
If the mob lasts between 31 and 39 seconds, depending on exactly when it dies, it would be anywhere between 90 and 113 DPS.<br />
<br />
Why you would be casting Nife and Pox at L64 I have no idea.  There are certainly more efficient and damaging spells.<br />
<br />
You may be able to burst to 200 DPS . . . but it is certainly not a consistent 200 DPS, nor is it in any way sustainable over time without considerable med/can breaks.  In fact, over the first 3 ticks of the fight, you are sitting around 40 DPS.<br />
<br />
If by some remote chance you are referring to the LDoN Spell Bane, it would beg the question of why not stack Anathema on Bane instead of Pox ?<br />
<br />
And this is all assuming that you take ZERO time to Can and regen your mana.  <br />

I do them with a chanter, tank, cleric, monk and a rogue usually.  The chanter is busy with CoDing and mezzing, I slow and keep the chanter alive when CoD breaks.  It's far more dps than replacing me with a BL or another dps class.  Chanters and shaman work very well together.  If the chanter has a CoD pet, they are going to lose it in bad situations.  If there isn't another slower available they can't keep it all going at once.  A BL could slow but they won't be keeping the chanter or tank alive while the cleric is busy with the other.  Same for a bard although they can help mez at least.<br />
<br />
In these situations, we can't be replaced with a druid or a bl.  Maybe a bard.  If they replace me with another dps class, they will lose dps because most chanters can't keep up with CoD pet, random mezzing, and all the slowing in GoD.  Lose the CoD pet and they are the less valuable ones in GoD.<br />
<br />
We could definately use some upgrades, no question, but we're far from useless and I never have a problem getting a group, be it hard LDoN, Elemental or GoD trials.<br />
<br />
Our jobs have changed a lot over time but we still have some very good abilities.  If you want to see who really can't get a GoD group, look at the druid boards.  Look at the necro boards.  We don't have it all that bad, we just aren't top dog anymore.  Really, it's been a long long time since we were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd actually recommend a ranger for weaponshielding of bosses while the chanter pet does all the DPS for the entire group.  <br />

He is referring to Bane, the LDON spell which is 420 a tick. As far as why he used Poxx, it's because it's a free click on elemental pants. He is probably out of spell slots if you include VS in your lineup which is why when grouping he doesn't use Anathema.</div></div><hr />

There is the first weirdness. You slow with a charm pet around? I do not even click my free slow in that case. It simply is not worth it to wait a few seconds to reduce the damage the tank takes by less then you can heal with a single Tnarg's.<br />
And a druid, paladin or cleric are all much better at keeping the enchanter up in the case of an emergency. Or, even better, a second enchanter.<br />
<br />
It's far more dps than replacing me with a BL or another dps class.<br />
Sadly the prime DPS class in that case is an enchanter (or druid). Either of those are better at keeping an ex pet in check then a shaman.<br />
<br />
Chanters and shaman work very well together. If the chanter has a CoD pet, they are going to lose it in bad situations.  If there isn't another slower available they can't keep it all going at once.<br />
Actually an enchanter should have no problem at all slowing instead of you. The charm pet generally puts out enough aggro to let him tash and slow with impunity and there is no need to mez when pulling singles is made trivial with pacify.<br />

A BL could slow but they won't be keeping the chanter or tank alive while the cleric is busy with the other. Same for a bard although they can help mez at least.<br />
A beastlord no - a bard is far beyond us in that regard. Snare alone will make sure a smart enchanter should not take any damage. That is, if he is not busy pulling 100% singles in each and every zone.<br />
<br />
In these situations, we can't be replaced with a druid or a bl.  Maybe a bard.  If they replace me with another dps class, they will lose dps because most chanters can't keep up with CoD pet, random mezzing, and all the slowing in GoD.  Lose the CoD pet and they are the less valuable ones in GoD.<br />
Cleric - can stun, which works better to recharm then slow. Can root, heal much better then a shaman, DI and possibly bestow DA. And of course rez if things really go bad. Far beyond shaman for keeping rogue pets under control.<br />
Druid - can snare and heal better then a shaman. Can also stun and in some zones have a pet of his own. Far beyond shaman for keeping rogue pets under control.<br />
Bard - can snare, mez, slow. A bit better then shaman for keeping rogue pets under control.<br />
Enchanter - can mez, stun, root, rune. Far beyond shaman for keeping rogue pets under control.<br />
Beastlord - can slow. Far far below shaman for keeping rogue pets under control.<br />
Paladin - can heal, stun, lay hands, root. Far beyond shaman for keeping rogue pets under control.<br />
Slow is just not an issue with charm pets around. Stun is, heals are, mez and snare are. What we are useful for in that situation is malosinia actually - it is a lot more convinient when you have to remez less often.<br />
<br />
We could definately use some upgrades, no question, but we're far from useless and I never have a problem getting a group, be it hard LDoN, Elemental or GoD trials.<br />
Useless is the wrong term. Not even a level 1 warrior is useless. But we are never the optimal class for any group configuration in GoD. There is always a class that will work better then a shaman.<br />
<br />
Our jobs have changed a lot over time but we still have some very good abilities. If you want to see who really can't get a GoD group, look at the druid boards. Look at the necro boards.<br />
Druids have it a lot better then us - they can charm in a few zones and they can at least backup heal in the others. Necromancers suffer from the same problem as all other DPS classes. Having to have two healers plus a tank and usually another fixed slot in each group leaves almost no room for DPS classes. Having FD and rez on the same class is very powerful though.<br />
<br />
If the general encounter design would move away from high melee DPS low HPs MOBs a little about 90% of everyone's concerns would go away overnight. Knights would not complain about tanking, druids would not complain about healing, shaman would still be complaining about nukes and buffs - but everyone's contribution would be a lot closer to being equal.<br />
<br />
But since the devs have stated that short fights are here to stay there is a lot of balancing to be done, most of it artificially caused by encounter design. As is a lot of classes suffer but shaman have literally had their chair kicked from underneath them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Even if we use the LDoN Bane spell . . . the DPS still only works out to about 127 DPS over the whole fight.<br />
<br />
And we haven't even talked about regening mana from all that casting.<br />
<br />
I just don't see anything near 200 DPS and certainly not over an entire fight.  It takes time to build DPS as a Shaman as we need to stack DoT's on our targets.<br />
<br />
Yes, I agree, it's POSSIBLE for us to burst up to 200 DPS . . . but we can't turn it on quickly, or sustain it, which is where I believe the real problem lies.</div></div><hr />
