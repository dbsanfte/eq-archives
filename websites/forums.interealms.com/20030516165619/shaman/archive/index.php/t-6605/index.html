<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have already seen some estimates of the pet's dps.<br />
<br />
I also saw somewhere it is possible to give a weapon to the pet.<br />
<br />
Can you tell if this makes a big difference? Do you give 1 or 2 weapons to the pet?<br />
<br />
What s the impact in term of DPS? Is it worth sparing some weapons for the pet?<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
also, did someone make some tests withe the cripple spell? Does it effectively affect the mob? What about it s DPS? did someone choose a 'constant' mob, like named in the grey who are 55, and tried to make some log analysis to show the impact of crippling a mob or not?<br />
<br />
Thx for your time, but I think it is important to have a CLEAR idea on the impact of those 2 parameters for soloing.</div></div><hr />

Lists weapons you can give your pet.<br />
<br />
1. pets does hit MAX more often with weapons.<br />
<br />
2. you can give your pet 2 1handers.<br />
<br />
3. you can give your pet proc weapons.<br />
<br />
I give dog-dog:<br />
<br />
Serrated bone dirk for Engulfing darkness and these are dirt cheap in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Dragon Horn of Ykesha- 75 dd for long camps as these cost 75-150pp on average.<br />
<br />
Gnoll hide lariats are also nice and dirt cheap and proc stun.<br />
<br />
* note: Buff Dog-dogs dex as much as possible for procs. duh<br />
<br />
Summary:  I notice much better dmg output from dog-dog giving him weapons.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, save those FS weapon trash drops and the like and give them to Doggie. He definately won't do LESS damage. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as cripple goes, cripple critters that proc.  ESPECIALLY cripple critters with lifetap procs.  I'm remembering partnering the vamps in ME a while ago with a warrior.  Since I can't dot them, and since warr DPS isn't what it could be, the fights were pretty long.  Add in their life sucking proc, and it was positively hellish.  Start crippling those critters and the difference is very very noticeable.<br />
<br />
Outside of that situation, I rarely crippled unless it was some kind of miniboss - say, named pops around the temple in the grey.  Makes a lot more of a difference against higher level mobs where you're less likely to dodge/mitigate.<br />
<br />
Against regular exp mobs, seems to be a huge waste of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am almost embarassed to say this so you can call me stupid, but I never knew we could give our Puppies weapons.<br />
<br />
From reading this thread I am assuming that we can.<br />
<br />
Does it make a significant difference?<br />
<br />
And GAWD I love this forum, I have learnt more here since joining than I have learnt any where else.</div></div><hr />

Don't feel stupid, this is actually a rather new happening and I am pretty sure that its only the level 49+ pet spell that can DW...I haven't actually cast my lower level pet spells to check this out. Can anyone confirm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know that my 39 pet was procing velium weapons when I was hunting ulthorks.  Don't know how much damage it did because it didn't show.  But weapon proced at least 2 times a fight.</div></div><hr />
