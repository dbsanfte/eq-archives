<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ordered a new processor and motherboard tonight.  After I install it, I'll be a case and a few cheap peripherals away from having another PC.<br />
<br />
What I am wondering is, for those that already do it, would having my shaman on one box with my alts on another be worth it?  Or is dual boxing more of a hassle than it's worth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ive been two boxing and have never looked back. Ive always been more of a solo first person to a point though and always have my own group with my two accounts. When i do group with friends and such i needed to be flexable and rdy to drop the 2nd toon so not to bump a friends char out. I get a little burned out on my shaman and i play my palidan so gives me alot of options. <br />
<br />
  The downside is buying gear and or spells and getting flagged with all of them. Been mixing my wizard in also and its another face to feed /clothe/get spells for so can be expensise but worth it to me. The flagging part still sucks bad though when you want to do it with more than one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siamese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a bit of work to two box, but it's nice to not need to look for a duo partner.  Hot keys, of course, are your friend.  My wife and I each 3 box, and that gets a bit more difficult, but when you get into the swing of it, two boxing is cake.  The nice thing is though, when you occasionally just play one of the characters, it's like a nice calm vacation in comparison.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love dual boxing and its probably one of the things that has held my interest in the game for so long, never a dull moment.  Although it is nice to single box from time to time (rarely), you do notice at those times how much more time you have on your hands.  It also makes it easier to form groups (since you have fewer reliable people to look for), when the **** hits the fan though, it makes you less reliable.  I cant imagine playing the game without two at this point and will probably try and 2 box every EQ type game I can in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i 2 box on the same computer. no reason for two. though we do have 3 eq capable boxes here, so i suppose i could 6 box..... as for easiness. i think it is 100x easier to run eqw than it is to do two separate computers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I 2 boxed for a while some time ago and it added quite a bit to the game but the second computer took a dirt nap and my cleric was on that one so no rez.<br />
<br />
In any case I will never go back to 2 boxing.   I was getting to far into the game and not spending enought time with wife and kids.  Every time I start to think about the advantages of a second acount I just stop and remember that this is a game and not a job.  EQ is great fun and I can understand people wanting the vast improvement in capabilites that multi boxing can give,  I just won't go down that corse again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">About nine months ago my interest in EQ started to lag.  There jsut wansnt enough to hold my interest.  So on a whim (and cause I have a RL friend that does it) I started another account, and began 2boxing.  <br />
<br />
I love it.  I dont know if I could ever go back to playing a single account forever.  About the only time that Im not duo are when My shaman is raiding.  Other than that its me and my little SK twink (who isnt so little anymore).  Its great fun.  At least, I think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love to two box.  I went to upgrade my computer, and thought hey, I just get a new case, hd, and monitor and I could two box.  It really made playing alot of fun.  My twink is the shaman.  I have had a ton of fun, and have no regrets.  <br />
<br />
Many different choices for a second class to play with a shaman.  Thats the great thing, they are very versitile.  Just really depends on your play style and what you want to do.  Almost any melee class will do good to a certain level, just twink them well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>skulript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Going to try out two boxing tonight, and based on this thread it sounds like I am doing the right thing. Rodahn, I will let you know from a 2 boxing newb perspective after tonight, if you are interested in hearing about it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dual boxing is really cool. At one point, when my computer could handle it i used to 2box a friends monk and my shaman (PL'd myself from 61 to 65 in POV that way) and it was really cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that comp is messed up and 2boxing gives me alot of FPS lag it doesn't work so well and i wish i still could.<br />
<br />
<br />
Definitely worth it, especially in a raid type situation. No one needs people playing clerics but you need them in the CH rotation so boot up a cleric and just press heal (BTW alot of people say this makes inefficient guilds... but god gave us a brain which allows us to multitask and if you aren't a moron you can easily do this... hit a CH button once every 20 seconds)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the info, all.<br />
<br />
Definitely piqued my curiosity now.  Gonna move Rod to account #2 so he can plvl my ranger (well, as much as a lvl 53 can be plvled) and cleric.  Not to mention I can leave a mule in bazaar and sell while I play my main.<br />
<br />
Will take some getting used to, but I think it will be pretty fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Paying for 2nd account was too much, 1 shaman good enough for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With two-boxing you'll never have to look for a group, wait around for guildmates, or put up with any in-group stupidity besides your own! ;)  This can be both a boon to your gameplay, or a curse to your personal life.<br />
<br />
You will become the king of macros as your &quot;2nd&quot; box becomes more and more automated.  <br />
<br />
You will get to the point where you can play your second box without a monitor (I use my primary box for all the visuals - including targeting.  Makes &quot;runs to the zone&quot; a bit hectic though! :) )<br />
<br />
Dungeon crawls while two boxing are a big challenge, but static camps are a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
Overall I'd say I've gotten MORE than 2 accounts worth of enjoyment out of 2-boxing.  You will too Rodahn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've only just recently started two boxing my shaman with an sk so I'm still powerlevelling him but it's great fun :)<br />
Makes a nice change from the usual and is a welcome break from exp grinding. <br />
It's definitely worth a try, at least for the one month trial ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I bought a new computer late last year, and decided to open a second account when I did. Then I made a warrior and 2-boxed him with my shaman. It was pretty fun and a new challenge..and best of all I didnt have to look for guildmates or others to hunt with. Got the warrior to level 52 in a pretty short time, but havent played him much since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I 2 box on 2 comps it takes some getting use to. But onces you get it down it changes the whole game. I mainly 2 box 65shm and 63clr. One importain thing if you decided to 2 box a healer is your hot buttons. Useing....<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast #<br />
Works great but NEVER put a /pause in there. Useing pause with /sit on, sounds good to stand cast then sit. But it dosent work. If the spell fizzels or gets interupted you can do nothing till the /pause time is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have never played with two accounts, but the friend I’m grouping with does.  He plays a ranger as his main and a cleric on his second account.  The two of them make a great team.  They’re both level 58 now with numerous AAs.  I used to play a ranger and a druid, depending on my mood.  I’d group with my friend from time to time but I didn’t add a lot into the mix.  After my guild broke up and I couldn’t really bring myself to play my two mains I started playing my kitty shaman again.  After soloing into my upper 30s, I started grouping with my friend again.  Let me tell you, a shaman makes a good third addition to the group.  The ranger pulls and tanks, I buff, haste and slow and the cleric heals and does a rez when needed.  <br />
<br />
From what I can tell, my friend has very little trouble duel boxing.  His main attention is on his ranger and he tosses in heals when needed.  His timing is very good.  There are some minor difficulties, like people talking to his cleric when he’s pulling or otherwise busy.  But overall it works very well.  The only time I’ve seen him have difficulty getting around is in dungeons where auto fallow doesn’t work well, which is most of them.  We have to move a bit more slowly so he can manually maneuver his cleric.  And I would expect that a mad dash to zone would be troublesome as well.  But to be honest, he plays both his characters so well there is rarely ever any need to zone.  <br />
<br />
I’ve thought of playing two accounts, but the expense of buying another computer and keeping up with two accounts has kept me from trying it.  However, if you have a strong interest in doing so, I’d suggest you give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>zathrys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I 2box as well, but I went a bit of a different way.  My main is a monk.  Since The Great Monk Nerf Of Oct '02 (tm) I built a second box from spare parts I had and made a second account.  It was a no brainer to make a shaman.<br />
<br />
I wub my shammy, without her I would be tied to groups permanently.  I suggest using 2 full separate computers and monitors if you have the room.  I use my monk on box1 and the shm on box2 just because the monk pulls.  The shm is all hotkeyed.  I much enjoy hunting in horse enabled zones as it removes the need for /sit on and off lines.  Also using 2 full comps means you can put in a pause after the cast so you sit automatically, if the spell fizzles, just reach over and click the spell icon.  I have 2boxed and had groups believing that my rl wife was playing the shm.  Now that being said I still single my shm.  2boxing can get very stressful and you are amazed the time you have to think and react when you single box.<br />
<br />
I tried using a kvm switch but I found my abilities severely handicapped since I couldn't do as much...example, fighting rats in pod a root breaks and the rat starts to flee, to avoid adds I can back off pet while following and attacking the mob with monk.  Then while still following and attacking I can try to root again with shm.  If I used eqw or a kvm switch the monk would sit like a dumbass while I was on the shm...also, I can canni my shm while the monk is out pulling or using bind wound on the shm.  I just cannot see using eqw or a KVM switch being that versatile.</div></div><hr />
