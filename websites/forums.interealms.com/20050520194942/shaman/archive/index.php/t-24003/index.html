Classes:<br />
<br />
      Shaman level 70<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
<br />
      8: Decrease Attack Speed by 50%<br />
<br />
Recourse Effect: Vindicitive Spirit Recourse<br />
<br />
      1: Mitigate Melee Damage by 50%, 1600 total<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This looks like a interesting spell to help on raids. Couple this with the warrior AoE taunt and we could really help bring a tricky situation undercontrol quickly. Well in thoery anyone. <br />
<br />
So anyone got it? If so has it been useful to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If turgurs lands first, why would you need it to land?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Say Turgur's is about to wear off an extremely Magic Resistant mob. Vindictive has a -100 MR check to it, so you can be certain the mob will be slowed (by at least 50%) all the time while you try to reapply Turgur's or BoN.<br />
<br />
This could prove to be very useful in those kind of circumstances as well as just for AE slowing mobs, assign 1 shaman to constantly keep this on the mob while others try to land 75% slow (highly mana intensive though).<br />
<br />
edit: you would need 2 shamans to keep this up constantly as it has a 30 sec recast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If turgurs lands first, why would you need it to land?<br />
<br />
For the recourse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman gonna be the next eye of zomm buyers? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For the recourse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good point. as well as the turgurs wearing off thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This spell is much suckier than you present, it's an AE slow.  It is 'better' than our other AE slow, since it hits all mobs in range.  But as I posted somewhere else (forget if it was here or on the SoE shaman boards), where would you use it?  Most times (99%, I'd say) is on a huge inc train or ring mobs in PoWater or PoEarth.  For the PoEarth rock ring mobs (x12 inc), you cast this and you will die.  Even if all mobs are slowed, guess what, they QUAD (and do so for a max hit of around 1k or so x4, granted not that common, but it does happen).  And 90% of the time, they're going to do so when they agro your butt, since, well, your offtanks are going to miss some of them.  So, unless you are uber GoD geared with 2k ac, your going to die using this, even with the mitigate 50% for 1600 damgage.  Assume your a 7k shaman (I'm right there, so, I'll use that).  Assume your offtanks can target and get half the mobs taunted on inc and the mobs don't fly off at you when you slow, that's still 6 mobs inc on you.  6xquadx1k = 24,000 damage on you (granted, it's going to be less than that, but still).  Ok, you are mitigating 50% for 1600 damage, well, that's gone on the first mob on you, so 5xquadx1k + 1xquadx1kx0.5 = 20,000 + 500 = 20,500 damage on you.  Guess what, you're still dead.  Even if the numbers are half of this, and then some.<br />
<br />
Now that said, this spell would be useful on boss mobs or the like.  I had not really thought of that, but using a -100 adjust slow would be a good idea, then use Tugurs/TA to get him real slowed.  Nice job on thinking of that one, I was just comparing it to the old AE slow, which was only useful in LDoN mass pulling and rings.<br />
<br />
Also, looking at Lucy (I am not level 70 yet, so I have not actually tried this spell), not all the blocks appear to be correct.  IE, Category = Haste(single).  So, I may be completely wrong on my theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This spell is much suckier than you present, it's an AE slow.

<br />
<br />
Granted, but if 5 mobs come in and the tank hits AoE taunt, he pulls aggro from all the mobs, unslowed btw, and helps save the raid from whiping. Im trying to view this spell in the over all picture. I mean come on bro, we are shaman, we die, that how it goes. Im thinking if you got 2-3 shaman in the raid as a example and a ton of mobs come in, say 5-8 and all 3 shaman cast this spell or with in a relitivly close timeframe to each other, then yes, 1 or 2 or maybe even all of the shaman are going to go down, but you will save the raid from going down or if nothing else you will have a noticable role in helping save the raid.<br />
<br />
I agree the recourse should be a lil higher, cause for the situations that this spell is needed for and at the level you have to be to aquire it, to even think about a single shaman surviving  consitently, we have to look at atleast 3k, assuming most shaman at that level ar around 7k raid buffed. I mean i suck and i am just under 6k and most shaman i see here are well over 1k beyond my current HP.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, in theory i can see this as a useful spell, even in its current incarnation and beyond that dont you think its its a reason to have more shaman on a raid situation where CC will become important. I mean trio this with chanter mezz and AoE taunt and if a raid team knows what they are doing, its adding another dimension to the situation, another useful tool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, this is speculation and theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If turgurs lands first, why would you need it to land?<br />
Another one: mob mitigates slow, but not past 50%; with the additional effect, you get 50% slow times 50% melee mitigation = 75% damage reduction, just like a full Turgurs.<br />
<br />
Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, you are right for that one mob (in my situtation).  It is in fact equvialent to Tugurs on the mob hitting you, untill the 1600 damage absorbed is done with.  But, this Tugurs-like effect is only on you (IF I read it correctly).  I could very well be wrong on this though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The recrouse effect is self only. You won't provide any sort of mitigation to your group and you won't be able to keep the recourse on yourself due to the recast time.<br />
<br />
Let's not downplay this spell too much, though. <br />
It is excellent for high end Shamans, and I am sure it will be the primary slow spell I'll be using for mobs(I give credit where and when credit is due).<br />
A -100, fast casting slow spell makes an excellent choice for that.<br />
Vindictive Spirit is a PB AE spell, but no one keeps me from using it on a single mob.<br />
The slow will last between 12.1 and 17.9 seconds, which is enough time to overwrite it with my TA.<br />
<br />
My only gripe is the total amount of mitigation. I would have liked to see the total amount to be between 5 and 7.5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think the resist check of the spell is very very helpful, that is why it would be good for a preslow on a mob.. Good spell i think, nothing bad about iit at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Will be badass when I pull Ldon's, 8 inc PBAE slow /afk while my 5 mage friends destroy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Taunt wars. AoE Slow vs AoE snare, and whomever wins, gets to run the mobs around til the chanters and tanks get them locked down.<br />
<br />
I can see applications to it. Just don't see myself in a position where I'll ever get to actually test them out...<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Correct in thinking that it'd be a good spell for preslowing.  So is the GoD slow for 99% of applications though (with longer stick time on mob).  Now bosses, this is a great spell =).  LDoN normal, ya, this spell would be great for those of us with enough accounts to destroy with 5 mages (/envy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have only the one account, but I made a point of finding good mages when LDoN came out cos I knew id be abusing them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think it looks good.  And just a note, if you are AE pulling at a raid, mostlikely you will have chantters to either chain mez or stun so even if you have agro over that mess, the mobs won't be beating on ya.  (Goes for all the AE raids i've done so far /shrug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My guild is strange that we don't do a whole buncha chain mezzing, just 1 AE mez for the inc mobs for the rock ring in PoE.  Now PoW, that's another beast . . .  I hate that fight.</div></div><hr />

Does it have to land for the recourse to work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So... the recourse is like a self-rune (vs damage from that mob only)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This is probably a very good AA.  It would come in handy when a BoN bounces and you grab agro from MA in xp groups.  Kind of like the cleric DA or a warrior shielding you.  But will be low on my list of must haves none the less.</div></div><hr />

If the -100 resist check is going to go live, I will stop posting on the Crucible(talk about an incentive for Sony . <br />
Trust me, it isn't going to happen or they would have changed Nihil to be -70 six months ago. <br />

Okay, stop posting, because it's gone live and has been live for a while: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5400&amp;source=Live<br />

The slow and the rune recourse only last 3 ticks though.</div></div><hr />
