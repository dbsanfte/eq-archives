<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After a 3 month break from EQ my S.O. and I decided to start a Rogue/Shaman duo.<br />
<br />
The last shaman I geared was very old school (WIS heavy) so I am kinda clueless about what kind of balance to reach between WIS and AC/HP.<br />
<br />
Anybody have some pointers on target numbers for wis, and what gear we can change out to maximize our survival rate. (we have about 20k to spend right now)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you plan on slow-tanking, with the rogue attacking from behind while you hold aggro with slows, etc?  If so, you will want to focus on HP/AC, because you will rarely be FM anyways... a larger mana pool is not as big of a deal to you.<br />
<br />
Gearwise, I'm not familiar enough to make recommendations... i just run bazaar searches with the HP stat selected.<br />
<br />
I personally have decided that a medium-AC approach with focus items works best for me.  I sometimes take hits, but mainly support my 56 ranger with haste, slows, heals, etc.  I have enhancement extension, affliction extension, affliction haste, mana preservation, and extended range focus items.<br />
<br />
Affliction haste would be a good choice for you if you do plan on tanking and keeping aggro for the rogue (shaves a third of the time off).  It'll let you get off dots and slows better while being beat on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cyrnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, the plan is she slow tanks keeping aggro with dots. (she is the shaman) and my rogue evades and tears the backside of the mobs apart.  I know how easy it is for a shaman to hold aggro if they really want it (especially when the rogue mashes that evade button often).<br />
<br />
<br />
Never thought of the affliction haste angle, we will have to gather a good focus when we get a few more levels.</div></div><hr />

Sell crystal chitin shield and get a SBS.  Also a net + in cash.<br />

Ears....electrum black sapphire are 2ac, 35hp, 25 mana....I consider them better than gold.<br />
<br />
Dusty soriz boots....12ac, 40 hp, and good saves too.  They're like 800 or 1k on terris.<br />
<br />
Cloak...dire wolf hide, coterie general, shimmering terrorhide are all pretty cheap, andhave good hp for their cost.<br />
<br />
You may not want to make all these swaps, as that'd drop your mana a whole lot, just pick and chose which would be the most effective or something.<br />
<br />
I was comfortable as low as 149 wis, couldn't get any lower with the gear I had (when I switched from druman gear to shaman gear), so I can't speak for having lower.<br />
<br />
Since you're both twinked, getting to the level where you can actually canni and use that HP shouldn't be a problem, even with lower wis.</div></div><hr />
