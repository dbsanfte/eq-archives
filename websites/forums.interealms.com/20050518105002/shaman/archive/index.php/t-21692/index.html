<br />
Anyway. I come to find out a truly depressing fact. We arent needed. I mean i knew this already but i guess it didnt really hit home fully till i apped to multiple guild on my server, guilds im in very good standing with and my responses were &quot; im sorry but we just dont need anymore shaman, they would be useless.<br />
<br />
Man does that suck. They want wizzies and bards and BST and basicly DPS machines and healers, pretty much every single class but us. Talk about crushing your hopes.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a lighter note i got to pretend to be a SoE rep to someone that /tell me if i wanna trade accounts lol. Scared them good :D  Made me not getting a guild feel a lil better.<br />
<br />
Ahh well, so much for giving EQ another shot. Come on WoW, hurry !! :(</div></div><hr />

My guild hasn't recruited shaman in over a year. That doesn't mean that any of us are unwanted or unneeded. It means my guild has a large roster of high playtime shaman and we are happy in our current numbers.<br />
<br />
Could we stack better? Sure. Are we useless? Not hardly.</div></div><hr />

I dont think we are useless, but try letting the guilds on my server know that :(<br />

I dont think 2-4 shaman is a large roster though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I kinda gotta take Lit's back on this one . On my server at least the majority of guilds dont recruite shaman . However they would GLADLY take Clerics , Rogues , Wizards , beastlords , bards and basicly any outher class .<br />
I think its safe too say that as far as established guild desireability in the current state of everquest that Shamans are pretty low on the totem pole .. maybe not DEAD LAST but were prety low down there .<br />
I do think that is becase once you have 3-5 established full time shamans you really dont benifit hugely from adding more .<br />
Everquest has become a Fast paced game where FAST HEALING .. FAST DAMAGE and TANKABILITY are the 3 defining charicteristics one of the major factors in how &quot;desireable&quot; a class is too a guilld is stackability ... IF your class dosent stack well you will not be as needed as a Class that does .<br />
It used too be that sure we didnt stack BUT if a guild didnt have a shaman or two MAN were we missed .. these days though the BUT has been removed any high end guild will ALLWAYS have at least one or two shamans and heck if they dont .. they'll bot one .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A. Its certainly not &quot;any other class&quot;. Monks, SKs, Paladins, and Warriors with less than 10K hps and under 300 aa arent exactly getting invited anywhere either. <br />
<br />
B. Shaman is one of those classes thats burning out quickly in the new enviroment. This week they may not need shaman. Next week they might. Seriously. <br />
<br />
C. We are making noise. We are making progress. I remember when Rangers were the laughing stock of the game. I remember when Rogues were the worst class around. I remember when Warriors were only desirable on raids, and couldnt get XP groups. The game goes through phases. Honestly, when SOE dev's create content, I doubt they go &quot;but how will this affect shamans?&quot; They have a LONG history of putting out crap, then adjusting and tweaking. Necros are useful. Bards arent a joke anymore. Yeah, it sucks that this is &quot;our&quot; phase. There shouldnt be phases at all. But they happen. We have been slipping in desirability since the end of Kunark. Fortunately, our insane powerfulness carried us through a lot of it. Now, its gone. BLs have replaced us in a lot of ways. Druids got much better improvements in healing. Chanters are a combination of buff, debuff, and insane DPS in some encoutners that no one can compete with them. Thats the way the river flows. But I think we have made our point. I think they are listening. <br />
<br />
I am not a nay-sayer who thinks SOE doesnt listen to its users. Warriors made a stink, and got some nice changes, changes that made them MUCH better 1-group options for tanking than they were. Other classes have sucked, and been adjusted. Content tends to obsolete things in the game the dev's never seem to consider. I am not defending this, I am merely pointing out that they HAVE adjusted it in the past, and there is no reason to think we wont be adjusted as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All those classes have always stacked better than shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some guilds on Vazaelle are recruiting shamans.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is because of the mass exodus of shamans on Vazaelle.  High-end guilds are looking for shamans, because most of their own shamans quit or rolled alts.<br />
<br />
Guilds need shamans on raids.  The problem is that they only need two.  That creates a very competitive atmosphere among shamans, competing for those very few openings available to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not usually what raiding guilds like to hear from potential recruits ;). They want people with commitment. who are going to be there when they are needed, not gone in a month if they feel bored.<br />
<br />
But I find your comments interesting, raiding guilds usually have 3 or 4 shaman on their rosters. But we have been told time and time again by the &quot;experts&quot; that shaman are quiting in their droves, especially from raiding guilds. Your experience would suggest that that is not the case after all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think our desirability is decreased by the fact that (at least on my server) every  other paladin/SK has a shaman alt.   So even if you have a shortage of Main type shaman there is always one available to at least do malos/slow.  A bot shaman might not bring nearly as much to the table as a main but they can certainly cast malos and slow effectively enough.  Add the the fact that most guild will have several 65 bots and i some of those bots are nicely equiped with a decent number of AA's.<br />
<br />
In a strange way it isn't that we are undesirable which hurts us but that every hybrid wants a pocket shaman, we are too desirable.  How many other classes do you see rolling wizzy or rogue alts, there might be a couple but not many.<br />
<br />
And a shaman's main duties on a raid, unlike a pullers or cleric in CHR, are easily bottable.  That plus a lack of stackablility does hurt us.  But I would still rather be a shaman then sit in a CHR any day of the week :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I really think that if you want to go somewhere, come to my server then.  Every high end guild needs shaman, and until we just found another shaman, I had been running around for a while as the only raiding shaman.  Ideally, I'd like to have 3 - 4 on every night depending on the content.  2 shaman in the Ikk raids are good, but 3 for Ikk 4 and a solid 3 - 4 in uqua at least.  <br />
<br />
Personally I know the top three guilds on my server are recruiting shaman.<br />
<br />
I would not take a shaman bot and let them raid with me.  No way.  I do let one person come and park themselves near uqua if we are short and only i am present, but that is only for MGB purposes and they serve no other function.  <br />
<br />
Any class can be botted on a raid.  However, a best bot is only as good as the worst non-botted person.  If that's not the case, than maybe you should look at that person and ask why aren't they performing up to standards.  Sure you can sit there and hit the malos key when the mob is in camp and then slow it, but in that time, I would have already had the mob slowed and someone else buffed.  <br />
<br />
Let's face it though, how many classes can get away with having a huge number of people there and almost not be considered taking up valuable space. Well, you always need damage and why not take the best two classes for dps -- wizard and rogues.  You always need people to heal, so clerics stack well.  You always need people to tank stuff, so Warriors are great to have around too.  After that, there is a severe drop off in rest of classes needed.  Too many shaman around, not enough mobs to slow.  Too many chanters around, not enough mobs that need mezzing.  Too many rangers around, not enough mobs to kill them.  <br />
<br />
How do you really know if you are trying to maximize your damage output in a shaman role?  When you are one of the first ones to always get summoned when the tank goes down.  I tend to be #2 alot, after our best mage.  Just tonight I got summoned three times in Glorification when the mobs were at 0 - 5%, and most of them were just from one bane cast, and alot of crit nuking :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">... and for once, I actually somewhat agree with Val here (mark your calendars!)<br />
<br />
Thursday night I was just &quot;chillin&quot; in PoK, when I got a tell from a PoP progressing, but very casual guild who, surprisingly, had tons of shamans in guild, but 0 online for Aerin`Dar. Originally, I was asked if I had the flag (already did), but since I wasn't doing anything else (and was insanely bored at the time), I offered my services and they were accepted.<br />
<br />
One thing led to another, Aerin`Dar died... Rydda got walled and decided to wig out and leave everybody as a nice smear on the floor... and the leader and I got to talking. Apparently, most of their shamans now (despite having quite a number OF them) can't make Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, at all. How do I know this?<br />
<br />
Saturday night - Started with 4 shamans, ended with 2 of them.<br />
Sunday night - Started with 2, ended with ... 1.<br />
<br />
Granted, it IS a holiday in the US, people might be travelling and the like (craziness considering the price of gas right now, if you ask me) and the situation may be different in a week, but that's my observations, from a fairly heavily populated server no less.<br />
<br />
So... in some situations, shamans are still indispensible, sure... but unfortunately, the newer the content is, (and summarily, the faster it takes to ... take it out) the less that's getting to be the case. I can understand not wanting to have a half hour long fight (been there, done that, few times... even more boring than watching paint dry), but when it goes from &quot;somewhat balanced around that&quot; to &quot;suddenly not&quot;... that's time to step back and go &quot;Ok... where do we go from here?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shamans from my guild (pop progressing) have also found better things to do. There used to be 5-6 of them but now there are hardly 2 or 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damage output and aggro (cause of summoning) do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. A Wizard can do up to 6x our best nuke (with a crit, which is more likely because Wizards tend to max those AA faster than Shamans) yet that will not even generate the same aggro as 3 tics of Blood of Saryrn. <br />
<br />
One of our biggest complaints is the fact that we stack so poorly on raids because: <br />
1.- our nukes blow frogs, and <br />
2.- our DOTs generate far too much aggro in relation to the damage they do, and of course . . .<br />
3.- our heals look like Bind Wound on a tank taking quad 1200's<br />
<br />
The combination of these things makes us seriously unstackable. Poor DPS combined with poor healing. If we could consistantly stack 2 DOTs and nuke for 1.2-2.4K with a fast nuke (half the cast time of VS) or heal for a decent amount (1800 + focus and AA modifiers) while the DOTs were ticcing, we would actually contribute in a farily signicficat fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The first time my friends and I tried Aerin'Dar, it was a Shaman that pulled him.  :)<br />
<br />
I've found that there were very few Shaman around and now it seems like every one of my friends has made a Shaman alternate.  They may be twinked and have some better gear than I do, but over four years of playing a Shaman gives me some insight into how to work with other classes and fill in some gapes.  <br />
<br />
The guilds that have 2 - 3 Shaman and don't think they need more are sadly mistaken.  In my 40s I was with a group in Dreadlands.  We were three Shaman, 1 Shadow Knight and 1 Warrior.  One Shaman debuffed, the second one did DD and the third one healed.  Buffs were rotated between the three of us.  It was one of the fastest exp groups I ever had there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my guild and alliance fell apart about 2 weeks ago.  i talked to most of the high end guilds on the server and was either asked to app or told that while they don't need shaman they would be glad to have me app.<br />
<br />
why would they say that since after about 2 or 3 shaman on a raid we don't stack further?<br />
cuz i play a lot, am pushing to finish my time key, have 400 AA, have a lot of friends, and am near par with some of their shaman in terms of hp (outside the guilds that are nearly done with time).<br />
<br />
people quit the game, i don't see high end guilds turning away geared/flagged people who play a ton and know their class role in a raid situation.  unless they have 6-8 active shaman, with all the people quiting EQ recently i just don't get it.<br />
<br />
btw, i have no trouble finding groups, but i will agree shaman still need twiking for larger raid stackability and desirability.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Litgruv, this is an issue of stacking, not desireability.<br />
<br />
Shaman stacking has been an issue for a very long time, one that has never been addressed even partially. All guilds, no matter where they are in progression, need about 3 or 4 active raiding shaman MAX. This is to complete all buffs, and help with slowing. If a raiding guild has 3 or 4 shaman, another one is worthless. No job can be done by 5 shaman that cannot be done by 4.<br />
<br />
That being said, the desireability of EQ classes breaks down as follows. This is a huge flaw in everquest.<br />
<br />
1) Wizard<br />
2) Cleric<br />
3) Wizard<br />
4) Bard<br />
5) Mage<br />
6) Wizard<br />
7) Wizard<br />
8) Enchanter<br />
9) Wizard<br />
10) Warrior<br />
11) Shaman<br />
12) Pally/SK<br />
13) Wizard<br />
<br />
In short, the &quot;trio&quot; of grouping is trivial in raiding content. Raids require four classes. One very good warrior, enough clerics to spam supernal light long enough to keep anyone alive through a fight, a bard for each group (Bards are better slowers in the raid scenario than shaman or enchanters) to render everyone immune to AOEs and increase DPS of the raid by ~33%, and a whole sh!tload of wizards.<br />
<br />
The wizard is, right now, the king of burst DPS. This is why the unbeatable raid strategy is keep the main tank alive, and have every single one of your 29015 wizards crit Strike of Solusek at the same time. All other tasks are trivial in comparison. Kill fast, now, take precautions later.<br />
<br />
I challenge you to find a guild that says &quot;not needed&quot; under wizard applications. This is because they have a reverse stacking algorithm; the MORE wizards you have, the BETTER they become, because aggro can be spread among them, while maintaining DPS.<br />
<br />
The wizard is the most broken class in the game, shortly followed by bard, then cleric. That is the raiding trio, the force that cannot be stopped. All they need is a warrior or knight pawn to hit taunt for them and no target is too tough to beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That is not really true. A lot of encounters have significant off-tanking/CC requirements, and in those cases what happens on the main target is allmost trivial in comparison, its all about being in control of the adds. In some cases knights are preferred MTs. You generally need more than one warrior as well, at least 3, preferably more than that. Most successfull guilds maintain balanced line-ups to be able to deal effectively with whatever they come up against. The composition you are describing can only deal with one type of raid target.<br />
<br />
You also have to remember that raids are more than just killing the main target, there is allways a considerable amount of trash that needs to be pulled/split/killed/CCed. You need the capability to deal with that as well, just having a tank along with a bunch of clerics and wizards isnt going to get you too far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">read the enchanter boards. 'crowd control' has been a joke since after Luclin. In any case, crowd control and offtanking can be all done by the bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have been class lead in my guild for almost a year and we was raiding mostly EP.<br />
At one time we got short of shamans and usually we had 1 or 2 online at raid time only (Note that it was possible to raid anyway).<br />
<br />
I am just gonna cover the MGBble stuff on this post.<br />
<br />
Sad but true I had to explain to the guild leader that 3 shamans (only) are needed to get the job done (1 rebuff/2debuff-slow). He ended up recruiting more anyway which made it even easier for us. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons (not the only one) why enchanters are more wanted is because they need to MGB more spells than we need. Few of them at the raid means that nobody can mgb haste at some times.<br />
Once we MGB focus we just do the rest group by group with no problems and the spells will last long enough for mgb to pop back up.<br />
Same with the druids...  sometimes they need 4 of them (with mgb up)just to rotate SoW during a fight.<br />
<br />
IMO a very easy way for Sony to make shamans more desirable on raids is to give them something similar to paragon/SoW to mgb.<br />
Something nice for a shaman would be a heal overtime that every tick cure poison and disease (or even curse).<br />
<br />
This would be just one little change to help out the shamans.<br />

<br />
but yes, shaman desireability is disgustingly low, i log on to raid every now and then and ask for a Doth (corpse drag to certain raids) and get told &quot;sorry we are already here your too late&quot; yet there are no other shaman present for the MGB or what not, not even recruits (no shamans have been recruited in the last 2 months) so where do they get the extra 500 or so hps from ?<br />

<br />
     Another reason why you see guilds recruiting clerics/wizards/rogues constantly is due to the fact that these three classes burn out fast.  Each class is top in their department: cleric/healing; wizard/spell dps; rogue/melee dps.  The catch to this is that outside of their area of expertise is that there is little &quot;constructive&quot; utility, and hence a lot of players get bored with them.  Shamans have a lot of utility (some trivialized with new content), and that is why we see some many &quot; 5 years and counting..&quot; shamans on the servers.  If we don't feel like raiding/grouping we can always fall back to soloing- something not all classes can do efficiently.  <br />
     From what I have viewed on Brell, there is a large lack in shaman availability outside of raids.  I used to /role when I wanted to hide from grouping, but even that is not working as well anymore.  There are other shamans out there, but from what I have seen- many of them are very new.  A lot of these shamans have low aa counts, low hitpoints, and haven't progressed very far in PoP/GoD (not a bad thing, but sometimes not a viable option in specific scenarios.)  Some shamans don't canni, others are half-afk, and some just don't know what they are doing.  Many are alts, some are bots, and others are even ebay'ed; so it narrows down the availability of our class.  I find right now that slowers are desperately needed in Sol Ro, Elementals, and GoD just for the reason that there is literally no one on that is flagged/geared to mess with the content.  This is just the situation on Brell though, and could be very different on other servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">read the enchanter boards. 'crowd control' has been a joke since after Luclin. In any case, crowd control and offtanking can be all done by the bard.<br />
<br />
Since half the scripts in PoP and GoD involve large numbers of spawned adds, your characterization of &quot;crowd control&quot; as a &quot;joke&quot; is amusing to say the least :D. CC and offtanking are critical in those events, and I've yet to see a bard do either. I'm not sure how well a bard can tank relative to a real tank, since I haven't played one before, but the fact that most in raiding guilds have 3-4k hp less than their warrior companions means that there is likely no comparison.<br />
<br />
If guilds need someone for those roles they recruit chanters, warriors or knights, not bards. Bards are recruited for other reasons.</div></div><hr />

totally agree with you.  i anon and AFK and still get harrassed. once your name is out there for a decent shaman it is all over in terms of privacy.  &quot;come farm wasteoftime_01,&quot; &quot;come farm godinstanced_01,&quot; &quot;lets EP xp,&quot; &quot;come heal/slow/tank/pull a normal ldon,&quot; the list is endless...honestly i try REALY hard not to group outside my group of friends anymore, simply because of the fact that in nonuber groups a shaman can perhaps trivialize the content...people never forget your name then...<br />
<br />
<br />
back to topic, yes our stackability on raids needs fixed...i was the only shaman on raids for a long long time and did fine that way....a little busy but fine....it really shouldn't be this way..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It has nothing to do with alts. It has to do with the fact that the shamans don't offer ANY utility to the raid/groups other then slow and occasional, well placed/timed but crappy heal.<br />
<br />
Debuffs? Sorry, but mages and chanters can debuff as well, in addition to loads of utility spells and crowd control/useful summons/CoH and whatever. What does the shaman have to offer? A slow, a buff no one really misses because it's crappy, and, well, that's that. With slow mitigating mobs, or slow immune mobs, even that isn't such an issue, any bloody chanter or BST can slow in cases like this just as well. What do shamans have to offer in cases like this? DPS? Tanking? Healing? Good buffs? Nope. Nothing of that kind, literally every other class in these areas outperforms us easily. That's why there's really no need for more then 4 shamans max online on any guild raid either, because if there was more, they would simply have nothing to do. And that's only because we simply have not much else to offer.</div></div><hr />

You were proud of soloing/grouping (when you wanted to) for your career and then got tired of the game limitations. Now you have given the game another chance based on the premise that you are going to join a guild and make everything better. It hasn't happened, so the game once again sucks because &quot;shaman&quot; are not wanted/needed/whatever.<br />
<br />
I gotta pull the BS lever.<br />
<br />
Lack of stackability has ALWAYS been a shaman limitation. Of course it wasn't noticed because there were not that many folks playing shaman. Our biggest downfall was the period when everyone decided that shaman were flavor of the month. Thanks to those posting about soloing dragons in WW. Thanks again to them waving the 'power flag' in SOE's face resulting in no positive adjustments being made to a balanced class.<br />
<br />
Now there are simply too many shaman. The real downside is the majority of those are not shaman at all, but folks who made/got a shaman toon and haven't got clue-friggen-one how to play them. Actually, this comment can be attributed to many more than just shaman class.<br />
<br />
Long-to-short version of this is those shaman who excel, who have worked up with a guild and stuck with it, and who are 'real' shaman are very much in demand. I am not saying you are not one of those, Lit. I don't know you, or how you play your shaman. I am saying you left some steps out of your career path - and that was guilding. While your grouping reputation sounds solid, just like the difference between grouping and soloing is significant so is the difference between solo/grouping and being a raiding shaman. The slots available are few (always have been) and, regardless of who you know, for the higher end guilds your credentials better be outstanding as a raiding shaman if you want to be considered for one of the few slot.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that sucks goats ... as does most of the limitations on raiding sizes/requirements that have nothing to do with the people playing but rather by game design/limitations.<br />
<br />
I have to add that I am 100% sure that at least 1 guild on each and every server is looking for at least 1 shaman to add to their ranks.<br />
<br />
Penny - your comment about 'read the chanter boards' takes the point chanters have discussed completely out of context. Chanters bring lots to the table and CC is still a very stong skill on that list. Note the word 'skill.'<br />
<br />
Putting on the class hat doesn't make you an expert at that class. You earn that on your own - whether shaman or enchanter or, even, wizard.</div></div><hr />

While I agree with the majority of your post, this part is just silly.  I'm 100% sure that at least 1 guild on each and every server is looking for at least 1 BERZERKER... but that fact doesn't actually mean anything.<br />
<br />
I can about guarantee you that exactly zero EP guilds on Xev are looking for a shaman - and really, EP's are the only ones with any content to offer at this point.  Unless you're one of those hordes of shamans who're just DYING for their prismatic spear!<br />
<br />
Because let's be honest.  More than 4 regularly raiding shaman in your guild, and the 5th and later shamans will be worse than useless, they'll be getting more and more pissed off / demoralized with every raid.</div></div><hr />

I agree completely, LDoN and GoD really brought out a better awareness of other player's skill and class strengths and weaknesses.  I don't know how many times I have been in a group and someone says &quot; xxxx, 65 pally lfg- anyone know him?&quot;  Higher end guilds don't want to waste their time training new recruits, and I don't blame them.  If you are raiding X content you don't have time to explain to monk06 on the aspects of pulling- they should already know.   Lower level guilds will usually take anyone with minimal guild application requirements because they need bodies.  Those are your &quot;training wheel&quot; guilds where they have time to help new players and explain group dynamics.  It takes time to build an individual rep- it requires you to make friends and give a lot of &quot;face&quot; time to those you group with.  Coming back from retirement, many players may be facing the same situation where they just need to build their rep back up.</div></div><hr />

I have been playing this shaman as my main toon for 4 years and some. I like to think that I am a fairly competent shaman too. I have been in small guilds, I have been in big guilds. I have been in 2 guilds that were, at the time, 3rd or 4th guild on the server.  Right now, I am interminably in an app guild for one of the big guilds. I have the min. requirements, I have the AA requirements, I have the resists requirements. I can't get in, basically, as far as I can tell, because there are enough shaman active in the guild. I don't even know if they are particularly competent shaman, because it doesn't, in my experience, require massive skill to be a raid shamam. Skill is required in anything from soloing up to about 2-grouping.<br />
<br />
So my gear sucks, and always will, and I do LDoNs and mooch around...</div></div><hr />
