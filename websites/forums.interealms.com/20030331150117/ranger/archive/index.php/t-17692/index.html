<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerDave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone please explain Resist stats to me? Obviously, I realize that Poison, Disease, Fire and Cold resist stats apply to spell attacks of the relevant type, but what about Magic Resist? Does it only apply to spell attacks that don't fit into the other categories, or is it like an overarching stat that affects your resistance to all magical attacks?<br />
<br />
Also, I know that the relative level of the player and the mob are major factors in determining how often you resist their spells, but in general, when fighting level-appropriate mobs, how high do your resist stats have to be before they start to become a significant factor?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Magic resists stuff like Snare, Slow, Lightning nukes, Fear and all that other stuff.  So I guess you could say that it covers everything that &quot;doesn't fit&quot; into the other saves.  I never really looked at it like that myself.<br />
<br />
As for level-appropriate saves blah-blah, you really only see saves becoming useful beyond 200+ or that was the point they were at last time I was in ToV.  There aren't that many AE mobs in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SwordMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you saying that resists only matter in the end game and are not useful in the amounts available to characters in their 20s to 40s when fighting in XP groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sort of.  For instance, the majority of exp mobs have very weak nukes, when rangers and monks run around with 5k HP in PoV, the occasional blast for 600 is not going to bother you much.<br />
<br />
This is scaled up from the absolutely pitiful Burst of Fire that drachnids seem to like casting.  32 HP is *nothing* in Dreadlands, even at level 39.  Of course, this was almost two years ago, so the caster NPC overhaul may have changed this, but judging from the inanity of deathbone magi in PoD I doubt it.<br />
<br />
In EverQuest, resists are often an all-or-nothing.  For instance, the resists simply don't matter when you're exp grinding, because the spells are measly and pathetic.  Then you go on a raid and have to put your resist gear on because Maestro AE lifetaps, say, and you want all the MR you can get.  There's very little middle ground.</div></div><hr />
