<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, i did some searches and only came up with how radiant cure falls into our typical aa progression. My question is more on radiant cure itself, and in more detail, one of the effects it has.<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure 1 according to lucy:<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease Curse Counter by 9 <br />
2:  Decrease Poison Counter by 9 <br />
3:  Decrease Disease Counter by 9 <br />
4:  Remove Detrimental(1) <br />
<br />
Radiant Cure 2:<br />
<br />
1:  Decrease Curse Counter by 12 <br />
2:  Decrease Poison Counter by 12 <br />
3:  Decrease Disease Counter by 12 <br />
4:  Remove Detrimental(3) <br />
<br />
Radiant Cure 3:<br />
<br />
1:  Decrease Curse Counter by 16 <br />
2:  Decrease Poison Counter by 16 <br />
3:  Decrease Disease Counter by 16 <br />
4:  Remove Detrimental(6) <br />
<br />
Anyways, I understand how the counters work on poison, disease and curse. However, I'm not sure what to make of the Remove Detrimental (X). I know from my experience with RCure1, that it sometimes will cure malo cast by shaman mobs, but sometimes it wont. The only thing i can think of is that maybe thats the number of chances it tries to cure a detrimental effect, and it each try it will either succeed or not. If it has attempts left over, then it moves on to the next detrimental effect, and tries it. Either way, I haven't been able to figure out any rhyme or reason to it and I am hoping you guys can help me out. <br />
<br />
For what its worth, i currently have Radiant Cure 2. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any input guys. I didn't post this in the Spells section cause its more of an AA question, but if it needs to be moved i can understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">6 counters to a detrimental effect that isnt DR/PR based</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is definatly a chance for RC to fail. Sometimes it works on things like thunderblast/malo etc etc, whereas I have never ever had it fail me on something like tash.<br />
<br />
I've yet to determine exactly what they mean by &quot;detrimental&quot;. I dont remember seeing a lucy spell that adds detrimental counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, spells that are flagged &quot;Detrimental&quot; in lucy (such as malo) dont have counters. So that doesnt quite make sense to me. I have had the same experiences as you Krakster. Sometimes (at rc1 anyways) it would cure Malo, sometimes it wouldnt. Same with thunderblast in the example you gave. I just got Rcure 2, so i havent had a chance to test it out yet. Hopefully someone has figured this out, if not ill be sure to post my results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">May be way off base, and in no way have I tested it myself so...<br />
Could that counter, be the number of buffs/debuffs that it will remove per casting?<br />
ex. RC3, can remove 6 seperate debuffs, providing the spell can remove enough counters to account for it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd have to say no wastrelda. In my experience it's just a random chance. I've removed malosini on the first cast of RC and i've taken 5 casts of RC and still not removed. It seems to be pretty much random and I would guess that yeah it would mean 3 and then 6 tries at it either on one debuff or on multiple if it gets the first one soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd have to agree with Taraddar. Its totally random. Sometimes ill cure malo on the first shot, sometimes it takes 3 or 4, with RCure 1. Now that i have RCure 2, i haven't had the opportunity to test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It might have something to do with casting/stacking order, or location in &quot;slot window&quot;.<br />
<br />
Don't know if there is a connection, but dispell can work odd sometimes too. It doesn't always take the same buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe the higher the level of radiant cure the bigger chance you have of curing otherwise uncurable spells. Some uncurable spells are easy to cure, others just cant be done with any spells(Lure of the Storm from Avatar of Wind for instance). Malos/Malo is more inbetween in that it gets cured maybe 50% of the time.<br />
<br />
When it comes to dispell, the used dispell has a counter, the highest dispell counter is 9, it dispells the first spell in roughly 95%(shamans 9 counter dispells are actuall 9 times 2 so will mostly dispell the 2 first spells) of the cases. If it doesnt dispell it, the next round it seems to be able to dispell spells lower down. Other dispells with less counters such as 4, have a chance to either dispell the first or second spell, if it doesnt dispell on first round, it has a chance to dispell spells thats further down, or so it seems atleast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I found with RC1 that if I cured the Malo really SOON it would always be cured.  But if I waited a minute or two to attempt the cure, I would never be able to cure it.  <br />
<br />
Now i have  RC2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">taking a stab in the dark only  took a quick glance at the  info.  but i will bet the detrimental  numbers  check the duration formula of the spell.  they range form 0 to 9 on spells that cant be cured by other means. this  with rc topping at 6 and cleric's purify soul cureing 9 detrimentels got my vote =)<br />
<br />
duration formula  10 has mostly disease/poison dots or spells with disease poison counters. duration formula 11 is buffs.  duration formula 12 charms  duration formula 50 dire charms.  few were higher they were illusions or summoned items  but after duration formula 12 it skips to duration formula 50  then skild again to duration formula 70  skips to spell durations formulas 3600 or higher<br />
<br />
 i used eq caster for my info over lucky it allowd me to  oder all pc and npc spells by duration formula to make it  quick and simple to get a general idea but lucky  lists the duration formula as well in the spells's raw data  if ya have a fast enough connection and care enough to check it that way <br />
<br />
<br />
anyway thats my best guess i dont care enough to spend more time proving it =P good luck to you if ya care enough to prove it wrong or right=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the detrimental(x) is like using a dispel on yourself that only looks at detrimental spells.  Dispel has a chance to fail, as does the detrimental cure.  The higher the (x) the better chance of curing it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thats an excellent theory, Kaison. Thanks for the input. I'll check into it as soon as i get some time. So, if i understand correctly, spells with duration formulas of 7, 8, 9 cannot be cured with radiant cure, since it caps out at 6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I tried RC2 tonight on a Malo that was on for a couple minutes.  It cured it no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">any one else notice some times RC doesnt work properly if you dont have yourself or a party member targeted ?<br />
it would always remove malo from myself .. but if i had the mob targeted while casting it wouldnt remove malo from party members<br />
this being with RC3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I looked on the duration formula and Lure of the Storm has Duration Formula: 1, which is a spell I yet havent been able to cure with RC3.</div></div><hr />
