<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got a pouch yesterday so have decided its time to get rings for the guild as its about time to hit SSRA a little harder.<br />
<br />
Trouble is I can not find a decent map that names rooms and mobs. For example Shissar Ring quest guides talk about the Imperial Guard room or something, the place where you kill for the Insignia. I dont know where this room is and short of crawling the place I am running out of people to ask.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to point me to either a good map that shows me where ring related rooms are or a guide that does something similar?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Each 'floor' has a piece -- the basement warders drop the pouch, which you said you already have.  Warders are the only ones that don't always drop their part -- the other three floors are named mobs and they will always drop their part.<br />
<br />
First floor:  the commander there can spawn in a number of spots, including the area beyond the ramp (there is a 3 spawn room at end of hall, 6 spawn? room to right leading to the tunnel to 2nd) and the assassin room -- as well as the right most hall from zone in, which leads to the other half of 2nd floor.  Check tracking, if he's not up, just pick a spot and start killing.  He's not too uncommon.  He and the elite guards on first floor are slowable.  This isn't a bad spot for experience since the recent changes -- and 1 of the 10 or so cdrs on this level I've killed dropped a bridle, too.<br />
<br />
Second floor:  either 'half' will spawn the commander on this level.  The commander isn't tough, but the elites cannot be slowed.<br />
<br />
Third floor:  The insignia drop off the General, Arbitor, and ... (forget the third named one).  To get there, go through the Assassin room and up the tube to third... this is also the room that has the portal to the Emperor.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a little searching around will find better guides than this, this is just meant to give you an idea.</div></div><hr />

General, Arbitor, and Advisor <br />
<br />
And these are some pretty good maps:<br />

Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Basement pouches are by far the easist to get. Most of the time, they drop like candy, although there are only like 6 spawns per 2 hours.<br />
<br />
First floor we normally did the assassin room, and the mobs around the tube behind it (which leads up to the third floor for the insignias)<br />
<br />
Second floor commanders are the bitch in this quest. They are very rare. You will end up spending most of your time on the second floor.<br />
<br />
Third floor, wait until you have the other pieces for nearly everyone, and then take the entire guild up to the third floor and kill everything. Your DPS will hopefully be high enough that you can pretty much clear the entire area just as repops start in. It will probably take a couple nights to get enough insignias, but there are normally 1-2 named pops per clearing.<br />
<br />
One benefit of spending all that time in Ssra is that you are there when something pops, and can get right on it.</div></div><hr />
