<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been up since 0330 (It's 0950 now) so running on about 1 hour of sleep.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am sure there is a good reason not to implement this, but it's not coming to me. (Like sleep). So here goes.<br />
<br />
What if ND items were tradable to toons on the same ACCOUNT? That is you put said ND item in the &quot;common&quot; slot of your bank for access by the other 7 toons on the same account.<br />
<br />
This would really help with quest items, specifically Epics. <br />
<br />
I kow one immediate concern is twinking, but shoot, spend the platz, buy a Fungal, voila, level 50.  Throw in a DS or two, and you can be 65 in about 10 days played.<br />
<br />
Looney tunes idea? Any merit? (Not that I ever expect to see it come to fruition)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've MQ'd some items from the same box, loot something with my shm, hand it in, log up my monk (which I camp at the npc) and finish the hand in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To much of a problem imo... You could twink a level one way to nicely with no drop stuff and people would be asking for loot all the time for their alts :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The problem here is that stuff wouldnt be getting taken out of the game. All done with that 8th Shawl? Pass it down. Replaced earring of Solstice? Give it too a twink. Stuff would be in the game forever. <br />
<br />
I have 1 10-slot bag in my bank I keep some of my old no-drop stuff in, for sentimental reasons. The rest I destroy as I upgrade. This isnt the old days where it was wise to have extra stuff banked in case you had a REALLY bad CR to do. I think Tribute and Casino are targeted SPECIFICALLY to remove old items and pp from the general pool. They won't add a method to make you keep even more junk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They need to just go through and put Recommended and Required levels on everything and get rid of the No Drop tag except for very few items (Epics, etc.) similar to how Firiona Vie is set up.  Recommended Levels would keep the twinking down since the stats would not be as good.<br />

If No Drop tag was removed a lot of the older items would end up being turned in for Tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What Jaradis said.<br />
My bank has 6 bags of old gear in it.<br />
All my NToV and other Velious, Ssra, epic, PoH, and other gear I still have banked.<br />
If they put recommended levels on that stuff, some of it I would twink, some I would sell, and possibly some I would tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why would it be more acceptable to allow people to twink their own alts with nodrop rather than twinking someone elses?<br />
I encourage anyone who wants to try life without nodrop to try firiona vie for a while.  Sounds great at first, buy whatever you want.  When you get to the point where you are raiding, it sucks enormously.<br />
The problem of not enough raid content on crowded servers is greatly worsened when you have to fight solo/group/guilds using up content to farm items to sell to plat dealers.  Real $$ is more ingrained in FV than any other place, and its not a pretty thing at all.<br />
Time guilds farming VT tonight?  Yep, look to see it all for sale for plat/$$ tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
