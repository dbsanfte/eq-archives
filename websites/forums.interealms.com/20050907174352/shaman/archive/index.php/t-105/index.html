<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this has been posted alot but what is the max DS dmg u can get???? And won't it be bigger b/c of bard AA stuff???<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you mean our potions, or max stackable DS sort of like the regen threads that have been going around a bit?<br />
<br />
I believe our stronger DS potion is level / 2 + 1.<br />
<br />
No idea if you wanted the latter. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I doubt if you can ever get a real definitive answer on max damage shield.   There are so many stacking sploits out there...The highest I have personally seen was somewhere around 150, not sure how sploited that was though.  <br />
<br />
anyways, you have bards, rangers, druids, mages, wizards and shaman potions.   Plus you have clerics with MoR... that's a weirdly kind of damage shield too, though not a buff on you, but a debuff on the mob.  Then you have items.  Chardok Ring, Coldain Rings... etc.<br />
<br />
Some general things I have seen.<br />
Wizards DS doesn't stack with Call of Earth (Ranger)<br />
Druids and Mages don't stack.<br />
Shaman potions seem to stack with all.<br />
I am told with all the bard (Instrument Mastery, etc) AA they can sing 2 songs for about a 59pt damage shield.<br />
<br />
Bard: 59 <br />
Mage: 33 <br />
Ranger:  4 (CoE)<br />
Shaman Potion: 31<br />
10th Coldain ring: 10<br />
<br />
Which is 137.   <br />
<br />
There are other variations, and tons of exploits and probably lots of other items with damage shield that stack that I don't know about.   Other classes, such as ranger have self buffs and stuff I think that could get them higher.   Shaman with JBBPs will also have bramblecoat buff from that (not sure if it stacks with COE)... etc etc.<br />

Did your 2 sentences really require 7 question marks?  ;)<br />
<br />
/petpeeve off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a friend in my guild that uses at least 2 question marks after every question and every time I read a question by her I automatically think that she's in desperate need of an answer or that it's something extremely important...when really it's just a normal question.<br />
<br />
Can be a bit annoying to be sure, but it's the least of her many quirks hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dangrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Highest I heared is 197 +15pt on MoR. Highest seen in the 158 area +MoR.<br />
<br />
You also forgot lava gem from VP mage staff (25pt), Bard SS bracer (9?), the RF arms (another 12), you take the Dain ring over CoE (dont stack together), Wiz ds (yes only 4pt or so but everything counts) and there is suppose to be a stacking issue so you get both Druid + Mage DS on top of each other... Bards is a must though for most of the stacking (&lt;<br />
<br />
Also Creator Mage dagger DS is 35pt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's also a bp drop in Grieg's that has bramblecoat (druid self DS/AC buff) as a click effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">By stacking DS potions and my backpack JBBP - i get a whooping 36dmg DS! ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Supposedly there is a bug with /shield disciplines that makes the druid 600 point DS (which is only supposed to last for 1 hit) actually sustain for the duration of the buff and return damage with each hit. I dont know if they fixed it or not, but a 600 DS would be pretty mean.</div></div><hr />
