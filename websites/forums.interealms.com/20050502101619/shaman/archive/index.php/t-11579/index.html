<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Deja-Vu. Seems like I've already started one nice size discussion on this before about a Month ago. However, my guildmate was saying that with LoY, you could no longer turn off all Luclin graphics and still get the meditation benefits while using a horse...?<br />
<br />
I am unable to log in for about a week to check myself, just curious, did they really implement this in LoY? <br />
<br />
Make sure this is recent information, and umm a short answer would be all that is need. :)</div></div><hr />

Ya but you still have to deal with the stupid horse and all its negative effects :/</div></div><hr />

Only reason they did this now is so that all the people that can't stand the horse's head would sell their horse at a loss and buy a lizard. <br />
<br />
I did x2 still pissed about it but ah well. <br />
<br />
The thing they really need to fix now is not being able to interupt spells. Already had two deaths because I couldn't interupt cheal in time with my cleric to change spells or targets.</div></div><hr />

I agree that it would be nice to be able to duck while on a horse.  However, in an emergency you can still type /dism to dismount &lt;b&gt;while you are still casting&lt;/b&gt;, then hit &quot;d&quot; to duck out the spell.  I have used this many times when we'd get an add while I was casting some spell (usually a long casting spell like Kraggs).  Note that having /dism on a hotkey won't work, you get the message that you cannot use that command at the time.  You have to actually type /dism, so its not the most efficient thing in the world, but certainly helps at times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't duck out of spells (no, typing /dism and hitting d is not enough to make me happy).<br />
<br />
Damn MOTION while standing still and casting spells.  I keep thinking I have moved accidentally and interrupted my spell.<br />
<br />
Slow start and slow stop suck rocks, especially when soloing, when I do a lot of root and back off maneuvers.<br />
<br />
I can live with the extra food consumption and (reluctantly) with the horsehead, but not this stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know you can type /dism then interrupt but the extra two seconds it takes to do that then retarget or whatever is not enough to save someone if they are getting hit as hard and as fast as say an unslowed add in PoS as happeded the other day. <br />
<br />
Add shows up, chanter's mez is resisted, I dismount then interrupt heal on tank to heal chanter who is going down fast, chanter dies less then a sec before heal lands. Add turns on me and resists slow and root and quickly kills me before finishing rest of group.</div></div><hr />
