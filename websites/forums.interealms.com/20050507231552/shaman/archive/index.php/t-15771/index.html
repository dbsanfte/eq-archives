<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild and I, 10 people a little more i think.( 5 RL friends, duel comping ) decided to try burrower in AC tonight.  Not all of us 65, not real uber gear, but ok i think for what we have done.  So, first try is great get him to 40% but cleric got hosed so that was that. second try is cool 30%, but tank goes down this time, hits way too fast for the pally with mitigated disease slow.  We got this in the bag now, 99% sure this ugly mofo is going to die to us.<br />
<br />
But funny thing happened then, as we where buffing/debuffing for next try, nearly ready to go again.  This guild zones in and starts forming behind us in the water.<br />
<br />
Next thing i know they walk right over us and engage.  so we engage, what other option have we been given? heh  They then back off a bit after we engage and of cource we die after being half buffed and half mana. Then they zerg him after we are gone.<br />
<br />
There was a cleric there from thier guild that was kind enough to click us when we failed the first and second one, only to get shafted by him and his friends once he called them all down.<br />
<br />
So how much is too much?  I dont think we were there that terribly long trying him those whole 2 times. Does a smaller group of friends have different rights to that of a normal guild?  I feel shafted and abused, because there is absolutly nothing that can be done.  GM's? give me a F'ing break.  I was so mad i just swore in them ooc untill my brain hurt.<br />
<br />
The only solution i can see is a guild war, so i can stomp all over thier asses untill i feel better....untill then i will just go to bed hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMO they (the cleric) watched you wipe 2 times. Technically after the first wipe its fair game. It is possible they knew you were goin to try a third time and were waiting behind you, they should have asked just out of courtesy, but they definatly didnt have to. The fact that they backed off when you jumped in after they engaged (and carefull that is considered an attempted KSing)  says to me they were willing to give you another shot to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey cabe, <br />
<br />
   I hate to say it becuase i'm more likely to be in a guild like you described than a bigger guild but they seemed to give you enough chances. While it would be nice to be able to sit and peck at a mob til you get it deaded dont think its something thats going to happen. <br />
<br />
   Mean how long would you sit through another guild failing at something? &quot;only two times&quot; may seem short to you while its happening but id bet was a pretty long time with two sets of rezzes and rez effects and than rebuffs. <br />
  How much longer would it have taken if their cleric didnt rez you all and give you another shot and just killed it themselves? Oh wait wouldnt of mattered than.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Welcome to the world of too many people, not enough content.  Nothing terribly wrong with what happened IMO, although it would have been courteous of the guild zoning in to at least attempt to talk with you first.  The basic rule of racing is first to engage.  Bein nearby and buffing means nothing.  First to engage has the rights to the mob.  It sucks that there are so many people in the 50+ group looking for something to do and not nearly enough content to satisfy them all, but that's just the way it is. :(<br />
<br />
You got 2 shots and learned a fair bit, next time you can hopefully knock it out first try!  That's pretty typical really.  Most guilds don't get repeated attempts at mobs to learn and finally kill it their first night for the same reason you didn't.  There's almost always some other guild aware of the spawn and heading that way to kill it if you fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't blame the other guild, blame SOE for not enough content, too many high level folks. Unless you are the guild leading the way through new content, you will be competing with other guilds for every encounter. It sucks but until SOE does something about it, you have to get it right the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok im up again:)<br />
<br />
Just seem wrong to me to steamroll a younger guild trying to kill something.  <br />
<br />
Btw its not like they where sitting there waiting through all the attempts....they where off xping, or doing something.( they are one of these running around anon guilds, you know the ones that used to ks ragefire, you know the like. )  They showed up just AS we were going to try again.  I imagined they would take it if we failed again.  Which is cool, you guys are right, i dont expect them to wait.  I even said in /gu  we need to win or it's thiers.  Alas, we never got the chance.<br />
<br />
In all my 3+ years with EQ, **** like this happens to me, or someone i know all the freeking time.   Wake up SoE, and do something about it.  Its not that hard, log on a GM and slap thier wrist.  If they werent so ****ing cheap mabey a GM would be on alteast SOMTIMES.<br />
<br />
So whats next?  They will get thiers, even if i have to go SZ style on thier ass.  I've done it before with my monk and i'll do it again!  Stooping to thier level? mabey.  But there has to be some sort of action taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One time we went for Zland, and as we were buffing up an HK &quot;Uber Guild&quot; rolls up behind us.  We say we are going in and could they please back off.  So they stay on the other side of the river.... until their cleric &quot;Just wanted to take a look&quot;.  We had half our group set to charge while the rest were running over to Zland, when we see the cleric go running past us, agro zland and then tried running back to his guild.  Zland proceeded to spin in circles like he was going to pop somewhere and then he was gone.  When we figured out where he was, he was back to the river and chomping on half the raid while the other half were running back from his room.<br />
<br />
We wiped, though at the end we had everything locked down and it was just the MA, me and a cleric alive.  So the other guild was &quot;kind&quot; enough to click us back and let us loot the Claw....great.... thanks....<br />
<br />
We would have had him np at all if not for their jag off cleric.  I hate rude people, problem is there are tons of little kids &amp; antisocial jag offs that play this game so it's something to deal with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think that, like the other posters mentioned, it is simply a matter of not enough content and too many people wanting to experience that content.  <br />
<br />
It would have been courteous of the other guild to let you make your third attempt without rushing you, but if they knew the mob was up and knew you failed twice (as it seems they did) they could make the argument that you had your chance at the content and failed.  <br />
<br />
I would say just focus on the positive; you made a good effort, learned some things, and will certainly do better next time.  There is really no point in dwelling on the negative asepects, since it is something that is already over and done with.  <br />
<br />
I did not see any mention of you trying to communicate with them in your message, though.  Did you make any effort to let them know that you intended to engage the mob a third time?  Did you talk to them about it at all and see what they thought of the matter?  Communication is a two-way street, after all.<br />
<br />
There is also one other thing to consider.  Isn't that mob a race mob on your server?  If so, the general rule is usually &quot;first to engage the mob&quot;, not &quot;first to engage the mob, wipe, engage the mob, wipe, and then prepare to engage the mob again&quot;.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes there was communication between us, they knew we were trying again, i guess they just didnt care.<br />
<br />
No its not a race mob really, VS is empty pretty much lol.  It's actually what i like most about the server, its not a rat race.  All the people i have met on VS have been kind and courtious(sp?).  Untill just recently we havent had a problem with anyone really.  Aside from being pushed aside like cold dinner by the local uberguild a couple times.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes that would have been nice wouldn't it?  a little courtesy is all i ask.  Like i said before, they werent even there untill we were almost ready to engage the last time.  Couresy rolls both ways.....we wouldnt have asked them to wait around if we failed again.  But ****, have a little heart what is 15mins for us to die again to content that is trivial to them?  On that note, i think if ready we would have won that time.  Because your right. on the posititve we did learn a few things.( Hadn't done him since change...started fresh on VS. )<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just wanted to add.  I know what you mean, by little content among players.  My new server it wasnt a problem really since the pop. is so low.  Although i have been in uberguild02 on my previous server.  When the **** hits the fan there its a little different.  Having a lead roll on the pull team and 60+ players there to back me up when im fighting to pull mobs in a race.  I seem to remember an AoW fight that was a fun one, with the other guild eating all the mod rods on the ground, as im running back with him heh<br />
<br />
This situation to me, just seems to be the stomping on of younger players trying to experience content for thier level.  My whole point is common coutesy.  Is there no place for that here?  While it still is a just a game,( as they put nicely as i was going off on them on /ooc, hah ) there are still REAL people playing these toons.  I guess i should just be glad i dont know these people in RL....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont think they were in the wrong for engaging him after watching you wipe twice.  They could have waited until you guys gave up and left to engage, we've done this before with some mobs.  It's a judgement call by the RL though.  I dont see any foul play here though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They showed up just AS we were going to try again.

Alas, we never got the chance.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much the end of the story, right there.  You and the other guild both wanted a mob.  They were ready and engaged first.  They won.  Sigh for your loss, grats them for the win, and move along.  There's no reason to try to exact some revenge, because there wasn't anything wrong with what they did.<br />
<br />
There's not enough content for every single guild to have a full nights worth of raid targets for themselves, and thus you have to jump on what's available as soon as possible.  In a way, I like that aspect of EQ as it adds a dimension of competion between guilds.  Ideally, it's friendly competition where both sides are reasonable and things work out over time to a relative balance.  <br />
<br />
I look at it similar to when people do camp checks.  It always makes me laugh when someone yells out that they are &quot;Claiming XXX camp&quot; while they have half a group at the zone and are waiting for more to show up and then clear to said camp.  There are no reservations in EQ.  Technically speaking there are no camps either, but that much is at least commonly agreed upon among the players even if not enforced by SoE.  Similarly the commonly agreed rule for guilds racing to a raid target is first to engage.  &quot;Claiming&quot; a mob means nothing without action, i.e. Engaging said mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">guess my edit should have just been a new post heh ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well if we are speaking in this regard, im pretty sure our tank actually landed the first blow as he saw them rushing in.   I didnt think it has to get that technical, considering the afore mentioned common COURTESY!<br />
<br />
So then if its all just technical like that, and you go back on some logs or something.....our tank would probably have the first hit in.  We engaged at about the same.  Who hit it first is a moot point, in the point that i'm trying to make atleast...<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: i forgot he had been plinking it for quite some time to piss it off a little. Does that fall under yout technicality? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is actually one of the things I really like about my new guild.  Not long after I got tagged, we heard King Tormax was up (not a big target for us, but still, some upgrades) so we headed out for Kael.  Someone else got there first, so we told them we'd give them 2 tries, and even sent some folks up to help buff them faster.<br />
<br />
They succeeded on the second try.  At that point, someone noticed Vindi was up, but some THIRD guild was running that way next to us, and one of the officers said, &quot;let's not get in a race, there's plenty of other stuff to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which we did.<br />
<br />
Just because you CAN breathe down someone's neck for a spawn doesn't mean it's nice to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Exactly, Thank you, Rorgg...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Rorgg nails it again.  If someone has a mob engaged, then go someplace else.  In this day and age there are ALWAYS mobs up somewhere to do.<br />
<br />
Besides, who wants to be a part of a cluster like &lt;a href = &quot;http://pub142.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=3559.topic&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just seem wrong to me to steamroll a younger guild trying to kill something.  <br />
<br />
So whats next?  They will get thiers, even if i have to go SZ style on thier ass.  I've done it before with my monk and i'll do it again!  Stooping to thier level? mabey.  But there has to be some sort of action taken.<br />
<br />
I thought you had some validity with your comments, but then you say you've trained people before and you'll train again? takes away any kind of respect I can ever have for you, but probably doesn't matter to you anyway....<br />
<br />
Lets say you are xping and have the dogs camp in pon.. and you wipe.. 10s later another group will be there to soak up the loots xp.. (well pre openning of new pop zones).. <br />
<br />
I think your mistake is thinking that if a guild starts zoning into a zone in the high end game, that the others back off cause they were there first,(and your guild was small so you got picked on) it's actually exactly the opposite.. for the emperor in ssra, 4 guilds have their eye on em, they will literally wait with like 60+ people strong (each guild) to see if the other guild fails, if they do they then will wait an addtional 4 hours for the trigger to come back up and then go at it.. or they will wake up EARLY in the morning to take out the guy.. when our guild was there trying to keep this trouble out of VT, we would go in 2+ hours before emp would have to spawn sometimes waiting a loooooong time before it would spawn.. <br />
<br />
It has to be limited content imo, but I dunno how to fix the whole problem, maybe make each encounter need more people like 140 people.. but if they just make each /raid zoning into a zone have their own instance of it, it'll be stupid,.. every mob will be up that you want etc.. no challenge to the whole thing..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just because you CAN breathe down someone's neck for a spawn doesn't mean it's nice to do.<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering, how many people were there and how long did they wait? And also in your case it was just a random meaningless mob that you guys were going to off.. but in the other case you don't know if they really had the guy on their list as an important target or what..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hehe, read the other posts before you give your opinion.  Yes, there was one cleric there from the guild, asking if he could watch.  <br />

<br />
Yes i have on SZ, but thats part of monk tactics in pvp. no i havent here yet.  On that note though, what other actions can be taken?  My friend that was there put it pretty well i think...   &quot;It's like someone coming up to you in RL and kicking mud in your face for no apparent reason. &quot;  <br />
<br />
So, what are the consequences for an ******* in EQ? If someone kicked mud on me in RL i would probably not be likely to bend over and take it.  Sony doesnt care, uberguild01 doesnt care, only the small ones that get stomped on care.  If you have a better idea then killing them over and over again untill im satisfied, please speak up! lol<br />
<br />
Edit: the one person in zone watched us for the 2 tries, total of mabey 45mins before he called his friends.  The rest of them? they didnt wait 5mins.  Considering how fast they showed up, i assume they threw some buffs on upon entering the water, then just swam past..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sherah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Respect goes both ways.<br />
<br />
Expecting to keep trying over and over when you do not have enough to do a mob...tying it up for hours...is not respectful.<br />
<br />
You gave it 2 shots...if their cleric wasn't there to rez you, you'd not even have the 2nd shot.  So /boggle on that one.<br />
<br />
Suck it up and make sure you have prolly a half a group to full group more and kill it the first time so you won't have issues.<br />
<br />
And please, you came here asking what we thought...stop sniping at ppl who tell you that you had your chance, it was their turn.  You asked, you got, you learned for next time.<br />

For that matter, i dont think i was rude/disrespectful to anyone in my reply's. Who knows, mabey one of my posts has swayed someone one way or the other, thats the point isn't it? :p<br />
<br />
Respect goes both ways.<br />

Ya actually read through some of my posts, i said that also.<br />
<br />
You gave it 2 shots...if their cleric wasn't there to rez you, you'd not even have the 2nd shot.  So /boggle on that one.<br />
<br />
Ummm, Have you done this mob?  Hes rooted in place, and there is nothing around him to aggro.....nothing see's invis, and our cleric was bound outside along with the enchanter, heh.<br />
<br />
Expecting to keep trying over and over when you do not have enough to do a mob...tying it up for hours...is not respectful.<br />
<br />
Again, read some of the previous posts.....try 45mins, and yes we had PLENTY of people.  I also mentioned earlier, that they werent even around waiting for the mob, just the cleric that asked to watch.<br />
<br />
Suck it up and make sure you have prolly a half a group to full group more and kill it the first time so you won't have issues.<br />
<br />
We had no problem sucking up the deaths, and even letting them have the mob once they where there. Point is they showed no respect toward us, and steamrolled us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh, if you were on Tarew Marr you'd be so used to getting ganked, KS'd, cockblocked, etc that you wouldn't need to ask this question.<br />
<br />
You guys had 2 uncontested tries at the mob. Count yourselves lucky.<br />
You learned the tatics for the mob. Next time take a few more people, and remember those tatics and you should succeed.<br />
<br />
If these were TM guilds, I'd say the guild that came in second backed off only to &quot;Let them weaken it&quot; (a TM trademark), and you're lucky as hell some other guild's cleric did more than res your own cleric.<br />
<br />
On our server, It's not &quot;First in Force&quot;, it's &quot;First to engage&quot;... and screw anyone in the way. Small guilds do not try Vindi when the Statue's up, because they know that at least two of the bigger guilds will be racing for AoW (and he who gets Idol doesn't necessarily own AoW).<br />
Spawned events like aow, cursed, etc are ks'd all the time. Plenty of tells between friends in different guilds go...&quot;Sorry man, following orders&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a rough world out there. Be a shark or get eaten.  :mad: <br />
It's not fair, and some do strive to not be that way, which is a great thing.</div></div><hr />

First I'm a retard didn't know what SZ meant, pvp all I know goes out the door :) and 2nd what to do on non pvp is a problem, but training is not the solution.. dunno what is.. once you start training them, then they start training you and it turns into stupidity.. their monk fd right next to the burrowers corpse (that you took out) etc so the loots can't be distributed..</div></div><hr />

You have 2 options:<br />
1) Get your guild stronger so you don't wipe.<br />
2) Nothing.<br />
<br />
Going &quot;SZ style&quot; as you brag, will accomplish exactly one thing: You being banned from EQ.<br />
<br />
2 uncontested tries against a VERY contested spawn is more than you could reasonably expect to get. Most guilds would have fought you for the first one.<br />
<br />
If you weren't so totally biased, you could see that you didn't even come close to getting screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">nothing you can do for this, at lease they are pretty good enough to back off engage, and rez you guy; that is 100x better than old day King Tormax, or Statue/AoW racing. there can up to 3 guild rush to train/ks each other and claim it is their mob, or similar for AoW/Statue with both guild try waiting other guild to clear Vindi so they can pull Statue<br />

I've never pushed and shoved.  In the UK we had a disaster at a football ground once where dozens of people were crushed to death by the crowd.

I am going to admit right off the bat, i hate the disease called society.

Cutting infront of old ladies and cutting people off in traffic? I dont think so.  If you do, its a little late for you, sorry, society already has you deep in its grasp.

<br />
If you want to go for mobs above a certain level you have to understand that it -is- a multiplayer game and that you will be competing for it. If you want that mob be prepared to play the exact same games raiding guilds play when they go after spawns- racing, cockblocking like the example siludorf gave of his guild with VT, the lag out ploys of dropping 60 or more people right on top of another raid, etc..<br />

<br />
Oh God have mercy, I thought the VT key camp was hellish, and I never even had any competition at any of the camps.  With people actively trying to STOP you from getting them... egads.<br />
<br />
Currently my guild is sharing VT with one other, with I think 4 or 5 guilds pretty much past VT and doing other stuff.  We've worked out a time share on Emperor and VT where we help each other with the rifts as needed and trade off VT.  It's worked quite well.  A couple weeks ago, a third guild, which has started on its keys, killed the emperor for the first time.<br />
<br />
Naturally, this is a little nervous, and while we'd LIKE to retain our current 2-sided rotation, we haven't even discussed doing anything aggressive towards the third guild.<br />
<br />
Ahh well, it's sad that that sort of thing goes on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Yeah the burrower in AC is one of those kind of spawns.  Can be done with low numbers and has a lot of nice items.<br />
<br />
Our very first attempt (forever and a year ago now), we were fighting, currently engaged on the burrower.  Not one, but two other guilds moved in.  They assembled inside the little part where the burrower himself is... not the outer cave but the inner.  While we were fighting.  After there was about 60 people in there, all buffing themselves, casting on us and our mob (dispelling debuffs, casting focus repeatedly on our cleric) finally our cleric lagged out enough to be late on a cheal, chloroblast wasn't a good enough cover and our tank went down.  Quickly followed by the rest of us.  <br />
<br />
The other two guilds jumped in and killed the burrower when it was at 8%.<br />
<br />
Then they fought with each other over the loot and ended up splitting it between themselves.  Even though we did 92% of the damage to the mob, were there first and would have won without their interference they never apologized or offered to share the loot with us.  Neither guild spoke to myself or the guildleader about the situation.<br />
<br />
I have never been so furious before over a game.  I almost quit EQ that day for good, figuring if this is what the &quot;high-end game&quot; is like, I couldn't deal with it.<br />
<br />
We also had another guild train rats down on us and KS Zlandicar from us long ago.  They even had the audacity to post a story about it on their website, with a picture of one of our rangers with the killshot and a comment about how easy it was.  Certainly it must have been easy, Zlandicar was easy for us with 8 people or so, 10 months ago, when you add your 40 people to our 8, it gets a lot easier.<br />
<br />
In both cases GMs claimed they could do nothing because they did not see what was going on. <br />
<br />
At any rate, if you are a little guild as you say, be prepared to be railroaded all over town.  Try to maintain good relationships with other guildleaders/leadership on your server.  Make sure your members are well behaved.  Don't shout, name call and otherwise make inflammatory comments in public channels and the like - in raids or otherwise.  Make sure all communications go through one person, preferably the guildleaders of both guilds or at least an officer so there is no room for misunderstanding.  Learn to move fast, that is the biggest advantage of being a small guild.  <br />
<br />
Learn to pick your battles, don't race for a spawn that other people are already gathered at.  You will just have to accept that you usually won't get second chances on mobs.  Either you win and collect your loot or you lose and step aside gracefully after you have had your shot.<br />
<br />
My guild is small (fluxuate between 2 and 3.5 groups on raid days) but I think we are fairly well respected on our server, so it is possible to be modestly successful as a small guild.<br />
<br />
Hopefully instancing in LDoN will go far to resolve these issues with racing for mobs, after 4 years of doing it, it just gets worse all the time.  We started doing it with Venril Sathir and I, for one, am damn tired of it.</div></div><hr />

It's great (for you) that you have a philosophy of complete satisfaction of other people complete at your own expense...but allow for the possibility that others don't feel the same way, and more significantly, that maybe you aren't right.<br />

What gives them the right to ruin my fun? How many attempts at a contested spawn is fair to you, Crusty? 50?<br />
<br />
 But where, in anything you have written, is there a justification for how you behave?<br />
<br />
I don't see anything in there that needs justification. Cabe's guild got two TOTALLY UNCONTESTED attempts at a highly contested mob. If it weren't for this other guild's cleric rezzing them (instead of calling in his guild while Cabe's was running back to acrylia to CR), they wouldn't even have gotten the second attempt. This other guild was MORE than fair to a force that was clearly not up to the job. You are the one who needs to justify their viewpoint. How can you rationalize people taking time (the most valuable commodity in existance) away from other people at their own convenience and without any regard for other people?<br />
<br />
Cabe-<br />

False. They knew you had already had 2, see above.<br />
<br />
You wouldn't with me, or any other decent person in line behind you. <br />
<br />
The person in front of me (and everyone else in line, holding them up as well) is being deliberately rude and inconsiderate to everyone else, I see no reason to be solicitious to such people. Perhaps you enjoy being trampled on, I don't.<br />
<br />
Henora-<br />
casting on us and our mob (dispelling debuffs, casting focus repeatedly on our cleric) finally our cleric lagged out enough to be late on a cheal,<br />
<br />
Now Crusty/Cabe/Rorgg...pay attention: THIS BEHAVIOR IS DIFFERENT. Taking active steps (which BTW, Cabe, is what you were threatening to do, so please don't open that hypocritical mouth at me again) to sabotage other people is *way* beyond ok.<br />
<br />
I quit my last guild because while we were racing another guild to AoW, and they pulled him first, and while we were waiting to see if they would win (they had never beaten him before) one of our applicants went into the other raid and clicked his VT AE food item to try and screw up their mod rods and make them wipe....and he was not immediately booted from the guild. Don't dare to lecture me on your supposed moral superiority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok....let my try to explain this again, i'll try simpler this time.<br />
<br />
You make it sound as if we were holding them up, which we were not.  They where off xping/raiding whatever.   So given that they showed up when almost ready for 3rd attempt, to them it might as well have been the first.  If we had failed, OFCOURSE we would move aside, theres no argument there, they are waiting, they should get thier shot also.<br />
<br />
The point you are missing is that they where complete assh*les too us, and with no communication what-so-ever, they just waltz on by.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you enjoy being trampled on, I don't.<br />
<br />
This is what it all comes down to here.  I belive its the old lady getting trampled on, you believe its yourself, waiting for the old lady.  <br />
<br />
As for being a hypocrit.  Mabey i am.  But like you said above, no i dont like getting trampled on, thats the whole f*cking point of this!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
So what do i do arriana?  Grin and bear it?  No i think punishment of somesort is due.  so put that wit you have to use and tell me what im supposed to do for revenge damnit!  cause there will be some, even if i have to walk away a hypocrit.  Sure i'll be the scapegoat for my friends, atleast those peckers will feel like we did, and relize the error of thier ways.<br />
<br />
If it weren't for this other guild's cleric rezzing them (instead of calling in his guild while Cabe's was running back to acrylia to CR), they wouldn't even have gotten the second attempt. <br />
<br />

Now Crusty/Cabe/Rorgg...pay attention: THIS BEHAVIOR IS DIFFERENT. Taking active steps (which BTW, Cabe, is what you were threatening to do, so please don't open that hypocritical mouth at me again) to sabotage other people is *way* beyond ok.<br />
<br />
Enlighten me please.  I fail to see how eatting mod rods and training, is ANY different than just blatenly KS'ing someone.  Before you decide to argue the fact of KSing keep reading...   First aggro? Check.  Suffecient force? Check. Hmm looks like KSing to me.  On top of that, if there were a gm online or that even gave a rats ass, i'm willing to bed my guild would have walked away with the loot.<br />
<br />
Oh, this is kind of off topic, but i fail to see where training will get me banned.  one of 2 things would have to happen for me to get banned.<br />
1) GM's to give a ****...ROFL<br />
2)I would have to be caught, guess what theres only 1, yep count em 1, way i could get caught.  All of them seeing me do it?( guess again that doesnt mean ****, even with screenshots. )  Only way is someone having a log on and me falling to the ground with a report.  <br />
Off topic, but thats what happens when you get my little brain spinning.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Well certainly it is tempting to bash people for doing things differently, but the fact is that small guilds are basically at the mercy of larger ones.  If they want to make your life unpleasant, they can, just because they are bigger.  There is no one to stop them.  GMs do nothing. <br />
<br />
So guildwar, shouting and screaming and bashing people in public channels just creates further bad blood.  If you are the little guy you will always lose if everyone hates you and goes out of their way to make things unpleasant for you.  Might is right in Everquest and it has been that way for some time.  <br />
<br />
It seems like this situation has really gone way too far for Cabe.  It would have been a better choice for your guild leadership to speak with the leadership of the other guild and talk about how this can be prevented from happening in the future.  Sounds like a good plan would be to establish some basic rules of courtesy between guilds.  Certainly there should have been some better communication between guilds at the time this occurred.  I doubt that guildwar will prevent this from happening in the future, but if it is your goal to cement any bad feelings between members of the 2 guilds that would probably be a good way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Cabe,<br />
  While I understand why you're upset, they did in fact give you two chances and even helped you with cr each time. The cleric involved, imo, called in the rest of their guild after the second attempt. They arrived while you were still buffing, were ready to make their attempt, and at that point tried to engage the mob. When your guild engaged again, they backed off and let you make a 3rd attempt. I'm not really sure what more they could have done. Should they have communicated the fact that they were going to make an attempt, probably. Should you have communicated to them that you would like to make a third attempt, probably. In my opinion at least, they were a lot more considerate than most large guilds on our server. You would have been lucky to get a rez let alone a 2nd chance. <br />
<br />
At any rate, what you do from here is of course your decision. The only 'warning' I would give you is to watch your reputation. Blue servers certainly don't have all the options red servers do for handling griefers, but with a poor reputation you'll quickly find life in eq a lot more difficult. <br />
<br />
Best of luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I think, crusty, that you are confusing conduct in a game with real life.<br />
<br />
If you want to go for mobs above a certain level you have to understand that it -is- a multiplayer game and that you will be competing for it. If you want that mob be prepared to play the exact same games raiding guilds play when they go after spawns- racing, cockblocking like the example siludorf gave of his guild with VT, the lag out ploys of dropping 60 or more people right on top of another raid, etc..<br />
<br />
If you can't run with the big dogs ...stay on the porch.<br />
<br />
I think you are confusing PvP as against PvE.  If you want PvP play on a PvP server.  This isnt about big dogs, its about cowards who are happy to stomp on weaker people as long as there is no chance of retaliation.<br />
<br />
I'm not advocating sainthood here, just a minimum standard of conduct in which you don't stomp on people who have done you no wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">What gives them the right to ruin my fun? How many attempts at a contested spawn is fair to you, Crusty? 50?<br />
<br />
They have the right because they got there first.   Its that obvious.  <br />
<br />
but allow for the possibility that others don't feel the same way, and more significantly, that maybe you aren't right.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to repeat another thing I said:  I'm not advocating sainthood here, just a minimum standard of conduct in which you don't stomp on people who have done you no wrong.  If you have any problem with this idea that's an indication of the depths to which you have sunk.</div></div><hr />

You did not get screwed.  <br />
Now you can cry all you want, or you can just keep an eye on the EB's spawn and get him next time.  I would have thanked the other guild to be honest.

Some of the people in this thread clearly confuse a lack of manners with being tough.  Wrong, they are very different things.  There are two likely reasons why someone might make this mistake:<br />
<br />
1.  They have no appreciation of what manners are.  It is reasonable to consider such people as either immature or (if adult) as lowlife.<br />
<br />
or.<br />
<br />
2.  They are wimps who have no capacity to really be tough, and who seek to compensate for the fact by behaviour which is far less demanding.  This is quite a common trait amongst adolescent males.</div></div><hr />

Ok, i'll say it one more time.  WE had first aggro on EVERY try, we where KS'ed if you'd like to look at it that technicaly.  PLEASE READ THE REST OF THE THREAD BEFORE ADDING, how hard is this?<br />
<br />
As for helping us with the CR as i stated EARLIER if you had read any of this thread: Our cleric was bound outside with the enchanter. He was actually standing right there while the other cleric was rezzing.  The reason he was helping is because our cleric has no click stick.  Just happened he did.  We did not need his help.  And just fyi, we rezzed him on first attempt cause he got a little to close.  Looking back i guess we should have left his ass there.<br />
<br />
Might as well let this thread die.  I got the information i wanted.  60% give or take, of EQ players are peckerwoods.  How to deal with it?  That i havent quite answered for myself yet, but there is probably nothing i can do. Aside frome becoming a hypocrit as some say, and taking action myself.  What to do what to do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Guess this was the new post with wings to go for a few days. I fail to understand why this is such a mess. Still sounds like lack of communication more than a guild being mean. So your cleric was close to rez but had no rez stick. Than why click you regardless of how far the cleric was if they meant to take the mob from you? Why help make it quicker? <br />
 <br />
  If the guild cleric was there they obviously knew how many times you tried so far and i doubt they just waltzed in and jumped past you. Doesnt add up cleric rezzes you guys to call in forces but doesnt tell them you already tried twice? They have the force to muscle the mob from you yet they backed off to let you wipe the 3rd time? PLus you went from they engaged first to i think they did to i think our guy got the first hit in. <br />
<br />
   Dont get me wrong i'm not a eq ass. I dont take mobs from people i never have nor will i. I dont bring a force in a push people out of the way i hate that. But at the same time i dont think your being totally fair to them. Make them sound like jack the ripper guild and it sounds more like you guys didnt say anything and they didnt say anything and both sides wanted to move and kill the mob without saying anything to the other cuz they should respect us. BUT we get to try again and they think you tried enough. Its easy to say but we would of only tried one more time!! Did either raid leader talk to each other and get any details? I'm sorry if i am missing something so try and be civil if you feel the need to flame me cabe but it all doesnt sound clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I can understand the frustration at losing a mob that you really wanted and believed you could have killed with one more attempt.  But, as the vast majority of people here have said, that's the generally agreed standard in EQ raiding.  First to engage gets the shot.  You may or may not agree with that, but the fact remains that it is the generally accepted way things go.<br />
<br />
Again, you don't have to be as competitive, pushy, or whatever you wanna call it.  You can hope that other guilds return the favor by not being that way with you.  You can refuse to help guilds that do otherwise, refuse to group with their members, etc...  When you step over to the actively griefing them area though (training, KSing, screwing with their raids) then you lower yourself FAR below whatever level you think they are at.  In the end, You and your guild will suffer more from ruined reputation.  <br />
<br />
Start training other guilds and their raids and see how long it takes for the rest of the guilds on the server to lose all respect for you, and thus trample over your guild without a thought at every turn.  <br />
<br />
Using the bank anology, if I cut in front of you in the line at the bank because you're on the phone, filing your fingernails, and staring at the ceiling... Sure that's kinda rude.  Now if in retaliation for that you start screaming at the top of your lungs, rolling on the floor, flailing, and spitting at me...  Who's worse?</div></div><hr />

<br />
From your initial post:<br />

Anyway, I just want to say that yes it sucks to wipe to a mob 2 times than watch someone else kill it. But after knowing that they engaged and you tried to KS, then you want to train them and pretend youre some SZ hot shot, I have no sympathy for you. <br />
<br />
If something like this upsets you so much and you would resort to doing such childish things either 1) Go back to single group encounters 2) Work on your tactics so you can actually compete for these mobs instead of crying that you couldnt kill it 3) Go back to a red server where Im sure your attitude would fit in a bit better.<br />

<br />
Yes we had first aggro. <br />
This is what i went on to say after..<br />
So then if its all just technical like that, and you go back on some logs or something.....our tank would probably have the first hit in. We engaged at about the same. Who hit it first is a moot point, in the point that i'm trying to make atleast...<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: i forgot he had been plinking it for quite some time to piss it off a little. Does that fall under yout technicality?<br />
<br />
On top of that, he was fully debuffed and slowed.  I had already camped out, and he was blured. Thats when our tank began plinking with arrows, ect.  I'm not sure how much more engaged we can be..hehe<br />
We wiped because thats why they began to attack.  Personaly i was at 40 mana, because the bastard resists slow after slow fully debuffed, even oos. Cleric( the tank too ) didnt have enough mana, or else he would have said im gtg. lol <br />
<br />
I will try to have them post.  Because i do think we were wronged here, i really do.  Me getting pissed at everyone isnt helping, im sorry, but its damn frustraring, you know? heh  :mad: <br />
<br />
I do know we did had some communication, between us and thier guildleader.  They knew we were trying again.  They just didnt care? Thier members didnt like the leaders idea of waiting?  I have no idea what thier reasons were for attacking anyways.</div></div><hr />

I think you are the confused one here, if you want a highly contested spawn you have to understand the need to compete to get it.<br />
<br />
Instead of complaining and crying when faced competition for that contended spawn, you need to either roll up your sleeves and compete or not do the spawn at all. Crying here because you want a spawn but don't want to deal with the things associated with killing it just makes you look like a weenie. <br />
<br />
Either compete for it or don't, but get off the fence.</div></div><hr />

Thats a good point to consider, but I think you are wrong.  If you want to compete with other players then go do PvP.  PvE is where players are supposed to have to contend with the environment only.<br />
<br />
If that's not the case then why do we have the PnP policy, why is KSing considered wrong?  Why are some forms of competing for mobs valid, whilst others will get you banned?<br />
<br />
Btw. I don't personally cry or complain: my group simply doesn't bother doing contested stuff.  In our spare time we have no desire to have to put up with the antics of children or 'Jerry Springer' types.  There seems to be plenty of places a group can go to avoid them, largely because these people are usually poor players who are limited to two things: zerg raiding, and dreadlands style exp grinding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had already debuffed it, and the warrior had been plinking it for agro, how come you failed because you were half buffed and half mana? Either you were ready to engage or you weren't. Precident says that first agro isn't always enough to claim a kill - for example, kiting a mob while bringing in extra forces, or stand up/FDing to keep a mob agroed do not count. I don't know what the GMs would say, but plinking a rooted mob might not count either. If you weren't ready to engage, I really don't think you can claim first agro.<br />
<br />
If you *were* ready to engage, well, they backed off as soon as you engaged, presumably to let you have another chance, and you still wiped.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that the other guild were not being unreasonable. You had 2 attempts, and they backed off once they saw you engage the 3rd time. Maybe the communication could have been better between the two guilds, but it seems most people here agree that the other guild weren't being unfair.<br />
<br />
On Xev, there are a few rivalries between guilds of similar size/advancement, but on the whole bigger guilds do allow smaller ones to make a few attempts at mobs. Xev guilds for the most part seem pretty good at sorting things out among themselves - with rotations for high end zones such as VT (and NToV in the past), and gentlemen's agreements.<br />
<br />
Maybe this isn't so true of other servers, but on the whole, if one guild is respectful to another and backs down in a particular race, then the favour will be returned. Often with races, there is no clear right/wrong of it, so one guild defering to another helps. If a guild KSs, trains, or leapfrogs, they tend to get a bad reputation and other guilds stop helping them out.</div></div><hr />

But really, if we are supposed to 'compete' on PvE servers, why are some forms of competing ok and others not?  KSing is simply competing by DPS: you don't kill other players by doing it.  Or are you saying you are a KSer?<br />
<br />
Why is it ok to show up at a place some other guild has already staked out and force them to stand aside?  In real life thats bad manners: why don't some real-life manners apply in a game.  Or are you just selecting a subset of manners for your own convenience?<br />

After there was about 60 people in there, all buffing themselves, casting on us and our mob (dispelling debuffs, casting focus repeatedly on our cleric) finally our cleric lagged out enough to be late on a cheal, chloroblast wasn't a good enough cover and our tank went down.  Quickly followed by the rest of us. <br />

I think it's pretty naive to think that GMs will do anything for you.  Trust me, I've been through this many many times.  When a GM logs in 6 hours later, they say oh, sorry to hear that but since I didn't actually SEE WHAT HAPPENED, I can do nothing at all.<br />
<br />
My point here was to sympathize, share a story about the same mob and to give my advice...  my advice is that when you move into the realm of high competition mobs you need to quickly establish how you will communicate with other raids that are after the targets you are working on.   My advice is to calm down and stop expecting you will get multiple chances on a mob that is highly contended for.  Sadly, don't expect courtesy from other guilds.  Especially if you are small.  It sounds like Cabe's guild got more courtesy than most, really.<br />
<br />
You cannot ever count on GMs to be online or to even respond, let alone help if they are.  You have to look out for yourself.  A good way to start doing that is to form good or at least respectful relationships with the leadership of the guilds that compete with targets with you.  That way you can address this person with familiarity when conflict arises and come to an agreement on how to proceed before people get all worked up.<br />

To claim mobs by parking characters in this way would itself be bad manners and wouldn't give them the right to claim anything at all.<br />

Think there is a difference between acceptable and honourable. Acceptable under rules and one try and your out on contested mobs yes. Honourable? Maybe especially if  they were the ones who did the suck job of clearing out POG. Could i live with them getting another shot ? yep sure could. Ive passed up alot of plat and items when i could of &quot;jumped&quot; at a chance. I dont let loot or mobs eat me up just not worth it. <br />

<br />
The problem answering your questions is that they're too general. Each type of incident is situational and has to be answered case by case. Take your tunare example:<br />
<br />
Did the first guild have a reputation of jumping over other guilds? <br />
<br />
Did the first guild have sufficient forces to kill tunare? <br />
<br />
Did the second guild have a reputation of doing whatever they want? <br />
<br />
Was there 'bad blood' between the two guilds?<br />
<br />
Without knowing the answers to these questions (and more) it's impossible to say whether the second guild was correct, honorable, etc. <br />
<br />
Henora hit it on the head as far as I'm concerned. Reputation and communication are the keys. If the first guild (in your tunare example) had a good reputation and attempted to communicate with the second guild, perhaps they would have been given another shot at her. If they had a bad reputation, communicating with the second guild probably wouldn't have made a difference. If they had a good rep, yet still didn't try to communicate, then they are at least partially at fault for not getting a second attempt (imo).<br />
<br />
Just my opinion of course. I could be wrong...</div></div><hr />

Condescension and patronisation = just as ****ing idiotic and annoying as &quot;lecturing&quot; about &quot;supposed moral superiority&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Welcome to the short bus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">There really no point in arguing this anymore.  Actually sorry that i brought it up in my angered state that night.<br />
<br />
It comes down to matter of opinion/morals.   Everyone's are different.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
About the SZ thing, that i seem to get slandered over alot in this thread:<br />
This server is off the wall, yes.  Theres alot of 12 year old ass munch griefers, hehehe.<br />
<br />
But i guess you have to play there to see the other side.  The more mature side.  Where combat is used to settle arguments, or to have fun with other willing pvp'ers.  I never did kill anyone, that didnt attack me, or wrong me in someway.( ok ok, cept that time i grav fluxed those newbies haha ) /shrug if someone spit in my face in RL, they would walk away witha broken nose.  IMHO,( can't stress this enough ) is what happened to me.  The only difference was there was no recource or retailiation for me. Except to wipe the spit off my face and walk away swearing, which is what i did. hehe.<br />
<br />
Like i said, this is just my opinion, and its going to be different to alot of you here.  This isnt the first time it's happened, and it wont be the last either.  We all stay /rolplay now, mabey this will help.  I'm sure they watch so they can wait around for us fail something else at 2% that they can gank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">My point here was to sympathize, share a story about the same mob and to give my advice...  my advice is that when you move into the realm of high competition mobs you need to quickly establish how you will communicate with other raids that are after the targets you are working on.   My advice is to calm down and stop expecting you will get multiple chances on a mob that is highly contended for.  Sadly, don't expect courtesy from other guilds.  Especially if you are small.  It sounds like Cabe's guild got more courtesy than most, really.<br />
<br />
I couldn't agree with you more on all your statements even though I quoted only a small portion.. and this link is a prime example of what happens and how bad it is:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">That was posted already, that link, hehe :)<br />
<br />
But yes, i know how bad it is.  This is not my first char, nor my first server.  I've been in almost that exact same situation in ssra, like that thread.   The difference is the guilds that fight over high end content are approx. the same size.  We are 10 people, who get steped on because we hold no real bearing on the server.  Oh well, **** is gonna happen, i guess.<br />
<br />
Oh ya and...ogre wall, ahahaha, i've seen that too many times.  Sad last resort, but funny as ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">You tried twice and failed twice.  You obv weren't fully capable of a sure win.  You had two or three chances, blame yourselves, not the other people.  That fight is ****ing easy.  It takes maybe 8-9 people to do.  One cleric, one chanter, and the rest can be any combination of classes.  I'd look internally before you put all your problems on the heads of this other guild.  <br />
Wiping twice to the burrower . . . pathetic. <br />
<br />
Also, the worm depops for good after 30 minutes of being up.  It was probably about to depop by the time the other guild engaged it.  It was either they engage it then, or it would depop and nobody would get anything.  <br />
<br />
You would have chosen for the spawn to be blown rather than let the other capable guild down the target?  Selfishness . . . you have no high ground sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Hey Land... the encounter was changed, a lot.<br />
<br />
There is no longer the concern over despawning, there are no more fish, and the burrower isn't even a burrower (worm) anymore... it's a giant bug.  There's some other issues with slowability and resists that are different as well, but it's not really important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">yeap, disease slowable, flurries instead of rampages, 7 day respawn instead of 3, n fish gone.<br />
all the same i agree with you land, it may not be &quot;pleasant&quot;, but the way things run in the raiding game of EQ you just gotta deal with it, move on, and get it next time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">How about 1? they werent even waiting for us to try once, as far as thier concerned. The cleric waited, but we didnt really know him.....we figured he was just watching, like he had asked to. <br />
<br />
Ummm the cleric sounds alot like a spotter... not a conventional one but any guild serious about going after contested mobs has many of them (spotters &amp; well clerics I hope too :&gt;). <br />
<br />
Sure the cleric wanted to watch &amp; let their guild know the second you first wiped that there may be a chance to go after this mob. Sounds like you had another shot at the mob while this guild was pulling it together &amp; racing to the zone for the chance at dropping the contested mob IF you wiped again... well you wiped &amp; you should be glad you had two shots at this mob. <br />
<br />
I can guarantee that when you go after any seriously contested mob there is a guild somewhere hoping you wipe... not to be malicious but to get the chance themselves to drop it. Especially mobs with long spawn cycles.<br />
<br />
One of the best experiences I remember in EQ had a guild wiping on Sontalak while we waited in the wings giving them their fair chance. They wiped, we rezzed them &amp; moved in for OUR chance, the other guild then stuck around in the backgroud &amp; actually congratulated us on our kill... thats right, they congratulated us Cabe. Not only that but their GL made a post on our messgae board the next day &amp; thanked us for rezzing them, congratulating us again &amp; giving them some good ideas for the next time they engage Sont.<br />
<br />
Do you see Cabe, much like your situation where one guild had a chance at a contested mob &amp; wiped, other guild helped rezz first guild (not required btw, just a courtesy) &amp; then takes their RIGHTFUL turn @ the mob. Successful, first guild should extend grats (you know if they are the good sport type) &amp; learn from their chance @ the mob &amp; maybe learn from watching how another guild takes the mob down, move on &amp; look forward to their next chance at the mob.<br />
<br />
It's pretty simple &amp; man how can so many other ppl on here in agreement be wrong about this &amp; you few others be right in thinking you can tie up (own???) contested mobs just because you already wiped on him &amp; haven't got your strategy down yet when someone else wants a chance &amp; they don't have all night waiting for you to try &amp; try again?<br />
<br />
Oh well thats just my opinion &amp; I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />
