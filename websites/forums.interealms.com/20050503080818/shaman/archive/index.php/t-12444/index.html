Get a radeon 7000 for $35 and get alot better performance AND drivers that are actually updated by paid programmers not hacks.</div></div><hr />

Actually there are alot of people that do. I personally call them &quot;voodoo nazis&quot; and they can be found at voodoofiles.com message board bitching that modern games won't run on their 3 year old cards that werent that great when they were released...sad really.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just went trolling around the voodoofiles.com forum and its just as bad as always. People saying not to use 3dmark becase &quot;it dosnt utilize the full power of the voodoo&quot; what a crock of S**T.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you can also alt-enter to go to windowed mode, get passed the eula, get passed server select and character select and once fully in game, then alt enter back out of windowed mode (or so i've read.  I havne't had time to log in since the patch! /rude work!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a Gforce4 and I get stuck at the EULA, I just have to hold down the mouse button and move the mouse to the accept button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was having a similar problem yesterday.  <br />
<br />
Before this patch, when a new patch came out and I tried to start EQ, my firewall(zone alarm) would pop up a little window saying the program has changed.  I just had to say ok to give eqgame.exe access to the internet.  <br />
<br />
Well, the patch that came out yesterday caused EQ to just lock up, so it seemed.  What was really happening is that the little firewall confirmation box was popping up, but not coming into view above EQ like it always had before.<br />
<br />
I reset the computer again.  As soon as the first splash screen for EQ came up, I hit the alt +enter for window mode.  That way when the firewall confirmation box popped up, I would be able to see it.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Re Zonealarm: You'll also have to do ALT-R to decouple your cursor from the EQ window before entering your password, else your system is likely to screw up anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Problem with EQ not being the focus window when starting, and sometimes when quitting out.  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">SOE acknowledged that the window focus issue is a problem they are looking at. For Win XP users, &lt;shift&gt;&lt;alt&gt;R and then left click on the EULA screen gets EQ the focus and you can continue as normal (this was their recommended work around.) However, EQ loses focus again when exiting back through the screens. I have to reboot to get back to the desktop, but at least I can play.</div></div><hr />
