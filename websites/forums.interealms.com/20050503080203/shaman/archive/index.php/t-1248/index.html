<br />
I was about giggling the time I handed Yelinak a copy of Burst of Flame and a rusty dagger right before we attacked him.  I was actually laughing when I heard, &quot;***???  He dropped a rusty dagger and a level 1 spell???&quot;<br />
<br />
Or turning on roleplay and running through BB in bear form(cause if they weren't n00bs, they'd go anywhere else!).  &quot;You dwarves have ruined your own lands, you'll not ruin mine!&quot; And watching them scatter.  (Yes, I do buff them after they change their armor.  I'm not THAT mean!  :) )<br />

So, who else is a sick person?  Post em if ya got em!<br />

When all the dust settled we both had a good laugh over it and ended up becoming prety good friends.

Also, I must confess that I was present for that old Blackburrow trick.  There's a spot where you can cast on a monster at the very bottom level from the very top level.  A friend of mine did it, then we all went invis.  The resulting train was a site to behold.  :)</div></div><hr />

When I was in the process of camping Hadden for a fishbone earring, I bound myself at his spawn point.  When I wanted to go check on him, I'd remove my visible armor, equip a fishing pole, and gate there.  I got a few really funny reactions from people.:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
--Way back when, before you could change the color of text (nameley emotes), and hide corpses, I would love going invisible, and dragging one of my many corpses throughout Norrath around, and pressing my emote hotkey:  &quot;Hullk's corpse tries to hit you, but misses!&quot;  I'd then follow people around quite a bit, dragging my body and clicking the hotkey.<br />
<br />
--Another favorite would be similar to what other folks do.  I carry random items around, like 'an eyeball', or &quot;a brain&quot; and 'torn limbs' that those raptors in Dawnshroud Peaks drop, or chunks of meat, sometimes racial specific.  After fights, I'd send tells to people, saying &quot;excuse me, I believe you dropped this&quot;, and proceed to hand them a torn limb, or a chunk of racial meat, depending on their race.  Lots of fun   :O<br />
<br />
--I still love going into the Hole, and packing my non KOS rogue mule with a full load of 'torches', and handing every single monster in the damn zone a torch, so it looks like they're all carrying smoldering brands!</div></div><hr />

About the mod rod: For some added spice, give rod to, say, a gnoll. Itll be wacking noobs left and right with his uber stick and when they finally kill the monster gnoll... Hey whats this eff.. CRACKSPLAT!.. Returning to home point, pls wait. Doesnt really matter those noobs dying cause they dont loose any xp below lvl 10, nowadays.<br />
<br />
I once ran in bear form with grow, sow and lev through the Kitty newbie zone (not even delibarately, i was gathering pelts for those nifty backpacks) and newbies were scatering left and right and giving me tells like: &quot;OMG dont ever do that again&quot;<br />
<br />
I also have a Troll beastlord named Hanx. I wanted to call him Hanks but name filter didn't buy that :/. I made a &quot;/r noprob&quot; hotkey for him, been using it quite often lately ;).</div></div><hr />

Since newbies spawn WITH their equipment still on them below level 10 now, wouldn't that make for an unreversible death loop if you were to give a level 1 an Ulthork Tunic and they put it on? :o</div></div><hr />

Another mean trick is to go to Gfay and lev a noob in a group with u, take em out up to top of wiz spires, then when they float out to go down, bind them, cancel magic.  Irreversible death loops are fun!  (this is nasty and mean dont do it haha).<br />

I did use the cancelled snare trick on a druid once who i didn't like, he kept trying to save the kite, eventually he got caught and killed.  Revenge was mine! <br />

Do you mean that negative HP on items is &quot;capped&quot; at 0? I thought an Ulthork Tunic would kill you if you had less than 25 HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one time i was on my lvl 52 mage camping pyzjin (sp?). my mage is a female gnome with blonde hair. everyone though she was pyzjin, even though she had her PoH robe on and a big ass elemental beside her.. well, i decided id take it a lil further. so i made a newbie necromancer, female gnome.. identical to pyzjin. the one with the red hair and a racing stripe going through it. i had a friend TP me to WK, where i made the quite dangerous trek to Qeynos hills. i bought the lvl 1 pet spell and life tap spell before i left Ak'Anon. Being a true Pyzjin camper i set up near her spawn point behind the ruins (down the hill a lil bit). i noticed there were 2 wolfies camping her this early morning (3am PST).<br />
<br />
I then turned run off and scuffled up the hill towards the unsuspecting [)r00[)s. I walked through the ruins and started casting a pet... just then i heard one shout &quot;PYZJIN IS UP!!&quot; and he/she and their buddy proceeded to unload their mana bars on me. once pet was up and they were OOM, i proceeded to laugh at their failed attempts to thwart my frail gnome body. I then began mashing my hotkeys wich were identical to her aggro message, then turned tail and ran like hell to the zone.. none the less they laughed like hell and comented me on my hard work.<br />
<br />
the next morning.. i noticed a necromancer camping her.. so i did the very same thing.. only this time i had said friend invis me. i then canceled invis while in ruins and emidiately started casting my pet. the dude started nuking me to sh*t with ignite bones (?) and dots. just about that time... who should happen to stroll up beside me? PYZJIN!!! so being the sly one i am, sis and I charged said neco.. spamming our aggro messages until his pet killed her...<br />
<br />
upon her death he looted her and she had the infamous GBS. (looking confused) he then turned to me and /confused. I said somthing along the lines of &quot;how dare you kill my sister, the necros of Bertoxx shall rain hell fire upon your bones&quot;. the confused necro..(thinking i was a GM event) said &quot;im sorry, here take this&quot; and handed me the GBS! for you sight impared people, let me refrase that.. HE HANDED ME THE GBS!!!<br />
<br />
after that he /cried and started asking me wierd questions.. so i went with it. I proceeded to walk around, mumbling to myself about a quest (that i was having to make up on the spot mind you). after he did all the silly little things i wanted him to do.. i swallowed hard and forked over his GBS w/ a little cash for his troubles and told him he had won the heart of bertoxx for his deeds. He thanked me and then started shouting to the zone about his so-called GM quest... and such. <br />
<br />
You may think me crazy for giving him back his 7-10k artifact, but after the way he made me roll on the floor laughing, and actualy working with me on my qest.. i felt if i had any chance left of seeing those pearly gates, i had better give it back.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
and on the mod rod deal.. i do that alot. but nowadays most newbs are well informed or not &quot;true&quot; newbs at all.. just twinks. so they dont fall for it often.<br />
<br />
however, i have bound people in the air at Gfey spires before, while spire diving w/ summoned lev rings. that in itself is fun as hell, and one of the only reasons i still played my mage.<br />
<br />
so keep this thread rollin! its great. hope you enjoyed my saga :) i know i did.<br />

Of course, it was even more fun to do to a rival guild. ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">okies try this one, mage or wizzy is best, but shammy aoe dots work too, go to your local beer store and buy a few stacks of ale, burbon, wine any spirit will do, buy or get a mage friend to make some fireworks and go to the arena, /ooc free beer and fireworks display for all under lvl 4toons in arena, get them all close. good idea to make a pet and park it in the corner of arena (to sick on the few that get to running) then after handing out the beer, and shooting off some fire works, cast your aoe on yourself yea youll take some damage but its worth to see all the littleones dieing left an right /snicker</div></div><hr />

They should respawn with it equipped if it kills them. Would this effectively ruin that character for all time? Talk about evil pranks <br />
<br />
Actually, they changed that a while back. Their HP will now only go down to 1.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Hehe great posts, my favorite thing is to have a druid friend pull all the guards from around Halas and pull an Ice Giant there :-) I know cruel, unusual and just plain wrong, but hey, we have to get our kicks somewhere :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Dstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Sick and Twisted Barb. <br />
<br />
Get a Chanter(easier if he/she has Dire Charm) friend and go back home to Halas. Sit up outside the ramp(OOR of the guards) and start buffing newbie, this way they will never expect what is coming, Have the Chanter go charm a Polar Bear Cub, summon up super mutt, have Chanter Haste it. Have the the Chanter park the Cub next to you and move your mutt into the Cub, play with it a bit after awhile a graphic bug will cause your pet to disappear into the Cubs model.  Shout to the zone offering 100pp to anyone under level 10, who can solo your pet, he is sitting beside you. Sit back and watch the newb corpses mount up.<br />
<br />
I give the 100pp to any non twinked newbies who try, Whiners 50pp. Twinked whiners I charm a bear cub infront of and give them a fair shot(of Pox)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Last time I was in WC, I was helping a friend get his crap for monk sashes. I got bored.  So I cast bearform, and tagged just about every bear in the zone.  I had my friend shout that there was a named bear with a bear army behind him.  Unfortunately, the lowest level in the zone was like 42.  :(</div></div><hr />
