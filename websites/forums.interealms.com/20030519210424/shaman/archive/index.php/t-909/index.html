<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LokiJones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, what I am looking for is some decent Wisdom items for my hand and feet slots that I could quest for or that drop off of some critters.  I am a 31 Northman shaman and I usually hang with a 30 druid, 31 monk and 32 cleric (the holy rollers, :) .  Any suggestions, we all have access to all continents and the moon.  <br />
Hope ye all can help and thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you don't already have Totemic Boots and Gauntlets, I would get those. I think they're probably about the best you can loot or quest for at Level 31.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rissell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Split paw hide gloves have 2wis.  Could find those fairly easily.  I'm lvl 40, using Totemic Boots, 12ac 5str.  One of my few items without wis on it.  But they say AC &gt; Wis in the end, so try for some with good AC, and some saves couldn't hurt either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could try questing the twilight armour from the moon. But it's a bit of a pot luck quest - there are loads of different items that drop and you need a specific few to make the armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">go to Karnor castle and politely ask for Jarcrap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good wisdom gear for the hands and feet can be tricky.  The Twilight Sea armor quests have decent gear, but by the time you get all the pieces your usually planar already or in Thurg armor.<br />
<br />
Many shaman go the druid/cleric route on the feet and get Eboots (Ac5 Wis9/Int9) and hands can either be splitpaw (low ac) or just skip wisdom adn get totemic or splurge and get CC gaunts from Velks if you have a bankroll.<br />
<br />
If you know exactly what pieces of quest drops you need for a certain piece of shaman TS armor  you might be able to pick them up fairly cheap as no one really does those in any force (your milage may vary).<br />
<br />
If you know a very good tailor you can try getting some artic wyvren armor pieces (very difficult even with 200 skill) or studded acrylia.<br />
<br />
Equiping the hands can be difficult for any shaman and you may just want to go heavy ac on the hands until you find something that suits you.<br />

<br />
Something you might think about is your own cultural armour.<br />
If you have cash, you can buy much better, but for the price, each piece has some wis and fair ac for the money.  Expect to pay 200-300pp for each piece.  For a little more, you can skip the wis gear and buy the JB pieces for nice ac (even if you can't use the click effects until 45).  If you wanted to, you could skill up to the banded level and MAKE your own Northern Imbued Ringmail.<br />
<br />
I use splitpaw gloves for the wis when working tradeskills, but I wouldn't be caught dead in them fighting.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
