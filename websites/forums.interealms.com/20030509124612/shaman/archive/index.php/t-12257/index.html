Charisma is a must for buying and selling.  And it helps with mez and charm.  But...  does it do anything else?<br />
<br />
I used to think it helped all casters reduce resists.  And one rumor had it that it helped root as well. So...  question is, what else does charisma do? <br />
<br />
An old shammy told me to always buff casters with charisma, including myself.  I do that, but am thinking it's superstition.<br />

Some might disagree with me on this but imho charisma is good for one thing one thing only that is buying / selling , there is even the rumor that less charisma helps fear testing this with my necro i find it absoultly false. <br />
<br />
and take into account that some say it helps mez / charm again if you ask any high lvl chanter they will say it does not make a noticable difference. <br />
 Just my exp on it after 3 years of play</div></div><hr />
