<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all i am about to create a new shaman, and i am curios as to some opinions on what race is best to pick ?  i will probally be doing alot of soloing/grouping i play abut 2 to 3 hrs a day 7 days a week,<br />
<br />
I am at work atm lol but reason i ask is i was leaning towards a ogre or kitty due to the str / large race but i am willing to go all avenues plus if you can tell me what is best points to put in that would be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they are all essentialy the same once you ge to 20's , so pick whatever you want , pick what is going to be FUN for you to roleplay.<br />
<br />
I would say there is only 2 true things that would make me wanna pick 1 race or another. Slam and no Frontal stun. Thats the ogre. But all large races have slam , so we are talkign about just the immune to stun. Its nice ,i but nothing to base a character around IMHO .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Btw i am sorry i just read a post below that answered my questions  :p  ,<br />
<br />
So i decided on a ogre but what should i put my starting points into ? i am realy surprized that by what i have read you say to get hp items over having 200 + wisdom ??? that the route i should go btw played since nov 2000  but i currently play necro 54th druid retired 52nd warrior 51 monk 36 wiz 9th sk 24th cleric 29th so not new to the game but i am to this class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh and if you can tell i am bored at work lol  ;)  But any how i figured while i am sitting here i would mention the gear i have set to the side for him  <br />
chest froglok scale chestplate <br />
ear forgot name but +3 wis <br />
wrists polished bone bracelets <br />
charred guardian shield <br />
shissar battle hammer <br />
  what is some other ideas pls tlking 10kish in funds or less</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jaundiced bone armor is usually pretty cheap across all servers.  The Legs and chest being the only really expensive pieces (at least on Rodcet Nife).  You can pick up arms, helm, and boots for less than 500 plat apiece usually, and they have solid AC, even though the lack on stats.  The clicky effects dont kick in till about 45 though.<br />
<br />
Ry'Gorr armour is another good choice for young shaman.  Good AC, nice stats, and usually dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
Does anyone even do the Totemic quests anymore?  They were great quests when I was a growing shaman, and I really enjoyed meself when doign them.  Lower AC than the other armors I mentioned, but a great way to learn what your shaman can do.  I still have my full totemic set (minues helm) in the bank.  I wear it to weddings and such)<br />
<br />
See if you can find an arctic wyvren mask.  should be pretty cheap and has nice wis bonus to it.  Crystal spider eyes is also a good choice, but usually 5x more expensive than the wyvren.<br />
<br />
Studded acrylia cape for your back.  10 wis on it.  Cant really beat that.  usually between 500 and 1K, depending on how many tailors on your server.<br />
<br />
As far as starting points go,  toss a couple into wis, but the majority into STA.  STA=hp.  and hp=mana after level 24 and canni.  Wis items are really easy to get and incredibly cheap, as are str, dex, and agi items.  STA is usually harder to come by, although there are a lot more choices  than when I started my shaman.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your shaman!  Great class with lots of abilities.  Dig through the boards using &lt;search&gt;.  Lots of great info here..some of it hidden behind years of chatter....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think race for a shaman is the most trivial choice you will make as a shaman. basically if you want regen and are willing to put up with exp penalties, then troll. Otherwise anything works heh.</div></div><hr />
