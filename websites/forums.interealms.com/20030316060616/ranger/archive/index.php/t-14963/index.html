<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay I got flagged for POV a while ago, but it was after they had done some of the nerfs against quad-kiters, soloers, etc.  Last night I decided to try soloing in there while LFG.<br />
<br />
I was told by a few people I asked that &quot;some&quot; of the mobs were flagged un-rootable/un-snarable, and some were not (random for mobs even of a specific type, like the mushrooms in FG).  So I tried.  I tried:<br />
<br />
- Planarian Larvae<br />
- tree frogs<br />
- undead vassal<br />
- another type of frog<br />
(all non-aggro, non-see-invis except the undead vassal)<br />
<br />
Tried multiples of each target.  I went 0 for 10.  Every single mob I tried to snare was unsnarable, which meant I had to run for the zone each time I tried and failed (I was careful not to train the zone-in when I was doing this, though many of these mobs are non-aggro anyway).<br />
<br />
At that point I got fed up (had also been LFG the whole time with no offers) and camped and went to a movie.<br />
<br />
Note that this was on Wednesday, which was a patch day.  It was at least 12 hours after the servers came up, though.  If some mobs are snarable and some are not, then if there were a lot of people soloing only the snarable ones, eventually all the ones left would be unsnarable.  But considering the servers hadn't been up that long, I'm not sure that's what was really going on this time.<br />
<br />
So, was I just really unlucky?  Is it worth pursuing this at all, or are they all going to be unsnarable?  Are there any mobs in the zone that are always snarable?  Being forced to zone out 10 times for every mob I successfully engage just isn't worth it.  ;-(<br />
<br />
My intent is to solo using root and shoot, so the requirements are non-casters, snareable/rootable, and non-summoning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Were they unsnarable, or just resistent?  I haven't ever fought the larvae or the tree frogs, though I do know that the majority of the vassals are all unsnarable.<br />
<br />
Many rangers have claimed to be able to solo in PoV/PoS once you have endless quiver and AM 2 or 3.  Probably AM 1 as well, will just take a while.<br />
<br />
The razorgills in the caves are all snareable though, and there is a pretty decent kiting area just outside the caves.  The Crystalline Golems are all snareable, though they do occasionally resist.  The WL is a TERRIBLE place to kite though, so you'll have to drag each one down to the lower area.<br />
<br />
In PoS, I'm pretty sure the majority are snareable.  The Hurricane frogss, the bear-looking things *forgot name* and the tree's should all be snareable unless I'm mistaken.<br />
<br />
Just realize that everything in those zones is pretty resistent, so 2 or 3 resists is not at all unusual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiyrwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The razorfiends in the cave seem to be snareable, golems also and so are crawlers in the dessert area. Frogs, skels and larvae are mostly unsnareable but the larvae closest to the zonein at the rock close at wall is, also a gamite frog on the rock at the water if you follow the wall from ZI to the right past the house thing with the guards in there is snareable, the frog next to it does not seem to be however. Most spiders are also unsnareable which sucks because you are likely to get them as add in the dessert area, at least i have not been able to find a safe spot not crowded with people and enough room to kite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BelzarQuickfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Razorfiends and golems are all snarable everytime except a rare razorfiend lvl 64 mob (subjector i think was his name or suppressor or both of those).  everything else is not always snarable.  I solo there quite often.. or used to before hoh anyways it's quite doable and yields nice xp:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wasteland area:<br />
<br />
All golems can be snared.<br />
Most crawlers can be snared.<br />
Only a couple spiders can be snared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Best shot is to bow kite in teh wastelands along the back wall. Several solo golems are back there.  Take them up on the wall and kite away.  I see a lot of necros and druids that do that.  It will be boring as hell though to bow kite them.  Its just faster to group and kill any mob than it is to bow kite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HoH zone in is alot nicer to kite, or frogs near forest giants.<br />
In the end grouping is more effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ralence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you can find the caves uncamped, aggro kiting isn't a terrible option.<br />
<br />
  There's been a few days when I've just grabbed 3 rangers and a couple rogues, and kited the fiends around the open area in front of the caves.<br />
<br />
  Get 2 am3/eq rangers, and another to kite, and it's a lot better than no exp at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Watch out for the crawlers.  I would say that  70% of them are snareable, but you still come across those unsareable ones from time to time.<br />
<br />
And the lucid arachnae or the Luminii crawlers are always unsnareable, so stay away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tilara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its possible, just boring.<br />
<br />
I'll often sit and solo golems while LFG.  I keep them snared and rooted all the time, as well as casting Drifting Death on them while mana allows.<br />
Other than that, its just chain firing arrows between re-rooting.<br />
<br />
Its not a lot of fun, and the exp is about 50% less than I'd get in a good group for the same period of time, but its more exp than sitting around at the zone waiting for someone to invite me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the responses.<br />
<br />
I tried again and had better luck -- went 3 for 3 on rootable planarian larvae right near the zone-in.  Further discussion with one of my friends who solos there a lot (he's a necro so he just FD's if they aren't snarable) indicated that he thinks certain spawn points always yield snarable vs. non-snarable mobs.  <br />
<br />
XP was quite good (probably around 5% AXP per kill  at 63 -- I have XP set to 50/50 so it's hard to say exactly).  But it took a LONG time to kill something (was using AM3/EQ and Drifting Death) and even with KEI my mana got quite low doing it.  I think it took me about 15 minutes per kill, counting some medding in between (was using one GOTF disc per kill, but didn't otherwise time it). <br />
<br />
So, it's something to do while LFG, but I can't recommend it as a full-time occupation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aegerenth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">.. its all about size in Plane of Valor when you talk about snareable vs. unsnareable larvae. <br />
<br />
Prior to the stealth patch, all the larvae where snareable. After the 4am patch, only the small larvae are snareable. <br />
<br />
It's pretty hard to tell what is small and what is large at first, but there is definately a size difference between the two types. <br />
<br />
As far as spiders and crawlers are concerned, I find more of them than less that are snareable, so I just stay away unless I am pulling for a group. <br />
<br />
As far as EXP is concerned.<br />
Golems are the best.<br />
Fiends in the cave are next best, but <br />
Larvae after that, because I can usually find the ones that are snareable. <br />
Frogs are the same exp as the larvae. <br />
<br />
I stay away from Vassels, Spiders and Crawlers, just because if I am soloing, its not worth my time breaking the skel houses with harmony (mana as well if i don't have KEI) so it's just easier to find something solo and pull and plink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Llyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I soloed a crystalline golem yesterday, to see if I could do it. I did, but I don't really find it a viable means of gaining xp. I have a Bow of Doom, Blessed Champion Arrows, EQ and AM 3. It took me nearly 20 minutes from the time I got it pulled to a safe place and started shooting till it died. I had KEI on at the time, and STILL spent half my mana pool keeping it rooted. I didn't bother nuking/dotting it at all. For all that effort, I got about half a blue of real xp at level 61. It's faster to get a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dimstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well not a well knowen trick is arrows can shoot threw water, so you pull a snarable mob(I usually harmony pull a yellow or red sentry that doesnt summon)then you bring them to the lake/moat, make sure you have lev/sow on and arrow kite, havent done it in about 2 week so they might of nerfed the sentries.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />
<br />
P.S. it can work the same for in PoS ocean</div></div><hr />
