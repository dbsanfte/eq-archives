<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This issue for me, for the most part, but not exclusively, is that there are so many general class weapons and so few ranger only.  In my guild, at least, this means these items go to rogues, warriors, monks, sk, and pals before they go to rangers.  Afterall, rangers have archery and endless quiver.<br />
<br />
Frankly adjusting items alrady in the game provide those already with them a benefit while those still without don't have much incentivve.  If I knew items were dropping that were nice and comparable to the other class weapons that were ranger only that were off comparable mobs then I'd feel better.<br />
<br />
If that has been changed then a big horray but it is unlkely.  I don't really want to be put in a position of competing with the other classes still.  I don't favor fighting for months and months to get a +3ac increase item or some resist item while these other classes repeatedly got upgrades and have tons of items available to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, i think rangers wanted more ranger only items, items we don't have to compete to get.  I watched my guild equipp our warriors with primal 1h and our rogues with primal 1h while we rangers watied and really only got a bow and/or a 2h.  Then I saw these same warriors and rogues get great gear in luclin and then I saw them get nice stuff in ntov.  I saw the guild award the members in that fashion.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is that at the beginning when we were developing as a guild this was important.  But as time progressed the warriros didn't need as many upgrades any more.  The other classes did.  Even so, the guild seemed to repeatedly award the warriors and rogues above and beyond the other classes even when it came to AC items.<br />
<br />
So, for me unless they increased the ranger only items these sort of changes are not of much value.</div></div><hr />

Ive been in luclin since its launch, and I dont have a single piece of luclin loot that I dont use situationally.  All the good shiznit didnt have ranger on it, or was only comparable to ToV loots.  Couple exceptions, but generally true.<br />
<br />
Adding ranger to piercing weapons aint gonna fly, unless they want to give us 250 pierce.  Heres to hoping for some new good slashers to drop, and maybe some bracers, shoulders etc, ranger only or not.</div></div><hr />

The Braided Strands of mana screamed Ranger weapon to me. I couldn't understand why it wasn't usable by us before. 12 dmg 16 delay 15 AC plus stats. OK it doesn't have 100 HP but that is one DAMN good weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your guild will not even consider rangers for 1HS items until every non-ranger in your guild that can equip it has the tiem, that is an issue with how your guild deals with loot and not with Verant.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't make them bad guilds, it doesn't mean they're not powerful or competitive, and I'm getting pretty sick of people making fun of them. Just because the uberguilds don't do it that way doesn't make it wrong.</div></div><hr />

It is called &quot;Acrylia Handled Broadsword&quot;.  Though I admit, it isn't a peach to get.  Certainly harder than the Cursed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it isnt ranger only, though I guess most people would give it to a ranger. And compared to what rogues and monks get from much easier mobs it's a bit frustrating to know that the only real upgrade for the BoF drops from the Emp...a mob only the most dedicated people will ever see.<br />
All melees get an upgrade or a weapon close to the &quot;Vulak Standard&quot;. The problem is ours are not reallz upgrade, cause our vulak weapon already kind of sucked.</div></div><hr />
