<br />
I'm a level 53 Shamaness and have done no reading at all into the Alternate Advancement theories. Can somebody direct me to a site that explains how all this AA stuff works. I dont plan to start working on AA until I reach level 55 (dont ask me why, just because my friend told me so and since he passed away I cant ask him why either  :(  ). <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Caster's Realm AAXP Info (http://eq.crgaming.com/archetype/) <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
EQShaman Skills (http://www.eqshaman.com/) <br />

As for an initial strategy, just about everyone seems to agree that the first 3AA points should go to RUN3.  This will increase your base run speed to just about jboots speed, allowing you to outrun most of the nasties you'll encounter.<br />
<br />
It's really important for indoor environments where SoW won't work.  Outdoors it's not as important if you have the insta-cast SoW boots that are part of our epic.<br />
<br />
When you get RUN3 depends on how much you plan on fighting indoors.  Personally, I've had all my chars stop XP'ing at 51 to get RUN3.  RUN3 has saved my collective lives more times than I can imagine.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're looking for how EXP is spread on a mob from his regular to his AA side and which zones are good for regular and bad for AA or visa versa, I haven't seen that written down.  The only one that sticks out in my mind ATM is FG, which is poor for regular and good for AA EXP.  <br />
<br />
As far as when and what, you can put your regular exp to 80% without hurting yourself too bad (think to yourself that you just started being a Troll for awhile) and you'll get run3 faster than you'd think.  I also am bullish on regen3 before you get Torpor, so I'd do that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you’ll find this is a very popular subject on this board.  Well, it’s a popular question on most class boards actually. *smiles*  Here’s a recent link I think you’ll find very useful.  Read through the post and follow the links provided there.  It contains some very good basic information.  <br />

For myself, I stopped at level 52 and set my AA experience to 100% until I got run three.  It’s slower to gain the AA points that way, but I wanted that skill as soon as possible so it was worth it to me.  After getting run three I went back to 100% regular experience.  I plan to keep it that way until I hit level 60.  Then I’ll go back to 100% AA experience and start amassing as many AA points as I can stand.  I know I’ll be tempted to go to level 61, since we get a new pet that level, but I’ve read that a lot of old world hunting grounds go light blue at 61, so I’ll try to stay level 60 for a while so I’ll have as many hunting options open to me as possible.  But I guess I’ll just have to wait and see how things work out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Corundum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks all of you, that does help greatly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I put my first 3 AA's into Run 3, but I wish I could change that now.  A guildie shaman mentioned to me that A) he hardly ever runs anyway, and B) Run 1 is fast enough to outrun most mobs.  I might choose to put one point into Runspeed and 2 into something else, like STA or WIS, if I was making that decision again today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Run3 is worth it, even if the only reason is because everyone gets it, and it's annoying (and sometimes dangerous) to fall behind them because you don't run fast enough. It becomes more and more important as you spend more time in dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Run3 &gt; all other General AAs.<br />
<br />
3 points into innate WIS = about 18 mana.<br />
3 points into innate STA = about 18 HP.<br />
<br />
Either of these has such a minimal difference that it's a joke.  I swear by Run3.  Indoor zones are made enough of a PITA by my inability to use Horsey, i'd hade to be slow as bejeesus as well.<br />
<br />
For those of you who 'never hunt in indoor zones', wait til you get to PoTac.  It rules, and it's indoors. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kinadafz60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you want AA's instead of levels...stop xping at 51 and solo the hole.  I powerleveled my monk for about an aa there....it took about 2 hours.  I am confident a shaman can solo the whole upstairs also, minus the rock golem which would make it slower.<br />
<br />
After I got run 3 with monk, i just xp like regular with my shaman / monk combo...when shaman reaches 60, he will get some normal, then AA till monk catches up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The advice I was given by my shammy guildmates was this (Incidentally I feel Levels &gt;&gt; AA so I went to 65th 1st but thats purely personal preference)<br />
<br />
Run 3 (it's a must simply for getting round in no sow zones)<br />
Regen 3 (apart from Run 3 the other general AA's are bog useless)<br />
Mental Clarity 1, 2, 3 (12 AA's to get and it hurts but its a pre requisite for.... )<br />
Canni 5 (definately a ground breaker in AA terms and has a noticable performance effect on me in groups, Raids (when not on my Rogue main) and soloing)<br />
<br />
After that SCR needs to be maxed and then SCRM, the Spell Casting Reinforcement AA line directly effects how long your buffs last and in that how long you Stoicism/Torpor/Quiescence lasts so you get more heals for the same mana, believe me its a winner.<br />
After that simply go for whatever takes your fancy, Mass Group Buff is great for a raid Shaman, Spirit Call is a lot of fun and handy DPS, Healing AA's I personally like a lot too .</div></div><hr />
