<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this is not a rant against anything really, I am just frustrated with myself, and am wondering if I am kicking myself too much!  I am 1 yellow away from 51 (good new spells, woo hoo).  The problem is that I have been 1 yellow away from 51 for about 2 days!! (figure 4-5 hrs. of playing time).  My guildies and I have been trying to get all our members Seb keys, so there have been about 12 of us all grouped (raid style) in TT, for about 2 days.  As you can imagine, exp has been nill.  Ah-well, 51 will come eventually, and as I said, I am just ranting about my own inefficient playing style.  Thanks for lending an ear (or eye?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm confused, what are you raiding? One ranger can track down and kill both seb key item holding frogs in a matter of minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dude...I've been &quot;half way through 55&quot; for over a year and a half. I've had more fun leveling up alts than doing the post 50 experience grind.<br />
<br />
You're being too hard on yourself. In a hurry to get somewhere or something? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If lots of people need seb keys, it's fun to do it in a big bunch, nothing wrong there.<br />
<br />
Don't be hard on yourself for no experience, you've helped other people get their keys (maybe even got your own too), and now your guildies can join you in Sebilis. Guild groups are more fun than pickup groups, it'll work out for the best in the long run. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guy's, I feel better after the positive comments!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And if you want some quick xp before you get more keys, just head to KC :)</div></div><hr />

Isn't that the whole purpose of the game?<br />
<br />
When I hit my first three hell levels (you remember them, don't you?) I immediately went walkabout.  I figured the exp bar was going to be frrozen, so I would juzt go exploring, and one day I would look up and see that I had made it halfway through, so I would be inspired to push on to the next level.  I  had a lot of fun doing it.  and, yes, that time was just as wasted as the time I spent at, oh, say Treants, zooming through levels and making a little cash.<br />
<br />
What is so bad about time spent helping your guild make progress, anyway?  That is usually a LOT more fun than grinding at an exp camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Valgoth, I have done the same thing.  I hit 57 and got about 23% of the way through when I had to step back and get away from my Shaman for a while.  Now I blast things with a Wizard.  :)</div></div><hr />
