<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Motius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its a lvl 64 spell and is a 170dd dmg proc effect vs. summoned creatures only (as I understand it)... Has anyone found a location yet where this is actually usefull?  Not much summoned in tier 1/2 planes at all, but maybe in elemental planes?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are elementals in Bastion of Thunder, and NR and Exile Summoned are both effective on them.  Tier 4 is where NR comes in very handy though, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was disappointed when I got it. Somehow I missed the part where it said it was only used on summoned beings =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah i was also disapointed.. what a waste of my first spectral to get this crappy spell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arthemis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To be honest, I found the spell Exile Summoned to be of more use than the weapon proc against elementals. It does over 700 DD damage and does not have the long reuse time like brushfire or frozen wind. <br />
<br />
The Plane of Water for instance does not have too many elementals in there. It's more fish and sea stuff like in Kedge Keep. <br />
Sol Ro has even more possibilities to use the damage against elemental spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Andric d'Regor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've used it in BoT a bit and as a long duration junk buff for dispellers.<br />
<br />
Use exile summoned a lot. fast casting, crits up to 966 without focus items. as nothing runs as such in Bot mem it in my snare hotkey spot.</div></div><hr />
