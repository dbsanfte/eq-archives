<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As time goes on, and more guilds get squished into the top tiers of PoP, I am dissapointed to find that the game is less about PvE and more about what timezone you raid in and inter-guild competition.<br />
<br />
Sure, everyone worked hard to get where they are, but the sad truth is that spawns are not nearly random enough to ensure that different guilds get a shot at them.  Patches are like clockwork anymore, so the bevy of spawns fall to those guilds with raid times that line up nicely with server resets.  Compound that with intentional blowing of ring events and you find that you can be sitting on your hands for many an evening with little to do.<br />
<br />
It is pretty obvious that Sony never planned or tested for having multiple guilds in the Elemental planes or Time and is oblivious to the fact that spawns can essentially be monopolized by the few.  Currently, SOE can't even make VT available to a PST guild because the whole zone spawns on a server reset and a single capable EST or euro guild has the first shot.<br />
<br />
I'm sure things are &quot;working as intended&quot;, but the game would be MUCH more stimulating if spawn times were on a 1-48+ hour randomizer for minis and rings.  Having all ring events instantly reset on a fail would be a glorious improvement as well.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts on the state of things and yes, I realize not everyone is running amok in the mentals or Time. :)</div></div><hr />

Boo frickin hoo, EST/Euro get the server resets, PST dont....<br />
<br />
I keep forgeting the centre of the universe is on the Western sea-board of the US, oh hang on....its not.<br />
<br />
Try being an Oceaniac guild, we get the rubble left over from EST?PST prime time OR ****ed by every patch AND must stayup till 3-4am to contend with server resets.<br />
<br />
Yes, there is a reason there are few Oceanic Elemental/Time capable guilds .... because while you sleep the servers are down in our prime time. <br />

This whine is soooo old, join a Euro guild and be done with it.<br />

This is not a post about how everything needs to spawn on one time zone or another, but rather how there needs to be a general fix to allow everyone a shot at a piece of the pie.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, mobs up to hit = fun and while this is the driving force behind LDoN, it could use some extrapolation to PoP.</div></div><hr />

Barbacus, I know that this is probably going to come as a shock to you, so you should probably sit down before you scroll down:<br />

Some people have jobs.<br />
<br />
OK, here comes another.  Maybe you should take your valium before reading further, since it will be a shock to you I am sure:<br />
<br />
<br />
The plurality of EQ players on SoE servers play during United States prime time.  <br />
<br />
<br />
That will be all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When there were 2 guilds who wanted to do vt on my server, we worked an agreement with the other guild and got vt every other week..

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It all boils down to one thing.<br />
Those who live in an EST zone and don't have either lives or involved jobs/school and choose to devote such non-lives solely to the pursuit of EQ goals, win EQ.  The others do not.  <br />
<br />
This is the way it has always been.  What exactly is new?  <br />
<br />
You people who worship people in big guilds for their awesome loot are just sheep.  That could be you, under vastly different circumstances.  Or if you chose to get very pale and sickly looking in body, so that your EQ character could become potent and robust.  <br />
<br />
This game has had SO much potential over the years.  It has more potential now than ever.  Stupid **** like the gripes expressed by above poster should have been fixed or given a work-around LONG ago.  Instead, they've been ignored.  <br />
<br />
The real solution is to just cancel your account and stop playing.  Go join the gym.  Get a tan.  Go dancing.  Get a girlfriend.  Get a LIFE!  Get a hobby.  Get a better job.  Get a CLUE!<br />
<br />
EQ is like crack for the computer literate masses.  It's a drug that takes up your time (tho saves you money actually, if you work as well as play) and gives you nothing in return except entertainment.  That's ok, nothing wrong with that.  Until you abuse it . . . which EQ is set up to be easily abused, in fact the reward system is ALL ABOUT abuse!  The more time you spend online at one time, the more odd the time, the more encompassing all your times available to play can be . . . the further your experience will take you.<br />
If you can type and drool and show up to raids a lot, things are even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Uh.  How exactly do you &quot;blow&quot; VT spawn?  *boggle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I always figured that getting a few spawns was compensation for not being able to play the 6-7 hours before that. I pay the same monthly fee as everyone else but for about one day a month (or more) I don't get to play at all.<br />
<br />
Wish people would stop blaming the Asian guilds. It's the Euros. Almost nothing spawns when the server first comes up. Generally the server pops, we all rush to log in, then wait nother 4 hours (so it's now 2-3am) before something worth killing spawns. Unless the patch is going to finish really early it's not worth my time to even log in. Heck, the patch previous to the one we just had there was nothing up for 7 hours! We had to kill AD simply because there was nothing else. Trust me when I tell you that spawn times are being shifted closer to US times which drops them right in the middle of a Euro guild's raiding hours. I don't think it's an accident either because the patch that just went (1 hour &lt;3) finished at 7pm my time. at 10:30 Cursed cycle popped. At 11:30 Rhags spawned. 12 - XtC. 1am - Seru. If the patch had finished at it's normal time (starts at 6pm and finished 12-1) then everything would be spawning at 3am which runs around lunchtime EST.<br />
<br />
Bitch at the Euro guilds all you want, but the only thing the Oceanic/Asian guilds are getting is Emp.</div></div><hr />

- So 1% of EQ population is in Time, 60% doesn't give a damn about raiding and 39% are getting screwed by very poor game design. Of course SOE has been ignoring this 39% of the EQ population. But yeah, they are &quot;whining&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hey dumbass, how would you like to go home, turn on TV and realize you can't watch half the channels because your neighbours got home earlier than you and they are watching them? Welcome to the world of Everquest for many people.<br />
<br />
Competition for entertainment content in a PvE game is beyond reatarded, and morons like you and SOE can't realize it. Well at least SOE did 4 years later, too little too late.<br />
<br />
Now back to your regular &quot;whining&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Always funny to see someone making up some &quot;statistic&quot; numbers.<br />
Let me join that fun.<br />
39% breaks down in 13% in Asia, 13% in Europe and 13% in the US.<br />
So as the euro's and the Asian guys have that famous &quot;time zone advantage&quot; they wont care so we have a whooping 13% left that are screwed.<br />
87% happy out of 100% is a good number I would say.<br />

Ah yes that famous argument.<br />
And this is such an idiot statement.<br />
<br />
EQ works much more like going to a sport event or to a concert.<br />
There are a limited number of spots available and they are handed out on a first come first served base.<br />
<br />
But I guess I don't care much as on my server things are ok.<br />
2 guilds in time<br />
2 guilds in the Elemental planes<br />
2 guilds in VT/Ssra<br />
And besides some rather annoying mistakes SoE made it is a situation all can be happy with (I guess the only thing that is bad is that time can only hold 1 raid at a time, what in turn pushes the US based guild back in hours compared to the Euro based guild)<br />
<br />
And Zorlac, Time is the current end game, wanna whine about VT?, wanna whine about ToV, wanna whine about VP? then don't name a topic &quot;so this is the end game?&quot;</div></div><hr />

- Maybe on your server. On my server there was one single non american timebased guild. All of them are mostly EST timezone based and only one is more PST based.<br />
One guild in time: 75 member raids, total:75:<br />
4 guilds in Elementals: 70 member raids each, total: 280.<br />
4-5 other guilds wanting actively Ssra, lesser PoP and lesser Luclin encounters: 40 members each per night, total 200ish.<br />
<br />
Out of these you have  480ish people competing for content. Server peak population is what? 2.5k? Take off 500 bazaar bots then. That 480ish is nearly 25% of the ENTIRE server population. And those are only bigger guilds, I am not counting in NToV, KD, Veksar or other smaller guilds. Yes I play with numbers, but they prove a point of a broken game design. And this coming from a server that is lately pretty quiet to play on. How would you like having 8+ elemental guilds and 3+ time guilds? Newsflash, some servers are already at that stage! Or how about 5+ guilds all wanting VT? Newsflash, already happening. Just because your (insert new server) doesn't have these issues doesn't mean the old servers are all happy and quiet.<br />
<br />
You have a very narrow vision of EQ's competition for content problems.<br />
<br />
Ah yes that famous argument.<br />
And this is such an idiot statement.<br />
- Coming from you, It sounds like a compliment.<br />
<br />
EQ works much more like going to a sport event or to a concert.<br />
There are a limited number of spots available and they are handed out on a first come first served base.<br />
- Bull$hit. EQ is not limited by numbers. There are currently no servers locked because they are too crowded. For concerts you have certain number of people can attend. Cable TV, everyone can watch, EQ in theory everyone should enjoy it, unfortunately in many cases in raid guilds, it's not the case, because of the retarded competition for content SOE doctrine.<br />
<br />
But I guess I don't care much as on my server things are ok.<br />
- That explains everything. I have no problems so I DENY problems that exist elsewhere OR I simply IGNORE them. Awesome narrow-minded view! Hey, there is no crime in my neighbourhood so every place on earth is jolly and fun filled happy land! Isn't?<br />
<br />
And Zorlac, Time is the current end game, wanna whine about VT?, wanna whine about ToV, wanna whine about VP? then don't name a topic &quot;so this is the end game?&quot;<br />
- Newsflash, endgame to some is killing Gorenaire. To some it's Tormax, to some it's VT to some it's Timel Just because Time is half-assedly instanced for 1% of the population, doesn't mean the other  30% of the raiding population has a fun experience, actually it's far from fun in many cases.<br />
<br />
Look beyond your retarded &quot;Time is endgame rest doesn't matter&quot; view and realize that 30% of EQ's income is from people who are racing regulary for entertainment content in a PvE game. You should thank the 30%+ EQ population for paying SOE people's salaries so you can enjoy plane of Time, ALONE with your guild, WITHOUT another guild breathing down your neck, WITHOUT griefing (well mostly).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Styg, your server is a frikkin cakewalk by comparison to mine and probably many others as well.  With no other guilds to get in your way and eat up limited content, ANY capable guild can get into Time.  The problem that we are looking at here is that not everyone has equal opportunity to attempt game content simply because of the time they log on.<br />
<br />
Please explain to me how Time is going to work out when it &quot;can only hold 1 raid at a time&quot; and you have 5 or so guilds in the same timezone all vying for it?<br />

<br />
And how did you produce all these numbers? <br />
My bet would be you made them up, maybe you made an educated guess but still it is thin air.<br />
<br />
And In reality any time capable guild will have about 90-110 players on the roster and will have a lot of second accounts people pay for. My estemation would be a time level guild would have about 250 active accounts<br />
<br />
So I will now leave you to this so you can produce all the made up figures you want to tell us why your guild is not able to kill mob X (blame the competiton) when it wants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well MS is in this way a unique server that we all payed $75 to escape the overcrowded servers we used to be on (BTW you all also had that option) but besides that all the higher level guilds understood 1 thing:<br />
Guilds should have room to breath and do stuff so we try to stay out of each others way as much as possible.<br />
We have had god rotations for the 4 elemental gods, we have flag sharing deals and in general we have a good atmospheer between guilds.<br />
<br />
As you all can see I am in a euro based guild and as such we have a certain advantage over the US based guild that is also time enabled (crimson tempest for those wondering). <br />
And yes we do realise that if we spawn a new 4 hour wave in time close to the end of our raid hours they will not be able to enter so guess what............. we wait for another day.<br />
And yes it must be frustrating to be in a US guild and have to wait till you can enter the place you want to raid in.<br />
<br />
But in my opinion SoE tried hard to make PoP fair. The god timer is a good and fair thing to share gods amoung all time zones, the respawn timer on mobs is not a number of days but in many cases some hours are added.<br />
<br />
The only thing they could not solve is competition in your own time slot. East coast and West coast guild difference is a huge advantage in EQ, much more nowadays then Euro-US advantage and it will not be until LDoN that this is solved.</div></div><hr />

- And you think that ONLY time enabled guilds have 2nd accounts? Not trying to burst any bubble of yours, but that's not the case with second accounts. Thanks for providing more proof of your narrow minded view of EQ. And again, let's not throw bazaar bots into the mix shall we?<br />
<br />
My numbers were on people being ... you know ... ONLINE. Not some 2nd or 3d account that is selling phatlewtz in bazaar or is played during non raiding hours.<br />
<br />
Oh and incase you haven't been following PoP, every guild that is considering serious progression in PoP has  90-110 people on roster. With many of them having more than one account. Of course only a small portion of those guilds has access to &quot;private&quot; or &quot;semi private&quot; content. So if all those guilds have an average of 200ish active accounts, and out of 10 guilds, only ONE or TWO are happy in time, rest is competing, you have a 1600 accounts with people not being happy. And that's only high level pop guilds.<br />
<br />
Keep ignoring the issues and mostly be very happy that you play on a very &quot;undercrowded&quot; server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I do not think that, I just showed that your figures are wrong and made up figures.<br />
What you are doing is making up some numbers and use them as proof for your case. And no matter how just the case was it lost all creditability by using make up figures to support it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Zorlac's TV analogy happens to be right on and Stygiana your concert analogy is just pure off.<br />
<br />
I pay a monthly fee to play EQ 24/7 (minus patch or server down times). I am entitled based upon my payment to take advantage of the content I'm qualified for.<br />
<br />
I pay a monthly fee to watch TV 24/7 (minus cable outage times).  I am entitled based upon my payment to take advantage of the shows my package has to offer (i.e. if I didn't pay for HBO I don't get it, but if I did pay then when I flip the TV if I want to watch it I shouldn't be prohibited in watching it for any reason.)<br />
<br />
I pay a one time charge, for a single day event, for a limited amount of spaces.  I am entitled, if I bought a ticket (minus the concert isn't cancelled and I get my money back) to view that event.<br />
<br />
See the similarities/difference?  Clearly, analogies aren't for everyone.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the percentage of raiders and such but this point is absolutely valid.  On Terris server I was in a Euroguild even though I am PST (had a flexible schedule for a time being).  Once we decided to be a serious raiding guild and geared up we raced and beat every guild in our range to 80+ of our targets simply due to our time advantage.  Same for the other Euroguild on our server, except for THE resident uber who already had separated itself from everyone.<br />
<br />
I don't have the time to raid anymore but this is a serious issue.  Not progressing because you don't have content up even though you're ready for it sucks and causes massive frustration.  Instancing solves this so maybe LDoN will be a god send but it will definitely cause rifts in large EP and Time guilds because of the number limit.<br />
<br />
I never enjoyed raiding anyway, being with 50 people zerging down targets was never fun for me.  LDoN's design sounds great for me but I'm looking forward to something completely new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">LDoN is going to be a big shock for the guilds have expanded to where they can field 60+ people a night.

<br />
The logic behind these expansions is mind boggling. You basically force guilds to grow in one expansion, and then in the very next expansion you screw them over for growing.<br />
<br />
I like the concept behind LDoN. Instanced dungeons are the way to go. But by leaving out raids designed for 48 to 72 players, they just blew it. Big time.<br />
<br />
Then again, isnt this just typical of SoE?<br />

What you are doing is making up some numbers and use them as proof for your case. And no matter how just the case was it lost all creditability by using make up figures to support it<br />
- Basic reading skills with basic logic and basic mathematics must mean indeed that people make up numbers.<br />

There are 70 players in Ragrax, Stronghold of the Twelve.<br />

There are 70 players in Reef of Coirnav.<br />
<br />
Very difficult indeed, hard to associate that EQ client text output with numbers. And despite the fact that my numbers ARE RIGHT, you can come to my server to count them yourself, it provides zero credibility.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">- Maybe on your server. On my server there was one single non american timebased guild. All of them are mostly EST timezone based and only one is more PST based.<br />
One guild in time: 75 member raids, total:75:<br />
4 guilds in Elementals: 70 member raids each, total: 280.<br />
4-5 other guilds wanting actively Ssra, lesser PoP and lesser Luclin encounters: 40 members each per night, total 200ish.<br />
<br />
Out of these you have  480ish people competing for content. Server peak population is what? 2.5k? Take off 500 bazaar bots then. That 480ish is nearly 25% of the ENTIRE server population. <br />
<br />
<br />
So taking each raiding guild from luclin level and putting those number out agianst peak level poppulation = Correct numbers?<br />
<br />
OR was this true?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes I play with numbers <br />

- I am sorry I will not try to explain to you how most EQ zones are empty or statistically irrelevant (2 people in FelwhiteB is nothing compared to 120+ in Sssra). I will not also dig up older sever population values, I won't either go into &quot;complex&quot; mathematics to explain you how you can extraploate server population by checking the 20ish most popular zones (again zones like Permafrost don't matter really statistically). I won't also go into details (because you will either ignore them or simply won't understand them, hard to count you know ...) how to estimate server population fairly accurately knowing the number of servers and number of EQ subscribers, and so on. <br />
<br />
If you don't beleive me, go around in an old server during peak times, count the number of people in zones and raid guilds and you will get to my figures, or close. <br />
<br />
You prefer ignoring the facts, that's your choice. Oh and keep putting up quotes 125.52% out of context, more proof of your ignorance of the crowded server issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">here is the answer in short order. decrease spawn times on all mobs that are part of keys/flags/quests  yea it may mean more gear in teh system .. that could be delt with on drop rates on things other than flag/ key / quest items ... personally I think anything more than a 24 hour spawn timer is rediculus (maybe 48 for things like NTOV)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Uh.  How exactly do you &quot;blow&quot; VT spawn?  *boggle*<br />
<br />
The Warders in VT have been programmed with the usual care and quality control that we have come to expect from SoE, so it is possible to blow VT while it is spawning. Killing named on anything less than a full spawn of VT has been a risky experience on my server, since this often bugs the Warder despawn.  There is no clear policy from the GMs on dealing with this, either. Sometimes they help, sometimes they don't.<br />
<br />
I guess it isn't really a blown spawn, since all those mobs are up - it's just darn near impossible to get to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Zorlac is right. We are getting the same thing on Veeshan. Currently 5 active guilds in VT actively farming it, 6+ in EP, 2 in time at least. Probably 8+ picking off Ssra mobs. It's a mess and it isn't getting better. There is not enough high end raiding content to go around. And more and more guilds are moving up. As to what percentage of players it is, I don't know. I do know the guild from Japan cleared VT last week.</div></div><hr />

... Do like I do ... don't raid. Problem solved.  There needs to be more &quot;dislike raiding highly&quot; high end content, period. &quot;Endless grindage&quot; is not content either...<br />
<br />
I hate raiding with a passion, have always found it downright dull and boring and have never once figured out how anybody can find lagging 60+ people into a zone for maybe one mob is &quot;fun&quot; ... sounds more &quot;greedy&quot; than &quot;fun&quot; to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My server<br />
One Time guild - private playground zone<br />
<br />
1 Elemental guild remaining (other recently disbanded) - Euro, 4 zones to play in with minimal competition. <br />
<br />
VT, Tier 3 bosses - 3 guilds actively persuing, 1 euro controls access basically<br />
<br />
Ssra, lower PoP - At least 6. <br />
<br />
I recently became a raid leader for my guild, we raid PST time. We've killed almost everything in ssra but Emp, cursed, and blood when we can find it up. Even non raid things like key camp competition is horrendous. Theres only so many times we can kill BoT towers, NToV, Paffa, ect due to lack of better targets before it becomes more of a bore playing eq then entertainment. The competition for the limited spawns just keeps getting worse and we're one of the smallest normal servers. The spawn time issue especially on mobs that are needed for keys or flags is insane. SoE's adding a neccessity for back flagging by higher level guilds just makes things worse. Even if a guild spends as long raiding as a guild thats already higher level they advance very slowly because of the vast competition for the spawns now that the top guilds didn't face when Luclin was end game. This is a core flaw with EQ and something I doubt they will ever fix as badly as it is needed. Ssra/VT is going the be the games most horrid bottleneck of all time and the way the loot in the lower tier planes is handled progressing without going through VT is very hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I'm in a lower level guild - we raid Kael, Hate, Chardok, Veksar, Hate's Fury - lower level raids. Here's what the game is for us, on Cazic Thule.<br />
<br />
We cannot raid Friday, Saturday or Sunday. The raid zones are packed - it's just impossible to find an open slot. In fact, if there IS an impromptu raid for us on the weekend, it has to be somewhere like the Hole, which in truth one group can handle. For the sake of getting the guild together and socializing, we take what we can get.<br />
<br />
Our official raid nights are Tuesday and Thursday, with Monday being our epic raids.<br />
<br />
At least 50% of the time our raid consists of going to a zone, finding it camped. Sending out alts to an alternate zone, finding it camped. Finding a very low level zone that isn't camped and going there just to do something. These zones are not camped by groups, they're camped by guilds at the same level we are at. In the case of places such as Kael, they are occasionally camped by a group of high levels taking down the Avatar (for example) because they too can't find a place for the guild to raid.<br />
<br />
There isn't enough content to go around, at least at our level (50 to 60). Period. We don't whine - it is what it is and we still get a lot of enjoyment out of the game.<br />
<br />
But there is no way on god's earth anyone can say there's enough content. There isn't.<br />
<br />
So in response to the original topic - so this is end game? Well, it's the whole game, as far as I can see. Hopefully LDoN will solve some of these issues.<br />
<br />
Grouping, on the other hand, is a piece of cake. I get a group within five minutes of asking the guild or turning on LFG, and we rarely if ever have a problem finding a decent place to grind. This problem (as I see it) is to do with raid encounters and people's expectations. LDoN seems to have been designed exclusively to combat that issue, so kudos to SoE for dealing with it (assuming it actually works, eh).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">LDoN is going to be a big shock for the guilds have expanded to where they can field 60+ people a night.

<br />
Perhaps this expantion is geared for smaller guilds. Not everyone wants<br />
to max out the raid. I did that once, the lag was terrible.  Some <br />
of us prefer to raid with only three or four groups. <br />
<br />
I understand that large guilds may not be happy with the limit but <br />
they can stay in PoP planes or, as you suggested, split up their forces<br />
in multiple dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Current end game = plane of time = instanced = no more need to whine.<br />
<br />
Nuff said<br />
Even if its instanced it sucks as 2 guilds cant be there at the same time. And to make gods spawn in a 5days cycle sucks too imo. Its a must to get a rota when you are more than 1 guild in time. <br />

I am in 1 of those big guilds that have 60+ each night but I still look forward to Ldon to get some fun new things to do and cool adventures outside raidtime. I know alot of my guildies do that too.</div></div><hr />
