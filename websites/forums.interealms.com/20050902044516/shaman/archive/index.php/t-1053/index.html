<br />
April 23rd, 3:00am<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
NOTE:  We are unable to patch &quot;code&quot; right now because we are in the middle of making some changes to the basic structure of the game.  This will delay fixes for system bugs and updates (such as Alternate Advancement Abilities and /commands).  Please be patient until we can get these much-needed changes finished.  Because these changes affect things such as the database that stores player characters, we're taking care to make these changes the right way.<br />
<br />
<br />

- Crystalline Silk Threads are now stackable.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells **<br />
<br />
- Casters of slow spells recently given a disease component (such as Shiftless Deeds and Turgur's Insects) should no longer attract undue attention to themselves. <br />
- Raised the price to purchase Phantom Plate scroll to be more in line with others of that spell line<br />
- The following Spells are now usable by Beastlords: Serpent Sight(19), Enduring Breath(29), Levitate(39) and Talisman of Tnarg(53)<br />

- Changed Koadic's Heightened Focus to better stack with other mana regeneration spells <br />
<br />
** Trade Skills **<br />
<br />
- Cazic Thule tradeskill items are no longer No Drop  <br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests **<br />
<br />
- Halfling Toes should now be available<br />
- The Dark Elven Cleric Guild Summons should show the proper text now<br />
- The Dark Elf Wizard Guild Summons should show the proper text now<br />
- Unholy Silk Bracer recipe should be correct now<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
So what happens to a Spear of Foresight in my range slot?  Does it stay til I move it, or does it go to a bag or my cursor?  Or do I lose it?  <br />
<br />
And more importantly, what is SOOO unbalanced about a 5 WIS, 10 mana, 2 SvAll range slot item?  Oh well,  maybe I will use it for my primary weapon now.  I prefer it's look over the spine chill spear, even if it has an inferior ratio.<br />

Does this hold true for the new aggro reducing component of these slow spells?  If so that will suck more than getting my ass beat each time I cast it.<br />

Woo hoo!  Working on Shawl #6 right now, this is great!<br />
<br />
Now if they'd only make the biles and glowing swatches stack.</div></div><hr />

Hate reduction doesn't get its own resist check, so this won't make the slows easier to resist. But ya gotta admit, this is a textbook example of how Verant treats EQ. It's like an old junker car that they just keep patching and rigging instead of actually fixing, and we still drive it cause we don't want to walk.<br />
<br />
First, slow generated X hate and was a dispel-only buff.<br />
<br />
Then, they decide (for good reason) that slows should be curable without having to dispel everything until you hit them. To accomplish this, they add disease counters to the spells, allowing them to be cured like any other counter-based spell. An unforseen (but not unforseeable) consequence of this is an increase in the hate generated by the spell. Now slow generates X+200 hate.<br />
<br />
Finally, to correct the hate problem, they add a hate reduction effect to the spells. So now, instead of:<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects, Level 51, Shaman<br />
Reduce attack speed from 66% (L51) to 75% (L60).<br />
<br />
we have something like:<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects, Level 51, Shaman<br />
Reduce attack speed from 66% (L51) to 75% (L60).<br />
Add 16 disease counters.<br />
Lower caster on target's hate list by 200.<br />
<br />
because, God knows, actually reworking the way counters generate hate would be waaaaaay too much work for them. I guess we'll have to start paying $20 a month for that. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does anyone else see the problem with this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Slow still has same hate # or whatever you want to call it. THis reduction of hate by 200 is only if the spell actually lands. So if you get 1-2 resists before you can get it to stick the lower by 200 is going to mean squat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The hate generated by a resist is the same as it ever was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is too true. Remember how they &quot;fixed&quot; the pet aggro bug several months back? Instead of removing the bug which caused them to build up too much hate, they simply made it so that pets can't hold ANY aggro when a PC is in range. The bug is still there, and pets are more broken than ever.<br />
<br />
This is getting old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The old guard is gone. The new guard doesnt understand/Dislikes the old guards code. Rather than Fix what they don't understand they just spot fix things till they can throw it out and replace it.<br />
<br />
As in Working as intended.<br />
<br />
The new folks are trying to get up to speed on this humongous program. They see that some things work but they don't know WHY they work, or what they also effect. So they can't make a core change. They can only duct tape patch it. The whole system is now more duct tape than actual material and is chunking even more every day.<br />
<br />
EQ 2 Can't come soon enough, unless of course it is going to be the same thing. (More than likely) Of course if they have rare drop spells I will personally Come sit on thier necks till they turn blue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, but they've been doing this forever, even when the old guard was still there. They're just doing it more now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is any original code still left?  Seems to me that the &quot;duct tape&quot; IS the code these days.  After . . . I dunno, how many patches have we seen since starting three years ago?  100?  more?  Seems like a whole lot . . . was one a week for many months, with flurries of emergency patches of course.  Then during release of expansions it was sometimes three a day.  <br />
<br />
I dunno, but that duct tape is covering bout everything by now I'd assume.</div></div><hr />

They fixed the pet. I was pleasantly surprised last night when I could actually DO something right after he popped up. :)</div></div><hr />
