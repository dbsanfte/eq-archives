<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Moving a bit deeper into the caves is necessary now. The things around the lake will be light blue. Follow the lake around to the left to the first passage going north. Head up this passage to the second left, at about location (n2400 n250). Down here you will find Sensate Reishi, Mature Sensate Reishi and a wandering Grime Tunneler. <br />
<br />
Watch getting too close to the water at the end of the tunnel, the Phlarg’s and Patog’s here are blue but hit harder and have a nasty disease that takes three cures to get rid of. Plus they are not nearly as good experience as the others mentioned above. You can solo these if you are careful (solo gets easy at 19), or bring a partner for some fun. If you solo them, I used the following spells to do it: <br />
<br />
Sicken (change to affliction at 19)<br />
Tainted Breath<br />
Spirit Strike<br />
Root<br />
Walking Sleep<br />
Burst of Strength (change to Frenzy at 19)<br />
Inner Fire (change to Healing at 19)<br />
Gate<br />
<br />
You can obviously modify these to fit your playing style. I would buff up with my best buffs (AC, Inner Fire, SoW, STR, DEX, STA, AGI or whatever else I wanted at the time) and meditate to full. Then I would pull with Walking Sleep, hit auto attack on. Cast disease dot till it sticks, poison dot till it sticks. Check health. If getting below 60 percent, root, back off and heal a bit. Sit and meditate till root breaks or cast Frenzy and wade bank in. Refresh dots and slow as necessary, melee to death. If you have the mana and health is low, nuke to taste. This will keep all your skills up, defense (VERY IMPORTANT), offense, melee and spell.<br />
<br />
At 19 I decided I was tired of the scenery in Paludal. I went to Hollowshade and practiced some root and dot strategy on Turtles, Grimlings, Owlbears and whatever else was blue. Make sure to keep SoW up for a quick getaway to the guards. And watch out for people starting the war, some of the mobs are VERY red that are generated from it. XP was slow but steady here. <br />
<br />
Still in 19, I decided to run to Shadowhaven, get some Traders Satchels for my bank and try my luck at the Shadowhaven side of Paludal. You can run from either the Hollowshade or Shadeweavers side. I found Shadeweavers to be a less dangerous run. Just SoW in Shadeweavers, get a map and run like heck. Don’t stop till you get to the Shadowhaven zone, and make sure you announce that you will have a large train coming, with where you are starting and going. Some people actually wait for these trains to bring them mobs.<br />
<br />
You have a few options at the Shadowhaven side of Paludal. There are two bandit camps here that are very good experience for a group if you feel like grouping or duo (monks, warriors, rangers, paladins all turned out to be great duo with a shaman here). You can kill (solo or group) the two Reishi that are in the tunnel and at the bottom of the ramp. You can easily solo Phlarg Fiends with the root, dot and meditate method. At 22-23, you can solo Maricella Slithra (named mob with bandit PH to the left of Bandit camp 1, about location n1400 p1350). She will be yellow to red, but can be taken if you are careful, for very good xp. Loot is okay, up to a plat in various coin.<br />
