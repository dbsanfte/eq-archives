<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has everybody seen this on Dev Corner:<br />
<br />
&quot;Using the Test Server to Test<br />
We wanted to talk a bit about some of the recent changes we're testing out on the test server and how they affect our customers. <br />
<br />
Putting new ideas on the Test server is really an interesting thing to do sometimes. On the one hand, players are constantly requesting upgrades, changes, new features... yet when we need to test some of these new ideas out to see how they work in a real situation, lots of people jump up and down in a rage. This is aggravated by the fact that often people have incomplete information, so the new change may not even be what they think it is. New features, changes, and ideas on Test server are there to be tested. They may go live after some testing, they may get significantly changed, or they may end up not working out and being removed from test. <br />
<br />
If you see changes on Test that you like or dislike, by all means send in some feedback and let us know what you think - we're always happy to get more input from players. It also works to just post your opinions and reasons on one of the many class message boards in the EQ community, everyone on the dev team reads many of those boards each day and keeps up on the hot topics concerning each class. <br />
<br />
The game has grown and shifted enormously from when it was initially released, and the role of each class has changed in many ways. Some classes have worked out fairly well, some have seen significant changes in the past, and certainly a few need some meaningful alterations to fit into present-day EverQuest. We're well aware that not all classes have grown equally over time. When the game was originally designed, no classes needed to have things like a defining raid role, as frequent raiding simply didn't exist in the original view of the game. Over time, many new factors have popped up and were retroactively squeezed into class balance, with varying degrees of success. It's our goal that all classes have a vital role, scale well with other members of their class, and remains desirable in many situations. Attaining and keeping that balance with so many classes and play-styles is a slow process to get right. It's better for everyone involved if we take the time to correctly balance and test before moving to live servers, as it causes tremendous amounts of frustration to players when we need to change an item or ability they already are using. <br />
<br />
Some of the things we're working on right now will be controversial - some players are going to love them, and others are sure to be angry about the changes. By the time these changes are done, the game will be healthier, more entertaining, and better balanced for the majority of players. I know it's hard for people to keep a positive outlook when big things are changing around them and they don't necessarily see how it will turn out in the end, but I hope you'll continue to be patient and try to believe we have the good of all classes very much in mind as our goal. <br />
<br />
Some big changes on Test right now include the introduction of some new healing spells for priest classes. This is a sticky topic with many players, especially as it's left clerics with concerns about their desirability to groups and raids. The decision to make some changes to clerics has been a long time coming and much debated before we decided to move ahead with it. Clerics are an unusual class as at high levels they become mandatory for raid encounters, but often are thought of as unneeded in high level groups, and lack the ability to solo efficiently. With the introduction of some better raid-level heals for shamans and druids, clerics can be assured that we're intending to give them more versatility and greatly improve their group and solo roles. It should be possible to have any priest class function as an effective healer, but if you want the best and most efficient healing you'll always get that from a cleric. I'll stop by the cleric board and make a post about more of the cleric specific concerns, but you can be certain that the new heal spells for the other priests are not going to make clerics obsolete by any stretch of the imagination - expect for the role of a cleric to become more entertaining, versatile, and valued soon. <br />
<br />
Classes are continually being looked at and revised. If there are legitimate issues with your class, we'll certainly be addressing them over time. We're working our way through the classes and given time we'll be addressing each class with any needed fixes. These things take time, but we're committed to bringing you the best game possible. <br />

So what are you really buffing again?<br />
When the only thing that really means anything in this game is HP's, the only stat buffs that we have to effect those are focus line and sta line. But seeing as most, not all but most, 60 players have capped sta. We're left with a 430hp buff...<br />
WOW!<br />
<br />
But please don't forget we can slow...<br />

<br />
I'd bet 1% or less of 60s have maxed stamina without a stamina buff.<br />
<br />
And far and away most dont even max with it.<br />
<br />
Dex is also a far from useless stat.  Procs are ultra important.<br />
<br />
And how the hell do you come up with SEVERAL other classes.<br />
Enchanters can slow.<br />
After that your looking at a FEW epics that can do 50%.  And NO WAY IN HELL is 50% acceptable in many situations.<br />

If you want to make specific points, dont exaggerate it ruins your credibility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would rather have a Torpor that could land outside my group and no negitive effects. <br />
<br />
I'd like to have a Group/single HP buff that did more HP than GFocus but had no STR or DEX like the old Kraggs (and stacked with other non-shaman spells).  <br />
<br />
I would like to have a better AE slow, one that could land on more than four targets and wouldn't get resisted by all mobs. <br />
<br />
Maybe a better cripple for the Luclin mobs. <br />
<br />
And maybe have our AE rain spells stack. /shrug<br />
<br />
Maybe a quest similar to the Druid one that results in an item that has single target hp buff (maybe even just Focus).  /shrug<br />
<br />
I like the slowed casting time idea too.<br />
<br />
Maybe an upgrade for Malo, although I have no real suggestions that make sense except to do 100 to debuffs instead of 60.</div></div><hr />

-- Hence I said the only crap that worth a daman is sta and focus, which when looking at the big picture they don't have that huge of an effect... <br />
<br />
My point was that what else do we bring to the table other than 430hp buff and slows?<br />
<br />
Proc rates have little or no direct relation to dex. Theres some good work over at Steelwarrior about weapons havening a set proc rate... <br />
<br />
http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=1901.topic<br />
<br />
And a 50% slow is more than acceptable when your slowing for max exp... Hence they wouldn't have a shaman any way...<br />

What do we really have to offer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excellent, excellent point.  Clerics may be one dimensional in the end game, but so are shamans.  Our buffs are marginally effective, our damage output is very low, our melee abilities are non-existant (unless you happen to have Rabid Bear).  Sure we can solo a few big mobs, but soloing is not an efficient way to gain AA exp at 60.  Slow is our best role.<br />
<br />
And basically, at the high level game, shaman slowing is not all that necessary.  With the enhanced damage output of melees and most other casters (especially wizards), mobs go down much faster.   Magician's Mala, enchanter's slows, and proc slows are often enough to get the job done for many encounters (our guild often does ST without a shaman).<br />
<br />
I'm all for increasing the fun and versatility of the cleric class.  They are clearly more one dimensional than other priests.  But shamans aren't that far behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What do WE bring to the table? Umm.. you joking? <br />

Malosini <br />
Torpor <br />

Insideous Decay <br />
Focus <br />
Group Regrowth (alot easier for us to get than druids) <br />
Talisman of Epicuration <br />

<br />
<br />
Malo  - it's great, Mala does in a pinch<br />
Slow - it's great, enchie slow almost as good and they do lack the hitpoints/AC to use it as effectively as we do<br />
Cripple ?  we share this with enchanters<br />
Malosini ?  we share this with mages<br />
Torpor - true, a godly spell, but somewhat limited...only good for in group, not suitable for melee healing (although I'd rather use it and have a slow tank than a dead tank).  Torpor shines in healing casters taking AOE damage, mod rodding clerics/casters and helping mages make mana factories.  A very very good spell and very useful in a raid situation.  Truely amazing combined with can IV, V for self mana regen.<br />
Disease Slow - okay, I'll give you this one, we're the only ones that get it and although it has limited usefulness, it's nice to have when you need it<br />
Insideous Decay - good debuff, stacks with necro disease debuff<br />
line<br />
Focus - lots of stacking issues, but I still love it<br />
Group Regrowth (alot easier for us to get than druids) - druids only get it mana free on their Velious bps, I think druids have the upper hand with group regrowth<br />
Talisman of Epuration - very nice resist buff, lasts forever, which I like<br />
<br />
I don't know if your list was supposed to cheer us up with what we bring to the table, but it left me a little depressed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Folks. <br />
<br />
You are burning out.<br />
<br />
Stop raiding so much. Take a group somewhere. Push your limits, with 6. Go somewhere new. Pull more than one mob.<br />
<br />
Raiding is hard. It is stress multiplied by communication limits and ego's. Raiding things that you have done 10 times before is even less fun. Getting an item for Joe blows Twink_03 sucks. I don't care how much better the twink is getting because of the item. <br />
<br />
Go back to what the shaman shines in. Small group tactics. Long drawn out fights where if someone makes a boo boo you are all going to die. (All 4 of you)<br />
<br />
PoP will be out soon and there will be all new content to bitch about. New exploits to report to the deaf ears of verant. More than likely new levels to stress over and laugh at once you finish them. New AA to number crunch and declare that it sucks.<br />
<br />
New spells to work at finding for 6 months before verant actually lets them drop off a broken encounter.<br />
<br />
You know what I bring to the table?<br />
<br />
Everything. If it is a small group I can do anything. Damage dealer to tank, Crowd control to puller, Healer to debuffer. Oh the tank needs to leave no problem. Ill tank. (Obviously it won't be as good. but what the hell 96% resses let you have fun.)<br />
<br />
I don't have to be a shaman. I Choose to be. I have a 59 Enchanter I could play as a main. Nahh shaman is more fun. I have a 60 thief I could choose to play. Nahh shaman is more fun.<br />
I have a little twinkie Shadowknight, I could play. Nahh shaman is more fun.<br />
<br />
The game is only going to suck if you let it. Take a break from the raid, and go have a little fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">We need to be much more specialized in a certain area.   I still say, in my own opinion, far superior debuffs (innovative ones at that) than any other class are the way to go for us.    Being considered a &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; class can have its benefits, but to me, have more downfalls with other classes being able to do similar albeit less powerful (but only marginal).<br />
<br />
Enchanters, enchant.   They should be above all others in enchancing people by physical or mind means.   Wizards should deal nuclear powered damage far more than any other can.   Clerics should superior in healing and dealing with undead than any other (well paladins can come close in the undead dept.). <br />
Melees in the end, do damage.  But each of them do it different and bring other things to the table.   Monks FD to pull a mob or corpse; warriors take damage and taunt (needs more fixing); rangers can dish out good damage via bow instead of boring swords; etc...  <br />
<br />
So, I'd like to see shamans bring something to the table that nobody else can even come close to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You see, raiding is fun to me, I've burned out on small grouping.  I've looked for small group stuff that would be new and challenging lately, I've duoed with a monk in deep KK, I've done exp groups in Fear and Hate and POG.  I've crawled SG, I've crawled HS, I've crawled Chardok.  I've done OS disco with no enchie and no cleric with just necros and rogues.  <br />
<br />
I've never been afraid of usual groups or of challenges, I'm just plain flat out tired of exping.  I really do ENJOY raiding, which is why I've been in a raid guild for 2 years, joined when we were struggling to do Fear and Hate and last week we were the third guild on the server to kill AoW.<br />
<br />
Just because I enjoy raiding and enjoy being a shaman, doesn't mean that some improvements would be nice.  It doesn't mean I'm burned out or need to play another class.  Heck, I'm stoked by the idea of dot stacking, improved out of group heals and even shield blocking! It takes so little extra to make me go &quot;ooooooh&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have to agree with Icklymuk on this one...we only really bring one thing to the table that is unique to us, and that is our Stat buffs, and we all know how little they mean.  ATK, AC, HPs and speed are pretty much the only buffs that truly matter.<br />
<br />
I wonder how many people that post on this board that say they only want to Buff/Debuff, have played the original game that was released in April 99?  Because nowhere in the game manual does it say that Shamans are the kings of Buffing/Debuffing--we are primal healers.  The original spell list in the manual only went to level 24!  Our spells were almost identical to Cleric spells, but while we weren't as good at healing, we had a few more utility spells (namely SoW).  <br />
<br />
I'm still a little upset that Shaman don't get some form of Rezz.  If you go by the original &quot;Vision&quot; of the game, according to the spell list available at release, we were five levels behind clerics, but slightly better than druids at healing.  <br />
<br />
So, we don't get Rezz, fine.  (How about Reincarnation, guys?  A level 39/49/59 rezz that gives you back 25/50/75% of your exp, and turns you into a Bear, Wolf, Lion, etc. for a duration of 30 minutes.  You now have the AC/HP/abilities of an animal (ie no spell casting) for the duration of the spell, and then you change back to human/elf/dorf form, and loot your corpse.  It would have positives, and negatives, and wouldn't infringe on clerics.).  Instead, we get Slow, the spell that causes clerics to Melee and Nuke when grouped with us.  Oh, wait, Enchanters get slow, too.  How come enchanters Slow is only 5% worse than ours, but their Haste spells are 40% better?  If we're the Kings of Physical Stat Buffs, shouldn't we have a better Haste than them?<br />
<br />
Does it not bother ANYONE else that Paladins are our equal as healers at high levels, and get Rezz spells??  <br />
<br />
Oh well, /rant off.  I started my shaman to be a utility healer, with the ability to solo occasionally.  Not to cast useless Stat buffs.   But it will never change, because the game is hopelessly broken at this point.  <br />
<br />
Last point:  Clerics are whining about us having better healing potential, thus making them unwanted.  How do we beef up the cleric class?  Make them what they were in their teens--masters of Undead Damage.  Give them AE Undead Spells, Undead Lure DD, AE Undead  Stuns.   Give them the ability to Command an undead (i.e. Charm).  Give level 60 Clerics the ability to Disentigrate Undead on a 5% chance, similiar to Assassinate with Rogues.</div></div><hr />

Anyone care to answer that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I agree that most classes are one-dimensional on raids. The lucky ones generally have at most two dimensions, and aren't necessary for the second one. <br />
<br />
The ones I pity are the zero-dimensional classes at raids: Beastlords, Shadowknights, Necros (unless you need corpses summoned, and a bot can handle that easily if it arises), Druids, maybe one or two more. <br />
<br />
Sure, the members of those classes are  useful, but I don't think I've ever see a raid not go forward because no member of those classes was available. <br />
<br />

<br />
P.S. Lest you think I feel so superior, my main (a bard) falls into the same category as soon as you start talking about the second one on a raid.</div></div><hr />

Give me a DOT that isn't resisted by a player with decent gear!  I mean even after Malo I have a hard time landing Bane and after Insidous decay half the time Pox is resisted. (Sorry play on a PvP server and this is a pet peeve)<br />
<br />
I want to be able to get AC high enough to make melee attacks as negated as thier resists make my spells negated!<br />
<br />
Don't give me a 1k heal I don't want it! make me more of a DOT damage dealer! ... Give me buffs that MEAN something other then Health!   <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hmm, I wouldn't mind being secondary healer, personally.  Hell, I kinda already do it (yes, even in raids).  <br />
Giving us a more powerful heal would only make us more desirable.  And no, we will never be more effective than clerics in the healing game.  CH and CE still cannot be touched by any other class.<br />
<br />
If there's one thing I've learned from EQ, it's not to count my chickens before they hatch.  Let's wait and see how these heals really affect the game when they go live, not speculating on what they might be beforehand.<br />
<br />
As for other shaman issues, I think we actually bring a lot to groups.  <br />
Stat buffs are not useless by any means.  I've seen an unbuffed tanks compared to a buffed one -- the unbuffed did not do nearly as well as the buffed one.  A tank with low DEX does not proc as much as one with high DEX, I've seen this for myself with my ranger.  <br />
Now that being said, I did a test with AGI spells and saw that they do have diminishing returns (Cat gives like 5 AC I believe), so I probably will limit the casting of that on raids since spell slots are at a premium.  But that's only one spell.  We have a whole slew of others that are effective.  True, Focus has some stacking issues that I would like to see changed (quite frankly, I would like to see all spells stack with each other, save for a more powerful version of a spell line with a less powerful version), but still not many people would refuse it.  <br />
And just because we share some spells with other classes, does not make them (or us) any less effective.  Many times, those other classes are not present on raids.<br />
Also, if I were a tank, I'd much rather have the maximum level of slow given the choice.<br />
<br />
Now if there is one area I would like to see improved for us, it would be increased melee damage output.  I must admit, the new cleric upgrades have me a bit nervous, but again I am not going to really worry about it until I see how it folds out once live.<br />
I'm not asking for dual wield with double attack and crits, just something a little better than what we have (after all we are 1/4 tank according to VI).  Maybe more powerful weapons with good ratios available to us would be a start.  Also maybe double attack alone would not be too overpowering.<br />
<br />
/shrug  Just my thoughts, but I for one will wait and see how the changes really affect the game before commenting too much on them.</div></div><hr />
