<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I plan on buying a second eq account. Will I have to buy all the expansions again for the new account? Also is there anyway I can transfer a character from my first account to my second?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'll need to buy any expansions you want the 2nd character to be able to go to for the 2nd account.  You can transfer a toon to the 2nd account from your 1st, but I believe Sony charges $50 for that.  Check eqlive.station.sony.com for info on the name change service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can buy evolutions for $30 + ldon for $30 and you'll be covered. In order to do a character transfer you must have the same expansions on both accounts.<br />
<br />
Last I checked, gogamer.com had both for like $25 each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As I recall, and this is old memory, you couldn't move characters to new accounts until after the first free month was over. That might have changed or I may simply be totally fogged in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Both accounts have to be original owner/billing info and must have all the same expansions to do a transfer. Its 50 bucks for 1-2 char's moving accounts on same server. I just finally move my palidan to my wifes account. They say can take 3 weeks but i was lucky and moved me the next day. I couldn't tell you about the first free month and transfering. My accounts are all couple years old i dont recall seeing anything about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The needing to wait the first month is still in the official rules, but like a lot of things with transfers its up to whether or not the person at SoE doing it actually cares.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I actually put in for a move on a character off one of my accounts to a brand new (Evolutions+LDoN) account the same day I purchased it.  The move was approved and completed inside three days, well within the 30 trial period.  Not sure why they allowed this as it does say you can't on the transfer web page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The nice thing is that although you must PURCHASE all the expansions, you don't have to actually use the CDs.  Just the CD keys.  You can use the existing EQ installation.<br />
<br />
If you are cloning your EQ installation to a new computer, here's what I do -<br />
<br />
Zip the ENTIRE EQ DIRECTORY and all subdirs.<br />
<br />
Unzip in the new location.<br />
<br />
Delete all the .TXC (texture cache) files.<br />
<br />
Voila, done.  You won't be able to uninstall EQ from the Add/Remove Programs dialog in the Control Panel, and you'll have to add your own shortcut to the desktop/Start Menu, but other than that everything should work fine.</div></div><hr />
