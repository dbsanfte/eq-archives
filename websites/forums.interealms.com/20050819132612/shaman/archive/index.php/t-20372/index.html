<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With Ryan checking our boards, I wanted to post something about two spells that are not working properly right now:<br />
<br />
Tiny Companion: This is supposed to shrink our pet, but it does nothing to him. We can't even shrink our pet using the regular shrink spell. This bug has been around for a long time, and shaman have just given up on it ever getting fixed. It's probably an easy fix too, since every other pet class can shrink their pet.<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryn and Torrent of Poison: This is a wierd one. Both of these spells behave in the same way. <br />
- For 1 target in AE, it does 3 rounds of damage.<br />
- For 2 targets in AE, it does 2 rounds of damage to each target.<br />
- For 3 targets in AE, it does 1 round of damage to each target, and one extra round to one of the three targets. I'm not sure how it decides which of the three targets gets the extra round.<br />
- For 4 targets in AE, it does 1 round of damage to each target.<br />
- For anything greater than 5 targets in the AE it choses 4 and behaves like the 4 target rule.<br />
<br />
I really believe since these are AE Rain DD Spells, it should do 3 rounds of damage to all mobs that get hit. In other words, if there are 4 mobs it should do 3 rounds of damage to all 4 mobs which is 12 rounds. Which is exactly how the Wizard Rain DDs work.  Why do our Rains work differently?<br />
<br />
Post any more bugs that you know of, and maybe we can get them fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rains are not buggy, they are coded to behave that way. The 4 target thing is a legacy from wizards killing entire zones with them - that much is fine.<br />
The hardcoded resist rate is not however.<br />
<br />
And yes, my poodle growing into a shepherd is not nice  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dunno how it's supposed to work, but I do have a level 35 alt Wizard, and his rain spells hit for all rounds.  In other words, if there are 3 mobs it hits for 3 rounds on each mob, not the way our shammy rains are behaving right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 4 target rule goes back to the early days of the initial release.   Unlimited rains were WAY over powered for us.   They also had the annoying tendency to target your own pets and generate instant death causing agro.<br />
<br />
The rules for them are probably buried deep in the code and are a special case just for that spell type.  Changing it would probably be a major pain.   And as far as I know, shamans are the only people that actually have Rains as their major AoE attack.   <br />
<br />
It might be a fun thing to see Rains adjusted to be a more powerful spell for us, but it's hardly going to be high on anybody's list.<br />
<br />
A more consistent behavior would be nice.  Like a doing 4 waves to a single target so you always get 4 hits per cast.<br />
<br />
Of course, removing the old 'shaman wave' rules and just letting us play by AoE rules would be fun...  I'd bring along a cleric to Rezz you after each cast though, if I were you.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I understand the 4 target rule, but why only one round on 4 targets, versus 3 rounds on 4 targets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well to fix it I guess they could just delete the old rain spells and add entirely new ones with the exact same qualities as wizard rains, only poison based etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps it is the wolf model that is bugged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, the problem is in the wolf model and that for some reason its smallest size is the size it is summoned at.<br />
<br />
To repeat: THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH TINY COMPANION OR SHRINK (except of course that shamans having the spell Tiny Companion at all is stupidity that passes all human understanding).<br />
<br />
You *can* shrink your pet with either spell. Grow it first, then shrink it with either spell, it will get smaller.<br />
<br />
The bug that has taken hold is with the minimum size of wolf pets. It is like trying to shrink a gnome...ain't gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I don't think this USED to be true.  I know I used to shrink the crap out of my dog dog.  I used to make it so small that I could hardly see it.  Not sure what the problem is now, but it USED to shrink.<br />
<br />
As for the troll warder..who would want to shrink it, they are already so small they need a grow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can't grow though without making their &quot;hit box&quot; massive... target one once with the targetting ring and note the size of the croc to the size of the targetting ring... big difference.</div></div><hr />

Because many spells are coded differently for PvE and PvP. Resist rate of Rains and how they behave fall under this category. In PvP your rain spell will hit everyone in range for 3 waves, just like it does that on yourself.<br />
<br />
But I guess that was more of a rhetorical question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, I don't think this USED to be true.  I know I used to shrink the crap out of my dog dog.

<br />
You still can shrink them.  What Arriana was saying is that shrink still works fine on the dog, and it does.  The problem is, when you cast your pet summon spell, EQ is looking on the specification sheet for &quot;Dawgdawg, Model 01&quot;, and finding some incorrect info.  It's getting the initial size of the dawgdawg model correct, but instead of allowing it to be shrunk a maximum of 2 times, it's allowing it to be GROWN a maximum of 2 times (or whatever).<br />
<br />
As far as shrink not working, do what was suggested.  Grow your dog, then cast shrink.  He'll shrink just fine, just won't get any smaller than he was when you originally summoned him.  All that's happening when you try to shrink him from 'stock' size is EQ saying &quot;Sorry, my instructions tell me that that dog is as small as he can get already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bug report it for sure, but don't blame the shrink spell, blame the pet summoning spell.  Shrink ain't broke.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
I personally hope they don't fix it.  Giant dawgdawg is fun, and makes an excellent umbrella in inclement weather.</div></div><hr />
