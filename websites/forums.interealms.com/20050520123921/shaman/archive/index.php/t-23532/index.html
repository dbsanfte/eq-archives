<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious what other casual players are thinking about OOW?<br />
<br />
For me, I enjoyed the PoP release and leveling up to 65 in low-end PoP and getting the power increase from reasonably accessible new spells.  This seems to be a similar experience.<br />
<br />
The thing that has changed is the gap between raiders and non-raiders is so huge these days, I am not sure if OOW will really be playable very far by someone like me.  Or it may be that OOW gear and spells will be fairly accessible, creating sort of a new baseline for the &quot;bazaar shaman&quot; that is sufficient to play some of this expansion.  It will be interesting to see whether SOE is serious about keeping the game playable for the non-raider.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the fact that it is a major design challenge to make this game work when I might as well be playing a different game from the point of view of gear, zone-access, GoD spells, focus effects, etc.<br />
<br />
My attitude is that I am just going to play the new expansion and try to enjoy it, without worrying about character advancement and upgrades so much.  Just play it, and wait for EQ2.  Thinking about a coercer next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think oow will have good amounts of stuff for raiders and non raiders.  Look up the 'task system' as an example of oow for single or group encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am in a raiding, yet non-uber raiding guild. Been playing this game since October 1999, would class myself as someone who knows most of the zones inside out, but certainly not someone who is at the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; in terms of the game. <br />
<br />
My gear is a mix of Ornate, LDON, GoD and Tier 1-3 planar. I have 211 AAs.<br />
<br />
OK -- so now you know who i am :)<br />
--<br />
<br />
My biggest frustration with all new expansions seems to be that I am denied access to most for it until the next expansion comes out.<br />
<br />
I don't know if Sony plans it like this, but i notice that the &quot;Changes to GoD&quot; to make &quot;Knights tank better&quot;, &quot;Spells drop more&quot; are happening on production servers on 14th September, around the due date of OOW.<br />
<br />
It's almost like they plan it like this, so only the uber guilds get the initial benefit (to keep them interested and to keep them comfortably above the rest of us) and then they &quot;open it up&quot; to the masses. (Compare what is happening in god with the lifting of the flag requirements for Tier 2 PoP Zones)<br />
<br />
Ever since GoD was released, I struggle to find tanks in my guild (and level of guilds) to tank Sewers1, Vxed and Tipt. <br />
<br />
I have been working very hard with mainly pickup groups and now am 2/3 of the way to KT. The uber raiding crowd keep telling &quot;Sewers is a timesink do Rondo&quot;....well that's all well and good but getting a &quot;casual raiding guild&quot; who is already working flat out on EP access (we just made it to sol ro) to do Rondo is not easy thing. Maybe I'm wrong I don't know.<br />
<br />
I have one GoD spell (Daluda's Mending) which took me about 60 trials and one lucky roll to win. (i've only ever seen about 4 spells/runes drop in GoD)<br />
<br />
Some of my guild (one cleric for example) won't even come to GoD as it's too stressful. (please keep in mind our clerics have small mana pools, low HP, and low FT compared to EP/Time clerics).<br />
<br />
Now I read they are &quot;tweaking&quot; GoD just as OOW comes out.<br />
<br />
Therefore I expect OOW to be the same. 90% inaccessible to me for at least 6 months until the next expansion comes out.<br />
<br />
Today i took a &quot;perfect&quot; sewer2 group in to flag the group (i have the flag other 5 needed) we executed exactly as i did when i flagged it (rogue sneaks for hand in) and yet the rogue's trade was refused. I asked around yet no one could find a reason why this happened. We failed the trial, perhaps it seems, to a bug. The uber guilds all did Rondo, so I have no luck getting sewers groups with them. It's me and the middle tier guilds in this sewer (it smells!!) together.<br />
<br />
Ok so Level 70 will change a lot. It's going to make raiding some of the PoP content easier I presume. It will be interesting to see the effect exactly.<br />
<br />
The spells I won't see for months. The gear probably for years.<br />
<br />
All that's left for me really is the new AAs. <br />
<br />
As I always say with the expansions since PoP:<br />
<br />
It's nothing new. Just an extension of the name. If you are already playing at lvl 65+ and raiding, you must buy the expansion for access to the new levels/AAs or have a harder life in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Luclin was the last expansion that really added something imho, beyond just some new features and bells and whistles and just new gear that instantly makes older gear redundant.<br />
<br />
So to summarise this waffle:<br />
<br />
Yes i will buy OOW. No I am not excited about it whatsoever with one important (for me) exception:<br />
<br />
A list of AA titles to choose from at the start of your name. <br />

<br />
Just wondering where you found information on this? My friend plays a pally and we've really been struggling with god content and I'd really like to actually see my new slow at some point. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty much in the same boat is you at this point with a mix of ornate and tier 1-3 drops. I've been to GoD a lot in the last few weeks and frankly its really been lousy. The exp to risk ratio sucks hard core in all the zones I've tried. I hate bot, but I can grind out aa in complete safety there at a much faster rate then any of the lower god zones. I'd prefer the challenging mobs if the exp was worth the time involved (I can do and win ldon hards with a sub 7k tank so I'm not looking for an easy ride). Why would anyone exp in riwwi per say when its harder then pov and doesn't give a fraction of the exp?  <br />
<br />
I'm hoping that the exp to risk ratio is much better then god was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I will enjoy OoW I think.  However when WoW and EQ2 come out I will have to choose which 1 or 2 of the 3 to play.  Thats going to be the hardest choice.  I will most certainly play all 3 for at least a month to see the &quot;replay&quot; value of each compared to EQ.  I know I can't play all 3 thats just to much time.  Depending on What EQ2 is like I will play that over WoW but so far WoW is awsome.  Undead warlock w/fishing, Enchanting, and skinning as skills.  Lvl 10 Voidwalker(pet) is awsome, well for lvl 10 anyway lol.<br />
<br />
OoW should &quot;complete&quot; GoD.  If not EQ may fall a few notches on the totem for even the most dedicated players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For what its worth, the beta buff characters for OoW are pretty much bazaar equiped (or at the level if they had non-droppable items) for the most part, and people seemed to be doing ok, so I expect that there will be something for most people to do in the expansion when it goes live. Of course it will scale up as you go into harder parts of the zones, many zones seemed quite diverse in that respect, with a lot of &quot;zonelet&quot; areas, sort of like BB or LIO, with mobs increasing in difficulty as you move from one area to another. None of the zones have the &quot;big square&quot; feel that many traditional zones have, and mostly have a more &quot;natural&quot; feel about them, much like LIO did (not withstanding issues people might have had with those playing there, I still think that zone itself is one of the best laid out in the game).<br />
<br />
One zone in particular is clearly aimed at the high end though, allthough I doubt too many casual players will hang out there. They can get in but there appears to be a raid mob &quot;guarding&quot; the zonein sort of like RC guards the entrance to VT, or like sonty guards ToV.<br />
<br />
The first zone is easier than Natimbi (most mobs are green to a 65 in fact) so there is something for people lower level than who currently can do Natimbi.<br />
<br />
It looks like an expansion with a lot to offer, both in terms of things to do and development possibilities for people starting at about 45 or so, and certainly for the 65s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just hoping I can slow the mob period before the tank dies without having balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am so casual that I have only been one-rounded once at 65 :)<br />
<br />
When I log at night, I don't expect to kill gods and dragons and I don't want adrenalin pumping through my veins. I just want to have a good time with the people that I have known for a long time and like to hang out with. If it's moderately challenging, that's fine, I can handle it as long as I have a rez and a Summon Corpse handy. If it's mostly trivial, that's OK too, we'll just joke around and snicker at mobs. If it's too stressful, I'll just take my toys and go elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I am not sure when I'll be buying OoW. Based on what I hear, I will have no way of getting 66+ spells right away and I see no point in leveling to 70 without them. If there are fun zones to hang out at 65 there, I may buy it sooner rather than later. Ditto if there are any fun AAs to be had. Otherwise I'll wait and see.<br />
<br />
$60 is insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but I hate to waste money and, since I am yet to get any use out of GoD, I don't want to repeat the experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really sorry about this statement I made. It is actually from the God &quot;re-tune&quot; they did back in May....I read the wrong date on the page (I'm an idiot).<br />
<br />
As for knights tanking, from what I've seen if your friend is a pally with just under EP level gear (like we have) and a decent amount of AAs, vxed is doable if you make sure to use a chanter pet, and have the pally stun a lot and to &quot;back off&quot; when the mob gets lucky hits in, so the pet can take some damage. <br />
<br />
It's not ideal but with the really fast exp rate in vxed hopefully your tank can buy some more good tanking AAs. Not to mention the possibility of good drops.<br />
<br />
Again my apologies for the bad information. It was wishful thinking lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OoW looks a lot nicer than GoD...but I wonder how dependant it is on GoD? I haven't purchased GoD for my two accounts (still boycotting it =P). Hehehe...<br />
<br />
I'm one of those people that don't preorder any expansions btw. I let other people test it for me. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm apprehensive about OoW, so I've only bought it for one of my accounts.  I run a 63 shaman and a 64 monk in a casual guild.  I have set foot in GoD twice, neither time for more than 15 minutes or so.  My guild is not capable of doing trials, which eliminates the interesting content.  I don't need 3 more outdoor xp zones for $60.  I'm fine grinding in any of the 6 other expansions.  <br />
<br />
Because of GoD, i'm concerned about OoW, though it sounds like SOE has at least admitted that they royally screwed up with GoD.  That's at least mildly comforting.  But i'm still concerned.  Maybe some interesting content really will be tuned towards the casual player.  But, with the gap between raider and casual becoming absolutely staggering, and the guild summit primarily (solely?) including very high-end guilds, I'm concerned about what SOE thinks the casual player wants.  I'd like something resembling progression that doesn't require 50+ people.  We'll see what OoW has to offer.<br />
<br />
I'm also concerned about the spell system.  Frankly, I think the PoP-style rune system was poorly implemented.  There was no differentiation between high-end spells and standard upgrade spells in PoP.  A rune got you a 65 spell, be it Quiessence or Fo7.  The only reason those two spells sell for similar amounts of money is the difficulty involved in getting them.  Fo7 is not the same caliber spell that Q is by a long shot, yet you essentially have to be a raider to get Fo7 without being severely gouged in the bazaar.  It grants the same effect as FoS, just to more people.  But you have to kill EP minis or better to get it.  That makes no sense to me.  Hopefully in OoW, the relative power of a spell will relate directly to the difficulty in obtaining it.<br />
<br />
That said, I am looking forward to custom titles, instanced xp zones, upgraded epics and the task system (somewhat).  The level cap bump is ok, though I haven't hit 65 yet, so the carrot of a faster moving xp bar (AAXP) just got 5 levels farther away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">in OoW, the relative power of a spell will relate directly to the difficulty in obtaining it.<br />
<br />
Power has nothing to do with it.  Which token (rune) you need is based simply off the level of the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My guild raids 2-3 times per week.  However, we're not &quot;uber&quot; and chose to progress via Ssra/VT before hitting the elementals.  We're taking out the Emperor regularly (I believe we're 6-1, with 5 straight kills), and just now hitting VT minis and closer in named.  We're going to be in VT for awhile gearing up, and I believe it will show when we hit PoP/Elementals.<br />
<br />
If there's anything I like about this, it's the fact that most guilds will move on to GoD, and OoW, leaving PoP for us without a lot of competition for the targets.  We chose this route intentionally, and I believe we will get through a lot easier because of it.  I won't see raid content of GoD and OoW for awhile, maybe never see OoW.  However, I still enjoy the game, which in the end is all that matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Regarding spell availability in OOW, the dev chat posted today said:<br />
--------------<br />
*Islington* Will the Level 69 and Level 70 normal spell tokens (not Ancient) be No Drop? If the answer is yes, why is this?<br />
The 66-68 spells for Omens will be tradable while the 69-70 and the ancient tokens are no drop. Although it’s worth noting that the 69 and 70 spells do drop from a variety of mobs that can be killed by a small group.<br />
[19:12] The rational for having this distinction is to create a situation where it requires a similar amount of effort for casters to have a similar power upgrade as a melee requires.<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
So it seems OOW will be partly like pop with the 66-68 spells on sale in the bazaar, but supposedly single group no drops for the 69-70 spells.  I never won the roll on a rune in PoP and bought all my 65 spells, so I hope the drop rates are realistic on those 69-70 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">in OoW, the relative power of a spell will relate directly to the difficulty in obtaining it.Power has nothing to do with it.

<br />
This is true.  More importantly though, level 69-70 token drops will apparently be available in single group content, which is nice.  My only question is single-group content for whom, Time+ or casual+?<br />
<br />
Also, the one word you left out of my quote vastly changes the meaning of the sentence you quoted: from a wish to a completely false statement.  In the future, if you want to quote me, please include everything needed to accurately represent what I said.<br />

You need to push for your guild to do Rondo then.  Rondo isnt that hard as long as your raid understands CC/Offtanking and repop timing.  Additionally his loot is elemental quality.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">On my server elementals are already empty, all of the capable high end guilds are farming GoD and occasionally Time.  So far we haven't had to race for a single mob which is nice.  <br />
<br />
As far as sewers are concerned, I'm still really angry about the nerf they did when they changed the instances to prevent farming.  You are lucky to see a named now in any sewer trial, and before you guys jump down my throat and tell me to hit KT, go join a low end elemental guild and tell me just how easy it is to get flagged .. it's not.  When your guild is concentrating hard on elemental targets there isn't a lot of time to do GoD content, and frankly we have a lot of players that are undergeared so that doesnt help.<br />
<br />
I don't want to buy OOW because of the mistrust I have for SoE, both in regard to casual players and playtesting, to the disrespect they have shown this community.  But I feel I may have to because my guild will expect me to in order to help them achieve thier goals.</div></div><hr />

I think this only applies to the instanced raids. Rondo being an regular zone means you can throw as many people at him as you have I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">So it seems OOW will be partly like pop with the 66-68 spells on sale in the bazaar, but supposedly single group no drops for the 69-70 spells. I never won the roll on a rune in PoP and bought all my 65 spells, so I hope the drop rates are realistic on those 69-70 spells.<br />

yes, this is a significant concern.  The concept in PoP wasn't bad, but the execution I thought was crap.  The distribution pattern was lame, and if folks can't buy them, they need to make them accessible to non-raiding inclined groups.  Or they can expect their numbers to continue to dwindle.</div></div><hr />
