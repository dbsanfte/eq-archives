<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arej</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know how many hitpoints each of our pets have? I am a new shaman and am about to ding 34. Just wondered how our pets stack up to other pet classes. Thanks in advance! :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thunderpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our pets are *roughly* the flavor of an enchanter pet. Probably better if you fully buff it. This is a completely non-scientific comparison. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The first few pets (34, 39) are weak, so you will have to tank for them, at least for any long period of time. The later pets get somewhat better but are always gonna be weak in comparison to mage/bst pets. Still, buffed, they can do some limited tanking and are good at temporary crowd control. A pet is much more reliable than root, unless you've dotted the mob.. then it's coming after you. ;) Still, the doggie is VERY useful, so get to know him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arej</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you for all the responses. What I am really looking for is how many hitpoints they have. I duo with a necro and he is always naming off the stats of his different pets. /shrug I realize his pet is more tankworthy then mine, but would still be nice to have an estimate of how many hitpoints my pet has. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe 2k hp or so.. I don't have a concrete number to give you. I do know that torpor (heals 1200hp) can take a pet to full hp even if the pet is well below 50% health.</div></div><hr />
