<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just awarded an 18% spell haste item recently and now, that stacked with QB2 and bor (cleric spell haste), puts my Q at the coveted 3 second mark.  Generally I would begin casting Q on myself right after Canni5 with no problems, but now that 3 seconds may as well be 6...and it's quite annoying.  At least 50% of the time when I try to heal myself now, I get &quot;Your spell recovery time has not been met yet&quot; message, which makes zero sense, since you have 2.5 seconds of refresh in between your ability to cast and Q is at the 3 second mark.  Is this due to server delay or what?<br />
<br />
And I use a custom Canni5 hotkey, so I don't see when it's &quot;up&quot;, I just hit the key and it either goes off or I get the message that I have a few more seconds to wait for it to refresh.  That means I generally will not cast Q on myself before Canni5 when the time is near, because I don't want to have to stand there and Canni4 just to get back the mana I wasted on an early Q.  I have never had any problems with using AA's in conjunction with an actual spell, but now I am.  Anyone else having problems like this, and if so, what did you do to stop it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It kinda sucks to have to use two hotkey spaces, but I'd set aside a relatively unused hotkey bank, throw your Quiessence, Cann V, and custom Cann V hotkeys all in it, and just swap there when you're about to chew on yourself. You'll still have all your functionality, it'll just be slightly less accessible. I don't see Cann V as being something that I generally have to have at my fingertips right now, so I'm willing to put up with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably will do that.  I use my second page of hotkeys for things like Canni5 and Radiant cure, and I have five free slots anyway.  Still kind of lame though. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a raw Canni V hotkey in my main bank so I can see when it pops, but I switch to another bank to actually cast it using my announce - canni V - Quiescence macro.<br />
<br />
But yeah, the spell recovery thing is annoying, and it apparently gets worse the more spell haste you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe add a /pause at the end of your Canni 5 key - not sure if this would work just an idea~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can add a /pause command to your macro, but that sort of defeats the purpose of having spell haste.  It might look something like this:<br />
<br />
/pause 10, /alt activate 47<br />
/g Using AA cannibilization now -- no heals, please.<br />
/cast 3<br />
/cast 3<br />
<br />
That would do canni, pause for a second, display a message, then cast Q.  You might have to play with the pause time a bit.</div></div><hr />

I have something similar to this, you need a pause in there to account for the cast time of Canni V anyway. Having to make it longer to account for the &quot;spell recovery time not met&quot; thing is a work around until they fix this annoying bug.<br />
<br />
One thing I would suggest though, in your macro, have another slight pause with the first /cast 3, (something short like /pause 5) which should help if you fizzle. Correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while since I set up my macro and I fiddled around with it until it seemed to work, but I believe a fizzle isn't instant. It doesn't hurt anything to add it in anyway - if you don't fizzle, you will still be casting the Quie when the second one tries to fire, and the macro will end at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You could cast Q first, then canniV. I do. With SCRM I almost always heal up to full, even though I cast Q before canniV. I do, however, cast canniV as soon as I see the Q buff icon appear though, so I don't waste a tick of Q.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, yes, you are correct -- you need to pause for the full length of the spell casting + the delay to avoid the spell time recovery not yet met message.<br />

<br />
I think that the fizzles are intended to be instant, but don't always work out that way due to lag.  In most situations, I get by without any of the pauses, but you are certainly correct in that it doesn't hurt anything to have them in either.  So, revised the macro might look like this:<br />
<br />
/pause 35, /alt activate 47<br />
/g HEY!  Read this message, clerics and druids, so that you are not watching my health bar drop rapidly and pounding your panic heal button like a madman!<br />
/pause 15, /cast 3<br />
/cast 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I get this occasionally just clicking a non-custom button for Can5 then clicking the spell gem for Q.<br />
<br />
I never checked though to see if my beneficial spell haste effected can5... It is listed on Lucy as a beneficial spell though but haste of mith (my spell haste) is a min 3 seconds so it should not effect Can5.<br />
<br />
I currently have qb3 (50% buff which effects Q) and haste of mith for spell hastes (20% on beneficial which effects Q and should not effect can5).<br />
Casting time on Q is 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
They added something to fix using can5 to bypass recovery times (was a bug on it before that if you used can5 all gems would ungrey).<br />
Since then spell recovery time not met happens occasionally...<br />
Not overly bad but they should fix it.<br />
<br />
Also get recovery time not met quite a bit on my chanter trying to tash multiple mobs. He does have detrimental haste.<br />
<br />
I would guess their delay timer on it is not quite accounting for spell hastes perfectly.<br />
I doubt we will see a fix any time soon though.</div></div><hr />
