<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was lucky enough to tag along on a HoT raid tonight (my first time there), which was run exquisitely by Cromondas of Fellowship of Valor.<br />
<br />
I have never felt so useless in all my playing days. We were there for 5 hours, and I had more resists on Malosini/Slow than I could count. If I had to guess, I would say I was able to slow about 15% of the mobs we faced. I practically blew 80% of my manna each mob trying to land something. Talk about depressing.<br />
<br />
I am level 59, and the mobs were all being Tashed. I can only hope things get better at 60.<br />
<br />
On the positive side, drops were super (course I didn't win any, but... :)<br />
<br />
5 hours: 6 Silk, 4 Chain (incl Tunic), 3 leather, and 7 Plate (incl Breatplate). From what everyone was saying, that it a lot.<br />
<br />
Oh well, had to vent. Off to put a Band-Aid on my cani-dance finger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow! That's a lot of drops in 5 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I feel your pain. Really, I do. My first couple HoT armor farming trips was the same way. I was only level 59. Bounced slow, malosini, etc etc all the time. Many times got me killed. So i threw down some leveling action. Got level 60. Malo combined with tash = win!. You should be able to get in a slow with malo and tash on most of the mobs in HoT with just those two. If you are lucky and have a bard along (bards make HoT farming MUCH faster and easier IMO) then they can OOS the mobs to make it a bit easier on ya. <br />
<br />
Just feel lucky you aren't in the same position in west ToV. Those normal wurms and stuff are a real pain in the ass =/ Sometimes I cant get em slowed with malo, tash, oos all in hehe. Oh well :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Malo is almost a MUST for HoT. Without Malo, you will bounce SLOW most of the time. However, with Malo, I land slow on most mobs before Tash even hits the mob.<br />
<br />
Braxton</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">blame the Bard <br />
<br />
its always a great idea to blame them <br />
<br />
HoT is doable w/out malo    you just need a bard who knows there role<br />
<br />
lvl55 bard with OOS and tashi stick will work wounders for landing that slow with out mala/malo<br />
<br />
yes tashi stick stacks with enchanter tash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">malo makes life a walk in the park. it gets 10x+ easier at 60. don't worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">malo makes life a walk in the park. it gets 10x+ easier at 60. don't worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thats alot of drops in 5 hours,<br />
<br />
In my experience level doesn't have much to do with it.  Let me qualify that with, having a 60 bard, a 60 enchanter, and a 60 mage to mala, I didn't have any problems slowing at level 57, 58, 59 or 60.  We also had a 54 shaman that often got mobs slowed before I did.  <br />
<br />
Of course having malo helps alot, and you have to be 60 to have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What was amazing is that with all the resists I got , and we are talking 6, 7, or 8 before I gave up, I never once got aggro. This Pally Cromondas was amazing when it came to holding aggro and tanking.<br />
<br />
When he said there was no one to cast Malo, only a Tasher, I asked when I should try to slow. He said right away. I figured that was a death sentence for me (bounced slows while mob is still at 99% health)... but again, he held aggro. I never once got aggro with all the resists... I thought that was amazing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the encouragement and motivation to get to 60. Got Malo in the bank, just need to get 3 more yellows in the experience bar ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When in HOT, how many people use a Monk /Warrior / SK / X with a J-mans stick to tash the MOB?<br />
<br />
Was wondering about Tashicide for chanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a thought for you if youre ever in that situation again instead of bouncing Turgurs all night and feeling useless why not just load up insidious decay and plague of insects ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">in hot a jstick is completely unnecessary. chanters can tash, malo will land, and if you have a half decent tank, they won't die from it.<br />
<br />
on the 2nd hand, if you want a tash stick, i suggest giving it to a bard. bard duel weilding tash orb and tash stick and playing oos is some fairly nice MR lowering. plus they can dex buff themselves nicely to land it :D oh. and last benefit to the bard getting these items, is that you don't take a useful melee outa damage dealing. bwahahhaha!!<br />
<br />
on disease slows, you may get agro from those, even with a pally chain stunning/tanking. but they are better than nothing, and a good tool to use. most shamans i know in hot use them on the totally MR drakes. the shimmers i'm fairly sure, not 100% tho, but i think those are too MR to even bother normal slows.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope that helps</div></div><hr />

When in HOT, how many people use a Monk /Warrior / SK / X with a J-mans stick to tash the MOB?<br />
<br />
We do HoT with no enchanter, so I depend on our warrior and bard for my tash.<br />
<br />
We often make due with just malo + occlusion of sound + malosini, sometimes I can slow before tash procs.  <br />
<br />
Pretty much all of us have tash sticks, I remember on one really resistant mob I had bard, rogue, druid and warrior all beating on it with sticks/orbs trying to proc.  heh.<br />
<br />
Good advice here, work with your bard, they can make your life a lot easier.  Glad you didn't get agro and get splatted all night, sounds like the Pally was good at his job.<br />
<br />
PS - Since they fixed/nerfed the disease spell agro, I can do insidious decay + plague of insects right on top of one another with no agro issues to speak of.  The only mobs in HoT that require that are the drakes that have &quot;butterfly&quot; wings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for the advice all... great place to turn when you need to vent and learn :)<br />
<br />
I tried Plague of Insects, but without Insidious Decay...  Good advice Arorot. Thats why I keep coming back here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I know how you feel, I had a good case of the Malo-deprived blues on our Thursday ToV raid. :(  I was the only shaman for the first couple hours, and I dont have Malo yet, and couldnt land a fekking thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">some numbers fyi:<br />
<br />
malo -45 mr<br />
mala -35 mr<br />
tash -40 mr<br />
bard occlusion -25-35 mr i think<br />
jstick from bard -20 mr<br />
orb from bard -30 mr<br />
<br />
no spell is magically better than the other except for it lowering more MR, allowing you to slow easilier (if you understand what i mean). tash+occlusion+malo usually makes it rather easy to slow. it also depends on the mobs' level, lvl 60 raptors/drakes are cake to slow, while vehement wyverns and burning guardians are very hard.</div></div><hr />
