<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks for the recent patch including the minor healing change. Although the changes bring the Shaman healing back up to the 100%/60%/47% ratio, the vast majority of shamans will never see the GoD spells leaving them with 1400hp HoT &amp; 1300hp heal. With this in mind, I would like to ask a few questions.<br />
<br />
1) Are the developers still looking into Shamans?<br />
<br />
2) Was the healing patch just the first of a few patches for shamans?<br />
<br />
3) Is 'Slow' being looked into regading how mitigation effects Shamans compared to Beastlords (Shaman Hybrid??) and Chanters?<br />
<br />
4) If Shaman 'Balancing' is still in progress, could you give us any insight into what you are looking at? <br />
<br />
I am sure many shamans are thinking along similar lines, and we would all appreciate your thoughts. <br />
<br />
Many thanks again for the Q change and your anticipated reply.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cosidering the change in Q this patch was good for all shaman GoD or not.  Although it wont make as much a differance as we had all hoped for its better than nothing and shows that soe is atleast listening.  I can say however that it is verry unlikely you will see any further changes in our healing lines.<br />
<br />
as for slows they did state that they are still looking into mitigation and such so well just have to wait and see on that one.  It is a dificult area for them because mitigation is necessary to keep many mobs from being trivial but still keep slow usable, its effect on class balance is simply adverse side effect.  Overall i wouldnt expect many other changes to take place...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm just still having a problem with the percentages that SOE seems to think that healing is balanced by.  With the numbers the way they currently are, if you had TWO shaman in a group they still could not heal as effectively as a SINGLE cleric.<br />
<br />
I just want someone to explain to me how that makes any kind of sense.<br />
<br />
Yes, the change to Q is nice, and most shaman will agree with that.  Im still convinced that the changes made were not enough.  My heals are a joke in almost any situation.  That includes 'trivial' content situations in PoP that Im still working through, so its not trivial to me yet.  <br />
<br />
All that aside though, it is still mind boggling to me that two priests of one class, when working in tandem, CANNOT even MATCH a single priest of another class in healing.</div></div><hr />

Quite interesting that many shaman think that 50 HPs per tick make a difference anywhere. We are very easy to please. Actually I couldn't care less about this change. Quiescence healed up my Canni5 damage before (6 ticks), and that is the main use of it while fighting mobs hitting for 1k. In the time Q heals 350 damage, the tank can easily take 3k damage. Easily.<br />
About the 1550 HP quick heal implemented: It's a good thing that they removed the useless disease dot. And giving us this quick heal puts us relatively at the point where we were in PoP (SoE percentages). But the question remains as asked above: Are those percentages any good? Is it a 'good thing (TM)' that each group in the harder trials MUST have a cleric as main healer? Is it a 'good thing' that you better take a druid as secondary healer or even a paladin than a shaman (they offer far more options, especially with another slower class in the group)?<br />
We still have to hear what SoE thinks of our 'place' on those GoD trials and even further on.<br />

<br />
I could personally give a damn about getting a faster slow.  That spell is what has caused all the problems.  I would like a faster malo.  But whats the cleric bitching about?  They have big heals to offset mob damage.  If they cant keep their tank alive without slow they need to get a better tank.  <br />

Yes, Im getting bitter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i fully agree that we need a faster Malo. it's impossible to malo/slow with how fast/hard mobs hit these days. while doing normal LDoN's no malo and only slowing is fine, but doing hards and GoD require malo (at least for me) to increase the chances for a successful slow, especially with multi pulls.<br />
<br />
i feel as though our slow casting time is reasonable though. malo is my only issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Either lower the cast time on Malos, or ideally just make Nihil be a malos+turgurs combo in 3 seconds. keep the duration where it is to make it more suited for groups and fast paced action and less for boss fights, and change the mana cost to like 500 or something.<br />
<br />
So you'd wind up with -55 mr check 75% slow for 500 mana, same recast as turgurs. and 1.5 min duration.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">a charmable mob that does like 5 times the DPS of a time geared rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Let me say this before i state my opnion.<br />
<br />
My point of view on this is from here:  I have GoD but wont be doing any trials or expeditions any time soon as i am still working on PoP to get EP flagged, and working on LDoN to get everything that i want.  I simply dont have time for GoD atm.  I wont be seeing any of our spells from there for a long time (well a cpl months).  I have all my current spells through lvl 65(aside from GoD).  I know this to be the same point of view of many of my other shammy friends.<br />
<br />
OK now here's my opinion (and suggestions)<br />
<br />
1. /agree on making malo(s) faster casting.<br />
reason for:  as the mobs get harder it becomes more and more needed to malo(s) them before slowing.  But with the higher DPS lower hp mobs landing slow at anything lower than like 95% health is usless as they die so damn fast most of the time.  <br />
<br />
2.  change the resist check on slow (turgurs). <br />
reason for:  using an LMM raid as my example here.  the damn protectors are almost impossible for us to slow even after sinia and tash, BUT a beastlord (i am not sure if their slow resist is different than ours or they were having an EXCEPTIONALY lucky night)  landed slow almost EVERY time w/o much prob.  That is not right that the ability that we were givin, and are supposed to accelorate at can be done almost better by a hybrid class.<br />
<br />
3. Throw the non hard core GoD shammies a bone here on the heals.  Q was nice but like i saw posted here already, Q before the patch healed cann5 fine.  Suggestion:  maybe lower the mana cost on our 1300 hps fast heal(tnarg's mending)?  or make it a LIL faster like 2.5 secs or something that way it is a FAST heal (maybe to offset the 'unbalance' this might bring, make the mana cost 500? and the recast time a touch longer?).<br />
reason for:  well, a 3.75sec 475mana 1300hp heal just......sucks.  i dont quite know how to word what i think about this, its been running around in the back of my brain though. Just seems like a nice idea though.  If we arnt ever goin to be able to heal as well as a druid/cleric, and beasts are taking over our corner on slowing, then at least a true FAST heal would be cool :) .<br />
<br />
Just a cpl of rambeling suggestions.  hope that someone reads this and agrees :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">don't make any heal under 3.0 cast time unless you're going to make it 2.0 or less. 40% beneficial haste with my fennin belt and BoR = 1.8 second cast time on a 3.0 spell.</div></div><hr />

(Sigh)<br />
<br />
I really do miss the fun EQ brought me. Shame it has mostly gone away. 5 years is a long time. And while I will always cherish the memories that I have from this silly little game, the reality is that it is now in the hands of people who care less about making a world than making a deadline and a paycheck. <br />
<br />
I like arcade games. I really do. Nothing can be more fun than a quick romp through a game world getting some visceral thrills. But EQ was always a game for the hours not the minutes. And in the new framework of semi Twitch gaming. it loses all sight of what made it great. <br />
<br />
We have encounters now, rather than a sandbox. And that makes me somewhat sad.<br />

Yea that hope is fading fast at this point eh ? I mean a 250 extra heal...   Its a joke the more i think about it.<br />
<br />
The HoT upgrades are ok, i mean if your really healing that much in GoD im sure you can find your way to BoT, which isnt bad. But any PoP tier 3 zone and up to GoD, this quick heal is ****e.</div></div><hr />

I agree with most of the stuff you say but don't exagurate too much it takes away from your credibility.. I can be main healer w/o any mind buffs and main slower in almost any makeup of a group in bot+ except for worthwile god areas..</div></div><hr />

Just FYI  BoT doesnt not = Bastion of Thunder.<br />
<br />
Start main healing in PoE and GoD with no mind buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, so we had a planned healing percentage compared to cleris and druids.<br />
<br />
do you not think we had a planned DD and DoT percentage?  something that we know is out of wack, given lv 65 and AA?<br />
<br />
but do you think the SoE boys will ever give us the percentages again?  live in your own little world.<br />
<br />
the guy that asked for a sticky on SoE quotes was good AND bad.  We all get to know our class, and we get to beat SoE over the head with facts when they screw us.  but, they don't seem to like to be remined of what they say.<br />
<br />
we are on the 5yr plan now.  Sony will not tell us what the nuke and Dot percentages to other classes are.<br />
<br />
on Debuffs they will just quietly nerf us, as there is no comparison.<br />
<br />
get used to it folks.</div></div><hr />
