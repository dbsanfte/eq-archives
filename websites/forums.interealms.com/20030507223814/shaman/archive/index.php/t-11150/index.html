<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiegar Dar`Grunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like it, it uses default skin so theres less lag, simple, uncluttered, /viewport'able. Before I download it... Does it work with the LoY patch?</div></div><hr />

How come when i use that UI and try to bank, the bank window does not show up?  I tried downloading and using a bank window, but it doesnt show up still.  other than that i love the ui, clean and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can always try my UI if you want. http://www.starpixel.com/eq.asp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">leoice,<br />
<br />
i love your UI, but that very prominent destroy button scares me to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Leeoice's UI is mostly my UI with fancy graphics added. He did change or adapt other windows though.<br />
<br />
I have modified my UI further since his UI creation. I combined the player and group into one window and changed a few other things, but it's quite obvious that he used my UI for most of his.<br />
<br />
He did a nice job of making it look 'pretty' though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would recommend downloading them seperately.  Goto eqinterface.com, and download a Player Information window that you like.  Then downlaod a buff window that you like, and drop both of those together in a UI folder.  Just that simple.<br />
If you get one that is the complete set, you are bound to get some non default stuff that you don't want, and ends up taking valuable realestate on your screen :)  <br />
2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use icy blue. BUT you can arrange the windows to make your screen window-free. Here I use /viewport to block the bottom part of my screen. I love it. the eq window is 1024x575 so a little less than 200 pixels for all the ui information.  I also use someone else's spell icons but darned if I can remeber where I got them..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">speaking of viewports how does that work?  I've noticed people talking aobut themin several different boards I peruse and would like to know how /viewport works</div></div><hr />

I use a heavily modded version of Telgar's Icey Blue UI, patched and working with all of the latest updates. I've kept it simple to give the most viewable area but it conatins all the essentials and then some.  <br />
<br />
The screenshot is in 1280 x 1024 but it works just as well in 1024 x 768. Any smaller and you'd most likely have to delete a chat window or 2 but it should still fit.<br />

<br />
You can download the Zip file HERE (http://www.speakeasy.org/~overshoe/Shaman%20UI/)<br />
<br />
Installing it is easy. Unzip the files into a folder named ModA in your  uifiles folder. Rename and the UI_Character_Number.ini file to your character name and server number and copy it to your main EQ folder. Load EQ and enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Skitzoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like your ui, yel. It's one of the better ones I've seen in awile. I'm going to install it when the servers come up, but it will have to be in 1024x768 because I'm too blind now for anything smaller. One question, though, is that box to the left of your chat boxes a hits window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yelara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes - I keep it small since I use just numbers for hits.</div></div><hr />

:) Any chance you or someone can post a JPG of this? That BMP is a monster to download, and I haven't been able to get it yet.</div></div><hr />
