But it takes 2 weeks to decide whether it is appropriate or not.  2 weeks to listen to other classes complain.  2 weeks to finally decide to balace test it.  2 min of coding to change the spell.  3 weeks on the test server.  8 hr patch on live server patch day.  3 more patches in the next 3 days to repatch the patches and revise the spell.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I fail to see what was so bad about any of the chat clips that Henora posted.  I see a lot of pissing and moaning about how it looks even worse now and a lot of people talking about cancelling preorders, but Gloriana is the only person to give a list of what was wrong, and even her post is a little brief and undetailed.<br />
<br />
I will conceed that the leadership abilities sound a little annoying.  It's bad enough fighting over what theme to do, and fighting over who gets to be leader does sound like a pain in the ass.  On the other hand, the group leader is usually the one who has to deal with the pain of doing /who all 65 lfg and then sending out 20 tells to fill the group, while everyone else sits there and plays gems.  If they get something extra, so be it.  I'd like to see what sort of abilities these are before I start complaining.<br />
<br />
As for the disease dot, we'll just have to wait and see.  They know we think it sucks, there is no possible way for them to not know.  If they let it go live, it will be a slap in the face (I've never used that term before on these boards).  It wasn't brought up in chat tonight though so I will leave it there.<br />
<br />
As for the ancient spell, it sounds not good.  If it is just like ancient spells in luclin where you need to kill seru or VT mobs to get it, it will be bad.  If the ancient spell was a new dot or a new avatar, like it was in luclin, it wouldn't be a big deal.  Uber players would do slightly better damage or have a slightly better atk buff - that's fair because getting keyed for VT sucked hard and those that did it deserve a cool little bonus.  However, the new canni is a much-needed upgrade that every shaman is starting to desperately need at this point.  If it is as hard to get ancient spells in GoD as it is to get them in Luclin, that's just unacceptable.  If they drop in a place where uber players get them first and then they quickly trickle down to casual players, that would be fine.  That was how it was with pop and before long, everyone had their spells.  Remember how people whined when PoP came out about how only raiders were ever going to have their 65 spells?  Well, now everyone has their spells (if you don't, it's b/c you either just hit 65 or you just haven't been trying).  Luclin is regarded by most to be the worst expansion ever, and I doubt they are going to be modeling GoD after it heavily.  Don't get upset about ancient spells until you really know how hard they are to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">That's the bad stuff.  I also liked some of the things I saw.<br />
<br />
&lt;jtroy&gt;No, the items in GoD will all be dropped or quested.  The instanced zones will just allow multiple groups to experience some of the same content without blocking each other out.<br />
<br />
How is this bad?  It sounds awesome to me.  How many times have you tried to do a quest or camp an item, only to find out someone else was camping it?  Also, he says all the items are dropped or quested.  That means not having to do 23 adventures just to get a 20/20 upgrade.  This makes me very happy to go back to the only way of hunting and killing named mobs rather than LDoN.  It's just more exciting to know that at any moment the mob you want could spawn and drop what you want, rather than having to look at your ldon stats and say &quot;ok, 23 more adventures and I get to buy an aug.&quot;<br />
<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; The tribute system does not allow for no drop items to be turned into Tribute Masters for favor points.<br />
<br />
This makes me feel a lot better about destroying all the ornate, ssra, and VT loot that I upgraded.<br />
<br />
&lt;RBarker&gt; A few of the spells will be drops directly off of mobs, while there's also a few that will be available via a pop style turn in quest.  Although there's one spell per class, per quest, so you won't have the repeats like you did in PoP.<br />
<br />
Not having to deal with dupes in GoD makes me so happy that I could cry.<br />
<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; We have provided functionality to add and remove group or raid members after the instanced zone has started up to a point.  Once you get passed a certain point, you will no longer be able to.<br />
<br />
Sounds good to me.  I hate doing LDoN raids because by the time we are done, we're usually missing a full group because people have gone LD, or just can't fathom the fact that LDoN raids take 4 hours, not 1, and had to leave early.  I can understand having it so that after a certain point people can't be brought in, and I like it.  When my guild does time, we have more than 72 people.  The people that show up late or volunteer to sit out to make room for a needed class get RPs (our DKP, basically) and are allowed to bid for items.  If they win, someone gates out of TimeB and the winner from TimeA comes in and loots the item.  This is fine in theory, but it gets abused.  Some people always volunteer to sit out, and then spend the next 7 hours watching movies and just keeping an eye on their EQ screen while accumulating as many RPs as I do, and they have the same chance at loot as I do.  It made me very mad when I lost on a Time's Antithesis to one of these people. /rant off.<br />
<br />
&lt;jtroy&gt; You can gain xp at a much faster rate nowadays than you could when PoP was released.  The increased group bonus, higher zone mods, and availability of high level NPC's all mean that you can gain AA's much faster now.  The higher cost reflects that.<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure about this one.  LDoN exp sucks pretty bad, and if GoD exp is on par with LDoN exp, the increased AA cost is not justified.  However, if GoD exp is as good as PoP exp, then I would agree with it.  If GoD AA's were as cheap as PoP and Luclin AA's, quite a few people (myself included) would max them in a week.  This way, it'll take me at least a month :)<br />
<br />
&lt;JMash&gt; The benefits you can expect to see from the Tribute system include effects that can be used to increase health and mana regeneration, vision enhancing effects, among other beneficial effects.<br />
<br />
If I can turn in useless junk I loot/make in exchange for free mana regen, I'm a happy guy.  I have no idea what the cost/benefit ratio for favor buffs is going to be, so I'll refrain from further judgement until I know.  It could be either amazing or worthless, but I'm willing to be it's somewhere in the middle, leaning slightly towards worthless.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Smed any word on community message boards for Everquest?<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; Absolutely.  We are going to be reopening the Everquest community boards on a MUCH broader basis in the near future<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; and the Devs will be around daily to answer questions on these boards<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; and they will be free<br />
<br />
I have a hard time believing that some of you are so cynical and jaded that you refuse to even consider that this might be a good thing.  I played DAoC for a few months, and they had a system with class leaders.  Every class had a message board, paid for by Mythic, and each board had a leader (who I think was paid by Mythic?).  Most of the leaders were level-headed, rational people, and their job was to listen to the complaints and suggestions from their class and consolidate it in to rational and reasonable suggestions which they passed on to the devs.  And, quite often, the devs listened.  Think about how good that would be for Everquest if they really put some heart in to it.  A forum where we can voice our concerns and have a developer listen?  Makes me want to cream just thinking about it.<br />
<br />
&lt;PCarrio&gt; There is definately equipment on Taelosia that is an upgrade to gear that can be found in time.<br />
<br />
Just like pop, there will be a trickle-down effect.  Casual players aren't going to get the best stuff in the first few weeks of the game, but everyone's equipment and power will improve.  It has happened every expansion.  Pickup raids kill all kinds of t1-t3 targets nowadays, and lots of droppable loot is available to anyone that can save money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It wasnt brought up because they refused to talk about anything other than Gates of Discord. They wouldnt address class issues. <br />
<br />
Personally, I was quite disappointed with the chat. They told us a lot of things we already knew, some inconsequential things like which races can be berserkers, and confirmed that the ancient spells are reality again and the raids in GoD are only for the ubers (Vex Thal and beyond). Leadership points have nothing to do with leadership at all - they're just another thing accumulated by those who play the most. Of the half a dozen questions I put forth, the only one Brenlo pasted was if GoD instanced zones would be timed and that answer was 'for all intents and purposes, no'....which sounds like a yes and no answer to me.<br />
<br />
I dont normally have negative things to say about SoE or EQ, but this expansion is sounding like it really wont offer much to the average player. Yay, new tradeskill interface on the 10th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The major issue I see with GoD for Shaman, is that Shaman are not receiving a single upgrade to any of their spells, except Ancient Chaotic Pain.  Our new slow is a downgrade in effectiveness with a tradeoff for being less resistable and quicker casting.  Our new DoT is worse than the majority of our high level DoT's, we don't even get a new heal as far as we know, no new DD as far as we know, the main thing I was looking forward to with Gates of Discord was Ancient Chaotic Pain, and now since I most likely won't even get my hands on the old ancient spells, I can forget ever getting this new spell.  <br />
<br />
So, basically every class gets an upgrade to their defensive and offensive abilities except for Shaman and we get a downtime reducer, in the form of an Ancient spell, yeah I am really looking forward to working hard for it...you bet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There has been nonstop whining and moaning on this board about every single scrap of information concerning GoD since GoD was announced.  People have had the same old rhetoric drilled in to their heads for months and months.  &quot;We haven't been upgraded since kunark&quot; - &quot;All these new spells suck&quot; - &quot;Shamans just aren't effective any more&quot;.  The same stupid arguments over and over and over again.  No one even has any new whines, it's just repetition of the same things that other people have said.  EQ players, for reasons I just cannot understand, have the innate need to believe that their class sucks.  Whenever someone comes up with some arguement that is complete BS but happens to sound good (&quot;We haven't been upgraded since kunark!&quot;) it gets repeated hundreds of times until people have heard it so many times they think that it is truth.<br />
<br />
All of this endless repetition of whines and gripes has turned this board in to the most negative forum I have ever seen.  I am honestly to the point of just abandoning this board because all I get back from it is negativity, like yours.  I am not quite there yet, though, so in the meantime I try to do what I can to force people to see that Everquest is not all doom and gloom.  I want people to look at all these things rationally, but appearantly that is just too much to ask.  There are quite a few people who are not content with things, and have stating good, solid reasons for their discontent - I respect the opinion of these people, although I disagree with them.  The vast majority of people, though, have no idea what they are talking about and just repeat what others have said, adding in their own cynicism and sarcasm.  It accomplishes nothing except further escalating the bad attitude here.<br />
<br />
No, I do not work at sony - I give them $13 a month, just like you.  If you think things are that bad, put your money where your mouth is and stop paying them.  Your words have no weight as long as you remain their bitch and keep giving them money.  I still love the game and will continue to play it.<br />
<br />
What are you so dissatisfied with?  Really think about it instead of just echoing what someone else has said.  When you play your shaman, do you feel underpowered?  Why?  Have you ever considered that maybe there is something you can do as a player to compensate, rather than screaming about how we are getting shafted when we really aren't?  In 250 days, 65 levels, 430 AA points, and 240 adventures, I have yet to feel that the shaman class is underpowered.  Why do you?  I've asked this many times but have yet to have someone give me an answer that wasn't a cynical half-ass or just a rehash of what someone else said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually Jinheim,<br />
<br />
I would rather have the option of saving points to buy a spell or what not. At least I know that I can do a number of adventures and get shiny bauble#1 or dottastic spell#2. One of the problems for me as a very casual player is getting hold of some of the rarer spells. I'm not asking for them to be put on vendors, but I do like the LDoN approach of being able to do enough adventures to eventually get that spell. Now it may take months but I know it is possible.<br />
<br />
At the moment I'm only able to play one night a week and the odd hour here or there when I solo. So I'm in the position of hoping that a partchement/rune drops and that I will the roll, and then if I'm really lucky I dont end up with a spell I've already got. As it stands at the moment I'm lucky if I see a parchement once a month.<br />
<br />
Now I know I can buy a spell if I see it in the bazaar and this I've done with Quiescence and a few other spells, but they aren't always for sale.<br />
<br />
I've no problem with workng for gear, but I do admit it's much more attractive for me if I know that I can at some point I can get said item under my own steam.</div></div><hr />

This is the kind of post we need more of.  Articulate, well thought out, and supported with good solid reasons.  I'd rather have it the other way because I play a lot more and have the ability to aggressively pursue drops with my guild, but I can see why you'd want it the other way.  Kudos for a good post, it warms my heart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Haledce beat me to a point.<br />
<br />
Anyway the leaving out of the LDoN adventure point system is a bad thing (tm) in my opinion. Actually i can do 30 adventures and know FOR SURE, i have 'worked' for something and get a reward. I fail to see, how not continuing that improvement for all players (though casuals may benefit a bit more) in GoD could be good.<br />
<br />
My (cynical) guess is, they were just too lazy to add more adventure point rewards and decided to go back to the old trusted gambling and hoping for a lucky RNG roll.<br />
<br />
The ancient news are scaring...<br />
<br />
Jinheim,<br />
<br />
complaining about the same old overused whines (and you may have a point to a degree) and then using the same overused counter-arguments ('learn to adapt', 'don't play if you don't like it' ....) sounds a bit hypocritical, doesn't it? ;) <br />
<br />
Has it occured to you, that maybe, only maybe some of the more reasonable complaints continue, because they aren't adressed by SoE?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ancient spells? Even you admit that this is a very bad idea. Whats even worse about it is that the one spell that all high-end shamans could use is the one being made an ancient spell. Apart from joining an ubber guild and being very last in line for getting that spell there isnt a single thing I can do about getting it. This &quot;clever&quot; design decision is even being made after a LOT of complaints here about GoD spells. And since they mentioned in the live chat that there will be zones that challenge elemental and even time-geared guild I think I know where these ancient spells drop. This is just not good enough for me and how you can say that we shouldnt complain (or whine as you like to call it) when getting fed stuff like that is beyond me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">There has been nonstop whining and moaning on this board about every single scrap of information concerning GoD since GoD was announced. People have had the same old rhetoric drilled in to their heads for months and months. &quot;We haven't been upgraded since kunark&quot; - &quot;All these new spells suck&quot; - &quot;Shamans just aren't effective any more&quot;. The same stupid arguments over and over and over again. No one even has any new whines, it's just repetition of the same things that other people have said. EQ players, for reasons I just cannot understand, have the innate need to believe that their class sucks. Whenever someone comes up with some arguement that is complete BS but happens to sound good (&quot;We haven't been upgraded since kunark!&quot;) it gets repeated hundreds of times until people have heard it so many times they think that it is truth.<br />
<br />
Amen to that! Every second thread started since the last month have been some whine about how much shamans suck and how awfully disliked we are by SoE developers.</div></div><hr />

     You probably talk about yourself indeed.Except saying everything is good and oh wait this is not really good ,but wait it will be ! You repeat everytime the same thing ,but you probably not notice (oh it's must be our fault ,we force you to repeat everytime the same thing  :(  ).<br />
<br />
There are quite a few people who are not content with things, and have stating good, solid reasons for their discontent - I respect the opinion of these people, although I disagree with them. The vast majority of people, though, have no idea what they are talking about and just repeat what others have said, adding in their own cynicism and sarcasm. It accomplishes nothing except further escalating the bad attitude here.<br />
 <br />
<br />
      Sorry but we're not parrot. We discut about a subjet and when is done ,we'll not explain again and again everytime. It's logic,we use the conclusion.You'll also notice that for some shaman ,english is a secondary language (like for myself) ,and they'll not make long  speech.<br />
<br />
      And about the The vast majority of people, though, have no idea what they are talking about and just repeat what others have said . <br />
<br />
You are pretty arrogant . hahaha . It's not only arrogance ,it's pur contemp.It's bad you're not enough lucid to understand how your presumption are ridiculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think things are that bad, put your money where your mouth is and stop paying them. Your words have no weight as long as you remain their bitch and keep giving them money. I still love the game and will continue to play it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
      I dont' buy their add on ,thank for advice but i don't need it. If i continu to play it's due to the verant's job ,not the sony's one.<br />
<br />
What are you so dissatisfied with? Really think about it instead of just echoing what someone else has said. When you play your shaman, do you feel underpowered? Why? Have you ever considered that maybe there is something you can do as a player to compensate, rather than screaming about how we are getting shafted when we really aren't?  <br />
<br />
       This discution is about GoD ,not only the shaman class.There something interesting about it ? WHAT ? We can camp item ? Are you joking ? Some very very minor point about raid ...ect ? Oh now i can't wait GoD ! I have fun just to imagine random generated zone like in ldon , or these so good zone like in pop ,ah DreadLand love !  No really it's promising.<br />
<br />
       Now about shaman ,i play in a small guild . We use ALL possibility of everyclass ,and i have not trouble like a shaman is always good in raid. Now tell me how, YOU ,so talented shaman can heal correctly ? <br />
<br />
ps: edited that paragraph ,good point salorm. <br />
<br />
<br />
In 250 days, 65 levels, 430 AA points, and 240 adventures, I have yet to feel that the shaman class is underpowered. Why do you? I've asked this many times but have yet to have someone give me an answer that wasn't a cynical half-ass or just a rehash of what someone else said. <br />
<br />
       Hahaha ,you have probably 8 to 12 topic about that ,but sure all these post are just crap and make by idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Ditching LDoN style instancing sounds great, I detest LDoN and its randomly generated McDungeons.  I want to see good dungeons with instancing to prevent overcrowding.  I hope that is what they are giving us.  Imagine Sebilis, Lower Guk or Sol B but with instances, yum!  Of course, these dungeons may or may not be that great  :D <br />
<br />
Ancient spells are fine by me.  If they are like Luclin ancients, I won't be getting them for a long time but so what?  So long as the spells are just upgrades to spells I have, rather than entirely new functionality, that makes me just like every other player in EQ.  Rogues in the top guild on my server do a little more damage on average than rogues in my guild, who in turn do a little more damage than rogues in less advanced guilds.  Why shouldn't spells be the same?  I think this is just a matter of perspective, because these spells are functionally identical to focus items.  Not many complain that a time-enabled shaman can do 10% more damage than I can because of their better focus items, but if you give them a spell with a different name that does a little more damage than mine do, people flip out.  Weird.<br />
<br />
Of course, I like many wish that we were getting better spells.  Personally, I'd love to get more rain lines and have the hard-coded rain resist removed and a better blast heal.  But I don't think that there was much bad news in the chat about GoD, other than the leadership system, which sounds annoying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Much love to Salorm, Jinheim and Valsavious. You are the light in the dark, the holders of the holy grail.<br />
<br />
Jin, how long have you been playing this game? Since Velious?<br />
You probably experienced most of your raid content *after* it was inflated due to a new expansion being out already up to PoP where you probably joined a Time guild that was pretty much in farm modus already.<br />
<br />
When you do LDoNs do you do normal setting?<br />
<br />
I am willing to bet 90% of your 240 adventures are normal wins.<br />
<br />
So now I'll tell you what. I have never whined about GoD. This expansion could be named S.T.F.U and I'd still feel the same about my class. <br />
The fact that this new expansion doesn't adress all the issues with the Shaman class, just like the last 3+ expansions, is the root of the problem(I am not gonna rehash what I see as crucial issues, since you don't seem to like people repeating them). Oh and if you are gullible enough to believe that expansions are not the time for adressing balance issues...<br />
<br />
When I happen to do a normal LDoN, I feel like a god with my 7k+ self buffed HPs and 7k mana, I really do. So what? How many times does somebody have to state that Shamans are very effective in a trivial environment?<br />
Now I do a hard setting and while I certainly have an easier time than an average equipped Shaman, I feel underpowered. <br />
There...I said it. After 5 years at the very top of the game, 513 days played, max AA's since october last year, having done well over 200 hard LDoNs, I feel underpowered. <br />
But more importantly, I feel underpowered on raids. Oh ya, I can cure my group and keep it healed, which healer couldn't replace me though?<br />
<br />
What happens when I try to switch to a damage centric role? I completely suck...<br />
What happens when I overaggro(which I certainly do faster than anyone else, thus I have to limit myself on what I do, feeling like a complete idiot), I die. <br />
At the absolute limit of abilities and power I can reach this expansion, I feel &quot;average&quot; at best. So who of you 3 is arguing that with me? Btw, don't give me the crap about what you do and how you are juggling 10 different tasks, because I know this class and game better than anyone else probably.<br />
<br />
My post is intentionally vague. I am not going to explain in depth what it is that makes us a below average class compared to others. Nothing I say will change your view(sup pink colored sun-glasses) and has been stated many many times by me and others. <br />
<br />
You do not play other classes to the extent you play your Shaman and that's why you are lacking any sort of credibility when it comes to discussing class balance, but unlike others who fathom the issues, you 3 refuse to think other classes have it better, guessing and assuming that when a Shaman is limited in whatever task, other classes suffer from the same limitations.<br />
<br />
Go read up Glori's last 2 post aout DPS in LDoN dungeons. Weaker than you thought, right?<br />
I'd like to see somebody parsing a Shaman's mana regen compared to, say a Cleric's or a Druid's over the course of an adventure. You'd be surprised, because you probably think we regen a lot mre mana than them. Many of the things that you *think* to know about class balance and other classes in general, are factually wrong.<br />
<br />
I'll leave you at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">because I know this class and game better than anyone else probably. <br />
How could I ever argue with the god of all shamans, the know-it-all of everything a shaman do? How?<br />
<br />
I do however say that do as you wish, play the game or dont. Order or not, your descision (sc), not mine. I will go my way and you go your way. You have said it in atleast 20 threads though. I bet the rest of the shaman community knows by now that the shaman of all shamans dont like what we have become.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Most of you have played this class alot longer then i have so i respect all your opinions.  As a 63 shaman my one thought is this:  After i join a group and buff everyone up, make my doggy, haste everyone nad malo/slow mobs that get pulled What is next for me to do?  Cast my new rain spell nope too many resist.  Cast spear of torment, yepper that is what i usually do for a huge 675 damage and with ID4 i can almost break 800 a pop.  Cant dot in LDoN they die to fast and in groups in PoV or BoT i might threw a DOT there way probably will more when i get to 65 with BoS and bane.  I can spot heal ok, i can kick ass healing any character but a tank, in bot or Pov 1300 hp heal really doesnt do a whole hell of alot to a tank taken rounds of 500+ per hit.  IF slow is resist the first time if tank has good aggro i'm fine but upon second resist i will probably die(with buffs i had 4200 hp)  but a mobs triple hitting me for 584 my 4200 goes pretty damn fast.  <br />
<br />
From my point of view shaman are lacking in these areas i posted above.  Are shaman the perfect class nope, are we the worst class out there nope, but we need some help in the areas of healing and stable DPS.  The game has changed alot over the yrs but shaman class has not changed to meet those changes.  The game is all about DPS and healing MT.  To me GoD does not help us in the 2 areas i feel we need the most help so i will not buy this expansion.  No whining,crying or complaining here just wont spend my money on it.<br />
<br />
I think part of the problem with high end game is with most classes9caster/melee/hybrid) upgrades in equipment affect them greatly.  My example is ranger or rogue, with an upgrade in equipment or a few AAs they great increase their potential to do their job which is DPS.  To me there isnt anything out there that makes shaman greatly improve our ability to do our job.  A shaman with maxxed aa and time gear still has to hit the same malo/slow button i do the only thing he can do better is survive the resist because he has more HP.  But u take a time geared rogue vs tier 1 rogue and u will see a huge difference in DPS.  I hope you can understand what i'm saying<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I frequently visit (pretty much every day) three different boards.  This one, mage compendium, and monkly business.  My first main was a monk - he's still around but I don't play him much any more.  I started up Shadrak (now 59 shaman) about 3 years ago.  Yes, three years ago and I'm still only level 59.  I played him with a warrior and a shadowknight.  I kind of burned out on that, so I recently started 3-boxing a mage/enchanter/cleric.  It has breathed new life into this game for me.  I'm playing three characters I've never played before.  I'm playing in some new zones I'd never seen before (Nurga, for example).  I'm able to 3-box adventures and win.  <br />
<br />
I'm not disputing that shamans have some issues that should be looked at.  But mages and monks are complaining just as loudly as shamans.  It's my opinion that end-game players of virtually every class complain about their class.  A lot of level-65 mages complain that they're underpowered relative to the end-game environment.  They're probably right.  A lot of level-65 shamans here complain that their abilities don't stack well on raids, and they're probably right.  A lot of monks of all levels complain that they've been hit too hard by the nerf bat, and they're probably right.  I check out the enchanter site runes.net, and many of them complain about what they can no longer do.  Yes, even enchanters complain about their class.  <br />
<br />
I don't have a single level 65 character, and I have played since beta IV.  I have a level 59 shaman, 57 monk, 56 druid, 56 warrior, 54 mage, 54 enchanter, 54 cleric, and 48 shadowknight.  You might sense a trend - the lower levels are just more fun for me.  I tend to get burned out on a class when the grind really starts to slow down.<br />
<br />
I've been in a couple of guilds, including one recently (Twilight Blades) that disintegrated.  That was pretty rough - I didn't realize how much I liked the people in the guild until that happened.  We had a lot of fun together.  The guild is still around, but a lot of people left.<br />
<br />
I've played my monk during the mitigation nerf; that was painful, let me tell you.  I leveled my warrior, ironically, before the recent improvements to warrior mitigation and taunt.  I haven't played him one second since those change.  I've played my shaman on and off over the last three years, through the ups and downs.  I started my mage with the intent to make use of pet canni once I reached sufficient level, only to have that ability nerfed before I even got there  :p <br />
<br />
My point in all this rambling is that I understand how many of you feel, about how your class sucks and that no one will do anything about it.  My advice?  Try a new class.  Don't look at it like you're throwing away all the time you've invested in your shaman.  Unless you play on Firiona Vie, you don't need to delete one character to start another.  This game can be surprisingly fun at the lower levels.  Take a small amount of money, like 5k, limit yourself to that much in the bazaar, and moderately twink a new character.  Go to new zones you never tried before.  Many of you (myself included) leveled in the original version (my monk spent a lot of time in the original pre-Kunark EQ leveling in Najena, soloing the ogre guards and Bonecrusher).  There's been a LOT of lower-level and mid-level content added in the last few years that many of you never saw, because you were already beyond that point when it was released.  <br />
<br />
It just sounds like a lot of people on this board are terribly frustrated with the state of the game right now.  Just like the mage boards.  Just like the monk boards.  Just like, to some extent, the enchanter boards.  Maybe you need to take a break; either from your shaman, or from the game as a whole.  These boards are so negative it's almost hard to imagine any of us even enjoy playing any more.  But I know I go home every night to check out my bazaar merchant to see if he sold anything.  I even sell words and runes for 3-5pp; I'd rather see someone get some good out of them than go to a merchant.  This game can be a lot of fun, if you let it.  But for some of you, it might be time to walk away from it.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">While I appreciate and agree with much of what Jinheim is saying, I do recognise that shaman need a small boost.  In LDoN hard, I get owned FAST with 5300 buffed hp and an 1150 AC with LR3 on an unslowed mob.  Generally, we get 2 mobs at a time with no bard or chanter.  I'll malos and slow the assist off of the MA and the ranger will try and root the add. Sometimes the mob gets through and on slow resists and sometimes with just mitigation I'll get owned.  On triple pulls we usually take a couple deaths at best and on quad pulls we wipe hard and fast.  Even when I'm not getting owned, I know a druid or even another cleric add more to the group than I do (except on buffs, we already have a bot chanter, a bot shaman would be more useful than me taking up space in the group).  On normal LDoNs I rock when we don't have another slower or healer and I do both, plus toss off a little DPS, keep FA up on 3-4 DPS characters.  Not many guys can top that, but with a cleric or druid, I'm really not needed (I might go so far as to say my group would be better off replacing me with a DPS class) if another slower, even a bard, is present.  Sure, when I shine, I shine huge, but my shortcomings are not really all that apparent unless you parse the spam.  I don't add much damage, I can't really CC much till ALL mobs are slowed and I don't heal as well as 3 other classes.  There is something wrong with this.<br />
<br />
My huge issue is that new can has the ancient label on it.  I need something like that so I can do more on normal advents and I need something else to help with hard advents because I die way too often.  I need something so I can chain nuke more on raids so that although I can't match the DPS on the wizard or mages of the world, I will be able to nuke more often to attempt to make up the gap over time.<br />
<br />
For the love of God, we've argued the issues to death.  There is some very good proof, quantifiable proof, on this board showing everyone exactly what I've just stated from my personal experiences.  The only thing that can possibly cause any disagreement is either people are ignoring the proof or people have different expectations of the shaman class.  Anyone who is boting their shaman in favor of another class should not speak up against the need for an upgrade because their playstyle supports the argument for a boost.  I like the new slow, but without the new cann, I don't see the boost in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">First, I'll just send my thanks to Giac for saying what I truely believe.  I do believe that shamans are a great class, and although we have some problems that even I admit, we aren't as bad as you make us out to be.  We weren't made to be a pure dps class, therefore will never get those abilities.  We can pour on the dps if needed (I've parsed 300dps in a soloing setting before), but more than likely, we will always be designated as pure debuffers, and anything more than that is just fluff.  Without having parsed it, I still think that in a the course of a god fight, I can still do about 180 dps without pet.  I don't know about you, but that's more than our druids and clerics both do.  They may have better buffs, but I'm not going to complain that they are in the CH chain or ramp chain as opposed to me having to do it.  I'll take my debuffing and then damaging over having to heal anyday.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the main point i wanted to bring up, is that there is alot of things about the tribute system that will be very nice.  For 150 pp, you can get an extra 50AC, 150hps, faerune, affliction haste IV, and BA4.  The abilities will be avaialbe for very very cheap.  I think that there is some very good potential for this system so far.<br />
<br />
In regarding ancient spells, well, the main complaint that the reason we needed a new canni, was cause all this gear has so many hps and mana that we needed a new one to compensate for how long it takes to get back up to full mana (it took me 5:17 to go from rezz to full mana/hp, and that was using horse, canni5 when it popped, and chaining canni4 with no other buffs).  However, if you don't have this gear with these massive amounts of hps, then you really don't need to worry about the new canni spell (no, i'm not saying that you really don't need it, just making a point as to the arguement about why we did need a new one).<br />
<br />
last thing, although our dps is sometimes suspect, I will never confuse myself as someone that doesn't try to up it as much as possible.  If I have spent the fight at 20m the entire time, then I will.  I will bane a mob even if it's possible that it will not run it's full duration.  I will cast slow on a mob thats at 20%, just to save the cleric a little bit extra of mana (but.. my slow is manafree so that's part of the reason).  I will use rains if I'm able to, sometimes even chaining both of them (i really don't see this problem with huge resists, sure sometimes one or more gets resisted, but the same things happens on some of our DDs).  I will chain VS or Torment, depending on what i'm fighting and what his hps are at.  Saying this, I do what I can do maximize my dps, instead of worrying that since the mob is so light in hps, then I shouldn't do anything cause it will be wasted mana.  A few seconds here, a few seconds there, makes a different to me.<br />
<br />
A lure slow would be overpowered if it was set up much higher than 60%.  Lure slow is going to be very nice for you pvps out there, although the duration is a bit short.  What it does give, is a chance to land that quick slow on something, and then worry a bit later about landing full slow on it (any mobs that give you alot of difficulty trying to slow will show this).  <br />
<br />
Honestly, if I was a developer and came to these boards to see what's being said, then I wouldn't change anything either.  A post that offers nothing but negativity is not going to make me think of changing something for the class.  Look at the monk boards.. have they gotten anything accomplished yet?  I do think that well thought out and articulate posts will do more than the constant ramble that is mostly prevailed throughout these forums now.  I'm kinda with Jinheim on his comment about thinking about not coming here anymore.  I'm not saying that there is another shaman forum to go to, but I would just stop reading anythign altogether.  There is so much negativity and name calling that these forums are barely readable anymore.  I left for a while, not cause I wanted to, but cause I didn't have the time to.  Now that I've started again, I almost wish I didn't.<br />
<br />
Come on, when I was a young shaman this site was my bible.  There wasn't a day that went by that I didn't come here and read for two hours.  I'd like to think that I've been as successful in game as I have only because of The Crucible.  I hope that someday we can get back to this.  1 year ago this website was a plethora of information.  So much good information was gained from reading it.  Now, you have to read it with a fine tooth comb to find anything worth a dang.  I hope that once the inital few weeks of GoD are out, we can finally come back together a be a real community again, instead of one divided.<br />
<br />
Anyways, last thing to say.  Sorry, Haliece bro, if I was still on AB then I would give you those spells, or at least keep an eye out for them for you (maybe you should move to maelin hehe).  Send me a tell sometime bro, I'm always on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">i wasnt going to relpy to this, most what need saying is said.<br />
<br />
GoD?<br />
hmm, yes there are some things that are nice like being able to swap poeple, new  loot, encounter etc. but thats not enough for me to buy this expansion.<br />
<br />
my discontent was here before GoD was anounce. the way i see it, things are generally heading to faster fights (it dies or you die usually within a few mins) for this the shaman is not equiped, we are equiped for long fights, long fights with mobs that have high hp and low dps comparatively.<br />
<br />
this is where we need tweeking, things like the new canni spell are a help, it gives us time to do more. other spells done this way will help too, so faster cast recast on slow/malo would help. basically most our spell just take to long to cast if we could cast them quicker this would sort alot of our problems.<br />
another problem i have seen is a lack of any new types of spell or ablility that alot of other classes got. (this is more just disappointing)<br />
one particular problem that has been dicussed is healing/slowing. the way i see that is that with slow and healing spell we should be near as effective as a druid in healing. this does not mean we heal the same, it means with slow and our heals we should be able to keep a tank up (on exp mobs (hard ldon, elemental)).  and i mean for more than 2 or 3 fights before going oom. it shouldnt be easy, no where near as effecient as cleric, but we should be able to do it. we are a priest class after all.<br />
i think just a few hundred hp to our healing would do it (1.5 to 1.6 k quick heal maybe, or 400/tick quin)<br />
<br />
but the main thing is that the shaman class is not what is was when i started 4 years ago.  We use to be more average between all skills our dots and nukes where just good, our heals ok, our buffs debuffs where good.<br />
now our debuffs are still good, our dots excellent for long fights,  but our buffs,healing and dd have faded, it is this unbalancing of what we where that i see needs correcting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>deadman1204</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I think it would be terribly wrong if shamans could tank ldon hards. If a priest class can have agro for a minute and not die, that means the mob hits the tank like a girl.<br />
I think shamans have kinda been put in a spot they cant get out, just like clerics. Slow/malo - always needed, no way around them, you MUST have a slower for a group at 65, no other way if you want to get any exp gain. Thus i think shamans have kinda been moving towards a 1 trick pony. Given, you can do alot more than clerics, more damage, lots of buffs, but with your absolutely godly group utility (slow)  sony probably thinks that they cant give you too much more.<br />
As far as ancient spells, i think they are great, as a melee i've had to deal with the idea since eq was released. Only the uberest of the uber get the best melee weapons, it makes no sense that every caster get all the best spells. It puts a sense of progression on the game. <br />
Just like how ldon items werent a good idea. People may like the ease of getting them, but this game is based on progression. If you can get everything easily, it soon loses fun. You envy high end raiders, but some of the reason anyone plays is the dream of achieving that. If a person can buy the expansion and get everything, it destroys the game. Many dont like not being able to get all the uber gear, but if anyone could, whats the point of raiding at all? And without raiding, most guilds would break down, cause thats why they exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Nice. Say, this tribut system, just an example: everyone can get the tribute points and get additional effects, like MANA REGEN as well. Little thing, perhaps, but yet another bonus for every caster. Our mana regen from Canni has been thrown in our face all the time, nevermind that over the time and expansions, every other caster class can now also rack up quite good mana regen. Now this Tribute system comes and this mana regen effect probably will stack with every other mana regen effect. And we still get crap spells and get ignored for what, our non-existand &quot;cutting edge&quot; in mana regen?</div></div><hr />
