Here's a [u]thread[/url] I linked to my guild forums stating &quot;I'm glad we didn't go PVP after all&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Currently the PvP system in WoW is worse than EQ's.  There's no reward system for honorable kills yet (no special discounts from vendors, access to special vendors, armor, weapons, etc).  In contested or enemy territory you can be attacked by anyone of any level.  You are only safe in your faction's lands unless you attack first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry man but you really are wrong here. Number one, it has not been dropped from the plans, only delayed and changed slightly. The &quot;dishonor&quot; may be changed, but the rewads for honor will help.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing people get wrong is, you are never able to be &quot;ganked&quot; unless you go into a contested area, and they are all 20 +. Also, most of the contested areas near your home areas are filled with allies, so you may get killed by a roaming enemy, but, they are usually put down pretty quick.<br />
<br />
Valgoth, untill you actually play on a pvp server, you would do well to refrain from labeling the servers, there is of course bnet kiddies as you say, but there is a hell of alot of normal folk like us who like a little fright.<br />
<br />
I have gotten &quot;ganked&quot; maybe 3 times total, in conteted zones all, mostly from not paying attention, but once by a party of alliance on their way through I didn't bother to con utill too late, and once by soem retarded high level rogue, he was like 40 and I was 24.<br />
<br />
It simply is no where near as bad as people make it out to be, and the fun factor is through the roof.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But you have to go into Contested areas if you ever wish to level beyond 20. <br />
<br />
Do you honestly think those who are predisposed to griefing will give a single flying f'ck about the &quot;Honor&quot; system that rewards you for killing things of appropriate levels? Or do you think they'll mainly focus on griefing anyone they can (primarily lower levels since they're easy prey) since they can do so without ramification? You're sadly naive if you think anything but the latter. <br />
<br />
And yes, the &quot;Dishonorable Kill&quot; as it related to PC's most definitely has been dropped from the PVP plan.<br />
<br />
Because we have several different threads on the same topic, I'd like to consolidate them here. <br />
<br />
Here is the current PvP server ruleset: <br />
Dishonorable kills <br />
-You cannot get a dishonorable kill for killing another player. <br />
-You can get a dishonorable kill for killing a lower level NPC. <br />
<br />
Honorable kills <br />
-You currently get an honorable kill for killing a similar level NPC. <br />
-In the future, we hope to add to the honorable kill system to provide for PvP rewards. You will be rewarded in some fashion for killing a similar level PC. You will not be rewarded for killing a much lower level PC. <br />
<br />
We apologize for previous statements to the contrary. We had planned on a PvP dishonorable kill system, but after basic implementation and analysis, the system was deemed restrictive and took away from the PvP experience, rather than added to it. <br />
<br />
In the future, we will provide more widespread announcements regarding any changes made to the PvP system, or any system that affects a large number of players. <br />
<br />
Tyren <br />
<br />
Regarding PvP punishments- <br />
<br />
From personal and professional experience working on games with PvP punishments, while such a system would seem to make it so that PvP occurs only between those players of similar level, historically, it opens up the possibility of exploition of the punishment system more than anything. <br />
<br />
PvP zones- <br />
<br />
World of Warcraft is separated into 3 different types of areas: <br />
Alliance <br />
Horde <br />
Contested <br />
<br />
Only if you are in a Contested or opposing faction area can you be attacked by a member of the opposing faction without your consent. In your own faction area, you must first attack a member of the opposing faction before they can retaliate. <br />
<br />
Thus this is a built in safety measure to ensure that lower level players are not being attacked. Once you are into level 20 and up, you will need to head out to Contested territory. <br />
<br />
[update] <br />
The misconception here is that a dishonorable kill system would protec new players. It would not, it would discourage PvP fighting and invent new ways to make life miserable for other players. <br />
<br />
[Update2] <br />
Taking a step back. The concept of a player dishonorable kill was taken off the table after analysis. <br />
<br />
It was mentioned in interviews and in the game manual, but the plan was since changed. <br />
<br />
We feel that the honor system that will eclipse the need for a PvP penalty system. If you can get rewards, and rank from killing a similar level character, why waste time killing lower level characters? <br />
<br />
I ask that players wait and see what the new system implementation is like before declaring it over. I dare say it will be exciting.<br />
<br />

<br />
In a nutshell, it was removed due to the ability of masses of lower level &quot;lynching parties&quot; to go out and find lone opposing faction higher level players and attack them or just disrupt their gaming session. The higher level player had no way to defend themselves without being subject to the Dishonor penalty. Reverse greifing, if you will.<br />
<br />
You'd do well to get your facts straight Mill.<br />
<br />
And I don't have to play on PVP directly to know what's up when I have close friends (and even relatives) who do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they implement the rewards system without changing the rules, it will only encourage high level players to prey on lower levels.  I imagine they'll limit honor points by level difference though, but that will not discourage preying on the weak in general. A PvP *should* discourage killing lower level players, because that behavior is clearly malicious and cowardly.  <br />
<br />
Blizzard only needs to think of a system that discourages (preferable to disallowing) killing lower level characters while allowing high level characters the ability to defend against groups of low levels without penalty that minimizes exploits. I've tried to think of some ways to do this, but the solution isn't simple.  However, it's completely feasible to create a system like this.  The system just needs some thought behind it, rather than giving up on it entirely and installing a reward system for unfair fights.<br />
<br />
I still have a level 28 character on a PvP server that I left, and I now have a level 14 character on a normal server I intend to keep as my main until the PvP is fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's a neat idea for regulating PvP play.<br />
<br />
If you kill X number of weaker players (say 7 levels lower than you) over a period of time, you are pursued and captured by NPCs that take you to &quot;jail.&quot;  In that jail, you stand trial by a tribunal of your faction and depending on certain values (how many times you've killed weaker players and been &quot;convicted&quot;, how many lower levels you've killed, how many opposing faction NPCs you've honorably killed, etc) they will either convict you or acquit you.  If you are convicted, you are confined to an arena accessible by the opposing faction as well as your own for an amount of time where you are basically a sitting duck and can be killed by anyone of any faction.  If they acquit, you can go back to doing whatever, knowing that the next time you stand trial, you have a higher chance of being convicted.<br />
<br />
Benefits of the system:<br />
- &quot;Player justice&quot;: PvP is still used to solve problems among the player base<br />
- The capture/trial system allows time for those being griefed to run away and find another place to enjoy the game<br />
- Players who regularly prey on lower levels will find themselves confined to the arena where they will be dealt with by more powerful opponents, hopefully<br />
<br />
Negatives of the system:<br />
- Defending high level players can be sent to jail and wrongly convicted</div></div><hr />

Tyren even pointed out where they dropped the Dishonor system. And the fact that &quot;They simply aren't going to punish people for killing somone lower level&quot; (your words even) will only serve to promote that very activity.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a battle.net kiddy gankfest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok Mill. Just went back and read my initial post where I did, in fact, imply the entire Honor system was dropped. My bad. However, without some sort of penalty for dishonorable infractions against lower level PC's, PVP will still be an unfun place for many people.</div></div><hr />

You don't really have to be on a PvP server to know whether the system is crap or not.  Taking EQ's system you could observe that PvP servers were always about a year or more behind the PvE servers in advancement.  That was because they were fooling around in the broken PvP system rather than consuming the expansion.  If you were in a raiding guild, you had a huge advantage over everyone else, since with high resists (or if you were a bard) you were immortal in one on one.  Gear over skill won most battles for equal level fights.  Also, you'd notice that the EQ PvP servers were the first servers to clear out once WoW and EQ2 were released, because people playing in the system knew it was utter garbage and would take just about anything else.  I think every Zek server is dead now with the exception of Rallos, and it's on its way down now.<br />
<br />
While the WoW honor system has always been in play, they currently do nothing with it.  And they need to punish people for killing lower level characters.  The reason there's an outcry about their reversal of that decision is: 1) they promised dishonor for killing low level characters on their site and in the game manual 2) by societal norms, killing someone non-threatening and weaker than you in war does have consequences</div></div><hr />

I have several friends who play PVP as well as a brother-in-law. I ask them frequently how things are working since I was originally interested in playing on a PVP server. Just because I don't play PVP now does't mean a) I never have, and/or b) I don't know the state of WoW PVP. I probably follow it closer than a lot of people who are content with PVE since I originally wanted to play under that rule set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So far at Level 24 on Frostwolf PvP server, I've honeslty had only one bad experience. And we were trying to find a fight, just found one that was too big and he corpse camped us a bit. I'm sure the jerks are out there for certain. I've probably just been lucky on the times when I play.  <br />
<br />
I've never did the whole PvP thing before, because I'm an older gamer and having some twit kill me that is 20 levels higher doesn't sound much like fun, but I do enjoy the rush of running into a contested zone knowing that there are folks out there to get me.  Anyway, it all comes down to what you like and don't like. I'm sure we are all getting what we want out of this great game. If they ever make game worlds like the intro movie....I might as well call the boss and quit work now!  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PvP is lots of fun in WoW and I love it.  If you're worried about being attacked when you're at a disadvantage then don't play on a PvP server.  So far I haven't seen any high-levels going around specifically preying on lower enemies, although I am sure it does happen.  I don't think it is nearly as rampant as people make it out to be, though.<br />
<br />
It's a war, so you can expect to be attacked when you're fighting a mob, corpse camped, ganged up on, etc...  If receiving and dishing out these things doesn't sound like a good time to you, then stay off the PvP servers.  I personally am having the time of my life.  I don't extensively grief people, i.e. corpse camp them until they give up and use the spirit healer, but I do try to give them a little bit of hell just to put the fear into them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have always been of the opinion that being ganked, ganking and even griefing and corpse camping people were part of PvP. I have no problem being ganked by high level people, it's PvP and a war.<br />

Thanks for the answers, I was under the impression that you could PvP on &quot;blue&quot; servers too, but I am thinking I will pick WoW up and start a character on a PvP server for when I want to chill. Any server recommendations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can you PvP on normal servers also.  Just hit /pvp and you can be attacked by anyone for 5 minutes until your flag wears off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see, interesting. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What people who have never tried PVP need to realise is that its really not that bad. I never considered myself a PVPer, but i managed to survive and thrive on Vallon Zek for several years. Sure, bad PVP will have you logging off in rage sometimes, but all in all i think it has had a marginal impact.<br />
<br />
The reasons behind my retirement has nothing to do with PVP either.<br />
<br />
With that being said, i still lean towards a non PVP server for the european wow release, much due to the fact i want to casualize my gaming. PVP can sometimes take up a lot of game time, and if im limited in my play time i want to be able to judge what i do with my online time. I simply dont feel up to it anymore, but if i had no choice id know id be able to live with it...<br />
<br />
But i think that people who have no experience with PVP should try it for a while before trying to judge what it is like. Not from being able to better discuss it on the boards, but to find out that it might not be so bad afterall...<br />
<br />
One thing that has struck me about the PVP is that we actually have a low ratio of trash on our servers. If someone is being retarded and a PITA, you gather your guild and chase him to the end of the world... On regular servers, you have no means of actually scaring off the griefer...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd say Mill is slightly more correct on how it is on a PvP server. Ganking isn't rampant, though it does occur. Then again we both play rogues which is the class that is the hardest to gank. I pity warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">ya melee classes have it harder for sure, well, warriors that is, they are the class with the least amount of tools to escape if that is what they want. hunters, pallies, rogues seem to be great pvp classes, and believe it or not, casters are a pain in the butt too, but warriors, caught, they are dead and useless, they need much, much more power.<br />
<br />
Biggest problem I have had with pvp so far is I get so caught up in the fun sometimes I forget what I am doing and 2 hours have passed :) The higher level you get too, the less people seem to want to grief.<br />
<br />
It isn't bad, really, but not for everyone.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Originally I was going to go to a PvE server 'cause I'd always hear about griefers and corpse camping and all that crap so I figured it's not worh the trouble. <br />
<br />
But then I played the FST and OB, and after playing that for a couple of weeks I realized that PvE would get rather boring after a while. Also I wanted to be able to fight Alliance whenever I saw one. <br />
<br />
The rush you get from PvP is just too good and I am so glad that I went onto a PvP server. Hours can just pass when you are PvPing 'cause its so much fun. I must have spend like 20h+ while I was like lvl 25 killing NEs in Ashenvale near Astranaar. It was awesome to gather like 10 ppl, although we couldn't kill the guards we did kill a lot of PCs. And slowly watch NEs build their army one by one then eventually rush us and kill us all. Then we'd all rez up and kill them ... was great!<br />
<br />
Also about the griefing/ganking/corpse camping thing ... while I have not really experienced that, it does happen. It's a small price to pay for being able to have so much fun IMO. <br />
<br />
I've been ganked a couple of times and it's usually cause I'm too lazy or let's say I see an Alliance mage and I dont feel like going after him, thinking he didn't see me so I just wanna finish this quest and move on. Next thing I know though, gettin nuked from far away by a mage 4 levels lower then me while I am half hp/no mana. So from then on I have killed and chased every single thing that I had a slightest chance of actually beating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">it is almost impossible to get corpse camped, btw. You can rez in a very large area, rez behind a rock/tree/hill, etc, or rez and run to a better rezzable spot. It would take a large group alot of effort to camp just one person even. Believe me, I have tried to on a real jerk off high level hunter, he always was able to rez and get away, he was smart :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I thought at first that PvE would be the way to go, and that PvP was for the b.net kiddie crowd.<br />
<br />
Was I wrong.  PvP is a blast, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  It changed the way I do things.  I look for hidden crevices to pull to, so I'm not fighting out in the open.  I have to swing around the camera viewpoint to look for approaching goody goodies.  There's a real rush when you say a similar (+/- 1 or 2 lvls) alliance (especially paladin!) and you stake them out and stalk and then kill them.  It's great.<br />
<br />
Is there griefing? Sure, I guess.  Although training is difficult in WoW and corpse camping is hard due to a fairly liberal area in which to res, and if worse comes to worse, you can take the spirit res and just escape.<br />
<br />
I play a priest and I think people look at priests as easy targets.  Had a 36 human mage in Shimmering Flats come up and nuke me hard.  I'm 32, so I'm already at a disadvantage, but with fear, snares, shield, I dropped him, and then camped his corpse for half an hour!  Killed him 3 more times.<br />
<br />
That'll show that bastard.  It was lovely.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Corpse camping in Shimmering flats is relatively easy as opposed to other zones because it is, well, flat and there's not a lot of geography to hide in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Let me chime in here with my experiences with PvP<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, WoW PvP is not the &quot;gankfest&quot; that you make it to be brother Valgoth. I play in exclusivly contested areas and on top of it i am currently playing in Tarren Mill which atleast on my server is one of the hotter spots on the land mass. There is people of other factions constantly running around and picking fights or not picking fights. PvP has it own rules nad you just need to learn them.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Alertness.  This is key in a PvP enviroment. I find its a hard lesson learned that you cant just sit back and relax at all times when your in certain areas. This is a fact, your on a server you picked specifcly for this reason, you wanted to be at war. Get used to it.<br />
<br />
2. Pre-engagment.  This believe it or not plays a HUGE role on to how you will be approached and dealt with. If you see a group of 5 or 6 alliance running around in a tough group, guess what.... they are hunting horde. Simply avoid them and 9 times out of 10 if you make a blatent effort to just avoid them, you will be left alone.<br />
<br />
Also a very important tool to PvP is the /wave command. This is a commonly understood interaction that will let the person your coming up on that you mean them no harm and are just here to quest like they are and even though your on PvP, questing is still a majority of what your will want to do unless your 60. So make it a point to let everyone know that you want nothing to do with it and your mostly ok, there is still people that will gank you and attack you, but your a horde FFS, your on a PvP server and want to kill alliance, get used to it or move to a blue server.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Pains of death.   The worst thing you have to deal with when you are killed by a PC is a short ( in most cases ) run from a GY back to your corpse. I find corpse camping is so minimal that only if your in the middle of a battle will someone camp you, mostly cause you killed them and they want revenge. Ghost mode is the best cause you can just afk on your corpse, grab a drink or something and wait till they leave, which is usualy 5 min or less.<br />
<br />
<br />
4.  PvP is PvP.  The only thing i can think of that is a &quot; gankfest&quot; that many people claim, is situations where you have to battle in opposing faction territory, but you dont have to do that quest for starters and number 2 i think its a blast. Some of the most fun i had yesterday was me trying to do a quest by TM. I had to kill some farmers and some alliance kept coming in and killin me. I put out the call in local defense and some horde started showing up and a small skirmish broke out. When the horde had control i killed some farmers for my quest and when they didnt i fought with my brother horde to gain the area back. Only thing i dont like is there is no reward for gaining that area back or killing another alliance. But the fun factor was through the roof. We were are war for real and my brothers had my back.<br />
<br />
Thats something i want to stress. They had my back. I find that these &quot; b.net kiddies&quot; are rare. I find that most people will run to my aid faster then i can type /y help.  Seriously, if there is a alliance chasing me, you can bet any horde in the area is coming over and helping me dismantle that alliance scum and then together we will partol the are to make sure its clear before we both move on in out own ways. Its very cool to just instantly bond with a complete stranger like that, get each others backs and then be on our ways with a smile and a wave when its over.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So to sum it up, i cant think of playing any other way but PvP now. I was hard core PvE in EQ and my friends cant believe im playing on PvP and much less loving it. I think if you give it a open minded chance you will like it, but i will admit that it does require a different mental state then a PvE server does. Its less relaxed unless you go out of your way to make it without conflict, but really, if you dont want the battles that bad, you should be on a blue server anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dig it, i cant ever go back at this point i think. but they do need to adjust some things and figure out some sorta real honor system. But im not about to go OMG BLIZZ SUCKS AND PVP SUCKS, simply cause it needs tweaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats my deal anyway.</div></div><hr />

No thanks. I'll stick with my &quot;carebear&quot; PVE server. I'm enjoying PVP under the PVE ruleset where it's my choice to engage. I've gotten involved in several PVP excursions on my server, but only when it served my purpose and furthered my enjoyment of the game. All of which have been in defense of my factions territory. I've never gone to the other side to pick a fight with lower levels, though that's what I've defended against on every occasion. Some higher levels coming to lower level villages to kill guards and wreak havoc on lower levels. If this had been on a regular PVP server it would likely have interfered with my evenings fun. However, since it was on a PVE server I at least had the choice to engage, rather than being involuntarily forced to participate in what was certain death.

We have a winner. I never again want to have to deal with the twits that come out of the woodwork like they do on pure PvP servers.  PvE gives you a choice. And the other player a choice. <br />
<br />
I for one like PvP when it is among consenting players. It is alot of fun, sure it might spread the excitement out some, you may not constantly be on edge like on a PvP server, butas I have gotten older I have learned that constantly being on edge detracts from my fun. <br />
<br />
I am playing the game to relax, to enjoy myself. Not to be the victim one minute then later on make someone else the victim as well. It is a spiraling circle of stress in my mind.<br />

I have never been griefed nearly as bad on these pvp servers as I have on the pve EQ servers by idiots hiding behind no pvp flag.<br />
<br />
My guild is comprised totally of 30 + year old proffesionals, many with families, and we totally enjoy pvp. It requires much more skill and balls then being sheltered because so and so is afraid of a 2 minute GY run. Oh no, your life was ruined!!!!<br />
<br />
Stop the insulting and maybe you will enjoy things a little more. What is it, half the population of wow is on pvp servers? it is fun, if you aren't afraid of your own shadow, and you speak from lack of experience which is even worse. You play on a care bear server, how could you possibly know what goes on?<br />
<br />
PvP on a care bear server basically is you attack when you have the advantage, well heck, what is the challenge there?<br />
<br />
Anyway, spend some time actually playing on a pvp server, past level 20, before you start lumping everyone according to your own fears and bias.<br />
<br />
Did you know that probably 95% of the time, enemies pass each other with a wave and continue on their way? As long as you aren't a big enough ass to hang in the real kill zones like stranglethorn.<br />

I have never been griefed nearly as bad on these pvp servers as I have on the pve EQ servers by idiots hiding behind no pvp flag.I never called &quot;everyone on pvp servers&quot; anything. I simply gave examples of the griefing that turned me off to pvp. <br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you have a guilty conscience Mill.<br />
<br />
Either way...I'll play the way I like and you do the same. Having fun is all I care about, and I certainly no longer care to debate the virtues of PVP vs PVE with an asshat like yourself. I clearly stated my position, and that it's a matter of CHOICE for me, yet you seem determined to impress upon me that it shouldn't be, and that you should be able to attack me (or anyone) at your leisure. Sorry, but f*ck you, won't happen!<br />
<br />
For the record, I'm sure most of the people on PVP server are, in fact, mature, responsible, and respectable gamers (though you're not really being a shining example of that segment of the population at present :p). However, it's the &quot;bad apples&quot; that tend to ruin it for everyone and soil the repuation of the more honorable PVP players.<br />
<br />
It's that smaller population that I was unfortunate enough to encounter, which is why I'm happy playing under the PVE ruleset. Accept it or not, I don't care.<br />
<br />
And &quot;no&quot;, I don't &quot;only attack when I have the advantage&quot;. Otherwise I wouldn't have died the 5 or 6 times I did last weekend while defending Auberdine. Likewise, I wouldn't have engaged that 39 Shaman last night when I was only 32. It's not MY fault the dumbass kept running around to the point he agroed guards in Darkshire that beat him down enough for me to get the final killing blow.<br />
<br />
I know what PVP is mill. I merely choose to engage in it differently than you do. Get over it.</div></div><hr />

Try as you might, you cannot claim that this doesn't happen, because it does, and we all know it. Some of us know from personal experience. That's not my definition of fun.<br />
<br />
It is statements like this that anger me.  And they most often come from prior EQ players.<br />
<br />
If you played on a PvP server, and you were in contested territory, and I came across you just as you finished killing a mob, and you were hurt:<br />
<br />
I would kill you without hesitation.<br />
<br />
Here are the (false) assumptions you would then make:<br />
1. I have no honor<br />
2. I am a sh!t stick<br />
3. I am an asshat<br />
<br />
That truly pisses me off.  Fortunately, I can kill people on PvP servers that piss me off :)<br />
<br />
When I kill you, it is NOT personal.  I don't even KNOW you, how can it be personal?  So quit taking it personally.  I killed you because you are on the enemy team.  I will do all in my power to stop your progress.  By allowing you to explore, quest, and level up, I am allowing your team to grow stronger because you are growing stronger.  I am not killing you because I'm mean spirited.  I'm killing you because that is the whole point of a PvP server: to grow strong, and prevent your enemies from growing strong.  Take it as a complement, if you will.  I think you are enough of a *potential* threat to my team, that I am trying to stop your progress.<br />
<br />
I will tell you this.  I play Horde.  If another Horde players comes across an enemy Alliance player, and could easily kill that Alliance player, but chooses not to, I label that person a traitor to the Horde.    And I have more respect for the enemies of the Horde, than I do for the traitors to the Horde.  And I am not rare in my thinking.<br />
<br />
You are right in that you need to be on a PvE server.  But you have no idea at all what true honor means until you have played on a PvP server.  Here is a big hint: Honor has nothing to do with fair fights.<br />
Honor is about keeping your word.  And I give you my word: if I see you, and I think I can kill you, I will try to kill you.  Every single time.  If I think you will win, I will try to get away.  Unless you understand what I'm saying I'd expect you to call that cowardice.  You need to understand that a PvP server is NOT about fair, 1 person vs. 1 person  duels.  It *is* about a massive scale war between literally thousands of people.  If you only want fair, 1 person vs. 1 person duels, go play chess or checkers, or a PvE server and just do duels when the mood strikes you.  There is no dishonor or shame in that, and I will not even call you Carebear because I find the term demeaning.  But there *is* dishonor and shame when you assume that because I kill you when you are 20 levels my inferior, that I must be some sort of social reject.<br />
<br />
I will not handicap my abilities just to make things fair, the way a father might do for his young son while playing basketball.  This is not family quality time, this is a PvP server.<br />
<br />
It's like two football teams are out on the field.  One of the people on the other team gets mad at me for tackling him when he has the ball, complaining because I am so much more skilled than he is, I should just let him score a few times for fun.  He accuses me of having no honor, of having no sportsmanship, of doing it only to be mean, of being a **** stick or an asshat.   He complains of never being able to get better when people like me won't even give him the chance to run a few yards with the ball. When the truth is, I am out on the field to WIN, not to let you do whatever the hell you want to do.  And the cold hard truth is you will get BETTER, QUICKER by having me go full force against you than if I held back.  I have enough honor to go against you to the best of my abilities.  If one day you won against me, would you want your glory spoiled by the fact that I held back and did not give 100%?<br />
<br />
So the next you think I'm doing it to get my jollies off consider this.  I played EQ for a long time and I always respected your posts Valgoth.  I did not post here much but I can tell who is an ******* or not from their words, and you are not an *******.  But your opinion of us &quot;gankers&quot; is very, very common.<br />
<br />
I would ask you to consider that just because someone uses everything at their disposal to win in a fight on a PvP server, including attacking you when you are oom, only 10% health, and you are 20 levels lower than them; they are NOT the sociopaths you think they are.  Just because you get ANGRY when that happens to you does NOT mean it was personal or that some sort of social degenate &quot;b.net kiddie&quot; did that to you.  Face reality: you were in a war zone, and made yourself an easy target.  To expect the enemy to leave you in peace is quite simply foolish.  Again, there is no shame in saying &quot;that's not fun for me&quot;.  But do not think that because it IS fun for me, that I am somehow less of a person than you are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">A very well thought out and well presented opinion Khulgore.<br />
<br />
The fact remains that I would rather play under a rule set where you CAN'T attack me &quot;just because you want to&quot;.<br />
<br />
Again, it's all about choice.<br />
<br />
Have fun engaging in all the PVP you want. I'll do the same, but only when I choose to.<br />
<br />
You choose to roleplay why you would attack someone while they're at a severe disadvantage. Fine. However there are some who seek out these opportunities as their primary means of engaging in PVP and enjoyment. Those are the &quot;asshats&quot; and &quot;prepubescent honorless jackasses&quot; I'm referring to.<br />
<br />
As I stated in my last response to Millman, it's the smaller population of socially inept dregs of society that I've had the unfortunate displeasure of encountering &quot;one too many times&quot;. Not always, but it was enough to sway my opinion of PVP systems (both current and former) to the point of preferring to play in an environment where I no longer have to concern myself with such individuals, and can enjoy my evening of gameplay at my leisure, doing what I want instead of being forced to defend myself when I'd rather be doing other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Khulgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Mill hit on a very good point.<br />
<br />
EQ had LOTS of PvP, even on the blue servers.  That is the whole reason so much griefing occurred.  People would kill steal, train, do anything to get certain spawns.  The competetion was over who got what spawns for guilds, and even in between players over who got the drop from the named mob for the quest they need.  Any time there is a limited, desired, resource - there will be competetion.  But in EQ, on the blue servers, most people were not playing by the same rules - and lots of drama was the result.<br />
<br />
That's because the PvP in EQ was under the table, and dishonorable.<br />
<br />
In WoW PvP, I am telling you up front, I *will* kill you on a PvP server.  I am open about it.  There is honor in our conflict.  Very much unlike EQ where I could go AFK for 10 minutes and come back to see someone had kill stolen the spawn I had been camping for 8 hours.  And there was nothing I could do about it.<br />

<br />
Well, if that was the set of rules that everybody expected on all PvP servers, then there would be no problem since all people considering starting a character on a PvP server would be making an informed decision. If that's the kind of gaming experience that they like and expect, then more power to them.<br />
<br />
The problem, as I have seen it secondhand, is that a fair number of people expect a different code of honor to be prevalent on PvP servers. They read posts like this one (posted on the E'ci server board by a well known and formerly active player who is now playing WoW on a PvP server):<br />
<br />
The thing is you don't have to PvP 24/7 even on a PvP server in contested areas.<br />
<br />
Also something to realize is that you have plenty of time to do your quests, and instances, and really you can get by a lot of the time without having to PvP unless you go out looking for it.<br />
<br />
and they adjust their expectation accordingly. They forget that the same person later wrote:<br />
<br />
Of course diffrent servers probably have diffrent types of players.<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Really it depends on what people are after, and how agressive people are.<br />
<br />
Then, when they run into people who practice full time take-no-prisoners PvP, they get upset and vent about it.</div></div><hr />

Sure you are, and lame to boot. You can roleplay a gank fest until the cows come home but it still boils down to being a bully. Justify it how you want, I don't really care, but don't expect people to change their minds.</div></div><hr />

You are too scared to face a human opponent, so try to elevate yourself as somehow above people who like challenge. Can you play baseball, or do you prefer T-ball where no one can be called the losing team? Do you wear a helmet when you ride a bike?<br />
<br />
You are scared of getting killed and a 2 minute run to your body, so you call everyone names, classic man, just classic. I enjoy fun and challenge, you enjoy fun and easy, no problems there, but quit with the name calling man, makes you look like the battlenet kiddie you so despise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You can roleplay a gank fest until the cows come home but it still boils down to being a bully.<br />
<br />
Well, an all out &quot;gank fest&quot; is arguably a socially useful playground, even if as merely an outlet for excess adrenaline. But again, as long as everybody on the server starts with the same expectations, there is no problem -- let them gank each other to their hearts' content. It's when different expectations collide that you end up with upset customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Clearly all linesmen in football that tackle the quarterback when he wasn't looking are childish gankfest kiddies that don't deserve to live, just like the battlenet kiddies that choose to attack you when you aren't fully prepared to defend yourself.  You don't give out a warning shout to the other team that you are about to shoot someone in the back in a game of paintball.  It's a war.  You don't go into a war expecting everything to be fair.<br />
<br />
If you don't want the risk of possibly being attacked at any moment, and don't want the ability to attack anyone else when you want to, then that's entirely up to you to not make a character on a PvP server.  But choosing to talk down to people that want to do this and call them names for enjoying PvP under a ruleset that everyone fully understands is in effect is just lame and your opinions don't even matter on the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Just wanted to share this with you.<br />
<br />
I played on my pvp server for about 8 hours yesterday. I quested and gained 2 levels and got ganked 0 times. I didnt even see a alliance player cept for the one that waved at me on the road as i was running by.<br />
<br />
Its all how you chose to play. I like being able to participate in the excitement when i want to. When i want a war ill go to TM and try questing there, cause its a known hot spot. When i want to be alone all i need to do is head deep into my own territory and if a alliance comes all the way in there, survives and still wants to gank me and kill me, he deserves the kill cause only a rogue in stealth could make it that far or a battalion of alliance.<br />
<br />
Point is this, we all play for different reasons and they are all good reasons as long as the day ends with this.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot; Boy was that fun &quot;<br />

But to kill someone at 20% health, and call it &quot;honorable&quot; seems silly.  You can call it many things - fun, expected - no, it doesn't necessarily make you an asshat ... but it seems unnecessary to invoke &quot;honor&quot; to describe catching someone at a disadvantage and exploiting it.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />

I have no fear of getting killed or the death run. I DO ENGAGE IN PVP when *I* want to.<br />
<br />
What I don't want to deal with is having to defend myself when I'd rather be doing other things, like questing.

That is utterly laughable. My entire point was that I didn't feel like engaging in unbalanced, [mainly] unrestricted PVP, yet you accuse me of only engaging in it when the odds are stacked in my favor?<br />
<br />
Ridiculous Mill. Really.<br />
<br />
For the record...to date I have only engaged in PVP with one person below my level, ONE. And that was only because he challenged me by manually typing /pvp, then insulted me with emotes. I can only assume he wanted to test his metal, so I let him. It was an honorable fight, which I stopped when he performed the /kneel emote.<br />
<br />
All other PVP encounters have been against people 10+ levels higher where I died several times. Raids against Auberdine and this past weekend in Darkshire, I found myself taking on level 46 to 52 Horde (I made levels 34 through 36 this weekend as a reference). The question that begs to be asked is why were people of that level even in those areas when they're frequented by much lower level players? No honor, that's why. The same type of person on an open PVP server would be uncontrollably ganking those same lower levels. On PVE servers they can't. My guess is that they don't play on open PVP servers for the same reason I don't, they don't want to get ganked themselves by lynching parties. That argument actually works in YOUR favor Mill (the old 'more griefing on blue servers in EQ because of a lack of open PVP).<br />
<br />
Even so, the CHOICE to get involved is all I care about. I usually get involved at the outset of a PVP skirmish (hence why I die so much). It usually takes 10 to 15 minutes for higher level Alliance to show up (or for enough lower levels to show up to make a difference) to turn the tide of the battle. <br />
<br />
A perfect example of my reasoning happened yesterday at Refuge Point in Arathi Highlands. 3 level 46+ Horde showed up and started killing guards. Some lower-to-mid 30's Alliance peeps got involved with PVP. The wife and I were on a schedule and needed to complete a quest, so we chose not to get involved in the battle this time. On an open PVP server that choice might not have been ours. We ran out of the area following the road, right into the middle of that battle. On an open PVP server we would have been open targets and likely would have been delayed in our tasks. That wasn't the case on our PVE server. We simply left, leaving those who chose to engage have their fun.<br />
<br />
This is my last post on the subject, hoping you'll get it this time.<br />
<br />
It's simply about choice.  I simply don't want to be *forced* into a PVP confrontation. And stop trying to paint it like I only get into PVP when the outcome is stacked in my favor. It's exactly the opposite. Fighting someone that much lower than myself is not challenging, IE it's no fun.<br />
<br />
Clear?</div></div><hr />

I agree with Val'goth on this - I PREFER to engage in PvP at a time and place of my choosing. Not when some wanker who rushed to 60 simply so he could grief me along with four of his buddies chooses.<br />

Don't get me wrong - close or near close PvP is a rush.  Gank-fests are not.</div></div><hr />

once again, generalizing. Are you on a pvp server?<br />

How about the other crap that people can pull, like mine pimping, monster pimping, being a general dumbass, still gotta put up with that.<br />

Anyway, Valgoth started calling names, and that just isn't cool, if I started a thread and started calling people on carebear servers wussies, sissies, idiots, and panty-wastes, I am sure people would get offended too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>bumluc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Khulgore, clearly you were not in the military and your definition of the word 'honor' is somewhat twisted from the real meaning.  The term 'honor', in warfare, has a very clear definition backed by years of tradition, and killing your enemy when he is weak is not part of it.<br />
<br />
I'm not here to say that playing your way or any other way is wrong, but I will argue the use of that term.<br />
<br />
Going into a pvp server with preconcieved notions of how people would play almost ruined it for me as well.  However, the added element is worth it.  I play in a large enough guild that alliance 'gankers' will probably think twice about jumping someone with our tag in a clearly unfair situation.<br />
<br />
Part of the fun, is that you get to make your own rules on how you want to play, and with enough firepower at your disposal, you can enforce them :P<br />

When it comes to * ME * I prefer to engage in PvP at a time and place of my own choosing.<br />

If * YOU * prefer the randomness of PvP, any time, any place, then more power to ya. I am guessing that's why Blizzard created PvP servers - for people such as yourself in mind.<br />

* I * prefer the pace of a RP server. Coincidentally enough - that's the server I chose to play on.  Shocking I know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">PvP never really appealed to me. And to be honest the biggest reason is probably that I hate to loose hehe. And while I could probably accept a defeat to a player of equal level and equipment I just dont trust other people enough to rely on that always being the case on a PvP server.<br />
<br />
To me killing someone that is clearly inferior to me holds no value or honor or whatever people want to call it. It proves nothing. Likewise attacking a higher level player that is severly disabled because of figthing something else or having just finished a battle is also worthless to me. Thats Pv(PvE) not PvP.<br />
<br />
Now I just read about Battlegrounds here:<br />
<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds.html<br />
<br />
and that definately sounds like a whole other angle towards PvP. This has purpose and it has rewards and everyone there is there for the sole purpose of helping their side win. And I suspect it will be a real bad idea for any side to let its strongest combatants prey on the others sides weakest so that &quot;unfortunate&quot; element of PvP'ing will probably not be seen much if at all.</div></div><hr />

Hmm?<br />
<br />
But please, don't even try to claim that PVP servers don't attract the &quot;b.net kiddies&quot;. It's all they know from the D2/WCx ladder fighting. It's what they do best. And a large percentage of those find ganking or griefing to be fun, again because it's what they know and what they are use to.<br />
<br />
If some of my statements are offensive to you, perhaps it's because some of your actions are reflected in those very statements? If that's the case, you need to look at your own behavior for why my comments cause that offense. Not saying you do, but more often than not the people offended by such &quot;general statements&quot; (as you claim them to be) are usually guilty of some of the behavior those statements encompass.  Either that, or they have some sort of messiah complex and feel the need to defend or protect the groups guilty of that behavior. Psych 101 Mill. Think about that.<br />
<br />
You can call me/PVE players &quot;wussies, sissies, idiots, and panty-wastes&quot; all you want, because it simply doesn't matter to me. I know why I play on a PVE server, and none of those terms apply to my reasons. Again, look inside for why my comments offend you Mill. You might find something you never thought you would.<br />
<br />
Ok, psych lesson over. Feel free to continue this nonsensical banter at your leisure. I'm done with it. I'll be playing WoW instead of wasting my time here.<br />
<br />
Oh, one last note, only sort of related...<br />
<br />
I have to admit that while playing my Tauren Shaman I see World Defense alerts a helluva-lot more often than I see them while playing my NE Hunter. That could be due to more people playing Alliance than Horde, but I'm sure some of it has to do with the same issue we're talking about here. Some people just prefer engaging in PVP where they clearly have the advantage. Those types are on both sides of this war. Shame on all of them. They're losers. (no Mill, that wasn't directed at you, so don't! :))<br />

Bumaden - Battle Grounds sound like an absolute blast! Really looking forward to them myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I would say literally 90% of the time or more, a similar leveled alliance person will simply wave and go about their business, and you wave back. It seems you almost get to a point where it is intuative when a person is going to want to fight.<br />
<br />
I have not been involved in a pvp battle in probably 5-7 levels, but for one, and I followed a lower level guildie out and killed anyone who attacked them in stranglethorn, which is the worst pk zone known to man!<br />
<br />
Alliance supposedly has a small population advantage, and to be honest, having messed around with a paladin and seen how awesome the alliance starting areas are, I do not blame them. A paladin literally is a friggin warrior with all kinds of neatness.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds do sound fun indeed, I hope a group of 5 can participate without having to join a raid force, I hope you can just zone in and be thrown in with others.<br />
<br />
With battlegrounds, and with normal PvP, I must admit as a rogue I should do well, I want special mounts and armor!!<br />

PvP is the only way to play in my opinion, I play a Tauren hunter on Archemonde, and will attack any allance player I see.  I'll gladly bust a cap in an alliance player ten levels lower than me, and I'll try to do the same to one thats ten levels higher than me if i can catch him in the middle of a hard fight, or resting low on hp or manna.<br />
<br />
I've been run down by pallies on mounts ten levels higher than me in Hillsbrad repetedely, and once in Booty Bay had the misfortune of running into what looked like the entire KGB clan (an alliance pvp guild) on their way to raid the Xroads.  I died at least half a dozen times before I gave up on getting things done in BB that night and left.  And enjoyed all of it.<br />
<br />
If getting ganked by an evil night elf rogue just before you finaly got the last named mob you need for a quest will ruin your night of fun, there is no need to play on a PvP server.  If it feels like the only real excitement of the game is worrying about the vile invisible gnome mage and his sneaky night elf rogue friend just waiting to gank you as you clear to the boss mob, play PvP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">playing on a pvp sucks.<br />
<br />
this is coming from a guy who loves pvp.<br />
<br />
look.  anyone who's ever played on a pvp server knows taht the asshats, gankers, punks, morons will like water to the ocean, take the path of least resistence. they will ALWAYS do what's easiest.<br />
<br />
due to the inherent advantage that alliance has to level pre-contested lands (essentially to your mid 20s) on EVERY pvp server there's a massive alliance numbers disparity.  I'm a longtime beta tester, I have 2 lvl 60 character on warsong, have tested both alliance and horde extensively, and I'll echo what was the accepted rule of thumb in beta.  to 25 alliance levels @3x the rate.  after that horde catches a bit... mainly because people who play horde tend to be better players.<br />
<br />
so if you're gonna play shaman get used to the idea that you will always be overgunned as far as numbers.<br />
<br />
secondarily there is no real pvp system in the game.  there was an honor system propsed but it was shelved quickly.  there are no battlefields.  there are no negative repurcussions for ganking<br />
<br />
if you play on a pvp server.  you WILL be randomly ganked many times a day.  even for someone ahead of he curve (I was 60 when most of the server was 40) I get ganked.  I see all the time how much worse it is for ppl under the power curve<br />
<br />
for me personally it's okay. i dont really have a lot invested whether some guy runs up and kills me while I'm fighting a creep or whatever.  but it has been a huge issue on the pvp servers. if you're the type that does give a damn.  OR who expects pvp to be fair or even balanced dont roll on a pvp server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I should also add that on warsong a full 1/3 of people are the current &quot;uber&quot; (goober) class: paladins.  also any jackass who's a gnome caster with a name like &quot;ownsyoo&quot; is suspect.  also any female priest: KILL EM.  these ****ers will GANK you.  I dont know how casters I've let live even when i've run across them at a disadvantage, only to have them a few minutes later run up with a friend and try to gank.<br />
<br />
on the other hand.  for some reason guys who play dorf warriors to a man seem very cool...<br />
<br />
there are pluses with playing on a pvp server.  often you're playing with the best players.  within the realm there seems to be very little bull****.  at least horde-side there's the mentality that we're all in the foxhole together.  as of yet no gay guild-relations drama or looting crap.  there's also the BIG plus that at the end of the day there's payback.<br />
<br />
I let **** slide but if I feel like someone's crossed the line there's the great satisfaction of hunting them across the zone and camping thier corpse until they're forced to log out and think about what they've done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">LOL!  I see both sides of the argument here.  In EQ I played on a bluebie server and it was fun to make a plan and stick to it.  All I had to worry about was the AI and I could blissfully chat away with my friends while I dropped stuff.  Now, I play on an active PvP server and while I generally don't like non-consentual PvP (I'm playing with friends, they wanted to do PvP), there are some aspects that are fun.  First, the other day I was happily exping/farming so I could buy spells when I got jumped by a warlock one level higher, a warrior at least 11 levels higher and a dorf hunter 9 levels lower.  I'd seen the lower end duo of that threesome exping and figured someone was PLing a twink or friend so I laid off of them and went about my business.  But when the warrior jumped in, both the others did to.  So, I res, wander around a sec and return about 15 minutes later to find the hunter and priest hunting my spot.  I jump the warlock after they are done with their mob (I'm on the short side of a 1 on 2 encounter). I almost drop the warlock before they fear me, the dorf is riding me like a pony, but I'm looking for the warlock who is trying to chain fear me.  Eventually, a fellow horde shaman drops (at least 4-5 levels below me) in and throws a nuke at the warlock and one of us drops her.  The dorf just stands still and I kill him slowly, might as well waste his time.  I later drop a passing warrior 1v1 to even it all out.  The moral of the story ... It sucks having my plan disrupted by people who should know better, but it felt good to hand back a case of whoop ass on those who played poorly and showed poor judgement (by only engaging in PvP when they were at a HUGE advantage).<br />
<br />
Always looking over your shoulder and finding different tactics based on possible player threats really makes the game more exciting and adds an element of randomness.  One aspect that has improved with PvP is my group cohesion and teamplay.  My buddy opened a TS server and when we PvP we're using live voice chat to pick targets, set diversions and traps (I led like 6 stupid defenders away from Astraanar once while my guildies ganked the lvl 60, sure I get to run like a little girl, but considering it peeled most of the defenders for a viable tactic then my sacrifice was worth it and my guild appreciated my tactic).  Some people like it, some don't either opinion is just as valid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Warriors in general, do indeed tend to be much better players, they truly have to be to stand a chance in pvp. I am a rogue, and I can almost alays go toe to toe with a warrior and kick his ass, that is not ight, nor fair.<br />
<br />
Paladins, sadly, are a retard class. There are plenty that are good people, and good players, but the class just attracts the uber l33t stupid kiddies too. One level 60 Paladin can be a tough fight, where the next 3 with goofy ass names will be a joke, but take forever to kill still.<br />
<br />
Mages? Mostly gankers that I have seen, names like Lovegh, Genkage, etc. hehe, they wave, come back from behind a tree when you fighting and bam. Actually followed a low level guildie around Hillsbrad, and more mages attacked him than anything. They of course did not like a 59 rogue reverse ganking them.<br />
<br />
Druids, solid class if well played, roots can be very annoying.<br />
<br />
Hunters, get close, easy, they catch you at range, tough. Also a huge ganking class, and very populous.<br />
<br />
Rogues, well, alot of em are cheap ass gankers, yup. Unfortunately, they are not given much choice, only combat rogues with heavy hps like me can approach a battle openly, the rest have to gank the hurt, they have great burst but no stamina.<br />
<br />
Priests, very powerful, unless you have WOTF or fear trinket :). Then they pushovers.<br />
<br />
Warlocks, gank bait.<br />
<br />
Shaman, tough, really tough, not as hard to kill as Pallies but offensively brutal.<br />

He was 3 levels my senior and I accidentally dragged my frostshock spell from my hotbar but he probably would have beat me anyways.  He was moving so well around me that I could hardly get a hit in and his damage was very high.<br />

I tried to get revenge later by rooting him in place with some really sticky glue I carry for just this occasion.  I was about to lay into him and then a Night Elf Hunter started shooting me from behind and I just gave up.</div></div><hr />

Best battle I have had yet last night, me 59 rogue, against a 60 pally that was good, battle lasted a long time, crushed through her first life, I was a little hurt, so bandaged when she healed(250 a tik bandage = yummy), went through the second life quick, third life went fairly quick, but then she used a pot for 1705 heal, ended up killing her, with about 1500 hps left. Must have been demoralizing to get her ass handed to her by a rogue with no sneaky tricks.<br />
<br />
but, they also had 3 level 60 rogues around, 3 60 pallies, 60 warrior, 60 hunter, and priests, support crew, etc, I was the highest horde at 59, and we still sent them packing many times, ha! Really funny that one time, no lie, I got hit by 5 rogues, and was stun locked till death hehe.<br />
