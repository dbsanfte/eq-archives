<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, sorry to go off topic but I need some help.  I cannot find anything about the magic the gathering game for the PC.  I used to play it all the time and recent found my old copy.  Im now using Windows XP Pro and the game just will not work.  Not in any compatability mode I have tried.  If anyone has got this to work on Nt/2000/Xp lemme know what you did please!<br />
<br />
<br />
If you need any other info just post here ill post what you need.</div></div><hr />

Tried installing it in all the ways I can think of, but no success and I gave up. Can't even uninstall it properly now :/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wizards of the Coast has hired out some programmers to write a program to allow two people to play magic online, with all the cards loaded and playing via rules text and such.. be prepaired to click 'ok' a lot though.<br />
<br />
The most useful thing this program has done was teach me how to annoy my opponents since I actually manually pass priority at each time now IRL.</div></div><hr />
