<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>axis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK. So here I am I've just gotten my Velious installed and I figure I'll go to cabilis to the field  of bone. I'm camped in a spot killing skeletons and scale wolfs when this dwarf in rust colored armor trains me with 4 dark blue skeletons. I tried to drop my agro and lead them back to him, but i couldn't becouse i kept getting stunned.<br />
   So the guy watches me die then later when i go to get my corpse i send him a tell asking him why? He says &quot;Yup&quot; he did it! <br />
<br />
So here's his name and a warning to the wise. Watch out for      KRIMER the dwarf.<br />

That is the sinkhole of everything honorable in EQ. It's a nasty, annoying, cruel, pathetic place and the only reason most Iksar stay there is because improving faction is annoyingly difficult. <br />
<br />
I made an Iksar BL, and I will be on Kunark for a while, unfortuneately, after that, it's strictly Luclin. I am not screwing with the faction I need ton train in Grobb, Oggok, or Halas. There is just no point with Planes of Power now out, and I have it.</div></div><hr />
