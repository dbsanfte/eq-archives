<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xanivus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Other than Rujarkian for Bane what other themes have nice items for shaman? What themes have the super groovy armor and augments!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice items at all the camps really.<br />
Everfrost is where the really good chain is bought.<br />
<br />
BTW... fortune teller says... I sense a sig nerf in your immediate future</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rujarkian for Bane and 40hp augment<br />
Miragul for Incorporeal Chain of the Spectre<br />
Mistmoor for AoB augment<br />
Takish for another 40hp augment<br />
<br />
Those are the ones that are of interest to me anyway. I am using the Incorporeal chain tunic until I am fortunate enough to get another tunic/bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mistmoore - 75hp lifetappy thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">-Everfrost has the top armor for shamans, as well as flowing thought II augments (if you're interested in those). <br />
<br />
- Regen V augment (chest slot only) is in North Ro, along with a flowing thought I augment and a 40 hp augment that can go in more slots than the East Commons one.<br />
<br />
- East Commons has the aforementioned 40 hp augment as well as a 10 stamina, 10 wisdom augment.<br />
<br />
- South Ro has an Enduring Breath augment that some might be interested in (like me, since my EB item is still a fishbone earring).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Guk has the 760 pt level chain armor. That's very good stuff, and probably a better target than Miragul's and the 1492 pt chain armor, for someone who needs to upgrade a lot of equipment slots. <br />
<br />
Sooo.... they all have good stuff for shamans, depending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been raiding Tov for gear so seeing the mistmoor armor thats better at 440 points is my direction. I didn't catch your level but at my level of 58 and only 20 points per adventure 1400 or even 700 seems nuts. 400 ap is my price limit and that range stuff seems to be mistmoor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After looking at the Armor in Miragul and the Armor in Guk, my opinion is for the cost the Guk one is better. It has 25 hp less and 6 Ac less. The Guk BP has +10 Stamina.You can make the argument that the Miragul BP has 2 Type2 Slots, but i think majority will go HPs so you can do the same witht he Guk BP, ad 80hp and a focus. I personally going to get the Regen 5 Aug for th BP. Just my opinion on one of our great items in ldon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been looking at this:<br />
<br />
Guk 442  Ykeshan Troll Staff<br />
Type:1hb, Dmg:15, Dly:25, Cha:20, Wis:10, Mana:70, MR:15, Effect:Torbas'AcidBlast, type1,type2  Clr, Dru, Shm, Nec, Wiz, Mag, Enc Primary <br />
<br />
and I like it but it would be even more awesome if it had the slot 4 so I could throw the 75hp lifetap on it.  220dd + 75hp lifetap would be awesome!  <br />
<br />
Oh well :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What good is a proc for a shaman? Or maybe you're an iksar so can't use a JBB for clearing out greenies?<br />
<br />
My piercing skill (only weapon skill I've ever worked on) isn't even maxed, because it maxes a couple levels AFTER I was able to start using a JBB. Now, I  swing once every 8 seconds (ok, sometimes less between other spellcasts), and only indoors. Outdoors I never ever turn on autoattack (due to the horse). Just the other day I was joking to my wife &quot;OMG NO! You turned on my autoattack!&quot; when she'd been bot'ing me while I was afk a few minutes. ;)<br />
<br />
So... seriously, are there shaman out there who REALLY melee enough that they'd actually spend adventure points on a weapon, or on a proc aug for a weapon, even a lifetap proc? At higher levels, of course. We all melee'd a lot at L 12. ;)</div></div><hr />

All my weapon skills are max and I have a couple nice weapons to use. JBB is usefull, but not the only way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well i will probaby get the lifetap proc eventually for fun. At 65 i only melee when im soloing ( for fun ) or farming green mobs. So it would be more of a toy for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Of course it's useful!  Why do you think the Soulstripper is such a popular item?  And it's not just for farming greenies, in LDoN I melee all the time.  It's way better to melee with a lifetap proc while using canni4 than to just sit there in the back doing nothing.   Especially if you get in a slow killing group, you just cast Slow and Bane and stand there canning while your dot does the work and you get mana back AND health back.<br />
<br />
If I put the another lifetap proc on the soulstripper that would be ideal, but the stats on it arent that great.  220dd plus lifetap?  That's ownage in LDoN for a shaman, just cast FA on yourself and go to town.  Hell if the clerics gonna melee I'm gonna have my fun too =P<br />
<br />
edit: and oh yeah, in LDoN I'm usually on CC.  Which means root+dot so as not to break root.   If you get a few resisted slows on an add they are on you like glue anyway, and if root gets resisted too well then I'll just whack away.   It's not like my melee damage is awesome .. and that's not the point.  The point is I'm getting health back while I canni without spending mana to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i was going to go for the life tap augment, but i decided to wait till i have 40 augs in all alther slots they will fit.<br />
i do melee in ldon, but i tend to find that off rooting 2-3 adds or less is a wiast of time so i just tank them after i slow.  i can do more damage with chain rains then with melee+bane.  dps is what it is all about anyway.  if you get a voq/kei before you enter the adventure it is usually enough mana regen to rain the whole adventure.  then again i have canni v as well.<br />
i see the life tap proc as more of a novelty than anything so i am not waisting points on it until i have nothing else to use points on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK, I can see how that'd be useful. If you're chain-canni'ing while tanking a mob, you get one free swing (maybe two) between each canni cast, without slowing down your canni any. So that is of some use. Maybe I'll have to start trying to work that in occasionally. I still don't see it being worth spending adventure points on, though. Compared to the HP regen you'll already have as a high level shaman, an occasional 75 hp lifetap proc won't do much. I see as something to get only if you can't upgrade by buying armor or other important augments.</div></div><hr />
