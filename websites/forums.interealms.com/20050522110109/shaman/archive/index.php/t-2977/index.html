<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to be a shaman, but I don't know which to be out of Troll or Iksar. Does wearing JB armor really make THAT much of a soloing difference (JBB especially)? Thank you. Also, are Ogre shaman better soloers than trolls or ikkys? And finally, lol, can druids solo the &quot;big time&quot; mobs like shammys? Lodi, etc...THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
edit : druids cant solo the big time mobs, JBB makes a HUGE difference, the other armor is nice too but not as much as JBB, and any shaman race can just about solo the same, mainly depends on gear.</div></div><hr />

Iksar get some mad AC bonus,  and have a convenient city on Kunark, and its always fun to be a master swimmer right out of the egg.<br />
<br />
I wish I would have play a Troll SOMETIMES, then I think...do I have the time or money to get a JBB? Probably not,  unless my guild helped me. So I keep pushing on, and hell yea - RE sucks compared to SH (in Hate).</div></div><hr />

Yes I am serious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">druids do solo high end mobs, not as effectively as a shaman, but it does get done.<br />
<br />
lodi is not a real option, but there are plenty of decent mobs for druid to solo, as well as shaman. heck, necros, SKs, and other classes have soloed very high end mobs as well<br />
<br />
i've seen logs of both a SK and druid soloing yeldema, whom we know is really shaman's who started that. but point in case, it was done. (i apologize, i don't have links to logs handy. i'm rather skeptical of the druid one being true in either case).<br />
<br />
me myself i've tried soloing tantor. it can be done, and i've had some good and bad breaks on him (i remmeber one time i had him to &quot;Ta&quot; and he got a lucky quad on me for 246x4+bash+flurry hehehe.<br />
<br />
druid strategy is just usually different than the mindless shammy solo strategy &quot;ok i malo, slow, and torpor/jbb till dead!&quot; it gets rather creative lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
anyways, i'm goin thru withdrawl and rambling. don't mind me</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah, but he didn't do it the way i did i'm sure.<br />
<br />
i ran around for half hour charming anything with 4 legs and throwing at tantor :D<br />
<br />
rangers do some pretty badass kiting in these new days of AA skills now. i'd imagine if he could jstick/tash tantor, he could land a snare.<br />
<br />
i used animal only druid MR debuff, and i'm told it could take up to 50 tries to land snare after that, so i said screw it and went off to find stuff to charm :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">troll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Troll or ogre. <br />
<br />
Troll get regen and a nice, nice nice snare necklace if you worship Innoruuk. I have found that necklace to be one of the most useful items any of my &quot;non-snaring&quot; characters have. troll stats are OK and the old models look really good. <br />
<br />
Ogre get better wis and are non-stunnable from the front. The get good melee stats. Old model ogres look like they swinging telephone polls with a 2hb staff, which I think is neat. They get access to cultural smithing of really really nice items if you have the gumption and the plat to work the skill up to 250.<br />
<br />
Both can wear JB armor. I don't have the bracer yet, but I've found the JB items I do have to be greatly useful for buffing group or pet and reducing my downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I also agree with a Vah Shir as the best choice.<br />
<br />
They are the only shaman race with no xp penalty. That may not seem like a big deal, but coming from an Iksar shaman that finally made 60 with a 20% xp penalty, I'll tell you it is HUGE. Trolls also have 20%, Ogre's 15% and Barbs 5%.<br />
<br />
Also Vah Shir have some awesome faction, good well rounded stats including stamina and safe fall. If I did it again, I would play a Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
Of coarse, its very cool being one of only 3 Iksar Oracles on my server. I take a lot of pride in that and once you finally make 60 the xp penalty is in the past. So play what you like, but remember a 57 Iksar/Troll shaman = a 60 Vah Shir Oracle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I say go Ogre!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NewShaman1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I went Iksar and am 100% happy with my choice.  <br />
<br />
Personally I hate playing big races (mainly ogre/troll) and I love Iksar regen, so it just worked well for me. <br />
<br />
Troll make the best shamans, but any shaman at 60 is gonna rule no matter which race you chose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My pref is iksar, play what you like =)</div></div><hr />

So be a Troll !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cats have no XP penalty, they have JBB, tough to get FunGuy tunic, not that ever shaman is born with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">tough to get FunGuy tunic, not that ever shaman is born with it. <br />
<br />
Not true, every Troll and Iksar Shaman are born with a Fungi, it just gets progressively better with age. Isn't quite mature until 60.</div></div><hr />
