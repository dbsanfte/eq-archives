<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tolian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One dirty little fact that I found out about Mez recently...  for some reason, its coded to act differently in a guild war compared to a duel or something.  I had chanters casting Rapture on me, which turned out to be a long duration stun, instead of a mez.  Sucked hard, cuz it was damn near impossible to resist, and everytime it stuck, I was toast.<br />
<br />
Edit - Oh, and about Flame Lick.  ya, its a nice little trick, but its a major pain.  I have to basically strip down naked to drop my FR low enough to have it land on myself, which is very inconvenient in the middle of a fight, and due to the short duration, you're bound to have to cast it more than once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ronarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are having trouble casting Flame Lick try Stinging Swarm.  It lasts 1 minute, only does 180 damage, is difficult to resist, and can preclude some higher level druid DoTs from landing on you.</div></div><hr />
