<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if it's possible to engage project Alpha with only one weapon? Specifically, a weapon that's secondary but not primary useable. <br />
<br />
2 days ago I'm bored and decide to start work on the Coldain Ring quest.  Puppup is laying waste to the Tundra Kodiak population in EW and I give him 2 chill daggers that I looted off of a dervish. I loot another dagger a bit later and notice that they're secondary/range only, so out of curiosity I check to see how he's attacking. He's biting and piercing which, to me, implies that he's only using the one dagger in off hand. <br />
<br />
I didn't get a chance to do any further testing and last night I skipped EQ after crashing the first two times I zoned. Being the lazy bum that I am, I figured I'd see if anyone else has played around with this before I do any more testing. If I only need to have one weapon to engage project Alpha and that weapon is easy to get, I might well start carrying around a pack full of daggers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you saw both biting and piercing, you had achieved the primary goal of Project Alpha - getting the pet to dual wield.<br />
<br />
It does not realy make sense to me that the bite was one of the attacks, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing that was because it couldn't equip either weapon in the primary slot so it used the default attack type (bite) for primary attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bite is alpha's version of hand to hand.  I used to give him the bags of rocks you get in SFG, and you got triple and quadruple bites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've read up on project Alpha, but something's been in the back of my mind and I've been too bored to test... maybe someone here knows the answer.<br />
<br />
A while ago, they changed it so that at a certain level, all pets who could dual-wield were allowed to do so without being given two weapons.  I think this would only kick in with level 44 pets or such.  Have people tested our higher level pets specifically to see if they are dual wielding without us knowing?  It would require looking at logs to see if there are ever three or four attacks with the same timestamp.<br />
<br />
I assume that we're in the same boat as enchanters, whose pets can dual wield if given weapons but don't do so as-summoned.  Then again, they come with a shield, so it's possible that they have to swap that out to dual wield anyway.  I know mages and necros don't need to give their pets weapons starting at a certain point.</div></div><hr />
