I'll do that.<br />
You can STUFF it for not trying enough to get it.  The rune drop rate is roughly 1 in 5-10 named.  You can get more than one kind of rune to drop at once off a named, as well as get some loot, so it does not appear that the appearance of any one rune is blocking another from appearing in the loot table (I've seen 2 runes + loot on a named).<br />
<br />
Yes at ONE TIME the drop rate was rediculously rare.  They fixed that.  The drop rate isn't that bad any more.  When OOW came out, pretty much everyone in my guild was doing KT for xp up to 70.  During that time, *every* guildmember and recruit and twink that was flagged for the zone received *all* their GOD spells, minus ancient.  We were routinely OOCing to the zone that certain runes were rotting, as were the other people there doing xp.<br />
<br />
If you want the rune, you have to hunt in KT and kill named.  You should get at least one of the nihil rune in a day of hunting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My problems with the spell rate is they are releasing expansions so quickly that it's hard to stay caught up. I didn't get the spell when GoD was new and now, 2 expansions later, it can be difficult to convince people who are excited about doing the latest and greatest stuff to go back and slum through old content.<br />
<br />
I've never been comfortable about asking people to go out of their way to do things for me in game - there are a lot of people like that, who don't feel comfortable asking for others to do unpleasant things.<br />
<br />
I was there, I spent a lot of time there, I killed a ton of KT named (look at all those augs in my Magelo!) and I missed the chance. Now, I have to ask people who'd rather be doing something else to go do something that nobody really liked in the first place. I mean, get people to go to Vext? That's almost amusing - I could barely get flagged in the first place.<br />
<br />
I wonder if I'm missing my chance with OoW spells -I have 2 70 spells and 3 69 spells. Already the guild is getting kind of tired of spell farming, they're excited about the awesome raid drops in DoN, anxious to do the new things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It takes one group to get your last two 69s, from MSL or Menlo.  70s will be tough to get if everyone focuses *exclusively* on DoN, but they drop two at a time from every raid target in OoW.  I'd be pretty surprised if Affliction spent all of their lockout time farming faction in DoN rather than pick up RSS/Battlemaster loot, or just decided to skip Anguish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Of course it's going to be hard to get a group to get there *now*.  It's a week after a new expansion came out.  Expect people to flock to DoN zones for about the next month or two.  When the newness of the expansion wears off, people will be more ready to go back to the older zones.<br />
<br />
And ya, I've spent ages and ages in KT xping as well.  The drop rate for the longest time in KT was fubar.  There was almost only 1 rune type dropping in the zone.  Sony must have patched something in the zone to increase the drop rate of the non-jelki rune.  Because the difference was, well, not quite night and day, but more like day and twilight.  :)  The rune drops a lot more often now.  Seriously, I'd expect you could see the rune you need drop in a few hours of hunting in KT.<br />
<br />
Also, you belong to a guild.  Guild members generally help each other out.  Tell your friends that you are trying to get a spell you really need and see if they can lend you a hand.  The xp in KT is still decent.  Any group capable of hunting in MPG can handle hunting in KT.  Just remember that the named hit hard, though they have almost no hit points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From my experience a Rondo collection raid to Ferubi seems to be the best way to get Yiktu runes.<br />
<br />
We have killed Hexxt N`Vak Tkan about 4 or 5 times and every time he has dropped a Yiktu rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just get tipt done and go exp in KT. And don't wait for a group invite, get a group together, it can be hard to get ppl there these days yes, but many still like the zone. We got like 1-3 named every 2-3 hours and runes drops are not to that bad many times 2 will drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is there information anywhere where nameds spawn, PHs etc in KT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From my experience. All Hynids/Cragbeasts can spawn the named versions. The 3 Kyvs standing guard at the front of the temple are PH's for Hexxt named and the Ixt that are opposite of the west temple can spawn the Ixt named.</div></div><hr />

I found this amusing.  In 2 months, SoE will be on the verge of releasing the next expansion, haha.  <br />
<br />
It will be very difficult to get Nihil unless your guild is raiding lower GoD or you ask a few friends to go farm Vxed, KT or Yxxta.  The Nihil rune is much more common off Yxxta named than KT named for whatever reason.  I saw Nihil drop once in 30 or so runs of Vxed, however, we didn't farm the named and sometimes even skipped them to get the the flagging done.  Most of this was when you still had to kill 100 mobs there instead of 50.  And when i got my copy, it was still an individual spell I could scribe right there.  Now that you only need Tipt for KT access, people probably don't want to do Vxed anymore.<br />
<br />
If you can get a group together for KT, why not drop down to Vxed instead, the named there are left up quite a bit because people don't leave the path to PSM/Uqua.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Maybe SoE will put the rune on a DoN merchant like they did with RGC if enough people ask for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes - that's kind of what I'm hoping. There is precedent for hard to get spells from previous expansions being made more accessible later -<br />
<br />
1. Kunark spells dropping in Velious<br />
2. RGC as a LDON buyable spell<br />
<br />
The feeling of Nihli hopelessness really didn't start to set in until this expansion, when I realized I was 2 expansions behind in spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">EDIT: everything I was going to say is posted in the other thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am seeing a lot of the &quot;Nihil Hopelesness&quot; in my guild. Its been difficult to get people into KT since a couple weeks into OoW, when it was discovered how easy MPG was. KT is still a dangerous place, a PITA to run to, a PITA to get to camps, even with invis, and the mobs still hit pretty hard compared to other zones with that level of XP.<br />
<br />
I got lucky. I picked up Nihil during the &quot;rush to save 30&quot; week before OoW shipped. But ever since around Thanksgiving, KT has been a ghost town on my server. Every time we go there for Ikky or whatever raids, its empty, even in Prime Time. <br />
<br />
There is an alternative to KT though. That rune does still drop some in the Sewers, and most of them can be done with 3 or less, even soloed by most 70 shaman with some AA and OoW spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Or, you solo clear the hynids &amp; crags in KT, who never summon and are always rootable, until you spawn the named.

<br />
So again (****)(&lt;-- LOL S  Tee F and u is banned here lol phiniky shaman boards.) you loser raid guild shaman that thinks all you have is easy as pie to get. hehe =p<br />
<br />
I was able to get serenity in omens without to much trouble but I'll never see this spell untill enough expansions come out to where I can duo for it myself.  By then a new version should be out in a diff place</div></div><hr />

All mobs in KT summon completely random sometimes they do sometimes not.</div></div><hr />

He spawns very close to zone in. If he doesn't pop you just /dzquit and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You'll never get it like that.<br />
You have to kill a minimum number of mobs in zone for those named mobs/phs to spawn.<br />
It was changed exaclty to stop what you just said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">He does, however, have a static ph, so you can just camp his room of four pookas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Abzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think you only have to kill 9 mobs for the rares to pop. By the time you kill your way up there, you only need a couple more kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">XP isnt horrid in Tipt either. And shaman can often solo in there, on the non-summoning mobs.<br />
I was told the same by my friend went all happy to KT killed a few than blam,  8th hynid summoned me. :D<br />
Wow this is the first I have ever heard of a hynid or crag in KT summoning, EVER. Are you SURE the hynid didnt radius-aggo something else, who summoned you close to the hynid since it was walking by?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">He'd have had to damage that other mob.  I'm thinking maybe he wasn't paying attention, and actually pulled the named?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can guarantee you 100% that the animals do summon. It really is just luck of the draw.  I spent literally days of game time soloing in there with my bard. It did seem to be a lower chance of getting a summoning animal than a summoning muramite, but they still are not uncommon.  Luckily, as a bard, I had the tools to fade off the agro and live through a summoner, unlike the poor shaman above.  The only other class I saw that could solo effectively in KT were necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I used to solo a lot in KT.. well, not a lot, but enough to know.<br />
<br />
Yes, random crags and hynids summon.  It's not set from what I could tell, just sometimes they do and most of the time they don't.  I was there just yesterday helping a friend get their spell that they are missing when the main tank died (don't ask me how I was out pulling) and someone else went ld.  I decided to solo the mob that I pulled (hynid) and naturally, he had to be the summoning one.  I still killed it np, but it's just somehting to look for.</div></div><hr />
