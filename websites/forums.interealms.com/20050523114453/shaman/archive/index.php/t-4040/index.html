<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, I know. Look in the hunting guide section :)<br />
<br />
I have done that, but I'm unclear as to what is actually sugested (if anything). <br />
<br />
I want to go solo. I have hunted in Paludal since lvl 19 (just turned 24) and I'm way behind on my skills. Only skill kept up to date is meditate :)<br />
<br />
I have seen the following sugestions:<br />
Mammoth in EF (seems to hard?!)<br />
Giants in Warsliks<br />
Echo Caverns (seems to hard?!)<br />
<br />
I'm a no twink with poor skills. In the past I have never ever been able to take a yellow and the only white I have survived I did as lvl 1.<br />
<br />
Will any or all of the above work for me? Anything better?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really don't care for Luclin, because the mobs there seem to have quite a few more HP's than &quot;Old world&quot; and Kunark mobs of the same level. <br />
I hunted at the Warslik Woods giant fort at 24 then LOIO at 26-30. At the giant fort find a giant pull him with Slow, maybe throw on a DoT, and melee him to death. Stick to blues, they respawn pretty quick and you can pull relatively easy without having to compete with anyone. That should raise your skills as well. If you get in trouble, root them, back up and heal yourself...go back in beat on them some more. <br />
<br />
Lake of Ill Omen would also be good for your level, yeah I know everybody likes to avoid that, but if you're just trying to level, work on some skills, then the Lake is good for that. Steady spawns, and if you want to group later you have that option. Loot isn't all that great, I made more at the giant fort, but the exp was good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey, I just posted a topic exactly like this about 3 days ago. I did something very closely related to what you have done. I hunted in Pauldal from 15-24, then once I hit 24, I thought I could solo pretty well. This is in my expierence, but as soon as I left Pauldal, I died a lot solo. After about two days, I went back to Pauldal, and stayed till 26. My recommendation is that you stay till maybe 25, then head on over to Marus Seru, and get grouped with a monk if there are any, or just try to get into a group. I'm currently level 26 right now in Marus Seru, I just went over there last night, and I grouped with a 32 monk. The exp was still fast, and in about an hour I got 3 gold bubbles, and now I'm one away from 27. I would stay there until you at least get your pet, then start soloing. I'm not sure on the hunting grounds as of yet, but I will most likely know by this Friday ). Good luck to you. - Exodus<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I forgot, at 29 you get quickness, so if your partnered up with a monk, you guys can do some damage. Combine it with walking sleep, and you two could go through mobs faster then with a full group, IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I read your post. It didn't really answer my question though. Thats why I started a new thread. Right now I prefer to get my skills up rather than rushing through my lvls. I figure I need to solo for a couple of lvls to get my skills to an acceptable lvl. I also figured that I better improve my solo skills now when it is still &quot;cheapish&quot; to die, rather than at a higher lvl.<br />
<br />
If I can do Warsliks Giants now without uber equipment or stunning solo skills, then thats what I will do. Only drawback is the long run to get there :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, if your still 24, stay in Pauldal Caverns still. Get into a group with a melee type and a healer, and inform them that you will be tanking and pulling. I did this at level 25 until I turned 26 and my defense, offense, and piercing was maxed. If you decide to do this method, memorize every buff you have that you think will help you, including frenzy, and keep yourself buffed at all times, and you should be fine as a tank. The melee is there as a secondary, to help you kill faster or backup in case you need to. You could also do this at 26 in Marus Seru, and once you get your pet, you should have all your skills maxed. I'm still hunting in Marus Seru right now, and I got 1 level in about an hour. I would alternate between a tank and a caster every other level, just so everything is even. Or you could just solo, but imo, this is much slower. I am able to quad kite mammoths in Everfrost just fine, but finding them is extremely slow. Hope this helps. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the sugestions, but I don't see any chance of my skills going up in Pauldal. The groups in there are all full, and the camps are fully camped. Meaning that when I group there it is as a healer. I usually get the chance to melee some, but that will only improve my piercing and attack. My offensive spell skills (I can nuke a little) and defence gets no exercise. There is no way I could find a group that would be willing to slow their xp advancement by allowing me to tank. Besides my AC and DPS is too low to stand for long against even these guys. Then again, that also limits me a lot when trying to rise my skills solo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get yourself to KFC in South Karana, and kill some aviaks.<br />
<br />
Start with rooks, then move up to harriers and avocets in that order, just slow, dot and melee, and you'll be fine. they run when low on health giving you a chance to skillup weapons for no damage. Also try to hunt down the solo roamers, as these seem to carry more gems.<br />
<br />
Also keep your DEX buff up at all times, it really helps with weapon skillups.<br />
<br />
Try to max all your weapon skills, swap out that piercer for a 2HB. If you don't have a good 2HB, get up to the bazzar and do a search for 2HB shaman useable, and buy the best one you can.<br />
<br />
Spell skills go up as you use them, so try to use which ever spell class is lowest, e.g. conjuration or evoke.<br />
And practice your spells whilst waiting for the spires/your pet druid to turn up.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, Remember most importantly, HAVE FUN !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">KFC it is.<br />
<br />
I made my mind up about that just before I saw the post :)<br />
My reasons is mainly laziness. Since I'm on the moon, it will be easy to get there. I can also keep my bind in nexus without having to much of a problem with a CR (me die, never happens ;).<br />
<br />
To lazy to skill up more than one weapon type though :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bearbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had the same problem about where to hunt at 24.  I too decided to go to South Karana and hunt aviaks.  Then I happened by the spires next to splitpaw and saw an even con gnoll. Well I decided what the heck and pulled it with affliction then ran away and hit it with envenomed breath.  Then I ran in circles like some kind of nut keeping out of its reach.  When the EB expired I stopped and cast another one.  Usually while I did this I would be hit a couple times and my defense would go up.  No biggy it is a good trade off.  When the gnoll got to about a quarter hp I would stop and melee with it.  To my surprise with regen up I had only lost 1/2 a bulb of health and had almost 1/2 mana.  I sat near a spire and just keep on doing it.  When I get bored I call for a group.  My skills are going up I can now take out yellows with no problem.  You can zone nearby into splitpaw.  I have only died once and that was in a group.  Often the gnolls drop fine steel weapons and a few platinum.  My bank account is now over 150pp.  Not much I'm sure but enough to by my lvl 29 spells.  I hope this helps.  By the way I have never rooted.  I sometimes use flash of light and sit while the beast runs away.  Root doesn't seem to last real long.  Careful with flash of light though because the gnolls will agro you.  Maybe it is because I am a troll but I seem to survive alot when other races and classes die.  Maybe that is just a shaman abiblity.  We seem to be pretty tough.</div></div><hr />
