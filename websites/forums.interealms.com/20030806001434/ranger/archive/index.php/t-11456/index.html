<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Domandred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1% chance to kill a mob in one shot means that some unlucky saps will never actually see it go off.  Along those lines I would like to see a &quot;Called Shot&quot; ability.  Much like this:<br />
<br />
Called Shot - Reuse time 1 hour.  Activated.<br />
<br />
Your next arrow will automatically hit for full critical damage.  Consequently this will also render archery unusable for 3 minutes and cannot be used in conjunction with the Trueshot Discipline and cancels Trueshot when used.<br />
<br />
The consequences make it so this would be a end fight ability used after Trueshot Disc.  The shot would still use damage multipliers ie stationary mob and archery mastery, but would also suffer the same LoS penalties as archery currently does.<br />
<br />
I don't think this would be overpowering, but still give us that one great shot when we need/want it.<br />
<br />
Just a thought...discuss</div></div><hr />
