<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today in the bazaar I was working on getting some hardened grey flesh arms for my shaman (gotta love those hp + sta + ac), and a discussion flared up about the usefulness of dex.<br />
<br />
Well, as an older player (beta), I dispensed what knowledge I could:  dex affects procs, but only slightly, and affects some offensive skill gains, as well as crits.<br />
<br />
Then the inevitable misinformed fella strolls in and says &quot;Dex affects chance to hit, blah blah blah&quot;, so I *politely* correct him, and then an argument ensues.<br />
<br />
As this argument begins to simmer down, someone comes on and picks up on the last part of the argument.  I had stated that I play a shaman, and as dex buffing is one of my unwanted forte's, I used that as proof: &quot;I buff the hell out of dex and see no real diff on melees&quot; kinda thing.<br />
<br />
Well, this person starts saying that as a beastlord, they see no reason to have a shaman around anyway.   She said that slow was not all that important (snicker) and that a beastlord could match everything a shaman could do, and supply dps whereas the shaman cant supply any (laugh).  Well, this spawned another argument, but it went fairly civil.<br />
<br />
Yet *another* person comes in, and starts in, but only mildly at this time.  However, he quickly jumps someone about the spelling of the plural of the word &quot;shaman&quot;.  He stated that &quot;The plural is SHAMEN, jackass&quot;, whereas Merriam Webster, Webster, and American Heritage all said either SHAMAN, or SHAMANS.  Well, I brought this to his attention (just happened to have those dicitionaries on my desk here) and he jumped on me, saying I was ignorant.<br />
<br />
So, with a big ol KABOOM, another argument ensues, and I nailed him on a few stupid spelling mistakes (ya know, since he was gonna be an ass about those anyway), and he gets pissed.  I swear here and there, like I sometimes do when I get mad, and it keeps going from there.<br />
<br />
Sometime after this part began, he actually said this in ooc:  &quot;Americans perfected terrorism&quot;, along with a few other phrases about America, the 9/11 thing, etc.  Being prideful in our country and damned pissy towards anyone that would suggest something like that, I flew off the handle...I admit it...I told him pretty much verbatim &quot;F*** you, Im petitioning your ass, and reporting that line too&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The rest of the zone joined in, except for a couple of people.  Pretty much everyone hated him, and we later found out that he was British, and that made things worse, as far as the argument was going.  He did have a couple of sympathizers, but they were really just sort of ignorant, and just wanted to help the underdog, I think.<br />
<br />
The thing that really pissed the zone (and myself) off was when he sort of poked fun at a guy who said he lost a brother in the towers.  <br />
<br />
To cut to the chase, things simmered down, and after about two hours of this, we left it alone.  However, the questions I pose to you are the following:<br />
<br />
1.  Was I in the right or wrong to report him for that?<br />
<br />
2.  Im fairly certain that I got petitioned/and or reported for the swearing.  Should I worry about this?<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my long rant here...<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have to be real carefull about swering in public channels. We were having problems with a rage spawn in skyfire one day and many of us sent in petitions to see if we could be helped. The whole day was utter chaos as anyone who zoned into skyfire lost their guild tag. There must have been 30 of us out of i'd say 40 people in zone so we were uising /ooc and /shout quite a bit. The chat channels were going haywire as well and booting people out and not letting them rejoin. A shadowknight from my guild said &quot;ass&quot; in /ooc. Yes there was A GM in zone. He was summoned from the rage spawn to the OT zone and a GM Warned his account for swearing in a public channel. I forget exactly what he said but &quot;ass&quot; was enough to warrant a warning. <br />
<br />
as for your arguement, like everone else has said /ignore works wonders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It really wasn't an argument over spelling at the end...he was just being a real ass to the folks in the zone, so I shot him with his own bullets;  perhaps in the end that wasn't the best way to go about it.  Some folks were alot worse than I, saying things to this guy like &quot;I hope you die a slow, horrible death&quot;.  He REALLY got on folks' nerves.<br />
<br />
So now that it's over and done with, I shouldn't expect more than a warning out of it?  I'm not one to cuss in public channels, and my account has never been warned prior to this incident...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As far as the dead brother goes, I spoke with that particular person after the incident...he said he appreciated the defense, but that the instigator was just a dick and it didnt bother him, deep down.<br />
<br />
Different views from me is one thing;  when you display blatant ignorance and no sympathy for things like that *while playing around a bunch of American people on an American server while he himself was European*...well...thats another.  I know that sounds strange, but this guy was anti EVERYTHING that was or is American.  <br />
<br />
I don't wonder if my opposing him was wrong, but rather in the way in which I conducted myself.<br />

<br />
Funny that someone displays their ignorance by saying &quot;America invented terrorism.&quot; Since our great country has been around less than 250 years I think a few others have the lead in that department.<br />
<br />
As a Brit he was probably pis.sed that a former colony now dictates British foreign policy. <br />
<br />
As far as the rest of Europe - quit subsidizing your social welfare state with American taxpayer dollars - THEN we'll talk. <br />
<br />
Oh Europe (And specifically france) does lead America in one category - that's body odor. Dennis Miller said it best: &quot;I was in a cab in ol Paris and the driver smelled of 3 week old gogonzola cheese, wrapped in shet and dunked in sewage. I was like &quot;Hey pal - there's an extra 10 in it for ya if you run over a skunk.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh and Europe  - you guys can have the u.n. - seriously.  I say we move it to france, consider it our payback for the Statue of Liberty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Very nice Faern...had me laughing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow, Faern, and you say someone else is displaying ignorance?<br />
<br />
Not often you come across such an arrogant ignorant attitude as yours.  Glad all the people I know from the US are a tad less full of themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a Brit he was probably pis.sed that a former colony now dictates British foreign policy. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would be more likely to believe it is because the guy is an idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Krnonebourg - Me arrogant? You bet. Ignorant? Not likely.<br />
<br />
Spent 4+ years in Germany, had the &quot; opportunity&quot; to travel to France, Spain, England, Switzerland, Denmark, and Austria. Miller was right on the money with his BO comments. I won't even go into the women with pits hairier than mine. (oops guess I just did)<br />
<br />
Insofar as europe's social welfare system...tell me...this new &quot;Euro Defence force&quot;...um where are ya'll getting the troops? (*)<br />
<br />
And...um Nato...who foots MORE than their fair share of cash, troops, etc? (Not to mention all those GI's spending bucks in YOUR disco's, bars, restaurants)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Bosnia...europe handled that HOW before America got (and still is) involved?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah that helping to end World War one thing - you're welcome.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah that helping to end World War two thing - you're welcome.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah that Marshall Plan thing - you're welcome.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, that 57 years of peace on the European continent since 1945 thing - you're welcome.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, that bringing down of the Iron Curtain, the restoration of freedom in places like Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia - you're welcome. I know it took BILLIONS of US dollars, but we spent the Soviets into the 21st century. <br />
<br />
Finally...this &quot;european union&quot; economic thing...that was created to counter WHICH economic juggernaut?<br />
<br />
Face facts..europeans protest daily American activities, they are keenly interested in (if blithefully ignorant) of American machinations and politics.<br />
<br />
I am trying to remember the last time there was a protest in America over say...I dunno the German Financial or Prime Minister equating Bush to Hitler? (IRONY ! I Love it !)<br />
<br />
(*) On the eve of the creation of this new imaginary monster the Polish PM said: &quot;We unequivocally ally with the United States.&quot;  Guess getting sold down the river in 1939 (iirc) still resonates with our friends in Warsaw.<br />
<br />
America is the most inward looking country around. Foreign policy routinely ranks near the bottom of election issues.  I dare say America's doings take up more news time on your tv's than Europe as a whole do on ours. (CNN excluded - another American entity)<br />
<br />
Yeah, so if as a soldier, or fek, just an American citizen I feel a touch proud of all our wonderful nation has accomplished in the past 100 years - tough. I know it must suck having the facts concerining european inadequacies thrown in your face like a moon pie at the local carnival - but them's the facts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a deep well of resentment over here as far as the US double standards on terrorism are concerned.<br />
The British have suffered terrorism for decades, men women and children killed simply for their nationality, religion or even job ... much like at the WTC.<br />
In lage part these attacks have been sponsored by American citizens, a large portion of whom reside in New York.  While no-one believes America in anyway deserved what happened, or that there is any justification for it, there is a certain feeling of &quot;well now they know what it's like&quot; here.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the person you argued with was a complete tool or perhaps he was trying to say something and you got the wrong end of the stick?<br />
<br />
And Faern, your ignorance and bigotry are stunning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm a Brit: I am aware that some Americans have paid for explosives used to blow up innocent men women and children, in Northen Ireland and in England.  Most of them did so without knowing that that was what their money was going to be used for.  <br />
<br />
One American blew up 100s of innocent people in his own country.  <br />
<br />
But I am also aware that the vast majority of Americans are decent people: there is no other nation on this planet I feel closer too.<br />

I'm British, and happy to be so, I have made friends in many countries since I started playing EQ, and many in the US.  <br />
<br />
I was at work when we heard about the twin towers, the whole office was in a state of disbelief.  Later in the evening I spoke to an EQ friend who lived within sight of the towers, speaking to people like him via EQ made the whole thing a lot more real, and a lot more personal.  <br />

I have lived and worked in America for 2 years, and several countries in Europe and Asia and I am a Brit. I have several friends in USA and other countries I am still in contact with.<br />
<br />
Y'all (hey, I can even get that right) sound like y'all are a person whose viewpoint of the outside world is based upon the worst of garbage spewed by the American far right wing.<br />
<br />
I won't even start to bother correcting some of your obvious misconceptions on USA foreign policy over the last 100 years (something obviously sadly lacking in your schooling - or even worse, deliberately suppressed and ignored, which may be the case). I don't have the time or inclination to bother with such a monumental task. <br />
<br />
Hint: No country ever uses their foreign policy out of the goodness of their heart, regardless of how often they state that is the reason. Foreign policy is dictated by &quot;How much benefit are we going to get out of this action&quot;, unless its a peanuts amount.<br />

End Quote. <br />
<br />
You have jumped right to the top of my list of international idiots.<br />
<br />
Final comment, and my apologies to reasonable americans who read this, any nation that allows its citizens (including children, women, old people) to die because they run out of money (read insurance) to pay for their healthcare has a big problem in justifying its position on being a &quot;1st World Nation&quot;. <br />
<br />
AFAIK USA is the ONLY 1st world nation that doesn't have a national health care system, they may not work too well at times but at least people who have no money have a good chance of surviving serious diseases/illnesses.<br />
<br />
I won't even bother debating this with you, as someone else said on this thread &quot;Never argue with an idiot, they will only drag you down to their level and beat you with years of experience&quot;<br />

1. Was I in the right or wrong to report him for that? <br />
On an absolute scale?  Wrong.  Here's the quote from the EQ Rules of Conduct that applies to your situation: <br />
<br />
&quot;2. You may not use any sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive language.&quot;<br />
<br />
The person you ratted out might have used &quot;ethnically offensive language,&quot; but I doubt it.  Sounds to me like he struck a nerve in you and instead of taking the high road and ignoring him, you reacted in the manner he hoped for.<br />
<br />
2. Im fairly certain that I got petitioned/and or reported for the swearing. Should I worry about this? <br />
Yes.  You clearly violated the ROC.  It's likely you now have a black mark on your account (they don't always tell you), but you most certainly won't be terminated for it (if it's your only offense to date).<br />
<br />

National Health Care System: Actually the United States has a system in place already. Every  major city in the United States has a County Hospital in which the poor can go and receive medical care at the cost of the tax payers. The poor also receive shelter and food at the cost of the tax payers as well. In our system you are rewarded with premium service if you can afford it. It's called capitalism a.k.a. the reward for working hard and being successful.</div></div><hr />

You know nothing about Europe - period.<br />
<br />
Sure, US and Europe have developed two different ways of live during the last centuries. Too sad, you decided the European one (of course different European countries have also different systems and life styles in details) is crap without knowing any real facts.<br />
<br />
For myself i cannot say, which way is 'better', i just feel OK with our way of life with all its strengths and weaknesses.<br />
<br />
Regarding 9/11, this guy joking about it was a complete moron imo. A very big majority of Europeans felt with America at this day and agreed and supported the later actions in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Don't believe this nonsense TV-shows about Europe or your politicians, who only use your biases and fears to get a few more percent at the next election.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Glad we went from heated debate to slinging namecalls.  Not like insults from anonymous people affect me one iota - but at least I get an idea of your mindset and intelligence level.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
won't even start to bother correcting some of your obvious misconceptions on USA foreign policy over the last 100 years (something obviously sadly lacking in your schooling - or even worse, deliberately suppressed and ignored, which may be the case). I don't have the time or inclination to bother with such a monumental task. <br />
<br />
<br />
Umm ok....the United States did NOT put 1,000,000 into the trenches of WW I?<br />
<br />
Umm ok...the United States did NOT carry the brunt of the Pacific and 1/2 of the European front in WWII?<br />
<br />
Umm ok...we DIDN'T spend BILLIONS of dollars to set you ungrateful fekkers back on your feet?<br />
<br />
Umm the new &quot;European defence force&quot;  does NOT simultaneously count troops already allocated to NATO?<br />
<br />
Umm the United States does not and has not had troops stationed in Europe for the past half century for the express purpose of keeping Western Europe and the USSR from going at it? <br />
(More likely Russia advancing over NATO.  The BEST worst case scenario had Russia at the English Channel in 2 weeks, the worst was 3 days.  This was discounting neutron bombs and the idiotic &quot;fall forward&quot; strategy of Western Planners)<br />
<br />
Please take the time, DEIGN to correct me on one of my points. Just ONE.<br />
<br />
 Besides, If America had gotten involved in the aformentioned conflicts earlier they would not have been so bad. <br />
<br />
Isolationism is not a good thing <br />
<br />
WW I  we needed an &quot;excuse&quot; to get involved.  WW II we had pilots and ships (You ever hear of &quot;Lend-Lease&quot;?) kicking butt circa 1939. (iirc)<br />
<br />
Isolationism is NOT a good thing, but neither is being the world's policeman.  If food weren't used as a weapon in places like Somalia we wouldn't have dead Rangers being drug through the streets of Mogadishu.<br />
<br />
Here's the rub - the United States DOESN'T get involved and we hear &quot;Ohh how can you say you're the worlds superpower dedicated to helping others when you allow all this suffering in Country X.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then when we DO help we hear shouts of &quot;Imperialist Capitalist, etc, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Make up your coffee sipping, black cloth wearing, crappy euro-trash techno house music listening to minds.<br />
<br />
What ticks me off is that places like Rwanda and Mozambique make Somalia look like Romper Room. But you don't see us in there trying to feed everyone.<br />
<br />
Fek all, why ARE we in Bosnia? If there EVER was a European conflict this is it. But Europe CAN'T or WON'T get involved. So the ball is handed to the US - AGAIN.<br />
<br />
The truth hurts. Hundreds of years of feeling superior is gone in a generation. There is one and ONLY one country on our planet that has the will, money, power and DESIRE to set things straight.<br />
And unless your birth certificate says &quot;United States&quot; it ain't yours.<br />
<br />
We had to fekking DRAG Europe (Other than the Brits) kicking and fekking screaming into Bosnia. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the Brits - there is some legend, rumor, grist that America (or Americans) funded the IRA. I've even read that McDonalds provided funds. PLEASE provide a link, a BOOK, a magazine, SOMETHING to back these claims. Now I grant you, American citizens, acting of their own free will may have sent money to neer-do-wells in Ireland for the purpose of doing harm to British Citizenry.<br />
<br />
Hey that ticks me off almost as much as it does you.  But if you think that September 11th was the ONLY time America has suffered a terrorist attack you need to quit reading  Der Spiegel  and pick up another news source.</div></div><hr />

Ever heard of Noraid?  It claims to be a charity, but:<br />

'In 1977, the U.S. Department of Justice made Noraid register officially as an agent of the Provisional IRA'<br />

<br />
Krup - um revisionism? Again, instead of slinging accusations, why don't you refute one of my points?<br />
<br />
1 - America put over 1 million men into the trenches to effectively end WW I<br />
<br />
2 - America carried the entire load in the Pacific (Britain and Russian iirc didn't even DECLARE war until post April 1945) and 1/2 of the European front. Via Lend-Lease we contributed 50 Destroyers to Britain and American pilots were flyign 2 years before Dec 7, 1941.<br />
<br />
3 - NATO was created to counter the growing Soviet threat. The United States contributes WAY MORE than its fair share of troops, money and resources while Europe continues to scale back while they fund their social welfare programs.<br />
<br />
4 - The situation in Bosnia had been going on for years before the United States got involved. It is now simmering, Miloslovich is on trial, and there is a tentative peace. <br />
<br />
5 - The Marshall plan contributed BILLIONS to countries we had been fighting just a few years before. More than any pathetic attempt by European countries to 'pull themselves up by their collective bootstraps' the Marshall plan was THE ingredient which allowed Europe to regain some measure of worth.<br />
<br />
BTW those BILLIONS (in 1949 monies) came from a country less than 175 years old, a former COLONY, of Great Britain. Stick that in your over priced wine and snobbery while you chow down on cheese along the  Champs de Eleysses .<br />
<br />
Again, you sling the term 'revisionist'...I'm just trying to determine which of my points I have altered from history?<br />
<br />
Oh and BTW I think Rush Limbaugh is an ignorant fat fek. True conservatives listen to people like Will, Buckley and D'Souza. Limbaugh is entertainment.<br />
<br />
Oh and as a Pro-Choice, Pro-handgun registration I'm laughing at your categorization of me as a Limbaugh fan.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to attempt to: a) refute my claims, or b) peg me into a hole because you're out of your league - both in this debate and because whatever european nation you call home is and WILL play second fiddle to the United States for as long as we both shall live.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Cayen - I was in the bazaar that afternoon...I was the one that pointed out that the plural of Shaman is Shaman (in amongst all the BL fanboi love and bashing).  Much hilarity ensued.<br />
<br />
I think you handled yourself with restraint, don't sweat it.  I was more upset about the idjit who insisted that Shaman weren't welcome in his grp because they slowed down the xp rate (you know who he is).<br />
<br />
To answer your 2 questions:<br />
Personally, I think you were wrong to /petition about the terrorism remarks...not because I agree with them, but because I think everyone should be able to say what they want, when they want.  That chucklehead shouldn't have been spouting off about terrorism in /ooc, but the EQ GMs shouldn't be called in to shut him down.<br />
<br />
I'm sure if you looked up info about The School of the Americas at Ft Benning, or our involvement in Guatemala, or Cuba, or Afghanistan or a myriad of other places during the Cold War you'll find out that America has done a lot of things I'm not proud of. Heck, look at the way we are handling Iraq right now.  But most countries have tons of dirt under the rug - we aren't any worse than all the rest. <br />
<br />
2. Don't sweat it about being petitioned.  GMs have much better things to do besides visit the bazaar everytime someone is cussing. :)  Or at least I HOPE they have better things to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Omg! so  the americans joined WW2 and defended Europe against Sovjet because they wanted to be friendly?<br />
<br />
Paah not very likely<br />
<br />
USA:s involment in WW2 was as much a defence of the world of democarcy as a defence of USA:s own land. <br />
<br />
The britts made the first move, after the Nazi attack on Polen someone had to stand up and say enough to Hitler, The Britts and France did. Not USA, they said, Europe have too handle this on their own, we will not get involved.<br />
<br />
No not before they got attacked themself the released their full force(they did supply Europe with weapons and some men before Pearl Harbor). <br />
<br />
I have to admit, if USA had decided not too interefer and the japanse could have made a clear thought and not attacked USA. The world would have looked alot different than today. <br />
<br />
In the end when all of Europe and Russia where conquered Hitler would have set his eyes one USA. That would have been a whole different war.<br />
<br />
Now, lucky for EVERYONE except for Hitler and his crazy men, USA were ruled by people not as shortsighted as you and were able to get support for a war against Hitler. Just remember, they didnt do it on their own and they did it also for USA:s own good.<br />
<br />
<br />
About the policy of defending West Europe against Sovjet, also called the cold war, was of greatest interest to USA. They tried in anyway they could hinder Sovjet and communism to spread in the world. It was not like Europe were begging USA to defend them against communism, that did USA take up on themself, gladly.<br />
<br />
Now its true that USA have pumped alot of money into the defence of Europe in different parts of history, but not only because Europe needed it, it as more political, ethical and economical reasons that simply steams from the reason that it is for the USA:s own good that Europe exits as it does today.<br />
