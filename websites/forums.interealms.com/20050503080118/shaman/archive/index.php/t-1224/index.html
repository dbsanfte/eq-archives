<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm wondering if anyone has parsed logfiles of fights with and without Cripple.<br />
<br />
What we know:<br />
-Cripple lowers proc rate of mobs due to the dex debuff<br />
-Cripple lowers a mobs Rampage and Flurry, supposedly because of the dex debuff too<br />
-Cripple does NOT lower max damage<br />
<br />
What we don't entirely know:<br />
-Does the AC and AGI debuff have any real effect on a mob?<br />
-Does the STR debuff lower avarage damage taken by the player?<br />
<br />
Our MA noticed a decrease on the avarage damage taken, though he didn't have parsed anything.<br />
<br />
Point of discussion is: Is it worth casting Cripple on high level mobs that don't proc, flurry or rampage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whether or not the AGI/STR debuffs does anything is tied to whether or not MOBs can be affected by stats.<br />
<br />
It's fairly easy to check that pets and MOBs are NOT affected by change in Stamina (just cast the buff on your pet or on a charmed MOB... no more HP after than before). From this you can reasonnably infer that STR and AGI won't be really impacting the MOBs either.<br />
<br />
AC, on the other hand, is alays good to debuff, especially with those extremely high-AC MOBs in Luclin.<br />
<br />
And Cripple gives something to do in raids to the 3rd shaman/enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jonaman, those are very hard questions to quantify, because the effects are interrelated in some aspects.<br />
<br />
I can confirm that the AC/AGI debuff component DOES make a difference.  Want a good check?  Go to the Deep, and cripple an underbulk.  You'll notice immediately that your tanks average damage per hit rises.  However, since agi also affects AC . . . well, you can see why it's going to be all but impossible to check the results of stats versus pure AC.<br />
<br />
The strenth debuff is harder to see.  Frankly, I have crippled a lot of mobs looking for a change, and I have never noticed that the mob damage was any less after crippling.  My guess is that the strength component has no effect on mob damage, or so little effect that it isn't noticeable.<br />
<br />
For all practical purposes, cripple can help to mitigate damage in 2 ways.  One, your group can kill the mob faster because they can hit it harder and more often, and two, the mob won't proc as much.  The melee damage the mob produces doesn't seem to be affected by strength.<br />
<br />
As for crippling high level mobs that don't proc, flurry, or rampage . . . I'd say probably not, unless it has a very high AC.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I make it a practice to cripple every raid level mob (or other particularly hard mob) if I can land it without too much trouble. I am going on faith that it actually does something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cripple can do wonders, we have the 3rd shaman on our raid hand out massive ammounts of copper pieces to mobs and then cast cripple.  They become way encoumbered and end up taking massive amounts of damage when we kite them down steps ect.</div></div><hr />

Cripple a level 30ish old world mob. It can barely move from it's own weight. Add esnare and you have a permanent 10 min root.</div></div><hr />
