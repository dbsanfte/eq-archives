Wonder if it's a mistake and if it isn't, what's the new cap?!?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it's true..alchemy 205 atm.It appears that 205 is the new level-based cap.<br />
<br />
Just did about 45 combines and got to 205, did another 100 and stayed at 205.<br />
<br />
The level based skill cap that we all understood while we were levelling up is:<br />
<br />
AlchemyCap = (PlayerLevel - 24) x 5<br />
<br />
So cap for a level 65 should  always have been 205, it was always dumb that they locked it at 200.<br />
<br />
It could very well be that SOE has simply corrected their previous mistake of setting a hard cap at 200, and have set a new hard cap at 205.<br />
<br />
But it could also be that they have simply removed the arbitrary cap of 200, while leaving the formula alone.  That will mean that a level 65 shaman will have alchemy skill capped at 205.  But a level 66 shaman will cap at 210, level 67 215, and so on to level 70 where the level cap would be 230.<br />
<br />
The skeptical part of me says that this is a lure to all those shaman who have cancelled their accounts:  now they can come back and get their alchemy skill up to 230 ...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Only question about this theory, couldn't you get to 200 alchemy at level 60?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, I think that the 200 was an artificial cap imposed upon us . . . not supported by any formula at all.<br />
<br />
My interpretation of this change is that it was a correction pre-OoW.  I'd guess that we'll be able to get 230 skill at L70.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't anyway...  Only hit 200 at lvl64.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you could only get to 180.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This could just be them unlocking the 200 cap in preparation for the level raise, and subsequent skill max raise, of omens.</div></div><hr />
