<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see the new cleric Yaulp V and hammer combination as a great thing for clerics.  Its about time for them to get a breath of fresh air.<br />
<br />
It occurs to me that this new melee ability for priests shouldn't stop at clerics.  At levels above 50, a shaman can't melee effectively.  Some would say, so what?  Naysayers aside, there's an easy fix.<br />
<br />
Why not tweak Voice of the Berzerker to make it similar to Yaulp V?  Perhaps some adjustment might also be made to Rage for lower post 50 shamans.<br />
<br />
This melee adjustment for shamans would restore the noble role of battle shaman to many of us who grew up on it in our formative years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh id love to be able to melee some. Sure i can take the hits but i sure cant dish them out. I'm not looking for super fighting ablility i just sometimes wish i could hit more consistantly. I bought a tae ew war maul to work my warriors 2hb up and also my shaman's. <br />
<br />
     2hblunt hit 180 today and i proceded to whiff 10 times in a row. Follow by two shots of over 100 than 3 whiffs followed by a mighty chrush of 13 points. Hitting over a 100 is rare drop. Missing is very common drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As nice as it would be, unless clerics got even more upgrades, this would just undo the &quot;balancing&quot; that they are putting in place by letting clerics have some melee skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They're trying to give Clerics some better soloing ability, as the new heal for Druids/Shamans means less desirability for Clerics in experience groups. Shamans can already solo very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont take my comments wrong. I'm quite happy with what i can do and if we could melee to much throw balance off. Just wish thinking/longing? since i had spent quite a bit of time lately catching my 2hb up to max it with piercing. But yes mine was just wishful thinking and not saying i think we should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree, just let us do damage close to a JBB and not only would it get the lizards off our back, we'd also have a bit more fun than clicking 'the bracer &lt;tm&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">shaman already have yaulp 5 (actually, an even better effect). it just works slightly differently.<br />
<br />
Yaulp 5: boost ATK, 25% haste, some piddly mana regen<br />
<br />
Celerity: WAY MORE than 25% haste<br />
Cann IV + Regrowth: WAY MORE mana/tick<br />
Rage and assorted other stat buffs: if your ATK with these won't pass a cleric's with Y5 you got some issues.<br />
<br />
Now it's true we don't have to mash yaulp 5 every 24 seconds to get these effects, instead we have to hit regrowth and rage every 10 minutes or so and cann 4 whenever we feel like it. but that's hardly something to complain about.<br />
<br />
Oh, and we don't get uber hammers... wait, yes we do, they just aren't NORENT :p<br />
<br />
has anybody on test verified that clerics with the new upgrades actually HIT significantly more often than shaman do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">has anybody on test verified that clerics with the new upgrades actually HIT significantly more often than shaman do?<br />
<br />
The weapon at least is supposed to proc more often than other weapons and since you can get a proc even with a miss, I'd hazard a guess that the cleric does indeed do some decent damage in comparison to a shaman.  Anyone heard anything about this from the folks on Test?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think the key point is whether or not there is an improved hit frequency for clerics with their new abilities.  If two clerics can hold a camp in CT with the new abilities, then I'd say their melee skills surpass a shaman's.<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for much.  Just a little tweak to make meleeing worthwhile again for a shaman (post 50), should they choose to do so.  I'd rather have the option of meleeing instead of JBBing to do damage.<br />
<br />
Besides, our scaly brother and sister shamans would really benefit from such a tweak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I just wish they would up the melee ability of priests across the board. There's no logical reason why I shouldnt be able to melee at least somewhat effectively with an AC of 1021, ATK of 1015, Str/Dex/Agi/Sta all 205-255, and ~2400 hps. That's better than most melees in their early 50s have, yet green mobs that they mow through, I have to lose 1/3-1/2 my life to kill.<br />
<br />
Do I think we should do damage like melees? No. Do I think we should be able to clear trash that doesnt give us xp without expending excessive amounts of mana for slowing, rooting, and healing? Yes.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, this isnt a huge issue, but it is something that would increase my enjoyment of the game without seemingly upsetting game balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with Tyric. Priest classes are ahead of possibly only Enchanters when it comes to the ability to continuously clear greens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Does make me laugh how adamant some people are about not improving the shaman class in anyway.  Yes, we are one of the more balanced classes out there, but that doesnt mean people cant hope for something to add a bit more fun and something new to a class that has remained relatively the same for a long time.  The problem is that whilst we are balanced now, if they improve everyone else using us as a base we are gonna end up like warriors, only our defensive disc is gonna be slow.<br />
<br />
I love playing my shaman, I am exceptionally glad that I chose him, but at the end of the day I am the same as most people, I like to get new stuff, especially when everyone else does.  That was the biggest dissappointment with Luclin for me.  We got no interesting new spells, everything just seemed to be for convenience), our aa abilities arent exactly exciting - Rabid Bear would be great if it was 15 mins long with a re-use time of half an hour or something.<br />
<br />
Not meaning to rant, but I just get frustrated when they chuck out loads of stuff for everyone but shaman, then when shaman ask for something people jump on em saying 'No, that isnt fair to xx class' and if we get something they say 'Nah, dont want it'.  Just remember that someone else might, and they have every bit as much of a right to want something for shaman as you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love bonking things with heavey pieces of wood.<br />
<br />
The &quot;melee&quot; damage clerics are getting on test is going to rely on procs FAR more than physical damage. I heard somewhere they clock anywhere from 20-40 DPS max hasted, which is not that bad, and giving them a higher damage potential will make them more likely to get into easy exp camps where damage is the only thing that matters.<br />
<br />
If it IS 20-40, it would also be a fair indication that the procs are pretty sporadic. Personally I think clerics should get something even if druids and shamans didn't get the new 75hs, simply because it's THE most singular class in the game and is utterly lacking in the department of &quot;fun&quot;, imo.<br />
<br />
I think the only way to add to our melee ability would be raising Offense/weapon caps, or giving us double attack (capped like 100 or something) but honestly I don't think it's very likely. Right now I'd be happy if they made Rabid Bear refresh in, say, 20-30min instead of 2 hours.</div></div><hr />
