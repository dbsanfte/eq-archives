<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In Najena there are mobs called &quot;a skeleton&quot;.  These always aggro, and are in the 22-26 range.  They are tough without a partner, and probably impossible unless twinked solo, but they are anywhere from 3/4 to a full blue per kill solo.  Even with a partner, I got 3/4 a blue from a yellow one, and half a blue from a blue one.  Loot consists of small ringmail and bronze daggers.  And if you can get a pally or SK, they can pick up their Hilt of the Nobleman, part of the Ghoulbane quest.  There are 4 of these, one near the area where you turn off to go downstairs to the ogers and Bonecracker.  Just go in the other doorway, it'll aggro on you.  The other 3 are in a nice package near the pool.  One is right before the pool room, the other is to the left of the pool room, the other is in the room, on the other side of the pool.  Nice exp and decent loot, and can take you all the way to dog dog.  Najena has an EXP bonus too, so this is a sweet little camp for a while.  Some will probably turn LBlue at 29 or 30, haven't gotten there yet, but it's a nice camp, as Najena is usually empty.</div></div><hr />
