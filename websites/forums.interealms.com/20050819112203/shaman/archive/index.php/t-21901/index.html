<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">FYI<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2004-06-10%2018:02:45<br />
<br />
Highlights:<br />
<br />
- Q now 420 hp per tick for 280 mana.<br />
- BoT now 630 per tick for 420 mana. (wow)<br />
- Regen spells bumped up 15-20 hp/tick and 25-40 hp/tick.<br />
- Omen stat buffs changed to % effects. (woot).<br />
<br />
For example,<br />
<br />
Champion<br />
<br />
Increase ATK by 160 <br />
4:  Increase Damage Modifier by 10% <br />
5:  Increase AGI by 160 <br />
6:  Increase STR by 160 <br />
7:  Increase DEX by 160 <br />
<br />
And others have similar upgrades.  Damn, they may just make me eat crow.  Just maybe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Say, that *is* encouraging. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">06-10 18:02 Changed 'Cast on you' message from &quot;You recall the pain and knowledge of your ancestors.&quot; to &quot;Ancestral spirits tear through your body.&quot;  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">These are nice improvements, but I was hoping for something beyond incremental changes.  For example, an FA replacement that lasts more than 6.5 mins (as champion does) or that can be cast on a group.  <br />
<br />
When mobs go up in power, incremental changes will be largely negated I would think.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they have something new for us that has not gotten to test yet - we can always hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well its better, though for alot this changes are chnage that affect all classes that have that spell so its not a increase seperate to us, but still good.<br />
however  i still wait and see, as they can chnage them back just as easy, it funny that we had to scream at them to actually get stuff done though. alot this chnages should have been months ago. (not OOW obviuosly)<br />
<br />
i still want to see how our dots/dd etc ahd dircect heals pan out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hey hey this is a start, they are listening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, it's a start, but it's not what the finished product should be YET. <br />
<br />
But then I guess we get to forget that there's levels before 70 with this expansion, just like we did with PoP...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice changes :)<br />
<br />
They seem to have removed the overbuff components and replaced them with the original offensive/defensive modifiers, which will greatly increase their value. I can see that AGI buffs are going to become in demand by tanks again  :D <br />
<br />
The regen changes are interesting. They have reached the point where they will completely negate the DoT effects on some AEs (such as those in the RC event for example) for many characters.<br />
<br />
I notice that Champion wont stack with one of the monks discs (ashenhand), which might be interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">- Omen stat buffs changed to % effects. (woot).<br />
<br />
<br />
That alone looks very promising to me. Lets see if it makes it to Live servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Trushar (as well as Holy Elixir) heals 50% more.<br />
Good change, although I would like to see us closer to clerics.<br />
<br />
Agi is back to avoidance (7% though).<br />
Very nice. I am not sure if that really is a 7% chance to avoid each hit though. If it is, good spell.<br />
<br />
Str is back to +damage (5%).<br />
Again, this is what it needs to do.<br />
<br />
Avatar is back to +damage (10%).<br />
I still think with the absolutely pain in the ass that avatar is it needs to do more. This is a nice change though.<br />
<br />
Fizzle adjustment on cannibalize lowered.<br />
Good. Now lower it again and again and again. For every cannibalize spell in the game. Or just get rid of fizzles completely.<br />
<br />
The amazing new Omens regen now heals 60 per tick.<br />
Well, I guess it might be worth casting in experience groups now.<br />
<br />
So far so good. I would still like to see a similar effect for stamina. And we will need a decent heal, nuke and DoT. But this is encouraging at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">These changes are an excellent start.<br />
Toss in a modest increase to the blast heal,<br />
a small resist modifier on the magic based dots,<br />
a reduction in dd cast times,<br />
and I would say we are really getting somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">good changes so far, but will they go the distance  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">*happy dance*<br />
<br />
If Champion can be increased to a 30 minute duration, I might swoon.</div></div><hr />

a small resist modifier on the magic based dots,<br />

I really think we need more then that.<br />
<br />
Upgrade us to what druids spot heal for now, then up druid healing. Feel free to give clerics invis and DoTs.<br />
<br />
Up DoT damage by 100%.<br />
Alternatively Make the Bane line unresistable and low aggro and add a -50 resist modifier to the poison line. Upping the dmage would not hurt either.<br />
<br />
Then up our nukes to match cleric nukes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Champion can be increased to a 30 minute duration, I might swoon.<br />
I would be happy with a group champion AA. I like the effect, it just does not seem powerful enough to tie up a spell gem and to have to recast it every coupe of minutes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We can buff 60 regen a tick, so combine that with the warder's regen and we can hit about a 120 continual?  If so, that'd be pretty dang nifty in groups, AE raids and solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That, Miss Vigdis, is the most intelligent thing I have read on these boards in a long time, and I mean it. <br />
<br />
Preliminary or not, they're moving in the right direction. Will they keep it up? Dunno, but I'm encouraged. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm shocked.  A couple of those changes will affect me too.  Didn't expect them to go down to level 55 spells. :D <br />
<br />
I recently stopped wasting mana on Regrowth since it didn't really seem to help any more than having the 300 mana for an extra heal.  I'll have to re-evaluate that now. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think the proper phrase here is &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot;.<br />
<br />
Looks like a good step in the right direction . . . but will they continue to go far enough both in continued tuning of these spells and in the other needs we have.<br />
<br />
So far they've really done nothing but ensure that buff bot Shaman will still exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cautiously optimistic&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Crap, and I deleted my shaman, I might just have to restart one :)</div></div><hr />

Still withholding judgment until I see burst healing improved substantially. I would also like some improvement in useful dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yeah make Avatar a longer duration PLEASE...30 minutes at least.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hmm BoT mana change is quite a bit more than old BoT, making canni5 even more inefficient to heal back (although I supposed you could argue with new regen spell you can just let yourself regen back and not bother healing). However, I am happy that they are atleast bothering to make a change to our spells.</div></div><hr />

[In the Shamans Crucible]<br />
Shaman Elder 1: This is where all our work is done.<br />
<br />
Young Shaman 1: So what are you gonna do with all these parses you do?<br />
<br />
Shaman Elder 1: Collecting parses is just phase one. Phase one: collect parses.<br />
<br />
Young Shaman 1: So what's phase two?<br />
     [Silence]<br />
<br />
Shaman Elder 1: Hey, what's phase two?!<br />
<br />
Shaman Elder 2: Phase one: we collect parses.<br />
<br />
Shaman Elder 1: Ya, ya, ya. But what about phase two?<br />
     [Silence]<br />
<br />
Shaman Elder 2: Well, phase three is class balance. Get it?<br />
<br />
Young Shaman 2: I don't get it.<br />
<br />
Shaman Elder 2: (Goes over to a chart on the wall) You see, Phase one: collect parses, phase two-<br />
     [Silence]<br />
<br />
Shaman Elder 2: Phase three: class balance.<br />
<br />
Young Shaman 3: Oh I get it.<br />
<br />
Young Shaman 1: No you don't.<br />
<br />
Young Shaman 2:You guys dont know anything about SoE do you?<br />
<br />
Shaman Elder 2: You bet we do.<br />
<br />
Shaman Elder 1: Us Elder shamans are geniuses at dealing with SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yeah make Avatar a longer duration PLEASE...30 minutes at least. Or better yet make it a group spell. Rangers get group attack buff spells that are a good percentage of avatar, that they can MGB. Why not us?<br />
<br />
To be specific, a Ranger can cast Spirit of the Predator + Strength of Tunare which last one hour (actually one lasts more, I forget which).<br />
<br />
These two buffs yield a resultant +130 ATK bonus, which is 92.8% of FA.  In addition, those two buffs also provide +400 HP.<br />
<br />
But, FA is overpowered right?   :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
(btw - Litgruv brought teh funnay stick out.  ns.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ancient Curse of Mori:<br />

Mana: 	1040 <br />
Classes: 	NEC/70<br />
Duration: 	5 ticksNice that they're looking at making DoTs do more per tick possibly... but that is pretty out of whack mana cost wise, seeing as it does less damage than Core Fire and costs more mana ~_~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Nice to see changes for the better. I've got some new hope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about &quot;Oversoul&quot; or something? heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Does this make us more desired in Raids?<br />
<br />
Will this make us more desired in LDoN hards?<br />
<br />
I am not sure, but we cannot just look a upgrades directed at us.  We must see how these changes improve our position relative to other classes.<br />
<br />
If Beastlords and Enchanters are still better bets for slowing and Druids and Clerics can handle all healing on a raid without our help then this is not really much help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Dreamx2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Progess is good those changes might benefit the low end player or raider.<br />
As far as the high end player goes imo on raids i almost always push the buff limit so more buffs wouldnt benefit me much. ive still seen to progress on dots in a high end raid situation frankly i cant use them on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">As much as I want to see this as a good start, I just don't see them getting things fixed. <br />
<br />
Shamans are in dire need of a DPS upgrade, yet look at this:<br />
<br />
Bane(Level 64) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4095&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
the Necro equivalent:<br />
<br />
Horror(Level 63) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4098&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
and the respective upgrades to the line planned for OoW:<br />
<br />
Shaman: Ancestral(Level 69) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5412&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Necro: Dark Nightmare(Level 67) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5432&amp;source=Test)<br />
<br />
So the Shaman version is now TWO levels higher than the Necro version and while the direct Shaman upgrade sees a increase in power of 30%, the Necro one is 55.8% more effective than their respective LDoN curse.<br />
<br />
Of course Necros get a second upgrade to Horror as well, which is 86% more powerful than their top LDoN curse.<br />
<br />
What kind of reasoning is behind design decisions like that I will probably never understand. I have to add that I think the Necro upgrades are perfectly fine and in line, it's the Shaman version that, once again, is lacking.</div></div><hr />

Since those wimpy Barbarian gods already have Talisman of the Tribunal and Focus of the Seventh the other shaman races need some names now.<br />

I propose<br />
Avatar of Zek (avatar for ogres)<br />
Agility of the Vah Shir (agi for the cats)<br />
Marr's Stability (stamina for the frogloks)<br />
Curse of Innoruuk (DoT for the trolls)<br />

<br />
HoT spells do NOTHING for burst dps management.  I can't say that enough.  It's a patch.  That's 6 seconds on pounding.  Want to figure what that is on named mobs in ikkinz single group trials?<br />
<br />
The buffs?  Ummm . . . so what?  Exactly how is that going to make us more groupable?  Buff-bots can do all of the above.<br />
<br />
Until we see substantive changes in burst heals, and dps, we're still screwed.  Necro DoTs are going up, but notice ours have been going down?  Anyone remember that nice little 709 to 439 a tic change from all of 2 days ago?  Seen any changes to our nukes or rains?  Notice any of our DoTs doing 600+/tic?  700?  Nope, me either.<br />

I don't care for any more placebo's thanks.  These help, but they're not even close to a solution.<br />

He wants to give us better HoTs,  yeah well the cleric ones will probably still be better and still overwrite ours I bet.   The buffs are great yeah, but give me something to do that is fun for me to do .. like oh i dunno do DAMAGE?!?    I just feel so useless right now in GoD and even in elementals.   I don't see anyone asking me to join them in their groups (and these are guild members), yet I see the beastlords grouped almost constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I'd have to agree.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I am not all that convinced that the Damage Modifier on spells like Champion are actually giving the target X%(10% in the case of Champion) of DPS increase. <br />
Damage calculation is based on the Damage Bonus, the Damage Interval and the mitigation(let's call it AC) of the target you are hitting. The first one is a fixed value depending on the weapon, the second and the 3rd criterion are heavily RNG dependant and only affected by ATK and levels.<br />
<br />
That said, the 10% Damage Modifier will hardly take the end result and multiply it with 10%. At this point, I'd have to assume that it might give a 10% modification on the DI roll or is there any indication for how Damage Modifications work(Discs etc.)?</div></div><hr />

Buffs have been halfway adressed (need haste, stamina and focus still)<br />

Do we still need more? Absolutely.<br />
Should we complain when we do get something worthwhile? In my opinion, no.</div></div><hr />

A number of melee discs have increase damage modifiers on them. Fellstrike for example has 100% increase to the damage modifier (it also has a 400% increase to the min damage modifier). Max hit with my BoW goes from 321 (crits at ~510) to around 640 or so. I'd have to check the actual numbers when I get home, but that is about right. I think it basically just increases the hit damage by whatever the % it is. With felstrike, I crit for around 1010 and crip at around 1600 (again, roughly twice a normal crip).</div></div><hr />

I'd be very interested in the exact numbers. I have a hard time believing that this is a straight modifier to the damage result, but I'd like it to be that way obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Well I think the thing that annoys me most is they kept the heal % the same over everyting EXCEPT Shaman heal as well as Druids up till level 58. Where Druids jump higher in heals.<br />
<br />
I wont begrudge the Druids anything in fact I am happy they got more healing. The part I dont get is why Druids heal more?<br />
We had slows then we have them now nothing changed except we now heal less.<br />
<br />
Druid OoW nuke:<br />
<br />
2420 hp for 605 mana 6.35 second cast and 2.2 recast.<br />
<br />
Shaman OoW DoT:<br />
546 hp a tick for 6 ticks for 612 mana 5.5 second with a 24 second recast.<br />
<br />
I wont even do the math VERY clear who is doing more DPS here... Druids hands down. Especially when there is more focus for DD vs DoTs.<br />
<br />
When you compare the 2 classes<br />
Druid &gt; DPS<br />
Druids are much less aggro on DPS as well.<br />
Druid &gt; Healing<br />
Buffs are about equal really... I mean you could nit pick it and argue it but no point really balances out in the end.<br />
<br />
So you pit slow against snare and ports....<br />
Shrug I consider that a fairly reasonable trade off.<br />
Again it could be argued but why?<br />
<br />
Not take into consideration we never got our second cheal upgrade.<br />
Ratio is broken right there. Period.<br />
Cheal compared to cheal we lost our ratio and they wont even discuss it.<br />
<br />
Now the ONLY reason to chose a Shaman is if you need slow and cant get a Chanter or BL or hell even Bard to replace us.<br />
<br />
In comparison the healing ratios need to be adjusted...<br />
I dont care if I heal as well as a Druid or or not but our ratio just sucks.<br />
<br />
We are just broken on so many levels at this point its not funny.<br />
<br />
The changes on Lucy are a good start but they need to fix more than our stat buffs and HoT to truly fix us.<br />
<br />
They need to give us a better heal ratio to maybe 10-15% less than a Druid, and Druids 10-15% less than Clerics ideally.<br />
The bare min on that is they need to give us our cheal back.<br />
<br />
They need to remove these stupid recasts let my mana and aggro rule my DPS not insane recast times.<br />
I mean it is just anal to make us pay high aggro, high mana cost and high recast times for our DPS.<br />
Remove all our anal recasts even the new slow...<br />
I mean SERIOUSLY the aggro and mana costs are enough of a penalty without the recasts.<br />
<br />
Leave the stats on the stat buffs (same level as the old buffs) AND give us a modifier like we have now on the spells.<br />
That way we dont screw those few still not capped or those capped.<br />
<br />
Review the recast and duration of Avatar line.<br />
<br />
I am not done fighting them yet just because they toss us a few bones.<br />
They need to get their head out of their ass and realize they can fix us without drastically breaking other classes and that we ARE broken atm.</div></div><hr />

Looking at the bright side of things is fine but remember that SoE has to please you, not the other way around. (And this is still doing a piss poor job in the shaman balance departement as only trivial issues are changed and not anything major)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Now apply the %damage change to Ferine Avatar as well.  And apply the %damage to our focus buffs as well, retroactively all the way back to Harnessing of Spirit.  Shaman need serious help, and there is no reason to be so freaking obvious as to not have the changes apply to all that line of spells.  <br />
<br />
Also, my ultimatum remains.  Improve shaman blast healing to EQUAL druid blast healing.  OR, remove slow abilities from BST, ENCH, and BRD. <br />
Either one will balance us in GoD.  For those who say druids will be pushed out, remember that they still have evacs which are dang handy at times, much stronger nukes (enough to be DPS), and POT9 mana regen.  Druid desirability will remain consistent.  Shaman desirability will get a boost up to be competitive with BST, BARD, and ENCH.  Not exactly the same with BRD and ENCH since those classes can mez, ENCH can charm for massive DPS, and BRD can pull, but surely we can at least compete then with BST.<br />
<br />
And MOST importantly, we will once again be able to perform as the secondary healer for a group.  A function we NEVER SHOULD HAVE LOST!!!<br />
<br />
That's the absolute MINIMUM that will be satisfactory for balancing shamans in GoD and beyond.</div></div><hr />

It through me off.<br />

Naturally, I assumed it was decreasing attack speed (aka a slow).<br />

But removed means they obviously took away that aspect. <br />

yes that would be better, and it would scale itself to the user of the buff, making it appropriate for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">A number of melee discs have increase damage modifiers on them. Fellstrike for example has 100% increase to the damage modifier (it also has a 400% increase to the min damage modifier). Max hit with my BoW goes from 321 (crits at ~510) to around 640 or so. I'd have to check the actual numbers when I get home, but that is about right. I think it basically just increases the hit damage by whatever the % it is. With felstrike, I crit for around 1010 and crip at around 1600 (again, roughly twice a normal crip).<br />

IF it works like most effects in EQ all +damage modifiers will be added up, then applied to the &quot;normal&quot; damage.<br />
<br />
Thus a +100% disc and a +5% buff will probably give a +105% effect.</div></div><hr />

thats not that much of anything, if it was 5% befor or after, instead of being added into the original problem, then it would have been good, as it is now, it looks like a buff i might only cast on rangers and rogues.</div></div><hr />

Sure, you need more of us for buffing (focus + new agi + new daiku + new sta) but once this part is done (by bots?) nothing has changed to make us stack better.<br />
<br />
Having more usefull buffs means of course either swaping spells like mad or make a spell set to keep all buffs memed at the costs of 0 DPS.<br />
<br />
How about this:<br />
<br />
oow_focus: +raw HP, +HP regen, +END regen<br />
oow_stat_buff: +str, +dex, +agi, +sta (situatinal for zones like uqua or fights like TT in PoTime)<br />
oow_offensive_buff: +attack, +melee_damage, +accuracy / proc rate / strike through<br />
oow_defensive_buff: +shielding, +avoidance, +dodge / block / reposite<br />

Well, I could even imagine that the offensive and the defensive buff do _not_ stack  if SOE think both together are to powerfull. But let the buffs last for 1h at least!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Numbers before and after fellstrike are:<br />
<br />
Normal melee<br />
Min hit: 39 (lowest number I saw anyway)<br />
Max hit: 321<br />
Max crit: 528<br />
Max crip: not determined, but in the 800+ range<br />
<br />
Disc melee<br />
Min hit: 229<br />
Max hit: 605<br />
Max crit: 1011<br />
Max crip: not determined, but those I've seen previously were around the mid 1600s<br />
<br />
Getting crips with fellstrike is difficult because of the timing involved and the low probability of getting a crip then, so I cant give exact figures for those.<br />
<br />
<br />
A regular max is bonus + damage, or 37 + 284 = 321<br />
<br />
Hits with the 100% to damage modifier appear to be something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
Bonus + 2*damage, ie 37 + 2*284 = 605<br />
<br />
I'm not too sure what the deal with the min hits is, fellstrike also has a 400% min damage modifier, which is why the min is so much larger than regular min.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it would seem that a 10% to damage modifier would have the equation:<br />
<br />
Bonus +1.1*damage, ie a max of 37 + 1.1*284 = 349 for a BoW.<br />
The percentage increase would be largest for max hits and least for min hits, because the damage bonus apparently isnt included.<br />
<br />
So a max hit would have 28 more damage, or about 8.7% more damage.<br />
A min hit though would have 0 additional damage so the actual dps increase would probably depend largely on whether your hits are closer to min or closer to max. In most cases we'll probably see about 4-5% more dps from the buff (assuming it works this way of course).</div></div><hr />

 or possible this is one of the &quot;new type of debuff&quot; and might have a less chance to proc or double attack?<br />
<br />
however, though these change are great, it should be remeber that certainly the healing types they have change this for ALL class that have them, even beast and ranger have the better regen spells. there fore shaman havent actually improved against the rest in this repesct , though it should till help alittle.<br />
<br />
still the %modifier is a start, i would still perfer stats and hp ac alltogether on one spell. then attack (possible some hp) %modifer and skill increase on a fw others.. i not sure having 8 or more buffs which poeple will need , if they do it via aa, alot of aa to actually benefit from, at the moment i clicking of stam,agil dex str so i can get other better buffs.<br />
<br />
btw i rem someone saying that a debuff that affect double attack or whaterver would give same problems as slow, it wouldnt it is much easier to tune fights to partial debuffs than a full debuff like slow.<br />
and if done correctly it could have noticeable effects , which is what shaman need. the only problem i see is that with only 8 gems i just wont have enough gems to load up all these spells, and i think that is something SOE should consider. Perhaps slow amd malos in 1 spells would be way to go, if immune then just the malos part hits maybe? if that was possible?<br />
but i do forsee our problems with lack of gems increases out of control if we/they not careful</div></div><hr />

so, the damage range increased from 321 - 39 = 282 to 605 - 229 = 376. That is a straight increase in damage range by one third (by upping the damage modifer by 100%). That means champion would most likely up the range by 3% (plus the value of ATK). The new Str buff would up the damage range by 1.5%. Total damage increase will most likely be between 0.5 and 1%.<br />
<br />
That is, IF the effect works like that. If it does though it needs to be more. The str line should up total damage done by at least 3% for it to be worth casting at all. 5% would be a lot more in line though.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the changes are &quot;positive&quot; and said so in my first post under this thread, but I have no sympathy for Rytan.

The BoW has a DB of 37 and the DI(~2-284).<br />
<br />
Min Hit(without disc): 39 = 37(DB) + ~2(DI(min))<br />
Max Hit(without disc): 321 = 37(DB) + ~284(DI(max))<br />
<br />
Max Hit(with disc): 605 = 37(DB) + (~284(DI(max))*2(Fellstrike))<br />
<br />
Note that I am not really sure why the DI(min) is that low, but by just using Tugela's numbers and applying them to the max Hits, I am deducing that the Damage Mod from buffs will be directly applied to the DI.</div></div><hr />

Talk about a bunch of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  The fun issue was not addressed.  The stacking issue was not addressed.  The fact that we're the least desirable of the slowing classes was not addressed.<br />

It was as if they took our list of concerns and avoided them as much as possible.  I'm glad they're trying, but I'm not sure they could've missed by a larger margin.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that there are so many deficiencies that we have to focus on one and the healing one is the most flawed due to the numbers given by Rytan. I am willing to bet Rytan wished he had never talked about healing percentages.</div></div><hr />

I'll admit I stopped play EQ just before LDON so my experience is a little out of date, but I did start well before the Kunark expansion.  It still amazes me how little we have asked for.  And on top of that, every time we do ask for upgrades, we have a bunch of community members which argue against it.  You know why Q only healed the same as Torpor?  Because we asked for it.  A number of shm specifically said that it could be the same, as long as it worked out of group it would be good.  Same applied for most of our lame 'upgrades'.  This is why shaman are in the state they are today.  DON'T ask for upgrades which are good enough for NOW, ask for upgrades which will be good enough for the NEW CONTENT!<br />

Stat buffs are crap, we've known this since Kunark.  Their only redeming feature is that the vast majority of people still though they mattered despite parses on these boards, steel warriors, safehouse, etc...  Melees reaching the cap just made them worth even less than crap.  These new % modifiers are just a dusting of icing sugar but it's still the same...<br />

Good luck with the game.</div></div><hr />

Damage increasing buffs in this and in pretty much every game I ever played are screwed up anyways. Any haste type spell will scale by itself, there is no need for better and better haste spells.<br />
That being said adding 5% to the DPS of 3 people in your group or 20 on your raid is certainly a decent effect. That is all I ask from my buffs - a decent effect. Not necessarily as big an impact as haste but something you can easily see in parses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">so, the damage range increased from 321 - 39 = 282 to 605 - 229 = 376. That is a straight increase in damage range by one third (by upping the damage modifer by 100%). That means champion would most likely up the range by 3% (plus the value of ATK). The new Str buff would up the damage range by 1.5%. Total damage increase will most likely be between 0.5 and 1%.<br />
<br />
That is, IF the effect works like that. If it does though it needs to be more. The str line should up total damage done by at least 3% for it to be worth casting at all. 5% would be a lot more in line though.<br />
<br />
Well. thats how it works with fellstrike, but the buff wont have the min damage modifier the disc has, so the range in the absence of that would be 38 (39?) to 605 if only the 100% damage modifier were applied. <br />
<br />
Fellstrike increases your dps by more than 100% because of the min damage modifier. The 10% mod on the buff won't have that advantage but the avaerage magnitude will be a lot larger than your estimate.<br />
<br />
It all depends on what you are fighting of course. The effect would be most pronounced in xp groups or trash clearing, but relatively minimal on boss mobs for example.<br />
<br />
To put it in perspective, in most current content I hit closer to max much more frequently than min. When I was looking for min/max values last night I had a hard time finding min hits, while max hits were pretty common. Since that is what ultimately what affects the dps increase, I expect that the average dps increase will be decent for current content. Less for boss mobs though, where you tend to hit on the lower end if you hit at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I am not 100% sure how and where that damage increase is applied. I based my calculations on the increase in damage range, that is the difference between minimum and maximum damage.<br />
<br />
I expected a +100% buff to increase that range by 100%. It does not. It increases it by 33%. Accordingly a +5% buff will most likely increase damage range by 1.7%. The effect on overall damage is going to be lower then that as the minimum damage is not increased.<br />
<br />
Now, the effect might work differently. It just does not look like it does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I beg to differ with you a little bit Philni, I think the reason Sony is listening now is that they are finally deeply concerned about losing customers to the upcoming games.  I think a lot of people discount Gloriana's &quot;relationship building&quot; in San Diego and expected immediate results like a light bulb would pop up in the spell guys mind. It starts with getting their attention and results happen with thoughtful posts (not rants).<br />
<br />
I fully expect that Sony/developers believe shaman are balanced on paper and that is reflected in their postings.  I fully believe that the developers have their stat buff tables with expected damage and mitigation increases (although they may be ignoring the cap).  I personally feel that fight is won for the most part with the proposed changes to the omens buffs (although they might turn us into pp making buffing bots that are still not wanted in groups). &quot;AUCTION SHAMAN BUFFS DONATE IN WINDOW PLEASE&quot;<br />
<br />
I do, though, believe that there is a misunderstanding of actual gameplay and also of the mindset of the players.  It took druids and necros a long time to regain the &quot;trust for a lack of a better word&quot; to get into groups even though on paper they were fine.  Unfortunately shaman have lost some of their &quot;dazzle&quot; in newer content and beastlords and enchanters have the edge in player's minds.<br />
<br />
But, IMHO there is one thing and one thing only that has made shaman unbalanced and that is DOT's.  If you take away all shaman DOT's and replace them with appropriate DD's you have a balanced class for the most part.  And yes, we are a bit light on healing compared to clerics and druids, but it is very apparant that the developers have decided that shaman are to be secondary healers with weak direct healing but significant HOT's.  (And I want to repeat what I have said many times, I wish I could DOT for rollplay reasons)<br />
<br />
I personally have absolutely no issue us being secondary healers, but with DOT's not being a possibility in so many of our encounters they need to balance the dps in some way to compensate.  <br />
<br />
But anyway, my main issue and my pet peeve for 4 years now is the unavailable class changing spells for shaman.  Many of you newer players might not realize and it is different from server to server but on Quellious torpor and malo (to a slightly lesser extent) were not to be found.  Period, Period, Period.  I had 100,000pp and looked for 1 year to buy it.  I went on probably 15 Trak raids, no drops.  There is nothing worse for a shaman than not being able to get or buy class changing spells.  If Sony wants to lose customers then class changing ancient spells will take care of that.<br />

Are you guys actually reading the posts explaining how Champion will give a 5% DPS boost?<br />
How can anyone say we have won a battle due to the reasonable discussion, when these effects where slapped on those same buffs a months ago already just to be removed again a few weeks later?<br />
<br />
In a normal group with 3 melees doing 650 DPS, you'd add 32.5 DPS to the group by keeping up Champion on all 3 of them 100% of the time. Expect Champion to be the most effective buff and then think about what Dex, Agi, Str and the rest of those buffs will do.<br />
<br />
I do agree that these buffs are actually better than what they have been, but I have a hard time calling these buffs significant. <br />
Even more so when you consider what an uproar it's taking to actually make them happen, when there are so many other issues that need to be adressed and that won't be this &quot;easy&quot; to argue for.<br />

<br />
<br />
Nothing will be done about it, though.<br />
<br />
It's painfully obvious that they aren't worried about it. This should be a top priority. The summer is close and I don't like to waste my time so I'll be moving on if I don't see drastic changes to my class and I suggest you do the same.<br />
<br />
And Morbid!   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">The problem is that there are so many deficiencies that we have to focus on one<br />
Exactly. I would prefer fixes to healing, then debuffs, then buffs, then damage, in that priority. Others obviously feel different. But I won't cry out if in the process of fixing my healing capabilities stay the same if I am as useful as everyone else after the fixing is done.<br />
<br />
That is the bottom line - being as useful as everyone else. Regardless of what we end up with, if we are to reach that goal we will need fixes to multiple areas. Healing is just the obvious target - it stands out the most, it is our class ability from level 1 onwards, Rytan has stated clear ratios and it is the top priority on the one voice post.</div></div><hr />

That looks correct for an effect that increases the DI by 10%. Note that the &quot;+100% damage&quot; of fell strike increases DI by only 33% according to Tugela's numbers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Ok I'm negative :)<br />
<br />
My view is that these spells while an improvement offer very little for an experience group.<br />
<br />
Agility = 7% avoidance<br />
Ferine = 10% damage<br />
<br />
Let's assume the ratio of DPS remains the same for each class.<br />
Approximately:<br />
800 enchanter pet hasted<br />
160 rogue/wizard<br />
140 monk/ranger/beastlord/mage<br />
120 berserker<br />
100 warrior/druid<br />
80 pal/sk<br />
60 brd/shm<br />
Read as: a shaman does 60% the dps of a warrior and a warrior does 60% the damage of a rogue.  A sustainable dps from a shaman is generally regarded as pet 30 + spells of 30 (keep in mind your roll is to slow and you have to do that before you can do damage).<br />
<br />
Assume that a shaman adds 25% extra dps to anyone they buff (this is an overestimate for elemental+ equiped people who are near stat caps).<br />
<br />
800*1.25 = 1000<br />
160*1.25 = 200<br />
140*1.25 = 175<br />
100*1.25 = 125<br />
80*1.25 = 100<br />
<br />
Now create a group where the benefit of having a shaman present is greater then that of a bard or beastlord (other common picks for slowers).<br />
<br />
When do you want a shaman?<br />
- If you have a full melee group (beyond chanter/cleric) and the chanter charms.<br />
<br />
When do you not want a shaman?<br />
- If you have any caster dps (mage, wizard, etc) who benefit more from mana regen (beastlord) or damage bonus/mana regen (bard).<br />
- You are not using a chanter pet (bard over haste, or beastlord dps + ferocity are greater then a 25% bonus + shaman dps)<br />
<br />
Did I ignore avoidance?<br />
Yes.  Why?  Because you will only avoid 1 attack out of 14 attacks.  And it is NOT very likely against a 1k hitting mob that you will notice or even be able to sustain 14 attacks hoping to avoid one.<br />
<br />
The usefulness of avoidance is really for the MA only and not for single group events where you will avoid one extra attack every few min (non ma).<br />
<br />
Do warriors use their evasive discipline when mobs hit for 3k+?  Nope due to the fact that avoidance is a &quot;random roll of the dice&quot; and defensive is a &quot;guarenteed lowering of damage&quot;.  There are no guarentees with avoidance.  It isn't like with evasive (50% chance to avoid melee attack) a mob which can hit 4 times a round will never hit more then twice.<br />
<br />
Did I ignore healing?<br />
Yes.  Shaman can heal.  A shaman's healing is not required except under extreme conditions (boss mobs).  And typically where a shaman is required as a healer, a druid or another cleric make a better choice.<br />
<br />
Conclusion.<br />
Bards, Enchanters, Beastlords provide means of slowing AND increasing dps of Melee and Casters.  Shaman only do Melee.<br />
<br />
Thus in order to use a shaman in an experience group, you must have melee in order to reap the bonuses shaman provide.  Also understand that there is no guarentee an enchanter will WANT their pets doing 25% more dps as their survivability goes down once it breaks.<br />
<br />
I still contend that you can easily blur this by adding utility to shaman which is beyond pure DPS calculations.<br />
<br />
Even something as simple as a ward which increases mana regen by 2-3 helps work towards this goal.</div></div><hr />

Actually I didn't mention anything about rants/thoughtful posts.  That paragraph was meant for those who keep saying 'Guys, don't worry about the spells, they are on test, they will be changed'.  It's to them I say make yourself be heard.  If you feel rants are the way the go for it.  If you think more 'thoughtful posts' are the way then more power to you.  But just DON'T for 1 second think that the spells on test will 'just be changed to what you want' unless you let SoE know.  Yes, the squeaky wheel get's the grease when it comes to EQ (and virtually everything else).<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd say thoughtful posts are more likely to have an impact (you know, the whole honey thing).  Hey, if I were SoE I'd be more likely to skip the rants.<br />

I do agree that right now, I suspect you have SoE's attention due to cancelling of accounts (or potential thereof).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">I still think Clerics should ahve the Biggest heals and shaman should have the longest duration heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
If we are both at 4 ticks. with Spell Duration focus and AA can extend that to 7-8 ticks. Then Clerics will simply be better healers in all aspects. <br />
<br />
But if a clerics heal over time is 900 Hps a tick for 4 ticks (3600 hps healed)<br />
<br />
Then shaman should be at 600 hps a tick for  6 ticks. (3600 hps healed)<br />
<br />
Toss in a 100 hp a tick regen and Slow and shaman are viable healers. and despite not having the largest heal we are much closer overall. And if there was a shaman in the group as well as a cleric they could decide which to use because they would both be effective. Sure the cleric heals for more shorter. but the shamans smooths out bumps better.<br />
<br />
Also this solves the problem of heal or slow. Get a heal off incoming then slow safe in the knowledge that for a change you have enough time. (Maybe)<br />
<br />
Clerics are still the best healers in HoT and Burst healing. Shaman are better at the longer duration and controlled areas. and druids are a mix of both (With High regen and Better than shaman Burst heals) And superiour nuke ability.<br />
<br />
Then to spice up the game for both Shaman and Clerics who suffer due to different reasons. (Shaman quick fights murder our ability and clerics are One trick ponys with an albatross around thier next)  Give Clerics the ability to Long term Dot. (Splurt based spells representing the growing force of the Gods fury upon the heratics perhaps) Coupled with thier Stuns and roots and Major advantage of heals this would truly allow them to solo Non summoning mobs.  And Give shaman a Major upgrade on the Curse line of dots. -100 MR check 900 damage a tick 4 ticks, (6 second recast) and lower the Poisen Aggro counter component on the poisen dots. Also make Mutt Innate duel weild and innate Spirit of the wolf. And majorly bump up his parry skill. (So he can live a little longer while not making him too much of a tank) <br />
<br />
And Finally Take rabid bear and make it a toggle With 1/2 of mana tied up while rabid. And with the AA for it now to lessen the recast on it change them to Lower the mana tied up amount so at third rank only 10% manapool is taken. (Can meele then well. But have to take into account lessened manapool.) <br />
<br />
Druids are sitting pretty darn good at the moment. But clerics are too required yet not needed enough for fun / relaxing things. And shaman are wandering without a home at the moment. cause there will be a slower/haster in the group. And Beastlords/ Bards/ Enchanters all fit that bill with other abilitys that are valuable enough to amke them useful already. <br />

Druid - best group heal, medium blast/complete heal, small HOT<br />
Shaman - best HOT, medium blast/group, small complete heal<br />
<br />
All priests would then have basic functionality - the blast heal plus one other. Each would also have a speciality, and a teriary support function. Clerics would still be kings of the CH line by far, druids rule the group heal, and shamans a formidable HOT.<br />
<br />
Like I said, probably too far along to think about this for EQ as it is now, but I thought it was an interesting idea to ponder.</div></div><hr />

In that case shaman HoT spells are once again strictly inferior since the cleric has the option to simply cast the spell more often for more healing.
