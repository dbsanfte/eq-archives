Why should I, let alone anyone, wait 6 levels and waste my first lesser muramite rune to get basically the same pet? I notice a small improvement in hitpoints and a slight increase in damage on higher level mobs, yet it still has the same max hit and still hits as poorly without weapons? I know I'm not the only one that feels this way. I've seen several posts regarding this pet but none that get right to the point, so I thought I would start one.</div></div><hr />

It's common knowledge that developers/SoE employees look at these forums for information. There's no better place to suggest a shaman change than on a shaman forum where somebody important might read it.</div></div><hr />

yes, but if you would (a) read this board and (b) read the official soe-shm board, you would have realized, that we already HAVE an answer here, they affirmed that its a bug and that it is worked at, we just didnt get a date for having it fixed (so theoretically it could be a second ancestral aid desaster). But nevertheless, it was posted a thousand times already, and making more threads of it wont help no one.<br />
<br />
reading before posting is your friend  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am hoping for the best, but I have a feeling its going to get about 200 hp upgrade and hit for 62 instead of 60. Still not going to dual wield either =x At the moment it actually a different level. The 61 pet is lvl 58 and Farrels is lvl 63 I think, but other then that is a copy of True Spirit still =(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guys (and gals), mage post 50 fire pets have been broken for 4+ years and SoE has yet to fix them.  Unless you see the term BEASTLORD in front fo your class, I wouldnt have any confidence in our pet being fixed anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Sorry, that just the way SoE is and how they have treated various classes over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">be careful what you ask for ... SOE has always avoided the dual weld issue on shaman pets ... leaving the door way to open to get a big chuckle out of saying &quot;it was never intended to be a feature of shaman pets&quot;<br />
<br />
or ... the fix may involve more tradeskill development ... to increase the stats, dmg max and abilities of shaman pets we may have to bake doggie treats and feed them</div></div><hr />
