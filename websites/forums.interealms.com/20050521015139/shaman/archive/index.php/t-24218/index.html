While in Bear Form you are similar to a Warrior. You might wish to read over the Warrior page for insights on how to play a Warrior. Bear form increases armor, hit points, and allows the use of various bear abilities. Bear Form is useful in parties when you need someone to tank. The Bear has several useful abilities including taunt and a stun to interrupt spells. These abilities are only usable in Bear Form. <br />
<br />
Swipe - Swipe X nearby enemies <br />
Growl - Adds a small amount of threat to the target. This is your taunt ability used to get the monster to attack you rather than a weak party member such as a spell caster. You will need to use this ability a lot to train it up to useful levels. <br />
<br />
Demoralizing Roar - The Druid roars, decreasing nearby enemies' attack power by X. <br />
<br />
Maul - Increases the Druid's next attack by X damage. <br />
<br />
Enrage - Generates X rage over X sec. but decreases armor by X%. The Druid is considered in combat for the duration. <br />
<br />
Bash - Bashes the target, stunning him for X seconds. This of course is especially useful against spell casters <br />
<br />
Challenging Roar - Taunts all nearby enemies for X sec. &quot;<br />
<br />
damit i might be a  druid:)<br />
<br />

<br />
You also get other animal forms (like to get something like SOW, you turn yourself into a cheetah :-) ).<br />
<br />
There's also a &quot;rogue&quot; animal form for dps if I recall correctly and an aquatic form for underwater breathing but doesn't allow you to fight/tank much.<br />
<br />
If I remember what I read yesterday  you lose the ability to cast most if not all spells when you are in an animal form.  The animal forms aren't as versatile as the base class that they emulate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
added link to whole page:) yes you cant cast spells in animal form, but although not as versitle they are compareable to the classes they emulate. <br />
basically what it does if give a wide choice of play styles and roles, i still like hunters though:) but i can see myself trying other classes too:) druid just looks fun, healer, or tank or rog in one class? although you cant do them all together, but fun huh? which adds to length of time playing it. i must admit the more i read the more i think i will like it. but only trying it will i really see:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the idea of a &quot;can fit any situation&quot; class is PAINFULLY appealing to me after the way EQ ended up.  If someone joins the group and the balance of abilities shifts too much, change form and do something else.  Oh, if only rabid bear had fulfilled that expectation!<br />
<br />
Another example of someone using something OTHER than the nerf bat as a balancing tool.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its an awesome mechanic.  I'm sure it's something that will require alot of tweaking, but its a great concept.  You'll still prefer a warrior for tanking, but when one just isn't available (or is afk, etc), your friendly druid can always bear form and tank.  Or, when healing and tanking is covered, they can go to cat form and deal the damage.<br />
<br />
I'm actually leaning towards druid when wow comes out, mostly because of that versatility.  I like the shamans too, but I was having alot of mana issues as a shaman (I wish the totems lasted longer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*nod*  Versatility is one of the reasons every other class I tried ended up on the shelf in favor of my shaman (in EQ).  I'm a big fan of the jack-of-all-trades idea, because I really do have the most fun when I'm making a significant difference in any situation.  I think people who chose shaman in EQ (for the most part) think quickly on their feet, and enjoy adapting to changes in situation.  The way Blizzard made their druid, it seems like it'll easily draw a lot of us in spite of the stigma the word has gotten from EQ.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Loved playing one during the stress test. Check the sig to see what bear form looks like. At the time I managed to get to 20th and had access to bear form (warrior) Evil seal form (water travel) Lion form (rogue).<br />
<br />
You can't use spells or items while changed so it's a choice you make during the fight if you want to cast spells or not. However shape shifts were instant cast and uninterruptable so you can shift from one shape to another as needed (mana cost was pretty steep at low levels though). However you have to be carefull since you're more vulnerable in some forms and a poorly timed shapechange will get you killed or leave you oom. <br />
<br />
The way solo fights usually went was front load a few damage spells (nuke, dot), Toss up a Heal over time and damage shield on yourself (also instant cast), change to bear form, start kicking ass and taking names. You regain mana while shape changed so you're gtg when you change back.<br />
<br />
In groups, As usual everyone loves a good healer, but if there's already a shaman, priest or other druid present you can simply shift to whatever other form is needed. I've been in groups with a shaman healer, a warrior tanking and 2 druid kitties pouncing on everything. It was great. Want to group with another druid ? One tanks, the other heals and voila, you're in buisness.<br />
<br />
The way warrior (bear) worked was with rage. You start the fight with an empty rage bar. Fighting, getting hit, and some special abilities generate rage. You then use that rage to fuel things like taunts, extra damagy attacks and such. <br />
<br />
The rogue (Lion looking cat) worked with stealth. You start with a full bar of stealth and use that to fuel special attacks. Some special attacks give combo points which unlock other more powerfull attacks for you to follow up with and also determine damage on some even more powerfull attacks.<br />
<br />
The cat form also had a stealth mode (invisibility) where you creep along belly to the ground. Near as I can tell it drastically reduced your aggro radius so you could walk through a crowd without being detected. however if you get too close to a mob, you can still get whupped.<br />
<br />
The water form was basically a waterbreathing / underwater sow, not  for fighting, it's a travel form. It looks like some type of grinning walrus or seal. I tried swimming across the sea when I got it but drowned after becoming exhausted :D. That's how they enforce the off coast limits. Get too far from land, you start getting fatigued, and eventually die if you don't turn back. It will definitely come in handy though. A large part of the continents are accessible from the sea so   you can swim to speed up travel and bypass dangerous areas. And the underwater decor was easily as beautifull as anything on land.<br />
<br />
On the last days, I was invited on a kind of raid into the human lands, to get there we swam along the coast to bypass some of the much higher suicide level zones (we were levels 20 - 30 ish). Like 50 people swimming along with a few seals thrown in for comic relief.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I didn't get to try the cheetah travel form as it was much higher level. <br />
<br />
Shaman had their spirit wolf travel form which allowed them to run fast and go invisible. Came in very handy when wiping in a dungeon. He'd run back as a spirit wolf and rez us back in where we got killed.<br />
<br />
Much fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sounds really cool. too bad they're called &quot;druids&quot; :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">WoW shaman can heal and rezz and you want to be druids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's a tossup between shaman and druid atm. I didn't get the chance to try shaman much during the stress test....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But that bear form is sooo cool.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">WoW shaman can heal and rezz and you want to be druids?<br />
its not so much that as a very nice choice to make:) i perfer hunters myself, but i will likely give shaman, pallies, druids a go too:) even cleric are a much more attractive class in wow(ie more than just heal) than in eq. shaman are similar to palies in wow cept slightly worse ac so they can tank ok,but both can heal and res too and have group functions, but form just reading hunter and druid are the ones i most attracted too:)<br />
<br />
form my point of view, i am much more excited and interested in wow than any eq expansion or eq2. i just hope it lives up to my expectation:)<br />
<br />
mind that fairly recent i enjoyed pop for the most part, but i feel the game shifted in gameplay but alot of classes where just left alone when they needed retuning. this meant that whereas i wanted to log on before , now i just dont have that feeling, some might say that i have just reached burn out, but i know if they revamp shaman i would probably be back, maybe burnt out with how shaman are at present:) however, its a game and if you enjoy it then that all that mattters:) I myself am pretty sure i will stop playing soon, but that noway means anyone esle should, but i do love the way the classes look in wow, much more fun than how they look in eq2 to me at least.<br />
<br />
side note 600 post? dam am sure i didnt post most of those? did i? still better than poor old Faern, hes got 2 times as much:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You have to pay for being a jack of all trades, though, and the price can be high. A warrior has to be a better tank than a Druid in bear form, otherwise nobody will play Warriors. Just how much better he will be at tanking will determine whether Bear form will be &quot;good enough&quot;, &quot;situationally useful&quot; or &quot;for looks only&quot;. And, of course, continuing game rebalancing can change things at any time. Rangers could tank pre-Kunark too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">still better than poor old Faern, hes got 2 times as much<br />

Two and a half times as much. &quot;Old Faern&quot; is bored.</div></div><hr />
