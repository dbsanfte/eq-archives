<br />
I have done about three quarters of my epic now. I am working on getting into The Hole, and continue, but my question is, I heard you have to be &quot;Warmly&quot; to the true spirit when you con them in order to finish your epic, is this true?<br />
<br />
I have done the Marrs Promise and Envy &amp; Woe part now 3 times. I am warmly to the wandering spirit in West Karana at the moment. Would that mean I am warmly to the true spirits as well?<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, the wandering spirit is on true spirit faction--thus, you are warmly to true spirits.  However, I believe that the needed faction is higher than warmly to complete the quest.  If you want to skip  the other parts and just do Rak, I'd advise you get up to ally.  If you are going to finish it the correct way, don't worry about the faction!  Just doing the quest in the proper order gets you enough faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since you are going to The Hole, it seems to me that you do intend to do every step along the way (the hole is the step that people seem to have the greatest desire to skip)...<br />
<br />
If you do every step in order, you are guaranteed to have the correct faction for the next step (unless you did something stupid and got yourself a negative TS faction hit).<br />
<br />
Repeating steps is therefore a waste of your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the replies. Yes I do plan on doing the epic in order. But getting to Kirn is whats holding me up right now as I can't seem to find enough people to head down there. <br />
<br />
I tried to get in a raid but as of late, knowone seems to be raiding The Hole. But, as soon as I do, I will be a happy camper as I have been waiting for this part of the epic for about 7 months now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could always try the cleric / mage / rogue technique for getting into the hole. If you can pull that off you can kill Kirn with a single group.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />
