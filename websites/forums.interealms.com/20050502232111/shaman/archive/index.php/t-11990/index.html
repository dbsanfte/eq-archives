<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so i play a 54 shaman on the lanys server.  i found this delectable experience spot that pretty much blazed me through 51, 52 and 53.  it started slowing down a bit at 54, so instead of pushing through to 55 and getting new pet, etc i decided to try out some AA experience before the spot went dry.  with C3 and a clear camp, relatively sober i've been making 35 to 40% AA an hour, plus maybe 250 or 300pp.<br />
<br />
my questions: i've read that the best levels for AA'ing are 60/61 or 65.  what kind of % AA experience per hour can a shaman scrap together at level these levels, on average? ..is this AA'ing typically done solo or in groups? ..and if it's done in groups, how much time do you usually spend dicking around LFG?<br />
<br />
thanks for the input folks, any responses are appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NipperRipper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">30%-40% an AA an hour is pretty crappy actually. Once you are level 60+ and get your PoV/PoS flag you should be able to get an AA every 1 1/2 hours or so in a good group in PoV. BoT is good too if you can get that flag. The important thing is to make sure you are killing stuff that is within 5 of your level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Where's the spot? I would love to use it bot for levelling and a bit of AA xp I want to do before I get to 60 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm....I've been in the constant chain pulling PoV groups and I think that at best I have seen about 2 - 2 1/2 hours per AA point.  Might be better...but more than likely the best AA places that I have heard is in the Boar pit in PoTactics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have yet to see an AA in 1.5 hours in PoS or PoV either, but have only been in caves once, usually in Desert and seems around 1AA/2.5 or 3 hours.  Xps in HoH are better still, but still not 1.5/hr with a balanced group (none of the groups Im usually in has anyone level 65 either though and no one has an extremely high number of AA's yet).<br />
<br />
As for LFG, Shaman seem to be in pretty high demand, I often get asked to join groups when Im not even looking.<br />
<br />
As for what you should do, most would say get to 60+, then AA, but do whatever you want as long as you are enjoying it.</div></div><hr />
