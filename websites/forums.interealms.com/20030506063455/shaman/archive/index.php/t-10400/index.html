<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How much cash do you have lying around?<br />
<br />
Get your epic for starters.  Hiero Cloak if you have cash, something with HP on it if you dont.    Earring of the Solstice, or some of those things from chardok for your ears.  Solstice parts are getting fairly cheap.  I picked up the whole set for about 5k.<br />
<br />
Shoulders with more HP would be nice.  Pauldrons of Witness maybe?  Tracking Wolf Collar if you can find one priced reasonably in the bazaar<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm not to sure how much cash I have. I am always able to muster some up when in need. I wish I could get my epic. I have been wanting it since lvl 13. I use to do PC on Spear of fate when I was a noob. My guild has alot of shamans and I think I am on the bottom of the list for tear. SO i have lots of time before i get my epic. Thanks for the adivce. I was thinking of shoulder back and neck is where I need most work done. I just dont know what put there.</div></div><hr />
