<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naedarie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alrighty, here i am, browsing, looking for places to solo at 45, hopefully staying there long enough to make 50.  I've tried the spirocs in OT, and the downtime is a lot more than i expected, not to mention, they barely move my xp bar.  I tried Sol B, good xp at 44, but at 45 xp bar barely moves.  I suppose now that i think about it, i'm asking is 45 a hell level, and i just don't know it?  any recommendations on places to go would be appreciated.  either i'm not taking on the right mobs in places i go, or something, as i am having a very difficult time with downtime to xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They supposedly smoothed the Hell Levels out, so that there are no more Hell Levels.  Whether this is true or not I do not know.<br />
<br />
I went through 45 the slow way; xp greens (what are now light blues) in Crystal Caverns.  Then again, I was after the silk for my chanter; the xp gain was just a bonus.<br />
<br />
Got a question for ya.  Have you got your Tolan's Bracer yet?  Few rangers have it before they enter the 50's, but it does open up some options for you if you do have it.<br />
<br />
You can solo the geonids (assuming they're open) in CC.  However, unless you've got Tolan' helmet, stop before they become KoS; they guard the easy way out from the dwarf town.<br />
<br />
You can fear kite in a number of places.  Jaggedpine (might be troublesome weithout wolf form, so might be worthwhile getting a lupine), EW, EJ from what I've heard.<br />
<br />
If you get the bracer, you can use a slower form of soloing that opens up a whole new slew of mobs.  Root, dot, and shoot is going to be slow, but will be the only way you are going to be able to solo some mobs.  <br />
<br />
One last thing : don't ever expect to see your xp bar move on a per kill basis again, until you either a) make an alt, or b) get a group in the Planes (not gonna happen untill the 50's, based on what I've seen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naedarie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">that's some good info so far.  Tolan's Bracer, not yet.  Helm, yup, i do have it, and the vambraces.  Jaggedpine isn't troublesome, other than the amount of running you have to do to track down a mob.  i suppose it's time i get used to it, as i've spent virtually all my time from 15 untl now doing static spawns, and am not used to having to track down my prey.  I did geos from 39  to 44, and then set out to track down other things to hunt, as i was only able to do 3-4 before the first spawned again.  i wonder if i'm just spoiled, as i am used to getting about half a blue per kill, at least that's how it was until i hit 45.  i plan to get the Tolan's bracer as soon as i can afford it, but that might not be until level 50 or better, as i am a casual player, or  rather a time-challenged player, being able to put in maybe 2 and a half hours of play time per day, unless i get a good day on the weekend.  I also plan on getting a swarmcaller, when the chance presents itself, as i hear that the slow proc itself makes  for quite some help.  i prolly could go back to the geos, as they should still be worth it,  part of the reason i left was due to the fact they were  just beginning to turn light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Geonids will be a mix of light and dark blue until you hit the low 50's.<br />
<br />
Nameds are lightblue/green to me at 55.<br />
The terrors are mostly green to me, but the nameds and a couple are light blue to me still.  <br />
<br />
So, CC still has some stuff for you; but the geo's would be your best bet for xp there.</div></div><hr />
