<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.  I have a level 65 necro, 53 cleric and 40 druid and have never had a problem specializing before.  I am leveling up a shaman who is currently level 39.  Currently my specialize alt is 50.  I haven't trained the others yet at all because I wanted my spec alt to get above 50 and didn't want to take any chances.<br />
<br />
Well the alt is stuck on 50.  I can't train it higher at a trainer and it won't go up on it's own.  Am I bugged?  Do I have to start the training in the other specialize skills to get the alt to go higher?<br />
<br />
I am fairly sure that I did this same process with my cleric with no problems, but can't remember.  The necro and druid I trained them all at the same time and just made sure the one I wanted got to 51 first.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's been almost 2 years since I have taken a caster into specialization so just wanted to make sure something hasn't changed that I don't know about.  I think I am bugged but wanted to ask first before bothering a GM, if I can find one.</div></div><hr />

Ok thanks.  I wasn't sure and didn't want to take any chances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trained all the other ones and on my first heal after doing that I dinged 51 on my specialisation...</div></div><hr />
