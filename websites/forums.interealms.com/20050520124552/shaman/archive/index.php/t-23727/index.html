<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greyram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i dont know about you, but im a lil disappointed they didnt upgrade Advanced spirit call.  Seems most of the aas were natural upgrades from previous ones, unlike the necros that got army of the undead i would of liked to of seen something like FURY OF THE WOLF PACK !!  Another issue i have is that SKS enjoy a stronger and weaker version of HT.  Seems only fair we should be able to enjoy the weaker and stronger versions of spirit call and Advanced spirit call.  BTW anyone know the macro code for ADvanced spirti call i cant seem to find it.  One last thing, I am very happy with the crits now available on hot's. :cool:</div></div><hr />
