<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw a thread like this over on the safehouse, basically, what do you guys think the shaman shoudl be like/do in EQ2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm, that's tough, I *love* playing a shaman.<br />
<br />
I guess, the only thing I would change is the fact that stats are nearly meaningless right now.  <br />
<br />
Yes, an agi buff gives more AC and yes a sta buff gives more hitpoints, but the effects are still fairly negligible.<br />
<br />
I always liked the idea of high Agi warriors being harder to hit and high str warriors hitting harder, so stats would truly make a significant difference in the development of a character.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I want a pet otter instead of a pet wolf.  (j/k, well, kinda)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Absolutely stats should MEAN something. This would mean that there are significant differences in the way your class is played depending on your choices. Also, items that raise stats should not be so plentiful to raise them to maximums so easily. <br />
<br />
Being a race with high agility you should have a significant advantage in being able to avoid blows, and you should have a better chance to dodge. Being a race with high dexterity you should have a better chance to hit, to parry, to riposte, to block. Being a race with high strength you should be able to do SIGNIFICANTLY more damage on a successful hit than a weak race. <br />
<br />
I mean, you would need to choose to be a certain type of warrior depending on what race you chose. <br />
<br />
As for what they have already proposed, I think the MOST terrible idea that I have seen so far is the proposal of the local banks instead of global. If i had to track all the way across the globe to get stuff out of the bank that I accidently left in it, I don't think I would consider it as extra fun. Just extra annoyance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oishii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">one thing that i loved about AC was that stat buffs REALLY made a big difference...  buffing stats could make you run faster, jump higher, hit harder/faster, etc. etc...   <br />
AC has a ton of buffs that you can use, including buffs on items.. eg. buff up the damage rating on a weapon, or the ac of armor pieces etc.<br />
The downside of it is that the buffs have a very short duration... the highest level buffs having only a duration of about 10 mins, but i suppose that is how they balance it out.<br />
<br />
Anyways, it is too bad that stat buffs don't do something similar like that in EQ :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>balith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2 words Concentration Buffs<br />
<br />
Ok in addition<br />
No Complete heal.<br />
No AE mez and limited in that you can only mez 1-2 mobs max<br />
Every healer should get the same healing balance it in other ways.<br />
Slow should be 35 percent max but better healing so it would even out.<br />
No feign death<br />
<br />
Basically they should tune spells on uber mobs assuming they all stick then work outwards.<br />
Dots should be additive ie per caster. <br />
Pets should not be the focus of any class.<br />
<br />
I would like to see Shaman having cleric healing with some solid debuffs. <br />
<br />
Unlike before ,<br />
All Casters should get the same burn<br />
All Healers the same healing<br />
All Tanks the same agro holding and take damage the same.<br />
All Damage Specialists the same damage output<br />
<br />
The secondary spell lines should make say a healing class special or a caster indivigualized.<br />
<br />
Thinking out of the lines I would have say all the healers get healing then let them pick 2-3 secondary lines they want.<br />
<br />
People getting a healer wont now what else they have but they will know they can heal.<br />
<br />
Another idea would be you make a level and get the generic spells then you have to do alternate advancement for 2 spell lines after word you could say try to get 2 more lines if you chose or try to get the next level.<br />
<br />
Alternate advancement next time should be built into all the levels with this idea, in addition to the abilities there now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WhiteandBlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I recall reading how stats use to mean something(beta?) but Verant didn't want an Ogre to how so much advantage over other races(e.g. gnome).  EQ2 stats NEED to mean something. Right now EQ is so diluded that the only stat left, for the high end game, is HPs because overthing else can be maxed or reached the softcaps.<br />
<br />
Don't balance classes/races by experiance penalties.  <br />
<br />
Each shaman(or any class) should not be a cookie cutter of the next. I like the skill tree systems, but balanced.  I would like to see them different, in the respect, each would be viable at raids not have it come down to one is good for PvP, soloing, and raids.  I would like to be a battle shaman. In that, giving up dog and dots and balancing that damage out via malee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow... 3 words, Completely Dissagree Balith.<br />
<br />
I'd go through number by number but this about sums it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I kinda have to agree with Gorgos. <br />
EQ has something, some quality which makes it incredibly addictive.  AC, AO and DAoC don't seem to have this &quot;quality&quot; I have many friends that tried those games and came back. <br />
<br />
Why mess with what is fundementally successful with EQ?<br />
<br />
It's all kind of moot anyway, since I found out that characters won't be transferred to EQ2, I have no interest in playing EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Think about what a shaman is - a priest/magician in a primitive culture.<br />
<br />
Curing diseases and sickness.  Cursing your enemies.  Making the tribe strong.  Knowing the old lore and preserving the oral history.  Foretelling the future and gathering information about the present.<br />
<br />
I can see elements of the first three in the EQ1 shaman, but knowing lore, divining information, and telling the future are under-represented by our current skillset.<br />
<br />
Maybe a way of getting more information on a MOB than just its con - like its class, relative number of HP, any special abilities or resistances, etc.  (ooh, I know - tell me if it's gonna drop something good!  hehe)<br />
<br />
Tracking could fall into the divination area as well - instead of following literal tracks (which is dumb anyway, how do rangers do that when they are not following the mobs?) you just divine the current location and go for it.<br />
<br />
A Vision-like spell that lets you send your spirit forth to reconnoiter an area would be cool (for non-PVP anyway).   <br />
<br />
Those things would make the shaman more &quot;shaman-y&quot;.  Whether it would make for better gameplay or not is hard to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I liked the way Camelot let you specialize in a spell line, after a certain point - it let you have one 'basic' class, with completely seperate abilities.  The Norse Healer, for example, could come out as the equivalent of the Shaman, Cleric or Enchanter, at high levels.  (Specialize in Buffs, Healing, Mez)<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see, is something based on race (background) and diety.  I could quite easily see the Ogre's specializing in Disease spells - the Feerrott (jungle type) would be laced with disease, and they'd have to learn to heal, and use, such.  Trolls live in a swamp populated with poisonous critters - again, learn from the environment.  Barbarians, in the icy north, wouldn't be exposed to either of those much, so would learn more about channeling the spirits of cold.  Hmm, guess there are no Iksar or Vah Shir in it, but not sure where they'd fit.<br />
<br />
Also, diety selection should matter.  The Tribunal, Cazic Thule, Innorouk, and Rallos Zek are all valid Shaman dieties - and the spells that you get should reflect that choice.  RZ shaman should be more warlike, and have more combat type spells; CT shaman, those involving fear; Inny, hmm... hate type?  Not sure what should fall under that, and about the same with the Tribunal - &quot;Justice&quot; is a nice concept, but what spells would reflect it well?<br />
<br />
Well, anyway.  My main point is, there should be a noticable difference - at higher levels - between Shaman of various races &amp; religions.  Even between those of the same race &amp; different religions.  AA skills (which should be worked in to the class) should also reflect it - Shaman of Rallos Zek should gain some limited warrior skills as they go along, for example.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've always thought there should be more variety, based on race (stats) and religion.  A fight between an Ogre Warrior and a Halfling Warrior should show completely different styles - the big lumbering Ogre, who only needs to land a few hits, versus the agile little Halfling, who keeps jumping about &amp; landing lots of minor blows.  Also, clerics should be different.  Those who follow Rodcet Nife should have superior healing/res abilities, although lower offensive capabilites, versus a warrior-cleric of Rallos Zek, who trades increased combat ability for fewer spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would like to see Training be taken to the next level.   As Khallin touched upon ... maybe Grobb Shaman trainers could offer increased skills in Poison spells while Halas trainers offer increases in Cold based spells ... etc.   If History and the weakness of the critters in the area were taken into effect ... then the local Shaman's would know what works best and increase those skills.<br />
<br />
This should lead into spells based on the local area and gainable by faction work.    This could mean that Troll would be really good with Poison based skills but need to work on faction to gain Halas Cold based skills (plus all other Shaman races aka their trainers).    Add this to the work for Experience along with faction work ... will make a reason to for a Troll to visit Halas.   <br />
<br />
As it is today ... my Troll Shaman has never thought of stepping into Halas and never will ... there is just no reason ... which is a shame.    Just as most Barb Shaman's have never thought of Grobb as someplace to visit ... even though entry via faction work is possible.<br />
<br />
There was something along this path in Alchemy when it was first rolled.  But as broken as Alchemy is what's the point or worth.  Maybe in EQ2 ... Alchemy would/will have a real reason or usage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally, I feel, and have always felt, that each different race of shaman should have different abilities---more specifically, spell lines.<br />
<br />
Actually, to focus that statement a bit more, let me add that it could really boil down to religion.  Worshippers of Rallos should have more offensive power (and arguably, worshippers of the Tribunal as well....to dispense judgement) in the form of dd's.  Followers of Cazic should get a fear spell (not just a necklace...lol).  Anyways, you see where Im headed...<br />
<br />
Most of all I want individuality...even among shaman of the same race.<br />
<br />
That, and pretty much everything Gloriana said : )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like soloing dragons as much as the next fella, but I've always felt that a shaman's best offensive weapon should be a buffed-to-the-gills fighter class. Also, I think that an enchanter should be unrivalled in empowering casters, but a shaman should be unrivalled in empowering fighters.<br />
<br />
Hence, I would reduce the raw offensive powers of a shaman in favor of extremely powerful stat buffs, and the best haste spells. To compensate, I'd give enchanters a much wider variety of spellcaster enhancements, along the lines of the focus items, so that a shaman and a pack of warriors and rogues would be about the same as an enchanter with a pack of magicians and wizards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could agree in part with this, but ONLY if VI fixed stats so they actually meant anything.  The problem with stat buffs is that currently, stats have minor meaning in EQ.<br />
<br />
Although, my impression of the Shaman has always been as a Cleric/Fighter mix - as opposed to the Paladin, who is a Fighter/Cleric mix.  (Main focus on the first of the pair listed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would love to see lots of skils / equipment that make class / race / religion choices relavent.<br />
<br />
Also, note that the game tends to move in the oposite direction.  Over time the classes have become less unique as more and more abilities are spread out.<br />
<br />
Same thing happens in da shaman racial arguments all da time.  Iksars griping about JBB is the most obvios.<br />
<br />
In DAoC there where no racial characteristics.  The only differenace between the races was model and base stats.  No bash, infravishion, swimming, safe fall...  nothing.  /barf<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of having a core group of spells for the shaman class and then different lines of spells that are abailable to different racial / religous choices.  I would also like to see more equipment be limited in use like da IGS, ivanders hoop, earring of bashing, and even the jbb. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That's what I meant, Cush... &quot;extremely powerful&quot;, not just &quot;extremely large numbers which have only a modest effect.&quot; =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I completely agree with Balith's views. I firmly believe that EQ2 should have the same basic abilities for the general classes with the sub-classes adding special abilities. For instance, all healers should have equal basic healing and buffing abilities, then on top of them specialist spell lines should be added - druids getting spells that relate to nature and the elements, clerics getting spells related to death and the undead, and shamans getting spells related to curses and debuffs. Soloing and grouping ability should be roughly equal as well. All the healers would then be equally desired and useful in their main role, while adding characteristic abilities to make them distinct playing experiences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, first, EQ has no quality whatsoever, which would make it &quot;addictive&quot; in the first place. The ONLY reason I log on, is to be with friends. They are not always on, as we all have responsibilities in RL, and many of them. When I log on and they are not on, I hang around for 5 minutes, and if they still wont come on, I log off. Game has nothing &quot;addictive&quot; to offer. When friends are on, we go to &quot;places&quot; and do &quot;stuff&quot;, but only because it's fun to be TOGETHER, not fun to be in EQ.<br />
<br />
Now, other then that, in EQ 2 the stats MUST mean quite a bit. I can take now a gnome and buff him to be on par with an ogre, so he better act like the ogre. I am a shaman, a person who &quot;talks with spirits&quot;, so I want some 'spiritual' goodies in the game for me too - summoning a spiritual pet next to me (different pet per &quot;level&quot;, i.e. wolf at first, then bear, then.. well something). Spells which would be offensive and defensive against spirits. Spells to affect spirits - not undeads, as there are many types of undead. I mean spirits here and spirits only, because I am a shaman, &quot;spiritspeaker&quot;. I want DoT's again of course, but also some &quot;spiritual curses&quot;, basically more debuffs. And debuffs also must mean something too - if I have a spell, which lowers the strong mob into sniveling mass of flesh, then he better act like this (not like it is now, when such debuff is mostly a mana waste).<br />
<br />
And so on.. Well, think of something, I can't think for all :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Id like to see the shaman more inline with a Witchdoctor, which is the way I see shamans from tribes around the world.<br />
<br />
Curses and whatnot should be added as well as our disease/poison dots as well as voodoo magic (maybe even needing a special doll to cast spells on, ie sticking needles into dolls to effect the target, etc..<br />
<br />
And the whole look and feel of the shaman should be changed to coincide with that, ie dressed in feathers, skulls, strange icons, beads, headress etc..etc.. with voodoo dolls and the like.<br />
<br />
Thats how id percieve a shaman to be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I couldnt agree with Lagger more. Would love to see more of a voodoo aspect with the shamans as well as the &quot;look&quot; of a shaman...not &quot;better&quot; graphics, just some that are different. How about something like a big chicken bone around me neck?<br />
<br />
Also, give us the feeling that we are actually controlling/seeing the future. That's what shamans do! Weissblau touched on this above. Let us have some more power actually controlling battles: maybe stopping time itself to allow your tribe to heal, while the enemy continues to deteriorate (slow being only ONE way we can control the fight...how about completely stopping all enemy action for a brief period of time); is a rare mob up in a certain zone? maybe we could see that from a far away place; twisting time/space by allowing more free movement...give us the ability to create multiple bind spots for ourselves.<br />

Make us more like a voodoo Yoda. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kaytlin Snowstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Something that i really want for EQ2 is mobs balanced with players..meaning a lvl 15 orc should have roughly the same stats as a lvl 15 players...if you want to balance group vs monsters, just add more monsters..instead of having 4 orcs in the camp put 12 or sumthin.<br />
<br />
Also, i want to see the damage roughly equal as well.  Not all mobs in game are monks, their fists shouldnt hurt that much.  And a wizard should NEVER hurt you with his fist as much as with his magics.  Make all war mobs have weaps if need be, but if they get disarmed make em hit for way less(make disarming harder or even more dependant on a certain skill number, like you need 150 skill in disarm to get an orc, whereas disarming a giant would take 200).<br />
<br />
And i agree that all base skills for classes should be equal, meaning a shaman would be just as desirable as a cleric for healing, but if your going against undeads a cleric would be a better choice, whereas if you fight animals you should prefer a druid.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I'm sure they'll try to make radical changes, but they aren't going to work, or they simply aren't going to deliver on their promises.  Bazaar?  New Interface? What's that you say?

This thread is nice to think about but maybe it should be called &quot;Changes to the shaman race that you'd like to see in the newest NON-Verant game&quot;<br />

No thank you verant - I've been fooled enough - I'm not interested in EQ2 at all if you are making it......  I'll pay the EQ1 bill until something better comes out and then I'll quit :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">What I find interesting is that everyone keeps saying that Stats should mean something, but according to the EQ2 announcement it appears that stats will be hidden or uncontrollable.  At least at character creation, where you don't get the chance to tinker with your points.  From reading that announcement, it seems VI is taking away our (as a player) ability to understand the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Let us have some more power actually controlling battles: maybe stopping time itself to allow your tribe to heal<br />
I can see it now, EQ meets The Matrix.....bullet time anyone?<br />
<br />
As for stats, I don't care if they hide them, but an ogre should ALWAYS hit for more pts then a halfling given the same equipment.<br />
And if I chant uber strength of Ox spell 2 on a warrior, make their max damage go up by 2.  Every other D&amp;D type game makes this work, why can't verant. Yah know, the lil Weapon Damage 10-20, cast spell it jumps to 12-22....how hard of a concept is that.<br />

Shaman animations should involve us throwing potions, and dusts and all sorts of magics at the enemy. The voodoo aspect really needs to come out more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I agree 100% on the haste thing(as much as hasting tanks annoys me =P).<br />
<br />
Shaman do melee buffs, and are the masters of slow, therefore should also be the superior haste casting class, while having little if anything that non melees want/care about.<br />
<br />
Enchanters do caster buffs, secondary slow quality, and should be secondary haste.<br />
<br />
Hell.. I would like to see the Chanter/Shaman haste progression swapped in eq1.. but that wont happen with the snake sticks.. and really I dont want to spend time hasting tanks who are too lazy to send direct tells so I can /rtarget<br />
<br />
joethelazydumbmelee shouts &quot;HASTE PLS THZ!<br />
<br />
Diety should also have more of an effect(and I wish they would add the rest of the symbols for tribunal.. sigh).<br />
<br />
I kinda dont wish stats had more effect. I like them nice and gimp so I can decline tanks who want arm buffs when Im barely able to keep up the slowing on a blitzkrieg raid somewhere.<br />
<br />
Heh.. most of this is EQ1 desires rather then EQ2.. I wont be playing EQ2 because I cant take my character with me, and I cant for one minute comprehend it having enough to do with out Kunark,Velious,Luclin,etc. I dont think it will bring back the magic of running from Qeynos to Freeport for the first time, of the first time I ever saw Kelethin, or trying to navigate the dangers of North Karana at level 12 to buy that &quot;uber&quot; combine weapon(back when it *was* uber)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Am in complete agreeance that our best weapon should be a fighter that we have  buffed the hell out of.  That is what buffing caster class is really all about, not using rare items that can dish out damage and being a lone-wolf.<br />
<br />
I'd gladly give up much of my ability to solo if stats meant something and I made a great impact on how others play.<br />
<br />
As for taking away peoples ability to understand the system, that is definitely another thing I am in extreme favor of.  Right now, EQ is not an online fantasy RPG.  It is an AOL chatroom that people have dissected so much that people don't see anything but numbers anymore.  <br />
<br />
In one of best MUDs out there, DragonRealms, numbers were never given out on items.  Ever.  You guaged how good a weapon was by feeling it's balance, the sharpness of the blade, etc.  Traders who made it their life's work in appraising items could definitely tell more about an item than the average adventurer.  This made the game far more interesting and immserive than the mindless statquest EQ has turned out to be.</div></div><hr />

No species should be able to be repaired to higher than it was in the beginning of course, and the amount of repair would be tied to the size of the sacrifice and the amount of essense used.<br />
