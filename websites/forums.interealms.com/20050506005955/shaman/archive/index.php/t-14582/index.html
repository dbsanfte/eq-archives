<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">when does Tormax spawn after a server reset. I have heard everything from &quot;right away&quot; to &quot;7 days&quot; its obviously not right away so I have no idea when to look for him. guild scouts are all over the place so I need to be there right when he spawns for a quest turnin... I dont care if its a 6 hour window I just need to know when!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just asked my brother this. He was in charge of spawn checking for a fairly major guild a while back.<br />
<br />
At the time (may no longer be true), Tormax spawned from 3 to 10 hours after server up, and would only spawn *on* the hour. It seemed spawn most often at 7 hours after server up. (Data was not statistically significant, but seemed to work).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're gonna turn in the head, I'd be sitting at his throne for several hours.  Guilds normally take him down as soon as he spawns, and the belt of Dorf Punting is worth a little bit of a boring wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great.... what you said Kianor agrees with the majority of what I was told, or at least close to it.<br />
<br />
And I am indeed turning in the head... Its definitely worth the wait but at the same time it's 6am here... and I havn't slept for one second so I'm looking at staying up a whole night and day for the belt.<br />
<br />
Not too fun but I have to do it. Only posted because I wanted to narrow down my options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah rams doesnt know anything Benaveriel ;)<br />
<br />
Lol yeah its generally within 6 hours of serverup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whats the spawntime after he is killed? Thats assuming of course that the servers stay up and there is no patch long enough for that to happen.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">7 days IIRC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe Krakster, Rams doesn't have the time to read this board anyway, between flaming people on Xevserver rants, so your insults are wasted. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Penny, why don't you give your account info to someone in guild that you trust and can easily 2 box in a different time zone. Have them do the turn-in and you get some ZZZZZ's. <br />
It's easy to change your password back and forth for the account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">it is worth the wait, just hang in there for him to pop. waited all day on him, got too tired, went to sleep, woke up 2a.m. with someone shouting &quot;Tormax Is About To Be Pulled&quot;! whew just in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can't remember who said this, so..no credits. <br />
<br />
&quot;The average moss snake probably has a longer and happier lifespan than Tormax does...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">His lewt is entirely too phat for as easy of a fight as he is at lvl 65.  A two group raid of talented well-equipped raiders can take him.  A totally uber group of people could do him with 4 clerics, warrior, and a few DPS, like 10 people I think is totally possible.  Maybe less clerics too.  Yah, three clerics and one necro to twitch them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dare you to suggest the twitching idea on the necro boards. Been ages since I've seen it used, and far as I know, they still despise it with a hatred unmatched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Often use mind rack instead of twitching now just FYI.  or thats what i remeber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A friend of mine retired and gave me his 61 epic necro. WHat a boring ass class on raids. Lifetap mob, beg for regen, stay out of the way and twitch whoever needs mana. Maybe get the chance to dot a boss mob every other week. I said fook that and went back to playing my shammy/ranger dou.</div></div><hr />
