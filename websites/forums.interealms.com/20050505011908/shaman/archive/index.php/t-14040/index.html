<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HarpuaKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anybody know of a good solo challenge for a 52 shm?  I'm looking for something of medium difficulty with possible a nice reward.  Any ideas?  I've been looking at castersrealm, but all of my search results are a bit overwhelming and due to the lack of leisure time I have these days, I can't decipher it all.  <br />
<br />
Don't look it up for me please, but if you know off of the top of your head, or remember a mob you felt was a challenge, could you please leave a post?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance ladies and gents ;)<br />

The Allzelesaur (that's not the correct spelling!) in OOT is a fun fight. Not 'that' hard, but basically you're fighting Godzilla, which is fun! Drops nice gems, and is on a 6 minute timer (goblin sacrafice is the ph, but the Alle spawns more often than the goblin).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soulstripper camp in Dulak. you can make EXP while waiting on him and he is a good fight for a 52 shaman. Just keep your resists up and your patience up higher.<br />
<br />
Nice reward is the soulstripper  :)</div></div><hr />

As someone else mentioned, Dino in OOT should be fun at that lvl. Was a pretty tough fight at 54 w/o epic, horse or jbb.</div></div><hr />

Huh?  The Forager is a wanderer, how do you camp him (without a tracker) if he can be just about any place in the zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulfson Soulforger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All you got to do is get him one time.  He  then pops about maybe 50 steps from the &quot;waterfall&quot; where the creek goes downhill to the big lake.  After he pops, he begins to wander not long after.  All it takes is one time usually.  I have always had luck of finding him there after I got the first kill under my belt.  Setting dog dog there and sitting on that big rock, or is it a house(?) you can see the spawn point.  The hard part is getting the first one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Arent vampire bats in ME a good fight at that level ? I seem to remember a 51 or 52 shaman here extremly happy he soloed one, looked like a tough fight too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you can get it, Frenzy camp in L Guk might be doable, I duo'd it with a 41 pally when I was 49 or 50, fought all the way down and held the camp, but it was quite rough in places...at 52 it may be soloable with the right kit. Might be a fun thing to try with care.</div></div><hr />
