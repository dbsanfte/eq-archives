<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am experiencing some really strange issues with my machine.<br />
I'm running:<br />
P4 1.6Ghz<br />
1024 DDR Memory<br />
NVidia GeForce2 MX400<br />
Windows XP Pro<br />
<br />
When I run EQ it seems to freeze up at random times, sometimes I can play for a few minutes other times I can for about 10 seconds. <br />
It seems to be maxing my processor usage. <br />
<br />
I uninstalled EQ (all 3) of them remove the Everquest directory and reinstalled all of them. That didn't fix the problem.<br />
I formatted both my partitions and re-installed Windows XP. I then re-installed EQ (it is the only app I'm running) It froze up again was running frame by frame as if it was maxing my processor. Not sure what to try next. I tried placing EQ as Top Priority in Task Manager and it ran ok when I logged on. But I only played for about 10 minutes before logging off again, so I'm not convinced that the problem is fixed. As I said the freezing up occurs randomly. Any suggestions ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check your sound, and try turning it off.<br />
<br />
I've been freezing like that a lot, and seems it was because my soundcard is built in my motherboard. I've turned that off completely (as in off for the whole computer, not just the EQ game) and since then it's been working like a charm.<br />
<br />
I do have a real soundblastercard as well so I can listen to other stuff but I can't have any sound on when I play *sobs unconsolably*<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With a random freeze-up, it honestly could be any number of things.  First thing I'd check is the low-tech solution.  Are you fans (CPU and video card both) working well?  Overheating can lock your computer and fry it if it persists.  Typically it will lock up more based on how long the computer is on, rather than how long you've been playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Also, check the datarate in your EQ ini file.  The datarate defaults at 5.0 (I think).  Anything above a 9.0 is the same as a 9.0.  Anything below a 3.0 won't work either, as I recall.  The datarate determines the speed at which your computer receives info from the servers.  Dial-up should be around 3-5, cable/DSL should be from 7-9.  Datarates too low or high could also lock the game.<br />
<br />
I'd check those 2 things first and see if they help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought that it may be overheated so I let it sit overnight before trying again. My fans are working properly, that was one of the first things I checked. I normally don't leave it running, I shut it off when I'm done. Which is usually no more than a couple hours at a time. <br />
<br />
I use a RAS dial up so I left the datarate.txt file at 5.0<br />
My soundcard isn't built into the motherboard but I will try turning the sound off. See if that fixes anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also had overheating problems. I upgraded my machine a while ago, from a Duron to an Athlon. The heatsink fo the Athlon CPUs is bigger, and the design of the case I had didn't allow proper air flow over the larger heatsink.<br />
<br />
I recently bought a new case and a new PSU, the machine is much more reliable now.<br />
<br />
And I don't think leaving the machine overnight will tell you much - the CPU probably reaches its normal temperature within a few minutes, and cools down just as fast. Your BIOS shoud have a temperature monitor, and you can also get desktop programs to tell you the current CPU temp. I'm not sure how hot a Pentium 1.6 GHz should run, but I'd guess less than 50 Celsius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had a similar problem for a while. At first I thought it was overheating, so I bought newer / better fans. That didnt help. The problem ended up being memory. I had a bad stick of memory.<br />
<br />
Check your memory - pull out one stick at a time, and see how it works, till you isolate the bad stick, or rule out that problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Basma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i had the same problem with my everquest locking up..it could happen just as soon as i log on..or a few minutes,hours later..when i switch video cards to geoforce4 ti 4600, ..it never locked up again....so try switching the card....btw..i also tried a geoforce2 440 card..and it also cause my  game to lock up or freeze...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Letting it sit overnight has nothing to do with it man.  An athlon processor with no fan on it will burn up to like couple hundred degrees and fry in 7 seconds.  Overheating doesn't happen from running the pc too long, it happens from lack of proper cooling inside, and/or faulty hardware.  Keep your PC open while you run EQ next time.  Play til it locks up.  After it locks up, put your hand to your heatsink on the video card and processor, and if they're hot to the touch, there's a problem.  With one of my old backup pc's, this video card was too much for the PC, and EQ was too much for the pc.  Same thing would happen, i'd lock up very quickly, and heatsink on vid card would singe my hang.  I had to run it open with a house fan blowing into it to be able to play on that pc.<br />
<br />
My soundcard isn't built into the motherboard but I will try turning the sound off. See if that fixes anything<br />
<br />
You don't have to disable the sound card on the board, or in windows.  All you have to do is when you first start up eq, before you enter your password select options.  It'll ask for you to select your vid card, then the models you want enabled.  The 3rd screen will have check boxes, one of those is &quot;Sound&quot;.  Uncheck it.  Exit out of EQ, and go back in.  If this corrects your lockup problems, try getting the newest drivers for your sound card.  If that doesn't work (which it probly won't), you might think about disabling onboard sound and putting a newer/better pci sound card in there.  I recommend Sounblaster 128, works wonderful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go ahead and lower your data rate to 4, too.  You said you were on dial-up.  If your modem is getting too much info, the game will lock up.  If you notice decreased performance, then you can always turn it back up.  Offhand, I'd bet on the datarate being too high at the moment.<br />
