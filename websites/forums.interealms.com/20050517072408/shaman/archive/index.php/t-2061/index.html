<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just has a blast last night beholding the power of the shaman. I duo a shaman and warrior. Shammy my main warrior pretty much my pet. My friend plays Sk and now has a 2nd account shaman so we group together alot. Just got done killing 4 arm freaks in ME. I guess alot of people who dont play shaman wouldnt want two in a group but its been great even with his shaman only lvl 40 and still using greater heal.<br />
<br />
    My shaman is 55, warrior 54 ...His SK is 55 and shaman 40. He is MA usually do to the warrior not being my main he has better gear and sk's tank better than given credit alot of times. Anyway what i had so much fun with is he would pull I'd slow which stuck no problem and than debuff since dots werent sticking just in case we wanted to use them. He would take over heals as needed while i  canned back to FM. Not sure he realizes the power of the cann because we had a cleric CH and he said &lt;insert fave swear word here&gt;. I said bad news is cleric ched herself good news is i am FM again. He was worried his shaman was down to like 30 mana and still using cann1 so he thought i was in the same boat. So i took over healing and a dot while he canned his shaman back up but it wasnt needed mob died and just seemed to run out of mana while we were ready to pull again very shorltly after. Excuse the ramble cuz i am tired but just trying to picture the mana cycle two torpor cabable shamans can do. I can get mana back pretty quick with just cann3 and an iksar regen bp, 3 points of regen in AAexp and regrowth. His shammy has the regen bp also just not the lvls yet. <br />
<br />
       The sideeffect of all this is my poor lvl 55 wizard hasnt been played very often because it can drive me crazy have very little options for mana regen beyond an occasional harvest and sitting. Any of the rest of you spend any time grouping with another shaman in a situation like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">never needed another shaman in the group when im playing shaman. Last time I played it was a group of us, me on monk and shaman, 2 rangers, a wiz and an enchanter. We did a good chunk of disco in Seb with shaman being main healer, never went low mana and I dont have torpor, though the rangers tried to avoid taunting so the monk kept aggro to reduce healing required.<br />
<br />
If a warrior is main tank then I much prefer a cleric as healer for efficiency, if a monk is tank then a shaman can easily keep up with heals.</div></div><hr />
