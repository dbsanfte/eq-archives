<br />
Last night I got my 7th cudgel :) The boss for this one is around level 55, not 50 as the website suggests - he was db to the level 60 and red to the level 48. A druid, pally, bard, and warrior combo (+me and dogdogs) quickly killed him in under 60 seconds.<br />
<br />
It was overkill cause I did not want to have to get another dusty skull ever again :)<br />
<br />
I was using my 7th cudgel last night, got my 1hb up from 112 to 126, it was nice to see it proc'ing on mobs... :)<br />
<br />
The only sad thing is the 8th cudgel actually removes some stats. Namely - the cha and the magic resist. I don't really care about the cha, but I do care about the MR, I don't understand why the 7th cudgel actually has more stats than the 8th. Blah :)<br />
<br />
I have all the bits for the 8th... now to get enough people flagged for HS and a rogue and the Iksar Apparition all up at the same time.... I've got my iksar relics... it's cudgel time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bah, I didn't think the first post went through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It dropped of an Undertaker skellie for me.<br />
<br />
After 5 hours of clearing HS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First of all, Gratz!<br />
<br />
Second, did the dusty skull drop off a specific named mob, or is it random from just any old mob?<br />
<br />
And finally, how restant is Thugga (sp?)?  I'm going on a questing spree this weekend as soon as I ding 56 and he's one of my targets.  Most of what I found on Illia's was people saying OMG he's a big meenie and turnde me into a globilin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thought arisen was 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I duo'd Thugga with a 56 ranger.<br />
<br />
He went down so fast, it was funny.<br />
<br />
I have a picture somewhere of us both in goblin form... him with ranger epics, me with my shaman epic.<br />
<br />
Bring a friend, but don't expect the fight to last long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimtug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just wanted to add my 2cp about Thuuga.  I'm 56 and thought I would take a stab at soloing him.  First time I had to gate as he had me and dog under 20% health.  Second time around I was a little more cautious and sicked dog, then malosi, then turgur's.  It took a few heals on the pet and he will summon you so be ready for that.  He went down fairly easy that way with me and dog with over 50% health left and still around 40% mana.  Got the Changeling Essense and also had fun running around as a gobo with a gobo pet since he cast &quot;polymorphic&quot; something on both of us.  Good luck =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya Harvyst, I'm all for overkill on anything that takes you more than a couple hours to get.  Think I had like 4 L60's at the Arisen fight and one was a MB wizard. :p<br />
<br />
Good luck on your final fight and just remember to let the script play through fully before going nuts on VS.  I have heard too many people talk of wiping on the 8th fight due to lack of patience and an untargettable mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so how long would you say, in all, its taken you to get to the 7th cudgel? =) congrats btw that is so awesome that you got it, i am wanting to start working on mine soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Congrats! I just finished my 7th cudgel also today :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Timing. A lot of people have asked me about timing.<br />
<br />
I took a few days off around Christmas, and goofed off. Mostly I worked on this quest. I think I've spent 30+ hours on it... most of them during the 24th 25th 26th 27th I had off for Christmas.<br />
<br />
I haven't done anything since the first week, I've been using the 7th cudgel to raise 1hb - just maxed at 200 yesterday, yay.... and our tank/cleric combo has been busy. Now that I've maxed 1hb, I'm going to start trying to drag a good group to HS... the problem is the right people at the right time. A lot of the people in my guild don't have the HS key and don't want to bother with it - I will gladly get the bit from xalgoz for them but I won't farm the prod as I'm on chardo faction.... so it's a bit of arranging.<br />
<br />
Got the iksar relics, got the faction.<br />
<br />
Anyone know whether a druid can see the Iksar Apparition from zone in? Whether a ranger can? How good of a ranger? I need to know if he's up before I drag people down there, but knowing who to beg to check to see if he's up is the key....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh, I got my seventh cudgel last night as well.  It only took one night in Howling Stones, it was a pretty nice surprise.  We didn't get the dusty skull until we were fighting to the zoneout; I believe it dropped from the undertaker skeleton for us too.<br />
<br />
I started getting nervous when we were fighting our way out and I hadn't gotten the dusty (despite an overabundance of glowing ones!).  I told our necro that since he was good with skeletons, he should tell them to drop a dusty skull for me lol.  He did and the group laughed...but then it dropped three pulls later. :)<br />
<br />
Overall I would guess that I've spent about 33 hours on this quest.  12 of them were that damned crusader in Kurns. &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />
