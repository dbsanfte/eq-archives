<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went into PoG this evening and suffice to say things didn't go all that hot.<br />
<br />
Now to set the table:<br />
<br />
13 in raid.<br />
<br />
1-Shaman-52<br />
1-Enchanter-51<br />
2-Clerics<br />
8! - SK's and Pallies<br />
1- Wizard<br />
<br />
We got into a bad cycle.  MOB (White to Red to me) would pound on MA until I got it slowed. (Tranquil Treant even). Then I had aggro until MOB or Faern was dead.<br />
<br />
Cleric heals? Well a CH would aggro the MOB, a HoT would not be enough to offset the damage from an unslowed (and pissed) Brownie looking thing, or Tree, and Fawn. ( I was burning though 3/4 to half a bar sometimes)<br />
<br />
Ok - BESIDES going with a higher level MA, waiting a tic longer before getting resisted by Malosi, OR trying a lower level slow first..<br />
<br />
any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Oh 1 drop in 8 MOBs - Awesome Cleric legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You gotta kill a LOT of mobs to see decent drops.  Drops are rare in POG.  Nevertheless, they are free, no gems or faction required.  So if you got the time and the patience you will see them.   I've got almost a full set of PoG armor in the bank as backup gear.  Only missing arms and one bracer in fact.  But I've done a lotta PoG in my time.  Last Tunare raid I finally got the bp for my collection off a treant I think.  No, nobody else needed it or wanted to loot it.  I figured . . hey, backup gear heh.  My backup gear roxorz!  Erm, for backup gear heh.<br />
<br />
Whoa I get sidetracked fast.  I assume the chanter was tashing.  If not, u gotta work that out with him.  Tranq treants are more MR than most.  You gotta spam malosi till it lands if you dont wanna get owned by slow aggro.  Get a hp buff so you look tuffer to the mob.  Low hp aggro is a bitch.  Try rooting the mob if u got aggro.  If it sticks it will stop summoning and focus on killing whoever is closest to it.  Spam Malosi until it sticks is my best advice tho.  Low aggro spell and then only need one cast of Turgurs for the slow so no real big aggro by then.  <br />
<br />
Mostly you are just way low level to be slowing in PoG without a 60 mage (Mala) or shaman (Malo) along.  Not that I want to discourage you, but understand it will be much more difficult than it is for a 60.  You guys *might* wanna just bite the bullet and get thurg armor.  Tho in my mind, the two places are kinda equal and if shaman lewt drops in PoG you will have better odds of being the one to loot it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">with that turn out your going to do nothing but kill the pogs all nite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Much easier and more enjoyable than doing PoG at level 52, in my experience, is taking a 24 volt DeWalt hammer drill, equipping it with a 2 inch diameter, 22 inch long SDS masonry bit, pressing the tip of the bit against your eye, then pulling the trigger and pushing your face toward the drill.<br />
<br />
I hate to give bad advice, but yeah, you gotta level up if you're the only shaman there. Otherwise, you'll never level up, because you'll be eating way too many deaths.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get at least level 55, and bring an enchanter thats at least 55.  Hell if you are going to do a 2 group raid you should all be 55.<br />
<br />
You are better off going to Kael with that make up and getting drops for Thurg armor.  You won't see any BP's or some class items because of the mobs they drop from you couldn't touch at that level.  That and paladins don't have gear in PoG.   You can get gear for everyone in Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry to go off topic, but I've got a question that you guys might be able to answer for me.<br />
<br />
Would a barbarian be KOS there, or could I wander around freely?<br />
I know it only takes a couple of kills to get to KOS but what do I start out at?<br />
<br />
I've not been there before, and would like to take a look without waiting for or organising a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm sure I did a POG raid or two at level 54, so it's not as bad as it might seem.<br />
<br />
I'd say, make sure your puller is only getting a single mob at a time, first off. Then, coordinate your casting with the enchanter, so you can get in a Malosi just after they tash. Try a slow, and if it doesn't take, don't get yourself killed trying too many times. I am sure 12 people can handle a single unslowed POG mob.<br />
<br />
Of course your raid will move slower because healers will need to med more, but that's better than dying every other pull.<br />
<br />
YMMV of course - but I just hate advice that goes &quot;get to level 60 before you consider doing anything&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Barbarian shamans dont start off kos in PoG so you should be good Haleice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Bruin,<br />
<br />
I'll have to get my backside there and do a spot of fishing whilst I wander about. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unfortunatly level. Chain cast Malosi until it lands. It should land fairly well after Tash, if you got a 55+ bard in gig ask them to keep OOS until mobs are slowed.<br />
<br />
And ... what the hell are you doing in PoG if not going for Tunare. That zone is a waste of effort. You and a high level tank (55+ to solo pull) can do KD bank area easy for better quality armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">2-3 groups low-50s can do fine in PoG, with the following exception, you need a 55-56 MA and a 55ish enchanter.  I'm 52 and can slow about 3/4 of the stuff there  in 1-2 casts after tash.  Need to work well together, assist, etc., but its perfectly doable at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Protector's of the Grove are broken on our server, do not know if that's the case everywhere else.  They don't come running, they just sit back at their spawn points.  Makes the zone doable with 2 high lvl groups ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Doable, but you have to be very coordinated:<br />
<br />
1: Stand next to chanter and mage/other shaman<br />
2: Listen to Chanter tash, follow mage/other shaman follows with maolsi-type spell, you follow quickly with chain-slow until it sticks (at least the chanter isn't getting whacked).<br />
3: Move on to the next mob (who hopefully is mezzed)..slow/rinse/repeat<br />
<br />
Dont' sit, protect the chanters, keep your buffs up so you can absorb damage, be prepared to root/rot/getto mez.<br />
<br />
Get the best possible buffs you can for yourself..don't be shy.  Co-ordinate closely with your healers and pullers to try and limit pull-speed to the available mana.<br />
<br />
Get a Dizok stick and beat on the mobs as a last resort..any slow is better than none.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better quality.. by what measure.. arguably most PoG shaman pieces are (slightly)better then thurg because they are(slightly) more focused on hitpoints instead of mana.<br />
<br />
Granted.. pog shaman gear looks like ass.. but at least it doesnt look like Rygorr's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Didn't think about the stick ..got one in the bank rotting.<br />
<br />
We did PoG but our forces had 3 level 60's in it and the average was probably 55 when you get right down to it.<br />
<br />
I think the Protectors on every server have been all moved down from zone wide argo.  Least it is on my server too.  Hopefully they keep this.<br />
<br />
At least the zone is fun and is actually doable by small groups... great change IMO only thing needs fixed now is the lag in the zone (least on my server).  I probably didn't help it by giving feedback and asking if my sarcasum came threw or not...<br />

<br />
- You got it the other way around. Thurg has more HP than PoG. Comment was, it's 100 times easier to obtain Thurgadin armor than PoG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">DAMN, those little visits every 23 minutes kept PoG really interesting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm if PoGs really are broken for sure and for certain then I'm gonna go solo up there, or maybe duo with a monk or a couple other melees.  I was noticing they weren't regular at all on our Tunare raid, but then again they did get pulled more than a couple times . . . I dunno why, maybe they still aggro from certain points.  Maybe the pullers were just &quot;clearing&quot; them.  I dunno.  <br />
<br />
Time to go to Plane of Gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">with that turn out your going to do nothing but kill the pogs all nite <br />
<br />
protectors are broken .. <br />
<br />
i solo there .. i get 1 % of exp per kill and gems + cash = money <br />
2pox+ 3epic + dogdog+jbb'luvin = dead mob .. (pull with malo quickly slow)<br />
<br />
we have alot of people here so zone in is safe .. not too many adds<br />
<br />
lvl 20ish spell sence animals WORKS GREAT for finding your next pull <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
great place to solo .. bind at pog tree in WL .. if sh!t hits the fan gate and start over .. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
now on occasion .. theres a named black horse that is at zone in .. he sees invis and will kick your ass ... also every 1/20 &quot;whorle of energy&quot; will see invis .. <br />
<br />
<br />
i dont recommend going past the river .. mobs that gate suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've been on 4 PoG raids now and have never once seen a Protector!<br />
<br />
What level do you have to be to solo some easier mobs in POG then? Is it &quot;Torpor required&quot;?<br />
<br />
I remember I got jumped by a &quot;whorl&quot; on zoning in once, not wanting to train the raid party I slowed it, ran it off a bit and rooted it so I could camp, but I suppose I might have been able to kill it - it didn't occur to me to try sadly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have done PoG a ton both before and after Protectors broke. I think we were the first to doscover this because when we did PoG a GM came in and tried to boot us. We told him we would take the 'warning'. Hell, you would too if you just did 5 pulls and no Protectors. That was a fun night. GM hung out with us shooting fireworks and goofing off. <br />
<br />
PoG as a raid on the regular mobs sucks. I was so bored. <br />
<br />
But, <br />
We did it with single group. No chanter. Me slowing at 55. Had a bard to OOC so that made slowing a tad bit easier, but still hard because those mobs have some good MR. When the Protectors are fixed, bring yourself a druid. They kite around the Protector with snare. Pay them money loots and gems for their time kiting. Druids love money loots and gems.  They wont take any faction hits if the Protector is never killed. <br />
<br />
Dont go to PoG if you plan on shaman armor dropping. It doesnt. I have seen 5 clerics get full PoG before I saw my boots and gloves drop. Go to PoG because you cant beat the cash. I make a ton of money everytime I go. Armor is just icing. <br />
<br />
PoG is one of the funnest planes I have done. It is a cake walk once you learn your PoG wings. Bard pulling for you is the best. <br />
<br />
Anyway, GL with your future raids.<br />
