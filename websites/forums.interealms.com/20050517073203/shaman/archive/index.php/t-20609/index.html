<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">GMs (Well, senior guides in this case) decided to do a Best of the Best the other night.  They split casters and melee apart and this is where I think things were going to look bad.  The put Bards with casters.  Fine, during the caster portion, a good way through it they changed the rules and dissallowed all heals.  Of course they still allowed lifetaps.  Needless to say, the shaman who was winning lost to a druid.<br />
<br />
The melee protion was even worse (so i was told on this).  The restricted them to the platform in the center of the arena so rangers archery became usless.  And then they decided to disallow melee healing, so paladins who had the advantage quickly lost it to SK's Harmtouch and monks mending.  <br />
<br />
To top it off, the monk who was winning, was disqualifed for leaving the platform when he didnt. (the guide has never cared for his guild).  <br />
<br />
Needless to say, is it any wonder why you see so many people talking about moving to WoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was part of the caster one on karana.<br />
<br />
Was fantastic. Would do one everyday, no question. Well organised, firm rulings and no arguements. No dispell, no levitate, other than that it was FFA. Bard won (no surprise) but we got 2 of the other bards down very quickly. <br />
<br />
No healing? Hmm, that must have sucked.</div></div><hr />

Once WoW/Lineage2 start to put a serious dent in EQ I'm thinking SOE will start to pay attention to the pvp aspect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really have to disagree. SoE or VI has never cared about PvP at all. It only exists cause people cried out enough for it, but its pretty obvious its a small part of the EQ world. Sorry if that offends anyone in PvP, but im not making it up. Just look at the server # of servers vs PvE and look at how the PvP enviroment is still broken. <br />
<br />
<br />
EQ is just not focused on PvP and i think you need to find a better game if thats what your into. Atleast thats what i see right now.<br />
<br />
Mind you like PvP and the only reason i dont PvV is cause as a shaman i dont feel i bring alot to the table other then a really long and drawn out death. But im sure me sucking at PvP doesnt hurt that either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like I've mentioned in pretty many other posts, EQ has the potential to be an extremely good pvp game. It just needs some balance tweaking and a bit of a runover when it comes to hitboxes and anti-ghosting to help melees out.<br />
<br />
But you are right, Verant/SOE never really gave the pvp aspect a second thought. There were some enthusiasts who tried but they got 'relocated'. What I'm saying is that once some other games, with pvp content, get out on the market SOE will realize the potential of real player vs player interaction (conflict if you will) and start to look into it. <br />
<br />
Just my opinion tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A Chanter from Eternal Wrath won it on AR. Didn't even know it was going on till it was over.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">totally missed it myself. Friend of mine finished second, was a 65 wizzie from like the 4-5th best guild on torv. Lost out to a cleric from his guild. <br />
PvP isn't really what eq's about though, and the fact that the PvP servers have low usage points that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We had this same event, although it was also a large pvp.  Ended up that the best rouge on our server won.  No real surprise at all there, she wiped out everyone.  other than that, I saw a post about lineageII? That game is horrible /shrug. Worst game i've played in a long time, main reason..They can't afford to hold a proper a non laggy server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Had this event on Sol Ro..and believe it or not Score one for the Shaman.  The Shaman won their division.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Same event on Friona Vie server and a shaman won also, gratz &quot;Elder Toxox Keeper of the Ages&quot;. Toxox and myself 65 Shaman also were cleaning up peeps i think i came in fifth as i was so pumped and attacked a GM and smacked here down to 50% hp with some root rot and got DQ'ed. LMAO Anyway was great fun killing druids and clerics :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This took place on Tunare also, Cept there was no caster fights. Just melee. And on top of that, LR Arena zone crashed and they moved the melee contestants to a private zone (ArenaB), noone was able to watch or anything...<br />
<br />
quite a letdown...</div></div><hr />

Bah I always miss the cool gm events on FV...tho I think Toxox would pwn me  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was a blast on Zeb.  I took 8th.. a Bard didn't win, wooot.. and a Chanter ended up winning the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

*** the game went open beta last week and has been SWAMPED with players well beyond what they were expecting...give em a chance to put up some new servers to lighten the load before you call it the worst game ever because of lag. you should be expecting high lag in a beta not being surpriesed that it exits.<br />
<br />
<br />
and for the pvp vrs pve players, you are right about the zeks having lower pops but I would blame that (at least a large part of it) on the fact that verant/sony A dont give a ****, B are complete imbicels when it comes to balance, and C never got it into their heads that if the game was a Good pvp game instead of the festering pile of crap it is right now more people would play.<br />
<br />
some simple changes to classes would bring balance in line much more than it is right now, it would only take 1 patch (and of course the mandatory 8 patches to fix the patch) <br />
<br />
I am looking forward to lineage and so are a ton of my guildies, several are already playing and I signed up last night. Sony had the chance, they dropped the ball and let it roll away. I like alot of the people I have met in eq, I like alot of the content but for me the game has always been to damn easy in the pve aspects and the pvp while often a blast is just to damn broken.</div></div><hr />
