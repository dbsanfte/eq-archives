<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm planning to try to get the Spirit Wracked Urn of her to quest the Spirit Wracked Cord. How many people is the lowest i can do that with? How hard does she hit? and how can she be reached the best way...<br />
<br />
Would be really great if i could solo her, but i dont think that is possible because i heard she isnt solo pullable...Not sure how that is at 65 though...<br />
<br />
Any Info would be great...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gonna need a rogue.  You have to travel through HS south wing, through several locked doors, up around some hidden back tunnels, then through all of the east wing.  Trying to do it solo would take hours (assuming you even could).  1 group is probably enough to do the whole thing, the more you add the faster you go.  I'd recomend yourself, rogue (necessary), enchanter (really helps, can pull faster), and a cleric (just in case someone dies to massive HT, there's a lot), you won't be dragging anyone back to IZ.  Add anything else from there to speed things up.<br />
<br />
Here's a good map, http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/howling5.gif, the entrance to east wing is blocked by the fake stairs (can't climb up).  The green dot in east is zone out, backtrack from there 2 red dots and that's drusella's room.  She wanders around, I think there are 4 or 5 other mobs inside as well.<br />
<br />
I believe her spawn is 3 or 4 days, don't remember off hand.  Easiest way to track her is plant a mage with sense summmoned at the safe spot below IZ, DS's pet is the only summoned mob in the zone.</div></div><hr />
