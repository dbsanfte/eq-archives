<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been deleting spells from my spellbook, but have come across some spells that do not bring up the delete option box.  The spells are:<br />
<br />
Cannibalize III<br />
Talisman of the Cat<br />
Shroud of the Spirits<br />
Blast of Venom<br />
Spirit of the Howler<br />
Spirit of Scale<br />
<br />
If you can, please check that these spells cannot be deleted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When they first introduced the ability to delete spells, they stated that only purchased spells could be deleted -- dropped/quested/nodrop spells would not be deletable.  I assume this policy was implemented so that you didn't accidently delete a spell that would be a major pain to re-acquire down the road if you decided you needed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I'd be crying in me beer if I deleted Spirit of Scale :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's the idea, each spell has a flag for whether or not it is &quot;Deletable&quot; from your spellbook. Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net) shows it. This feature was added in the patch of Sept 4 2002 -- when the spellbook only had 250 slots and they were about to introduce tons of new spells with PoP.<br />
<br />
But I notice quite a few of them are flagged incorrectly -- dropped spells that should not be deletable but are, and vice versa. Makes you wonder how Sony can be so confident about things like spell drop rates when they can't even figure out which of their spells are vendor sold. Some examples: Focus of Spirit, Khura's Focusing, Cannibalize II  :eek: are deletable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why delete spells?  Just move them to the back.  Way, way, way in the back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, now you might want to delete old spells to simplify the right-click menus. I like how they've done it though, with the higher level spells at the top, so it's not a big deal to keep old spells in your book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I gotta keep my lowbie buffs around so when a n00b comes up and says &quot;buffs plz&quot; I can give him Spirit of Monkey and run away.</div></div><hr />
