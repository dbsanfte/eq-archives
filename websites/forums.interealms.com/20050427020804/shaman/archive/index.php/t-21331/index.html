<br />
However, I popped my nose in there today and it was like British railways - everyone bitching about trains....  Could well become the new HHK.</div></div><hr />

hehe Mistmoore has -always- been known for its trains:  one route to zone that's a long narrow corridor + fast spawn rate + big aggro radius = train factory.  It's just not been as populated until its ZEM was bumped.<br />
<br />
I PLed my rogue in there last night and went from 20-23 in about an hour or so fighting level 30ish mobs.  It just took her forever to kill anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldunson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Went from 20 to 21 in less than an hour this morning.  Good group though, which always help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>arfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One dies a lot in mm, between trains and the caster mobs it can be a lot of back and forth. That being said it is very good xp and you dont have to go far to the next spawn. <br />
<br />
This week on xegony it has been populated with PL activity, where two or three people pretty much control the entire zone. Can be kind of frustrating if you dont bring along your 65 shami or drood. Was enough to convnce me to move.<br />
<br />
I took a flier to check out Kunark content. Only 3 people in LoIO. I remember 100 in the day. Is FM any better?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahh mistmoore, affectionately known as Trainmore. For many of us, the zone in was the sight of our first serious pile of corpses. The horror...the horror.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was in FM the other day with a friend and his wife. We had the zone to ourselves on Vazaelle. It seems like any more pre luclin content is about deserted, unless there is an ldon camp in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oldunson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Been in Mistmoore now for some time.  Got to Level 33 pretty easily.  On Venril Sathir finding a group is usually pretty easy, although there are usually less than 8 people in the zone.<br />
<br />
The train situation can still be bad and deaths are fairly regular.  But apart from the boring CR, the loss of XP can be made up very quickly.<br />
<br />
The next zones on the &quot;Hot Spot&quot; list are ToFS and Splitpaw.  I suspect getting groups there will be far more difficult...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The first time i ever went to mistmoore, as soon as i zoned in i saw about 9 corpses there, and about half of them were people i grouped witha nd from my guild and so i was like woah! Cuz im stilla  noob and stuff, and noobs are afraid of dying.</div></div><hr />
