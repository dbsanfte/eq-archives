<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">28-6. I haven't seen a butt whipping like that since the LAPD reunion party at Rodney King's house.<br />
<br />
Kudos to Willingham on a good effort tho. ND was hobbled with a lot of injuries and their offense is not what I would call &quot; high powered&quot;<br />
<br />
We're the Red and White from State <br />
And we know we are the best. <br />
A hand behind our back, <br />
We can take on all the rest. <br />
Come o'er the hill, Caroline. <br />
Devils and Deacs stand in line. <br />
The Red and White from NC State. <br />
Go State!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NCSU 1983 here<br />

&quot;Come over the hill, Caroline&quot; huh?<br />
<br />
I got to play in the pep band for the NCSU basketball game last Sunday because the regular band were all members of the marching band and were therefore en route to the Gator Bowl already... boy, that was a blast from the past.  I only recognized one song besides the fight song and Red and White.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">NCSU class of 98 here.<br />
<br />
Tried to get tickets...but they were sold out before they went on sale I think.  I think I heard the announcers say that State sold 14K tickets.  Wish I could have been one.<br />
<br />
Oh, and just a note...While I was at NCSU, I believe that the line was informally changed to  &quot;GO to hell, Carolina&quot;.  AT least, thats what we always sang.  Got spraypainted on the brickyard one year....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, &quot;Over the hill, Carolina&quot; is the nice G-rated line that's printed in annuals and pamphlets. Everybody knows what the true line is, as well as the true line in Carolina's fight song, which is &quot;Piss on Carolina-lina.&quot; :-)<br />
