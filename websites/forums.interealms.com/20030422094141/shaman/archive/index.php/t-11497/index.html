<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">20kish on Karana - if I buy one will I be disappointed??  I am lvl 63, and mostly solo/duo, which may make a difference.  Thanks for your response.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no, you will not be disappointed.  It takes away from the time that it takes to casts all buffs, and all heals not including your 10sec gimp CH..<br />
<br />
I found mine for 5k one night, and it was a steal, but not only just because of the price, but because of the effectiveness.  It will help save you a lot too when you get that slow resist and you need to keep chain cast heal to keep yourself alive till someone can peel the mob off of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">me thinks they made this focus stuff too confusing - from the looks of it I am thinking I will have bags of focus items and have to be switching them around as I am switchihg around my spells, which is not a lot of fun.  And the new names are not a big help - preffered Spell Haste - easier to figure out.  Oh well.../whine off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm there with Valsuvious, paid 5k in bazaar.  Average price I've noticed since then has been around 20k.  Guess we were both lucky.  Priviously used Djarrn's ring with spell haste on it, but I like this one better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been really happy with mine.  Nice to have shorter cast times.  Also, I got a real steal on mine, found it for 1k in the Bazaar :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">what does it drop from in CoD anyways?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nmok Soulblighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Firebone Archmagus drops it rarely.  I have been killing back there in the Undead part of CoD for a quite a while now and still haven't gotten one.  Only seen 2 drop ever nd both went to shaman in the guild I was raiding with.  To get more stuff to pull, just blow the Caprin cycle and then you can pull more mobs so you have more spots for him to spawn at.  Can be done by a necro solo, but I use a 65shaman and my friend's 65 Necro.<br />
