<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I always considered myself a decent soloer...I am twinked btw.<br />
<br />
But I have not played my shaman since the changes to Dots as it pertains to movement/Dot reduction.<br />
<br />
I took my 24 shaman out to SK..to the gnoll spires.  All the mobs are red/yellow to me.<br />
<br />
Damn! does no DOT penalty make a diff!!  Afflication, EB...kite around...EB again.....slow...melee last 1/4.<br />
<br />
Yellow/Red doesnt matter...!  With no resists...I end up with 1/4 bulb health gone...and 2-2.5 mana bubs gone.  Worse case scenario is 1 bub health gone...4 mana gone.<br />
<br />
Still....Im gushing..<br />
<br />
back to my shaman for a bit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try getting a focus item that increases duration of dots by 20%.  If your shaman is level 24, you can probably manage to find a cheap one too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">BTW, the focus effect is called extended affliction.<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/focus/<br />
<br />
Ok site for focus item info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kobold boots:  Extended Affliction II (20% longer duration on DoTs under level 45) - probably no more than 50 pp.<br />
<br />
Chipped Bone Bracer:  Affliction Efficiency II (25% less mana to cast DoTs under level 45) - few hundred pp, tops.<br />
<br />
Suddenly EBreath goes from a damage/mana efficiency of 2.19 (219 dmg... 30 + 27(7)... for 100 mana) to a damage/mana efficiency of 3.28 (246 dmg... 30 + 27(8)... for 75 mana).  A 50% improvement for a few hundred pp is a good investment. <br />
<br />
Between that and the removal of the DoT while moving penalty- it's a good time to be a DoTing low-level shaman!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe...I have affliction efficiency 2 (some bracer lol) + extended affliction 2 (chipped bone) + extended casting (shimmering terror hide boots...and I dont think its extended casting...but it makes you able to cast from farther out)<br />
<br />
Overall..yes...I feel overpowered lol.  Even if I wasnt twinked...Im sure untwinked shamans can do even cons with minimal sweat.  When I get dog -dog..oh me garsh.<br />
<br />
Hey...BTW...I hit these boards pretty hard for equipment suggestions..way back when.<br />
<br />
I picked up a couple new weapons..one of which wasnt suggested..well...really at all from what I can remember...but I want to put in a good word for it.<br />
<br />
Sharpened Mandible Spear (1500pp)  great dps...35 hp +wis I think....great spear if you cant afford REIF.  Actually, I could afford an REIF (3000-3500pp) on BB....but instead I bought the sharpened mandible spear...A Sarnak Battle Shield (love that sucker)...and a Fungus Tarmok Staff (sp) 30/45 +7 disease damage....figured those three were more than equal to just one REIF.<br />
<br />
Besides..for those that care...the shield and the Funus staff have GREAT graphics....<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your feedback!</div></div><hr />

Kiting is like riding a moped.  A lot of fun until your friends catch you.</div></div><hr />

Hey...I sure has hell cant tank a red mob...lol...so whats wrong with DOTing a mob and running around until its at 1/3 health, them using melee to finish it off?!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh wait...root rotting is much better...right?<br />
<br />
This must be some form of machoism...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe - to each his own.   some guys like mopeds and fat chicks.  root/rotting isn't quite as bad as dot-kiting... i'd equate it to having your spleen removed through your ear. ;-D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">heheh - i'm not saying it's wrong.  lots of people choose to root/rot, and since the change, i'm sure that many dot-kite.  i'm just saying that i don't enjoy these two methods.  i personally find it to be very boring, and would much rather stand toe to toe with a mob while my magic does the trick than to sit back and med or run around like a druid.  again, it's just my preference, and is the way i've played my shaman since the day he was created.<br />
<br />
despite what many of us on this board might say at times, there's only one wrong way to play a shaman:  the way that isn't fun for the person playing.  if you have fun with a particular style of play, then more power to you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah...I was just feeding this dwindling flame for all it was worth lol....<br />
<br />
I only Kite when soloing yellow/red mobs..which overall isnt very efficient...well, not terrribly efficient anyway :)<br />
<br />
Even and blue cons....I snare...apply Dots...slow...canni couple times...wait until bout 2/3 health...than tank.<br />
<br />
Then again...I learned all that from the elders here... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The problem with dot kiting is that after a certain point (like say, level 30) it just doesn't work anymore.<br />
<br />
Envenomed breath stops having the ability to kill things in less than an hour, and your next DoT isn't until 34 (and a disease besides, so it is naturally slow). 39 is your next poison DoT, and then the problem you start running into is mana consumption, and casting time. It is hard to channel the higher end spells through an unslowed mob hitting you, and the cast time on them is too long to get it off before the mob is eatting your underwear...thus forcing your to slow the mobs, and if you are going to slow them (and since you now have a pet), why not just stand there and beat them to death? It is a lot faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The reason I despise Kiting is the damage it can do to others near you if you dont' watch out.</div></div><hr />

Well firstly I think its simply cheesy.  NOT just my personal taste, but a pretty common opinion.  Showing your back to the enemy and running away from it is hardly heroic fantasy.  If you can't see that, then you might reflect on fantasy novels: how many descriptions of kiting do you come across compared with hack and slay?<br />
<br />
Secondly, it causes problems for other players.  You need room to kite, so immediately you cause some inconvenience for other players in the same area: lag etc.  raises the potential of greater problems still.  Thats why root/rot is frowned on less.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, its commonly associated with druids.  Any behaviour which makes us look like druids is bad news: even the least perceptive person must have noticed that druids are the most loathed class in the game.<br />
<br />
Fourthly, its bad tactics if you do it so much that you don't max. out your defence skill.  If you can't figure out why thats a problem I despair of you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummm, I haven't read any Heroic fantasies where the protagonists gather so many people togather that the dragon doesn't possibly have a chance to live and then dance around after they've killed him? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Kiting is a STYLE.  It aint your style, that's fine.  It's a style that many other Shammy's use, don't denigrate them for it.<br />
<br />
*** folks, I don't see the Necro boards saying &quot;Fear Kiting: right or wrong.&quot;  Much of EQ is repetative and boring.  If how a person does it doesn't endanger others or unfairly shut out others, then who's to say what's &quot;RIGHT&quot; about how they levelled up?<br />
<br />
It sounds kinda like American Football in the 30's where a whole bunch of teams were saying, &quot;HEY!  That whole 'passing' thing is just plain WRONG!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I remember my first time in high hold pass, watching the orcs there being killed.  The only heroes present seemed to be the orcs who, immediately they spawned, were jumped on by a pack of 12+ players.  Cheesy yes.  But how does that make kiting non-cheesy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What CrustyOldShaman says.<br />
<br />
Its a cowardly form of battle. And its inefficient as well given our abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Its a cowardly form of battle. And its inefficient as well given our abilities.<br />
<br />
This couldn't be farther from the truth. Kiting is the most efficient means of killing we have out our disposal in the lower levels and for non-summoning mobs. Even more so with nice focus items.<br />
<br />
Good kiting takes skill. MUCH more skill then slowing a mob and hitting autoattack. Many of you have either not experienced it or don't know how to do it. Bunch of naysayers.<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion but try moving to the aviak's roost area and double up to quad kiting them. That is some of my fondest memories of EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My shaman died several times in EW because I loved to fight ulthorks until I was about to drop and then go afk to regen.... several times an idiot druid would bring me 4 adds.<br />
<br />
Since they aren't undead, how do you prevent low health aggro if you kite the mob past another player who is in a close fight?<br />

Not YET you haven't!<br />
<br />
*Starts taking notes*<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, so let me get this straight.&quot;<br />
&quot;All right.&quot;<br />
&quot;The Dragon is terrifying the town, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
&quot;There are, say, thirty people in the town at any given time, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you're taking in eight groups of six to kill him, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
&quot;And when he's dead you're going to dance around?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just the Bards, Rangers and Paladins. It's their 'thing'.&quot;<br />
The Bard, Paladin and Ranger begin to Vogue.<br />
&quot;That's just silly.&quot;<br />
&quot;But we're going to get phat lew--&quot;<br />
&quot;Say it and I'll boot you in the ouchies.&quot;<br />
&quot;***??&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think I tried everything Shaman doable that didnt involve running away from mobs (the coward part coming in here).<br />
<br />
So please Viscerator. Enlighten me why is running around with the mobs behind you more efficient than having them rooted and medding/cannibalizing at the same time?<br />
<br />
Note that I think indoor xp in white to yellow indoor zones in a good balanced group is better xp and soloing only an option if you have nothing better to do. But thats personal preference!</div></div><hr />
