<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cerrou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not a shaman but I have a friend that has a 44 Shaman.  I'd like to camp Icewell for a bit but I don't know what kind of resists I'm gonna see in there.  Has anyone here been in Icewell around 44 and if so what did you think of the resists?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 44, if you get aggro you will be lucky to make it to the zone out before you die.. Not trying to be a jerk but they hit hard and fast and can't be slowed (disease possibly, not sure)<br />
<br />
Need someone tanking with nice AC/HP on these. Everything you will fight won't cast on you (Stuff upstairs does)<br />
<br />
I'm going off memory but I'm fairly certain fire spells landed on the &quot;yard trash&quot;, but magic never would.<br />
<br />
The quote from the Shaman we had was &quot;Guys I don't mind being here, but I'm completely worthless&quot;  Other than buffs, and with an enchanter doing speed he was just a regrow/heal whore.<br />
<br />
I would never go here again unless it was to farm armor for a plate twink. The exp stinks. The faction is probably good and would be the only real bonus I would imagine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of the dorfs are flagged unslowable.  And they are uber-resistant.  And if you get thru that resistance, and get their attention, a 44 shammy won't last more than 2 rounds.<br />
<br />
When hunting for faction, you typically are pulling the royals, which requires a flopper (monk or SK usually).  A good group of 60s in good gear can do the royals, but most people require 2-3 groups of mid-50+ people.   Killing the royal dorfs will give Tormax hits, which are hard to find, so you can find people doing faction work here occasionally.<br />
<br />
Someone looking for just exp can do ok with a 60/60 shammy/warrior combo.  But there are much better exp zones, not to mention the loot in Icewell from yardtrash dorfs is horrid.<br />
<br />
If you are talking about the monsters and such below the castle, i can't comment.  Never killed them except when down there for a Dain raid.</div></div><hr />
