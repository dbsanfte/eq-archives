<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there any chardok faction-giving mobs that we can safely afk kill with our pet? I popped into Droga and gave this a shot, but our pet is usually ripped up by mobs there.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nope, Droga pwns dogdog.<br />
You might be able to handle the top 3 spawns right at the drop off, just have to break them at an interval... but its gonna take you a damn long time to get all your faction hits that way.<br />
<br />
Also I had a great deal of problems with pet poofing in that tunnel down.  Mob goes into run mode, pet poofs, mob brings back 10 friends.  AFK Vova die gud!<br />
<br />
Going AFK you will also miss out on collecting the Salts and Skins for faction.<br />
<br />
I did a lot of my faction farming solo, and I tell you its a damn painful way.   Get help.<br />
<br />
Here was my favorite tactic.<br />
Mem the spell Fleeting Fury.<br />
Summon a bard and a wizard.<br />
Give the bard some buffs, tell them go pull some goblins.<br />
Bard fires up AE song.<br />
Bard runs around and gets goblins.<br />
Chain cast fleeting fury on bard.<br />
Wizard nukes.<br />
Collect 20+ faction hits.<br />
Rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
Heals don't give faction.  Fleeting fury works good though.  Very fast cast, virtually no mana.  Sometimes I had to miss faction because we pulled so many that the bard or wizard was dying and I had to heal them.  So don't go too crazy on the pulls.<br />
<br />
My other successful method was to mem that low level disease rain spell.  Grab a monk or rogue partner and do 4 mobs at a time or so.   With assassinate a rogue can just go nuts on those goblins.  So make sure to tag all for faction (with your gimped rain spell) at the beginning.<br />
<br />
I worked on faction from like March to June before I finally got mine done.   The good news is that there are often solo melee folks there looking for faction and they are usually glad for a partner.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
Give the Goblin Traitor a kiss for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I could be mistaken, however you do not get faction if you do no offensive spells/melee to a mob. <br />
<br />
for example my beastlord only engaged mobs with his pet in pog, and has yet to take a faction hit in that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was under the same impression Wildaar.  But I wasn't positive so I didn't think I should say much.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">True, but if a mob hits you and dogdog defends you then you get faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">have to dbl check that, could swear that if you do nothing, even with the mob smacking you that you dont get a faction hit.  Oh well, maybe the original poster will verify that for us ;p<br />
<br />
willing to bet, you'll wake up, go to the computer and be at your bind point as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if a mob hits you, you'll take a faction hit when it dies.... and sometimes you just have to be close to it when it dies and you may get a faction hit for some reason. can be annoying in tov if you're trying to maintain CoV or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All I say is /pet attack, my Shaman pet does 100% of the work, I don't touch the mob, but I do get the faction.  Kobolds, bandits, goblins, you name it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I AFK factioned up Paineel. (this was before the Wardens...the bastards)<br />
It works if they attack the dog and you do absolutely nothing. I wasn't even getting hit. Droga is wierd though because you don't get faction hits for slowing or healing.<br />
<br />
As for the original question, I never found a safe spot. There is places that would work well, but the mobs always run when low health and dog chases and aggros more. <br />
This might be slightly different now that pet's are neutral faction, but I don't know their status when chasing a fleeing mob. <br />
Might be worth checking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">try nurga, the goblins there are lower level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How did you AFK faction Paineel?  I factioned my monk in Warrens -- you said you did this before Warrens -- and greens ignored him.  <br />
<br />
Where did you find greens that would aggro you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wonder if you could give dog-dog that piercer that procs ROOT, or something that procs SNARE/ROOT..something like that.<br />
<br />
Bring a Muzzle of Mardu from a Mage.  <br />
<br />
Perma Hasted pet proccing root/snare.  Might do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">give your pet a Serrated Bone Dirk to keep them from running. Also, mobs no longer aggro on pets, even if they are attacking another mob. So your pet chasing a mob down the hall shouldn't matter any more if you are fighting green mobs that wont aggro on you unless you are physically (in the character sense) pretty close to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it seems to be hit or miss sometimes.  Doing Statue once I patch healed our MT the whole fight and missed out on the faction.  Ever since then I've made sure I walk over and take a swing on the thing.<br />
<br />
Also you don't always get a hit when your pet is defending you when you don't do anything else to the mob.<br />
<br />
Seems to be sure of the hit, you have to do something offensive directly to the mob (swing on it, debuff, make pet attack it).  Otherwise you may or may not get the hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I find the begining of this thread funny.  I can't believe that my dogdog would have trouble soloing the gobbos in Droga.  The level 61 pet is a level 58 warrior, and with project alpha engaged, he should rock the house.  Unfortunately, we're so high that they're not gonna aggro us very often.  the best you'd be able to do is stand at a gobbo bind point and let him eventually aggro you and dogdog kill him.  However, you never can tell when some jerk's gonna train a whole set on you, cause it's pretty obvious that yer AFK, just to see you die.  Seeing that it takes 2500 to get the faction you need to start the quests, 6 gobbos an hour isn't gonna get you very far, while you sleep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">61 pet owns Droga. It shouldn't be too tough to find an area with 2 or 3 spawns that will agro you as they pop to let dog solo. Yes, you get faction for healing in an ae-style group. I usually use the lvl 1 heal to get faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Aye Casmuss. <br />
<br />
The level 61 pet (lvl 58 warrior) totally rocks Droga...you can easily go afk with just focus and a couple weapons on him..even without weapons he can destroy the place.</div></div><hr />

I mean pet won't aggro anything on it's own.<br />
And if they aggro u and u are afk they will eventually wear u down.<br />
<br />
How is this done?<br />

Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Blarg: Me AFK'd Paineel fakshun afore da Warrens.  First me keeled as many of da Sentinels in Tox as me cud until fakshun wif dem bottomed out.  Den invis yer way to da top of da Erudin library.  Der be a 6 minute pally up der called Sir Nicalot or sumpthin (aka as &quot;Niceloot&quot; coz him drops 6pp on average which be sweet fer a lvl30 Pally mob).  Me parked me pet on him's spawn spot, wedged meself inta da corner ahind da merchants and waited fer him ta aggro me.  Puppy did da rest.<br />

SoulStorm: It all about da regen brudda.  Da mobs der be about lvl 30(?) or so and hav a hard time hittin ya and turn and start whackin on puppy as soon as it starts nippin at dem's arse.  Pet regen also be mucho big-heaps wen non-aggro so if ya got a staggered spawn, pet be full up wen next one pops.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You can stand in middle of a spawn as of about a week ago letting the mob agro u and pet killing nothin else. I did this in Warliks wood getting cabillis faction. Not the fastest way but easiest way as u can do it while sleeping or working or whatever and do more important things when home.<br />
<br />
Remember when u use to get agro from somethin and they swung at you and u out ran them then some one else killed them and u got faction hit? same principle. If they attack it dont matter who kills it you should get the hit(minus DS then u must hit the mob once)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Worked on my Chardok faction lately and a few things I noticed:<br />
<br />
-I ALWAYS got a faction hit when the goblin hit me and my dog defended me (didn't do anything offensive)<br />
-I NEVER got a faction hit when I only sent my pet in<br />
-I NEVER got a faction hit when I healed the monk who was actively fighting goblins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I just found a nice way to wack the gobos )<br />
I run in room aggroing a few gobies (usually 6 or 7) come back at spot (pet is already killing one somewhere /shrug)<br />
and cast Spirit Call and watch my 5 pet chewing the gobies really fast :D <br />
While they kill the first pull of gob, I pull a few more to get aggro untill my 5 pets despawn ) I can clear some area really fast like that :D <br />
<br />
Between Spirit call, I chain pull with Jbb and let pet kill the one that come. True spirit owns that place :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It's probably possible but I do see some potential difficulty with it.<br />
<br />
1) Getting the mobs to aggro.<br />
With the  change making pets non-aggro when not engaged you can't just park the pet in a room and let them aggro on him automatically and kill. You can work around this by placing yourself in the room but that risks death for yourself and since your talking about being afk possibly an unresable death from an expired corpse. With all the nukers and sks with ht i'd consider that a very real possibility.<br />
<br />
2) runners-<br />
Even tho the pets are non aggro when not engaged they will still aggro when they are chasing a mob so you need to make sure you don't get runners. A SBD or 2 or a stun whip can help out here but a proc is hardly a sure thing and still might get a runner which depending on the area could potentially kill your pet and then you (see 1).<br />
<br />
3) kill rate-<br />
With just the pet killing and needing to be a limited spawn so to speak the headway you'd make would be fairly minimal I'd think since you need thousands of gobblins killed and you miss out on potential extra faction from skins/salts. Might still be worth while in the long run but just doing afk killing would take a long long time.<br />
<br />
4) location-<br />
Need to find the right location. idealy it's going to be someplace out of the way with the proper number of spawns in the imidiate area but with nothing else near by so runner risk is minimal. Idealy also there should be no wandering spawns in the area since they make spliting and controlling the timing on the spawn difficult.<br />
<br />
Possible, probably. Easy, definitely not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You WILL get a faction hit if you send woofer in. You do not have to hit the mob. <br />
<br />
What I do is put on Gem encrusted ring and affliction haste belt sick woofer on one and pull about 5 or 6 others with Bane of Nife. Then Cann5 and Cann4 while they dot down, rinse repeat. Epic works too but Bane is much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The thing is, if your dog is the ONLY damage you do on a mob, and pet does under half the damage while other people does the rest, you wont get any faction hit.

Now no others were involved..it was just me solo with woofer. But he would chomp on his mob..i would bane a handful of gobbies then when woofer finished his hed nibble down the ones that bane hadnt finished off yet.</div></div><hr />
