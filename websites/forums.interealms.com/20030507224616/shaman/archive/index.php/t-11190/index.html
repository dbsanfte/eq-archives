<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vandalls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi<br />
my 20 ogre shaman is coming along good I think.<br />
<br />
I have looked at other magelo's &amp; my stats seem to be out.<br />
<br />
If anyone could check my gear &amp; decided if the stats make sense?<br />
<br />
Also appreciate any upgrade gear advice, I think my back needs it the most, but everything I look at costs 1000's pp &amp; I don't have that.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are doing great, back when I was level 20 your gear would have put mine to shame.  I had most pieces of banded and was just thinking about starting on totemic armor.  Now, if you are comparing your gear to someone that had a lot of money to twink from a second high level character, then your gear will look worse than it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I see three things that would be nice upgrades for you that don't cost all that much<br />
<br />
Tattered Mantle(AC 12 +20 HP), Goranga Idol, and Coterie Generals Cape. (idol and cape are in my magelo)<br />
<br />
These items would give you a big jump in AC and quite a few HP for under 400pp for all three if you shop around.<br />
<br />
You seem to be doing pretty well for the most part though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vandalls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks cattywumpus I will check those items out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vandalls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hi all<br />

1000 - 2000pp area<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
