<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, this is a cross post from mage boards, but since it touched on some issues with GoD/Shaman balance in general I thought I'd post it here and see the reactions.<br />
<br />
 just saw the patches about the retune of Gates of Dischord, and I wanted to post something that I feel totally sums up what is wrong with EQ and Gates of Dischord. <br />
<br />
A shaman guildmate of mine has spent a ton of time helping everyone with GoD quests, but still was wearing a crappy ring, so we decided to farm the KT trials for the Glyphed Prayer Ring. <br />
<br />
Looked around friend list, and we quickly got the following people, Pinaduz (best geared/nicest guy on Rallos Zek, warrior) Fayllia (druid with 300+ AA and full POT gear, very good healer) Gulu (Shaman with 300+ aa and Ele/VT gear, very good healer) Strydere (Ench with 500+ aa and full PoT gear) Britetribe (druid with 300+ AA aa and VT/Ele gear, very good gear) and myself, a magician with 450 AA or so, and we set out to KT. <br />
<br />
In a group with a warrior with 13000 HP's, 20% shielding, two druids with a ton of AA and a shaman A CLERIC is more valuable than a magician. I had to camp my mage and play a friends cleric in order for the group to function. This is not to be 'extra safe' or 'just in case'. They could not have beaten the named without me playing a cleric and on a mage instead. <br />
<br />
There is a mystake among the elitist that try to claim that Ikkinz trials are skill intensive. Ikkinz trials take absolutely no skill whatsoever. They just require a warrior with a ton of hit points and a ****load of healing. The strategy on the named is nill, just attack while spamming heals as fast as you can, and use DVA + DI to give yourself two 'free' heals. There is zero content in game that takes less talent to do Ikkinz. The content is not easy by any means, because it requires an extremly 'stacked' group, but it is absolutely not skill intensive. <br />
<br />
I have done hard LDoN with just Gulu/Britetribe healing countless times, and it was a hell of a lot 'harder' than Ikkinz trials.  Harder does not mean forcing certain group make ups.<br />
<br />
Vexd, on the other hand, is aboute right with difficulty, and I think trials like Vexd (mobs should be fully slowable though, please give shamans some love) with a three hour limit and without charmed pets are an appropriate challenge for a good group. <br />
<br />
EQ right now has such emphasis on healing &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all that even though druids get kick ass nukes, they never even get a chance to employ them because they are always healing. Those of you who played back in Luclin with old mod rods now what I am talking about. Mages got 'good' (by Luclin standards) nukes back in Luclin. However, no mage got even caught nuking in Luclin simply because making mod rods was a far more valuable use of his time. <br />
<br />
I won't even dwelve into the BS that is zoning into Ikkinz trials (WTG making DA a must to zone in) and whoever came up with that I hope has long been fired. <br />
<br />
Perhaps it is just me, but it has gotten to the point where I feel 'guilty' whenever I play my mage instead of a cleric on raid, because no matter the cleric turnout, I know i am much more useful on a cleric. As a matter of fact, I do not think this is a mage specific problem. Mages are a quite good DPS class and very well balanced versus other DPS classes in my opinion. <br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, I believe DPS classes are pretty well balanced versus each other. Healing classes are rather poorly balanced among each other, but there is a semblance of balance, same for tanking classes. DPS classes though in higher end content are totally imbalanced versus healing classes. Healing is just much much useful and needed than DPS <br />
<br />
Clerics are infinitely more useful than any other DPS class. Look at the roster and recruiting pages for any high end guild. You guys ****ed up the game now with the amount of healing required for bosses. PLEASE fix it.</div></div><hr />
