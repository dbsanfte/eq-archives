<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I received the Spear of Fate last night.  After starting the quest a year ago in my mid thirties, I completed it just one day after turning 50.  So this is shaping up to be a big week for me =).    I did the quest one step at a time, and there were no hitches or bumps along the way.  Gotta say I really enjoyed the story line and all.  <br />
<br />
I should also add that it is clickable at 50, some had thought it wouldn't click for me till 51.  I love the DoT, it really made exp'ing in a duo last night go easier.  I'd slow..my wife(49 rogue) and a pupply  melee the MOB down to about 75%, I root it, and the wife goes and gets the next.  Rinse and repeat.  If I had a horse, and I could med nearly the whole time, it could go on non-stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats Dagor :)</div></div><hr />

Shaman / Rogue combo? Wow. I am assuming Jobarer is a big part of yoru battle plans ?</div></div><hr />

damn this male dominated phallic society!!<br />
<br />
DAMN YOU !<br />
<br />
DAMN YOU ALL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe give this a try instead.  Let your wife stay on the current mob, and you go pull the next.  If you can keep up with that, you'll be better off in the long run.  Your dots can continue to work while you pull, but her backstabs can't.</div></div><hr />

Thanks...<br />
and actually we just make sure that she has REALLY good weapons, because the only time she gets to backstab is when I root tank for her.  <br />

Again, she usually doesn't get to BS too much when we duo.  At lower levels I used to root tank quite a bit, but lately with my increased use of cann I am much more guarded about letting some MOB eat through my Hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I duo a lot with rogues lately.   Root, curse, slow, send in pet while Plagueing.  Send in rogue while Ebolting.  Rogue gets in a backstab just before EBolt lands, and another as Ebolt brings the critter right to me.  I re-root and back off a bit, rogue gets in another BS, melees a little, then I mosey into melee range and keep agro for most of the rest of the fight.  <br />
<br />
And congrats for achieving the Spear of Fate, and thank you for doing it in a manner befitting the Heyokah!</div></div><hr />
