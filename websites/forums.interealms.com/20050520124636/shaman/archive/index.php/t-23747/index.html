<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 67 spell summons a pet identical to the one  that the level 61 spell summons.<br />
<br />
It does not quad without weapons and max hits for 60.<br />
<br />
Hope this is not working as intended or pet has way more hp or something that would make up for the spell being six ranks higher. Prob a bug but who knows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Submitted the issue to the Summit forums, thanks for the heads up (since it will probably take me WEEKS to get 67)</div></div><hr />

Just a lot of my usual unsatisfied blabber. It wont help making the expansion better so I deleted it.<br />
<br />
Have fun as long as it lasts.<br />
<br />
PS. Bara Cuda was fast enough to read my reply so sorry if I offended you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">already stated this serval times from beta test and feed back every day.  it was most diffinately known before oow went live. also vindictive spirit does nothing last hour before it went live.<br />
<br />
i found alot of the bugs you mentioned and feedback, it wasnt testers didnt find it is soe didnt have time to correct or just didnt care. although with lodn it was hard to test some things as alot of the zones where closed down so poeple focused on oow zones first, they only opened up other zones nearer the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good, then you will only have to wait 3 more months for it to get fixed.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and mark this day on the calender, I dare you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am betting it gets fixed faster than that, for the simple reason that the new pet is the FIRST spell the Lesser rune turn-in gets you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I posted this on the Sony Boards too, point out as well, the Problem with Vindictive Spirit (its marked as a benificial spell, with a target type of PLAYER_), also pointed out the GREAT lv 70 HOT, 820 a tick for 296 mana, and asked for bets about what gets fixed first (I bet the HOT gets mana raised real quick)</div></div><hr />

<br />
shush only point out the bad things! although i did feedback about that too:) still we can hope it be only 292 mana:)</div></div><hr />

Its a proven fact they they are notorious for &quot;fixing&quot; bugs that are beneficial to players extremely quickly and taking, literally, MONTHS to fix bugs that are detrimental to players.<br />
<br />
I think the Experience is too good in POF, but I have no intention of feedbacking that fact.  Soloing in Vxed is trivial with a boxed necro, but I don't plan on feedbacking that.  The assist aggro range in Droga is entirely too small, but I don't plan on feedbacking that.</div></div><hr />

well i try not to shout to hard, but this one is so obvious that even soe will notice, or cleric, or druids :) and they might take your other suggestions better if you do point out this ones too. but then again maybe they meant this to be the case? who knows   :D</div></div><hr />
