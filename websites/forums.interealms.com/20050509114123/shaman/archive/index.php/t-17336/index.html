<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As most of you are aware, the official stance for SOE in regards to camps *was* a) camps do not exist and b) the first ready to engage/spawn cycle has claim to said mob/cycle. That policy has changed now, according to our new Ayonae Ro server GM Jaanbaz.<br />
<br />
The story:<br />
<br />
A few of uswere finishing up a guildmate beastlord's epic in Timorous. Being the first to arrive, I noticed the guild &quot;Zone&quot; had about a dozen people sitting around the scout. I sat nearby waiting for them to kill it so I could tell the people coming not to bother.<br />
<br />
After 30 minutes of waiting and watching more of them slowly trickle in, everyone from my group had arrived(7 of us). I was discussing the matter with the shaman from their raid and discovered they had already been there for over half an hour even before I got there. At this point, since my group was ready, I asked them to engage or move aside so that we could. They replied they were still waiting for more people.<br />
<br />
After having over an hour to prep and still sitting there unready to engage, I told our beastlord to turn in his coin and start the cycle. I had given them first shot after all, and informed them that if they didn't take the mob at that time our group would.<br />
<br />
Our beastlord turns in his coin and starts the cycle, and we start killing the 6 spawned mobs from the turn in. At this point Tigaman sends me a tell saying he killed the scout(who our beastlord is to turn in the drops from the spawned mobs). I run up to verify this is so(it was), and receive tells from the shaman helping them that I had talked with earlier(notoriousraptor) informing me that Tigaman had killed the quest mob.<br />
<br />
I run back down in time to see Tigaman and others from his guild training every raptor they could get their hands as well as the remaining 4 spawned mobs we had been single pulling onto our group, and attempt to kill those remaining spawned mobs. Great, 4 of us die..and so do a good number of them. They also managed to knock off and loot 2 of the spawned mobs our beastlord needed.<br />
<br />
Immediately I petition, and while that is happening I get super lucky...Tigaman sends me a tell gloating that he killed our quest mob after the cycle has started, and laughing that our beastlord now has to start his epic over since he did not get the drops from the spawned mobs and had already turned in his coin. I send a /tell to the new server GM, Jaanbaz, informing her that we had trouble with people training/killstealing/killing our quest mob.<br />
<br />
Jaanbaz tells me she is looking at the petition, and asks me to send in /reports of Tigaman's tells(which he is still sending). I send in about 8 reports(yeah, he was sending that many tells), and inform the beastlord who the raid was for(who was also laughing and taunting directly to him that he now had to restart his epic) and the other people with us to report their tells from Tigaman.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm thinking we have him dead to rights at this point. We triggered the cycle after giving them over an hour to prepare with them still not ready, we have several people who /reported Tigaman sending tells that he killed the scout and laughing that our beastlord has to start his epic over. I'm even getting tells now from his guildmates there to help him informing me to let the gm's know they saw him kill and train us to screw up our beastlord's epic.<br />
<br />
The Jaanbaz lets me know he/she is looking at all of the reports now and will be with me in a minute. After a bit Jaanbaz asks me to join the csrresolutions channel.<br />
<br />
Here is the log from that(I also have screenshots of what happened before the log, however I can not host them. If someone wants to host them I will send them to you.):<br />

[Mon Oct 20 18:58:47 2003] You told Jaanbaz, 'i am an officer'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 18:58:52 2003] You told Jaanbaz, 'the guild leader is not on atm'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 18:59:42 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Alright here is deal'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:00:32 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I have my petition queue full of petitions from both of your guilds. The first thing that I want you all to understand is that sending in multiple petitions regarding the same issue will not get a quick resolution for the,'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:01:02 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'It only affects our ability to assist you.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:02:05 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Two - From what I take it is that there are issues among each other from both groups '<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:02:28 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Do I have both of you here and paying attention?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:02:35 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I am here'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:02:43 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'yes'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:04:52 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Now, As a GM if we have to interfere in this situation, we will have to take harsh action against you. If this becomes a support issue we will have to fix it completely'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:05:49 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'thats it they get away with taking our camp after we were there hour before n e one from there guild got here and when they zoned in i said scout is ours'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:06:16 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'if i may, when you are finished jaanbaz'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:07:05 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Now I have two officers of each guild with me &amp; I want this issue to be resolve here mutually. Otherwise we will just be forced to take actio '<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:07:38 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'Im so pissed i can barly see'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:07:46 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'If this occurs again, then the two of you will be held responsibile and this will be noted on each of your accounts'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:08:05 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'if he kses my mob again i get in trouble??'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:08:13 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Could I have some clarification please? Because from what I understand the first person on site and ready to engage (or) the first ready group to start a spawned event has rights.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:08:40 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'bro we were there hour before you we were waiting on fallin mate'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:09:07 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I asked them to either engage cycle or stand aside and they replied they were waiting for more when my group was ready to engage. Was I wrong to have my group engage if they had people here but were not ready to start cycle?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:10:02 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'who you think you are tellin us when we have to be rdy we will be rdy when we are rdy'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 19:11:09 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I am asking the GM about game policy to understand better if i was misunderstanding game policy'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:11:11 2003] You told Jaanbaz, 'ok'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:11:42 2003] You told Jaanbaz, 'i'm not trying to be patronizing btw i just thought i was operating under game policy'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:11:56 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'its like me buying a soda and you saying drink it now or im gonna drink it'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 19:25:58 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'up to you, would think you would like this resolved first'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:27:14 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'naa whats there to resolve?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:27:29 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'plenty from where I sit'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:28:45 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'you cant even wait for your turn at scout '<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:29:08 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'I waited hella long for scout hes a 72 hopur spawn'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 19:29:46 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'if you want to keep taunting me, by all means..i'll keep my responses aimed at the gm since I am interested in resolving this'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:30:03 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'you the problem man'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:30:12 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'Your rude and greedy'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:31:06 2003] Madruid tells CSRResolution:2, 'it floors me to know that you would just take epic mob after i said it was mine'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 19:38:32 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Will it be possible to get a reimburse for licck, since killing the scout effectively erased all of our work on his epic so far?'<br />

[Mon Oct 20 19:44:38 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Give me a few minutes, I am talking to him and I'll then get back with you'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:44:50 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'ahh ok making sure i wasnt in time out, thanks'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 19:55:35 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'i would appreciate it if you would stop taunting the person we were raiding epic for ikill'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:02:16 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Alright'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:02:21 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'k'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:03:12 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I think I have an understanding with the other guild here. I will reiterate'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:04:21 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'There were circumstances here which either of the groups could have avoided'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:04:58 2003] Ikill tells CSRResolution:2, 'ehem we said scout was camped he coulda said ok and left'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:05:21 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I do not want any further CS issues between the two guilds. I will be noting the chat I have had on the accounts of both guild officers.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:06:43 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Was I mistaken about game policy then? Could you clarify where I was mistaken so I do not make the same mistake in the future?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:06:59 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Again, this should have been resolved without GM intervention, with the groups co-ordinating with each other.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:09:23 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I was under the assumption from past rulings and statements that there are no camps in eq, and the first to engage or start a cycle had the rights to it. Their group had a full hour to engage before we did, more than thirty minutes of that I was here waiting to see if they did'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:13:01 2003] Channel CSRResolution(3) members:<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:13:01 2003] ^Jaanbaz, Jharassik, Ikill<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:13:06 2003] Ikill tells CSRResolution:2, 'we done here i mist a meeting at work to do epic i can make it for second half if i go now'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:13:53 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'The final verdict is that I just do not want any more issues between these two guilds.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:14:29 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I am not interested to punish/warn individuals, just I do not want such issues to be taking CS time'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:14:39 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'OK, but could you answer my question regarding game policy and possibly reimburse licck for all of his epic work that was erased when the cycle was interfered with?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:14:44 2003] Ikill tells CSRResolution:2, 'there was no guild issue with me there was only about six of them there'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:15:33 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I realize CS time is stretched pretty thin but I was under the assumption I was toeing the line as far as game policy goes'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:16:22 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'No, I will not be able to reimburse that. As for the policy decision, KS &amp; taking over spawns from guilds is frowned upon and not acceptable.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:16:35 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'That is in the Rules of Conduct for Everquest'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:16:47 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Ok, why will you not reimburse when you have logs showing him admitting he ksed it'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:18:05 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'and my question revolves around the soe policy towards what constitutes a &quot;claimed&quot; mob. Are you stating that mobs can in fact be camped and it is not first to engage/first with the force ready/first to start cycle is not always the rightful owner of spawn?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:19:33 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Yes the rules revolves around that its not appropriate to attack/KS something that someone else is fighting'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:20:00 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'But there are ways to deal with situations like this.. instead of runing it for each other'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:20:05 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'so it was our mob, because they had neither engaged nor spawned the epic cycle. They were merely sitting here waitint to do so'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:20:24 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'our beastlord started the cycle, you can see why this might be confusing to me'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:21:56 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'Agreed. However if a group was preparing for the event, you could have co-ordinated with them or did some type of agreement with them for the event'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:22:06 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'It could be using a random number or a duel'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:22:34 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I did ask them if they were prepared, they said they were not prepared yet and we were'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:23:10 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'I gave them the first attempt, I asked them to engage or stand aside, at which point they informed us over public channels they were not ready to engage'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:24:08 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'I have made a decision in this regard.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:24:39 2003] You tell CSRResolution:2, 'Even with logged proof of them taunting our guildmember after destroying all of the work he has done so far?'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:25:15 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'And I would suggest that you try other means in the future and I shall not want any further issues in this regard.'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:26:06 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'If you feel that the decision is not what you believe to be correct. Then you can write your concerns on the way your issue was addressed.Our supervisors will review and take the appropriate steps'<br />
[Mon Oct 20 20:26:26 2003] Jaanbaz tells CSRResolution:2, 'You can mail at eqcs@soe.sony.c'<br />
<br />
Now I'm getting a little angry towards the end, after Jaanbaz spends over 15 minutes talking with him about what happened and then not talking to me at all about the situation aside from asking for my reports earlier. Not only was our beastlord NOT reimbursed for all of his epic work so far that Tigaman destroyed(with plenty of proof from his own mouth to that effect), but the GM did not even discuss our side of this at all. In effect Jaanbaz inferred that our people were ksing his raid, despite the fact we were there first with the force necessary and we spawned the triggered cycle.<br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, Training is now OK, Interrupting triggered events to deny others their completion is ok, kill stealing is ok, and most importantly you can now camp mobs for however long you wish, regardless of your readiness to engage or if there are others waiting who ARE ready to engage the mob waiting to do so as well.<br />

<br />
Lets say another guild came up and you were still assembling, trying really hard to get that kill for your beastlord but people were slow. They told you to stand down or let us kill. <br />
<br />
You'll get so much further in game and in life being respectful of people. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, that other guild were butt-nuggets for training you. I'd say both of your guilds could've handled the situation much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All I can suggest is to email the address he gave you with all the above.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that precident said whoever triggered a mob would have entitlement to the spawns that were triggered, particularly in a situation such as this.<br />
<br />
I really don't see how anyone could have expected you to do anything differently, except for backing down completely at the beginning. But, I always thought SoE doesn't respect camps, and by those standards, anyone could call camp and that's it.<br />
<br />
Hmm.... I think I'll go sit in PoFire and call camp on Fennin Ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It has already been emailed to the GM in question's supervisors.<br />
<br />
Thorvan, I was leading the jaunt, and they had already been gathering for it for an hour and a half when I told our beastlord to go ahead and trigger the event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is against conventional wisdom on these boards, but you are clearly wrong in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Did you think they weren't actually gathering to kill the mob?  And they were there before you.  <br />
<br />
When you see that, people should just leave and go do something else.  Sitting around and lobbing ultimatums is lame.<br />
<br />
I know it's common in EQ and even expected behavoir, but it's being a jerk, frankly.  <br />
<br />
I don't blame those guys for being mad, but obviously they could have handled it better.  <br />
<br />
You created the conflict, you ruined the evening for a lot of folks by pushing a stupid issue of a regular old epic fight.  It's not worth.  <br />
<br />
Sony should tell folks to push off, because racing in to hand a trigger past folks who've been there already should not be encouraged.  So what if they wait 5 more minutes, 10 minutes, big deal.  Go do something else.</div></div><hr />

Politeness only stretches so far and i call waiting for an hour for them to engage  polite.<br />
Although I think they probably could have sorted things out better between the guilds what the KSing guild did was wrong.<br />
The whole thing with this post is that it shows the total inadequacy of GM's<br />
We all know since Sony took over EQ that EQ Customer Service is totally substandard and this post just proves that.<br />
We also all know that if the reversewere to happen to 1 of us the GM we spoke with would likely say &quot;Tough **** but you had plenty of time to engage etc and you didnt&quot;.<br />
What will change in the future ? Sweet FA as Sony dont care how you feel about the game as long as you pay your subscription.<br />

<br />
The servers are now pretty much lawless and 99% of the time there is nobody online who can even adress a problem.  At least on a Zek you can come back and try to make your own justice instead of waiting for some 18 year-old with no mediation experience to tell you how it's going to be. <br />
<br />
The rule is still 1st to engage &quot;wins&quot; and the group you passed up could have sat there for 3 weeks prior and had no valid claim to that mob.</div></div><hr />

A tracker cannot claim a camp - this would be far too open to abuse.  Calling camp for an hour and not being ready to engage is BS.<br />
<br />
Your new server GM is a retard :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First engage, first served, otherwise you have some jackass level 2 ranger sitting somewhere claiming a mob for a guild taking down another target. Sheesh, its not like you cant 1 group the beast lord epic anyways. Am I gonna gank a mob where people are clearing towards it? Not usually, but an hour is PLENTY of time to finish. If they werent done mobilizing by then, tough.<br />
<br />

You would have been better off by just coming back some other time and trying again.  You basically screwed over your guild mate, because you were greedy and lack respect for others.  Moreso, you escalated a situation that should have never happened in the first place, and then wasted the time of a GM because you wanted to be a prick.<br />
<br />
Its people like you that make it so GMs are not available when real problems arise.  They are too busy wasting their time with situations that only occur because people are disrespectful of others and greedy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am very surprised that the GM did not reimburse your BL for his lost epic items. I think he should have done that at least. <br />
<br />
Unless, of course, your guild has a long history of jumping over people in spawn competition. In that case, he was probably glad that someone screwed you over, and didn't do anything for that reason. I have no way of knowing whether he was just a lousy GM, or if you guys have a history of this sort of thing. <br />
<br />
Maybe this isn't &quot;EQ policy&quot;, but in my book, if a bunch of people are there gathering for a mob, and you just roll in and take it, just because you're able to do it faster, you're being selfish, and asking for trouble. <br />
<br />
I'm surprised they went nuclear on you, but I don't blame them. I've been in guilds where we were setting up to kill the Emperor in Ssra, inside the room looking at Blood, getting organized for our first kill. And the #1 guild on the server who was trying to cockblock us and keep us out of VT just ran in past us and attacked about 5 minutes before we were ready. They'd done it a dozen times and could do it &quot;on the run&quot; so to speak, so they ran right through our raid, who'd been in the zone much longer, and killed Emp out from under us. Sure, they were &quot;in the right&quot; according to the rules of EQ. But they were still being absolute dicks. We didn't do anything, but it's situations like that where you really wish it was possible to vote complete *******s off the island, or something. <br />
<br />
I leave the parallels, such as they are, for you to ponder. <br />
<br />
If there's one thing I've learned from watching guildchat for 4+ years: almost everyone always thinks their side is right. People think their side is right in these disputes. You could EXACTLY reverse the situation, putting everyone in the opposite role, and 90% of the exact same people would then think that their new side, which they thought was wrong when they weren't on it, was in the right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Now, I agree that Jharassik would have been better off leaving the others alone in the first place, I'm all for not getting into a conflict in the first place.<br />
<br />
But I still think the GM didn't adhere to SoE policy on this matter. In such matters, First in Force is usually applied, and kill stealing shouldn't be tolerated. I don't think that Jharassik's team kill stole, they merely camp jumped, and a camp which wasn't actually being maintained at that. Impolite, yes. Against the rules, I wouldn't have said so.<br />
<br />
I never really liked the SoE policy of not respecting camps, but I could understand it - if you start making rules about respecting camps, it opens a whole can of worms about what constitutes a camp, rare spawns, etc.<br />

<br />
By leaving timed mobs up for extended periods, you hurt everyone by reducing the total number of spawns available.<br />
<br />
That story is a complete debacle of customer service if all the facts are true.  People in the opposing groups should be warned or banned for intentionally training and killing the quest NPC during the fight.  First to engage has always been the CS rule and it sounds as though plenty of time was given to allow the other group to take the spawn.  What they did in response is far worse than any breach of ettiquette that taking the spawn from them represented.<br />
<br />
I suppose the high ground would have been to just move on and try again later, but after seeing the training and such that the campers did, they deserved to have it taken from them.</div></div><hr />

I'm kinda border line with these, I think to some extent everyone was wrong ('specially the GM).  I do think that J did give them the opportunity and it didn't sound like they bothered to give him a time when they were going to engage.  I mean, how hard would it have been to say, 'We should be ready in 5 or 10 minutes.'<br />
<br />
I do think the GM didn't weigh all the options and must have been new or something.  That was crap not listening to you and the guy who admited training someone and getting reported should have been suspended.</div></div><hr />

After 30 minutes of actually sitting there waiting for them to go and reportedly from them having already been there for 1.5 hours before that they either needed to go when he spoke with them or respectfully pass the spawn to someone who is ready and able to do it.<br />
<br />
Your gm interaction reminded me of our last gm on our server before they implimented the roaming gm thing. There where several times that he seemed upset that people petitioned and he actually had to do something. One time in particular we where in the basement in ssra trying to spawn the cursed and a rival guild pulled one of the trigger mobs after we had start pulling and killing the other ones. They refused to kill the mob and threatened to petition us for ksing if we tried to kill it.<br />
<br />
Once we finally got the gm to show he told us to solve it on our own and if he had to come out he would kick both our guilds out of zone and 100 other people from other guilds that weren't involved in the issue at all. Seemed absolutely put off that he actually might have to do something.<br />
<br />
Weither you think that thier trigging the event was proper or not, rude or not what the other guild did in intentionally training, kill stealing and intentionaly screwing up a triggered that they knew couldn't be restarted with out redoing the whole thing was compleately wrong and does violate the policy as still posted on sony's web site.

Pretty much.  You can clear the whole way to a boss, and/or trigger a spawn, and some guild or person can still come and take it away with no questions asked (because the main targeted spawn was not &quot;engaged&quot; yet), and at best a GM will say, &quot;You must share.&quot;   Witnessed it several times myself, or have heard other guilds having issues in the past.   I actually wonder why SoE bothers creating a script to trigger a mob, or put in trash mobs to clear the way.   There should just be a blank zone with a gnome you hail to spawn your mob at any given moment (sarcasm).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1. We didn't just &quot;roll in&quot; and take it, we gave them thirty minutes from when we started gathering(which took about 5 minutes to get everyone there btw), and they had an additional hour of prep time before that.<br />
<br />
2. The person we were engaging this mob for is in the military and shipping out to Iraq soon. This was likely his only shot at that mob before he's shipped out, which is why we didn't shrug and say &quot;Gee, they've been here forever and don't look to be ready to do the encounter any time soon, but we'll let them piddle around with it for the rest of the night.&quot;<br />

You were an ass, and wanted reimbursements for being an ass and expecting someone to sit aside and watch you do it.<br />

1. You enter zone... ask to see if your mob is claimed<br />
<br />
2. Someone says it is... you send them a tell &quot;when you're done, can you send me a tell informing me of success/failure?&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Using polite words while telling someone to step aside period is not polite, it's using polite words to be rude.<br />
<br />
4. Some people are less organized than you, and require more people than you.   Tim Deep isn't exactly the easiest zone to assemble people in.   Just because they've been there for &quot;an hour&quot; doesn't mean it was any skin off your back.   Had you just left when they said that they were after the mob, you'd have never been affected in any way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Ideally, sure it'd be nice if you could just walk away whenever another group/raid was camping/gathering for a mob you wanted to kill.  Ideally, that mob would be up again for you to go kill in a reasonable amount of time.  <br />
<br />
Realistically though, that's not the case.  I don't know what the respawn time is on this particular mob/script, but generally speaking if you're gathering for a raid the chances are the respawn timer is at least 3 days and probably more like 5-7... hence why everyone wants to rush off and kill said mobs asap when they're up.  Saying that you should just leave if another group/raid is in the area and &quot;claming&quot; the spawn is utterly naive.  I guarantee you any raiding guild can have a tracker or 3 sitting on pretty much every major spawn in the game 'claiming' it until the rest of the guild logged on if that were the case.  And no, it's not just the big uber guilds that do that sort of thing.  In fact, it's usually the other way around.  The more uber guilds are used to and accept that there's competition for spawns.  Hence, they're used to and in many cases enjoy a good ol' fashioned race.  You rush like mad to get there first and if you do, it's a bonus.  If you don't, then it's dissapointing but oftentimes the race itself is as much fun as the encounter would have been anyway although the loot isn't as good. ;)<br />
<br />
Sitting around a spawn for an hour and still not having enough people to engage just screams incompetence to me.  Wasting another half an hour after you know another guild is mobilizing for the same target...  sheer stupidity.  Taking it on to the next level and KSing/training the group that fairly beat you to the spawn... on Tribunal, we call that PoMS (Piece of Monkey S#!t)</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, for 4 years now, first with sufficient force to engage that engages on the scene has been THE only really mob/spawncycle claiming rule that SOE would support. It has been the stated policy for years. This GM clearly went outside his bounds to make a moral, rather then stated rules based judgement.<br />
<br />
Just reinforces my general opinion that GMS are, as a general rule, clueless tards. The random 5 minutes a day they use to address a whole servers worth of petitions doesnt help any either. Every petition I have made in the last year too 12+ hours to resolve. Most stretching into 3+ days.

When the poster and his group arrived on the scene, the other guys were allready there, the spawn was pretty obviously taken. So what if they take 5 minutes or an hour to get ready? It's not like it's a heavily contested spawn. Just come back 3 days later. Setting ultimatums and jumping ahead of them is just ******* behaviour, its easy to see why the other side got upset, allthough ksing and training is going too far. One other thing - you dont know what action the GM took against the other side - that was conducted in separate discussions. They likely recieved warnings and probably had the quest item stripped from them. As the GM said, this situation could have been easily avoided by both sides and almost certainly made sure that neither side benefited from bad behaviour. In the posters case, they lost their epic bit and had to start again (rightly so - next time they will be more considerate), and in the opposing parties case, they would (probably) have been stripped of the epic drop and forced to redo that step.</div></div><hr />

There are a number of stupid comments in this thread, but this one probably wins the prize.  <br />
<br />
Why deal with silly &quot;analogies&quot; that have nothing to do with what actually occurred in this case?  Ruatonim makes the same mistake, and Flabbo poses like some big raider, as if that means anything about anything in this situation.  It doesn't.  <br />
<br />
This was one epic mob fight, a guild was getting a ton of folks there to do it but they were slow.  Why? Who knows and who cares.  Some guilds have the horsepower, but want to wait for everyone to be there so they can all share the experience of helping guildmate_01. <br />
<br />
Real people are involved in these situations, and treating real people like crap may be &quot;permitted&quot; but it's still obnoxious.  <br />
<br />
Why play that way?<br />
<br />
Hell, what *should* happen is you'd offer to help them.  Create good will and go back in a couple of days.  Maybe they'd even help you then.  <br />
<br />
Instead, you got left with a mess because of choices you made.  <br />
<br />
In some cases racing is clearly ok.  That is part of the game.  But when a guild is squatting in front of an epic mob in Timorous Deep, that's not racing.  You already lost, go away and do something else.</div></div><hr />

How about some common sense?  Jebus!  Forget SOE's idiotic policies for just a moment and consider the situation with your brain.  I know that using logic and common sense often defy the world of EQ but try for just a moment.<br />
<br />
They were there first for a 72 hour spawn and were apparently putting a lot of effort (gathering people over time) to complete the kill.  You show up and decide that since you can do the kill anytime with your smaller number of people that you're just gonna gank the kill for yourselves.  You then justify and defend your honorless actions by quoting SOE's exploitable policies?!<br />
<br />
&lt;boggle&gt;<br />
<br />
Both parties behaved poorly, but the other guild was provoked into it's poor behavior by your group's poor choice of ganking someone elses plans.  I will say that even though your group started it all with an act of complete and utter greed that their reaction and follow up tells (if you're stating the truth) were nearly as pitiful.  I wonder how the GM would've reacted if they're people had just reported and petitioned rather than KSing and taunting...<br />
<br />
Over and over throughout that chat you're trying to get the GM to side with you and support your ganking based on an idiotic game policy that makes no sense while the GM, who did a great job of trying to mediate the illogical, is trying to avoid having to punish either side (since neither was in the right since you have one group dishonorably attacking another groups kill and they react like a bunch of children).  I really feel sorry for the GM for having to deal with such stupidity.<br />
<br />
The honorable thing for your group, who obviously could do this kill with a lot less effort (you show up with one group, they had to gather a small army over lots of time), would've been to come back at another time.<br />

I'm in an elemental guild, and, no, we dont do that sort of thing. If another guild is clearly in place when we show up we back off, if they are assembling at the same time we are, we generally roll for the spawn. We have working relationships with most of the guilds we compete with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This just struck a chord with me and Flabbo, my response is not directed at you personally, but rather at the entire 'end game mentality'. First, I'm by no means a newb. I started playing EQ 4+ years ago, but I am in a guild that hasn't progressed much past Kael (HOT, some of Ssra, etc). <br />
<br />
With that said, IMO, taking the high moral grounds is always much harder than not. The end game doesn't have to change how you deal with other people in EQ. There are several 'uber guilds' on our server, Tribunal. Some have nearly spotless reputations, willing to stand aside, help others, etc, while others have the mentality you state must be used or risk losing every spawn. You might think the 2nd type of guild can run uncontested because of their attitude, but in fact it's the 1st type of guild that actually accomplishes the most (on our server at least). <br />
<br />
In 4 years of play, my wife and I have come to the conclusion (shared by quite a few people on this board I think) that reputation is really the only commodity the matters in EQ. Whatever equipment you wear, the spells you have, etc are really very minor compared to this. You can certainly do a lot with a spotty reputation, but at some point 'karma' (for lack of better word) rears it's ugly head. Guilds that use the 'us at any cost' theory usually do well for a while until finally it becomes 'me at any cost' within the guild and self-destruction isn't far behind.<br />
<br />
Again, Flabbo, this isn't directed at you personally. I just feel strongly that no matter what point you are within the game, your reputation is and should be your highest priority. <br />
<br />
Just my opinion, I could be wrong...</div></div><hr />

Ergo, frineds were not on the way to provide a force able to take the spawn, they were prancing around doing their own thing.  Even THIRTY minutes after they'd have been told they had competition for the spawn.<br />
<br />
Claiming one portion of content while actively involved in another portion is BS.<br />
<br />
Taking a mob after another group fails to field a sufficient force may be subjectively wrong to some people.  Training, KSing, and gloating about wasting someone's Epic work is inarguably wrong.</div></div><hr />

With a couple of groups in zone and your guild obviously tough enough to do the encounter with far fewer players it wouldn't have hurt you any just to walk away when you first saw the other people there. The fact that you didn't tells me you were quite prepared to run over them from the start. <br />
  Yup, the GM screwed up, it should've been your spawn according to all the policies they've stated in the past but as the poster above me put it, consider it Karma.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Must be nice to play on a server where everyone rolls over to level 1 track bots while guilds monopolize content. If we did that, we'd be nowhere. We dont gank mobs when other guilds are ready, but we sure as hell dont give people an hour and a half to do a redicuously easy encounter we need done. Its like driving 20 in the fast lane. Move aside if you cant perform, instead of screwing over the rest of the server.  Or, how bout this. You are going to HoT and tehres a fd monk there claiming he is camping it. His guild is off taking down some minor luclin named. Would you let them finish, say, VaDynn, then trot their asses to HoT while you are left with nothing?<br />
<br />
Would it have been nice to let the other guild screw around for another hour to get people to tim deep (takes 10-15 mins to get there people... the other guild just sucked flat out if it takes them THAT long to mobilize)... yeah it would have been nice. Was it required? NOPE. Did the other guild act like asses in response? Yep. One guild was neither nice, or overly rude (they DID give them an hour and a half to get their crap together... plenty of time) the other guild consciously wrecked for someone else what they were too inept to accomplish. Tell me again... who are the *******s here?<br />
<br />
In case you arent familiar witht he BL epic... the beast in question here had to completely redo his epic from scratch if this fight is blown.<br />
<br />
I agree. Reputation matters. Its an equal mix of being nice, and having respect, and no one respects a doormat... no matter how nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Well granted the first group was most likely fielding a group of sub 60 personnel to do that epic mob so needed more then a single group.  And the second group most likely was 61+.  It has been beaten into most everyone since day one that first to engage spawn has claim to that spawn.  I feel that GM was grossly inaccurate in his findings.  Whether the GM felt the first group was right or wrong they broke several PnP rules by the training, KSing, and deliberate cycle bugging.  Rules are there for a reason.  Consistency.  If you dont have consistency then rules mean nothing.  GM's should not have the right to enforce rules as they feel like.  And as far as multiple petitions you better be darn tooting I will have everyone involved petition as it leaves a official stamp so to say on all those evolved.  And last point I would like to make is, when has there been enough time given for a guild to gather.  If one is ready to go, another has been there but waiting on members to arrive.  With the way PoK books are now you can get to ANY zone in 30-45 mins with no sow at all.  If they were waiting for people to log then guess what, they were not anywhere near ready to go and they should allow the others to go.  They would at that time KNOW when the next spawning was to take place and could gather earlier to be ready for the spawn the next time.<br />
<br />
Ok sorry I just have a REALLY soar bone with people that KS, TRAIN, and GREIF people.  If you want do this then go play on a no rules server.  It dont matter if your level 1, level 65, guilded or non-guilded its the same thing.  I have yet to see any reason for that behavior.  I just see them as adults acting like 3 year olds throwing tantrums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I think that if I was in the guild that was preparing, but taking longer than we should to prepare, I would be a little perturbed if another guild came in and engaged the mob we were preparing for.  If I were their Beastlord, I would probably be pretty hot, but I would get over it knowing that my guild should have been quicker in getting set up for the cycle.  On the other hand though, I feel like the person that trained you deserved some disciplinary action taken against them.  There just is not a place for that kind of behavior.  I really feel sorry for your beastlord, because he just did what you told him to do, trusting your judgement and having faith that there had been an agreement between you and the other guild.  <br />
<br />
I have done an epic quest before, and I know that if I had been forced to start the quest over from scratch over something like this, and no actions were taken by Sony to refund the pieces lost or to discipline the guy who screwed up the epic mobs, I would probably cancel my account then and there.<br />
<br />
Epic's may not be the end all be all of equipment nowadays, but for some people they are the toughest quest they will ever do and one of the best pieces of equipment they will ever receive.  This would definitely put a bad taste in my mouth if it had happened to me.</div></div><hr />

Kriel, on my server there was a very rude and public way to return the favor on the emperor battle for a guild that did what you are describing. Wait 10 minutes for the hate list to get nice and full of clerics, then have one of your clerics walk up and cast &quot;bestow divine aura&quot; on the main tank. Emperor Ssra will promptly gangbang every cleric there prompting a wipe. That guild will be a lot politer in the future. Or their rectal nature will get a lot worse.<br />

The subsequent training and KSing should've resulted in warnings for the people involved, and at the very least, the return of the BL's turn-in piece.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I don't really get the &quot;he's shipping out, so we needed to do it right then&quot; argument...  Does the military let you use the BL claws instead of more conventional weapons?  If so, I understand.  If not, it can wait until he returns.</div></div><hr />

Look, you either put up or shut up in this game.  Not everyone has two days to wait, or two hours to prep for what is, honestly, an incredibly easy fight.  I've DONE the beastlord epic, me personally, both for my old beastlord and for numerous beastlord friends.  As a matter of fact for the SONH spawn, I was trying to get people together when another guild (The Dark Exile) rolled in over us and took it.  I didn't get mad, because they popped into zone with 10 or 15 people buffed and ready to go, and my guys were still sitting around waiting for more people to show up.  My logic is, just because I was &quot;there first&quot; doesn't give me a claim to content.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Seriously, as much as I have been (since Nov 2000, when I started), a supporter of &quot;first in force&quot; as the means of determining who gets events ... it is obvious that a culture of abuse of this yardstick has developed.  I have been witness to some of the worst I have ever seen, all replays in some form or fashion of this scenario.  Some are from my server, some from that of a friend.<br />
<br />
I've watched a guild with 30 people in zone keep the Decorins (trigger mobs for RZ) mezzed for 3 hours in the vain hope they would have people log on.  [GM determination: There is no limit to how long a guild may prepare for a script before losing the right to complete it.]<br />
<br />
I've watched a guild with 32 trigger the Bertox script, failing on the first king and blowing the event in order to prevent a 2nd guild with appropriate numbers from attempting it.  [GM determination: Guilds have the right to engage with intentionally low numbers, even if the event is blowable.]<br />
<br />
I've watched a player intentionally, and admittedly, drop 4 mobs on a guild engaging Mith Marr.  [GM determination: Warning issued to the guild leader of the guild that was trained, for harrassment, after telling the training character to &quot;get the f*** away from the fight.&quot;]<br />
<br />
There was no right solution to do here.  Guilds should not have the right to wait indefinately to begin an event.  There has to be a point at which you say enough is enough.  Were that not the case, I can easily put a full group of guild 2-boxed characters on site for most any rare I can name.  It would take forever on some days to get a real force there ... but do I have the right to make others wait?  Is it okay to sit there at, say, Vallon Zek or Cursed or Babnoxious for 20 minutes?  Then how about 40?  An hour?  3 hours?  12?  Where do we draw the line?  By the same token, of course, its wrong to jump a guild prepping - if they are really prepping and not stalling.  That line is hard to judge, and impossible to know for certain.  But regardless who moves at the end, someone will think that line was drawn in the wrong place.  Responding by training, killstealing, and ninjalooting is never, ever an acceptable recourse.  This thread talks about kharma.  Kharma is getting back what one deserves for the moral balance of past deeds.  No one ever deserves what happened to the beastlord in this story.<br />
<br />
Assuming, of course, that the story doesn't leave out anything important.  Spin doctoring is an artform older than stalling on forces that aren't really on the way...</div></div><hr />

It is easier than the current method. You dont have to keep track of who makes more dmg. Only keep wich raid/group/player made the first hit. So if they didn't program it this way, it is because they dont want it this way.<br />

Ah, but it is about kharma. They adopted bullying tactics to try and get their way, because most people get mad but do nothing, so the bullys get away with it usually. They come to believe that this is normal acceptable behaviour. It is not. The other guys got mad and (unusually) did do something, with the result the BL lost all of his epic work. Then come the tears. I'm sorry, I don't condone what the other guys did, but the BL got what he deserved.<br />
<br />
And all you guys jumping on the GM, remember the logs only give the conversation with the poster, not the GMs conversation with the other party, which was apparently lengthy and most likely conducted in private. I'm willing to bet that the GM had some pretty harsh words for them. The GM didn't tell the poster what that other conversation was about, it was none of the posters business. The poster assumed that there was no sanction against the other group - actually he didnt have any idea what went on between the others and the GM. All the GM did, as far as he was concerned, was warn the posters guild leader that he didnt want to see this sort of conflict between the two guilds again (basically, be adults and work out a compromise between yourselves before getting CS involved). He didnt re-imburse the lost epic piece because the posters guild wasnt &quot;playing nice&quot; to begin with, and apparently took the position that the loss was a direct consequence of their actions, and therefore their responsibility. That seems pretty reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely false. I and one other person from my group were over 61, the rest ranged from 52 to 60. The other group had over a dozen there, and several of them were 61+. <br />

There definitely is a difference between a dozen people and one tracker bot but there comes a point when you have to put up or shut up. The second group didn't come in with no warning and run past them and start the event. Quite the contrary they came in sat around for half an hour waiting for the first group to do it and even talked will them. They told them they where interested in the same mob and offered them the chance to put up and engage the mob with what they had there. For what ever reason they made the determination they couldn't do it at that point. Once they did that they have no more valid a claim than a tracker bot sitting there.<br />
<br />
If a single tracker bot can't claim a mob who can? Can 2 people claim if it someone somewhere duoed mob xyz even if the people who did that where 2 uber geared maxed aa 65s and the 2 trying to claim it are just bazaar geared level 61's with no aa's? There is no clear force required for any mob and even the typical force required will change from mob to mob and change as time goes on. There is no clear spot to draw a line in the sand at. The simplest judge I know is if the force trying to claim the mob isn't by thier own judgement ready to handle the mob then they don't have a claim on it. You can lay a reasonable claim to a mob when you have a force there that you are willing to engage the mob with at that moment. If there's no one around and you want to wait for jane and john doe to show up then fine but if someone else shows up wanting to do the mob that tough luck for the doe family. They'll just have to miss this fight.</div></div><hr />

The next window opens up and the person in front of you is still shuffling papers around and isnt ready.  So you ask them if they are ready to go or if you can jump ahead of them in line.  They say they are almost ready just wait.  You wait for 30 minutes  (lets just assume there is only one window for the example :P ).  How long is it fair for that person, who by their own admittance isnt ready, to hold up you and everyone else in line?  If you just go ahead of them after 30 minutes and then they rip up your stuff and shove it in the trash, was that correct of them?</div></div><hr />

Just get the douches back for what they did, but make sure you sit there for an hour and say that you are &quot;gettngi ppl 2geth0r&quot;.<br />
<br />
And if they start the event, do the same ****.<br />
<br />
If they side with them again, take it up the ladder.<br />

This is a special version of ridiculousness. You're suggesting that he get even by training and KS&quot;ing them, and THEN petition a GM and take it to Sony CS that... they trained and KS'd them first? <br />
<br />
Yeah, that'll DEFINITELY get Customer Service on their side. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">For all of you guys saying that &quot;in the high end game, might makes right&quot;... you gotta remember, this incident doesn't involve the high end game.  We're not talking about AHR or Elemental bosses here... we're talking about a &lt;1 group kill on a beastlord epic MOB.  This is NOT a hotly contested MOB... it's regular to see ALL of the scouts sitting spawned and to epic a beastlord in about 3-4 hours.<br />
<br />
The guys who steam rolled were covered by the rules - but the reality of the situation is that they created a bunch of stupid drama over a stupid MOB that would be sitting up 3 days later.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if the guy is shipping out to Iraq and NEEDED this done, what good will it be?  For the same reason you say he needed it NOW I could say that he didn't need it at all.  I sympathize with him and I respect his duty in service to our country - but his epic bit would be sitting on an unplayed character anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Yes I am suggesting that. Perhaps GMs will take things more seriously when they contradict themselves (something SOE is good at, and rather good at trying to not get caught).<br />

Taken from http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp<br />
<br />
<br />
1. You may not steal kills.<br />
<br />
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.<br />
<br />
The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy. <br />
<br />
2. You may not ninjaloot.<br />
<br />
Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<br />
<br />
There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same NPC or hunt in the same area. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. <br />
<br />
If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a compromise. Any such compromise is final and not open to debate. Refusing to abide by these terms will be considered disruption and may result in disciplinary action. <br />
<br />
It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.<br />
<br />
Note: A &quot;group&quot; in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal.<br />
<br />
<br />
The facts as I see them from here:<br />
<br />
1. Said guild is still preparing for contested mob for 30mins<br />
2. Your guild arrives and waits 30 mins to see if said guild engages.<br />
3. Your guild engages said mob.<br />
4. Said guild Kill steals mobs, trains and ninjaloots.<br />
<br />
The law as I understand it states that KSing a group, that is prepared and is engaged in any way with a contested NPC is wrong.<br />
<br />
Both guild leaders failed to comply however with #3, which requires, not suggests, guilds to compromise on such events.<br />
<br />
Failure on your part to comply with #3 does not in any way render said guild immune to laws #1 and #2.<br />
<br />
With that all said SOE is not bound to do *anything* (legally) if they don't feel like it. In other words all they have to do is acknowledge whether something is wrong or right, but they aren't bound to reimburse an item or whatever. It would be advisable for them to reimburse your beastlord if they want to keep customers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cited from:<br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp<br />
<br />
<br />
THE FOLLOWING ARE THE BASIC RULES OF CONDUCT THAT GOVERN PLAYER INTERACTION AND ACTIVITY WITHIN EVERQUEST AND IN THE OFFICIAL EVERQUEST FORUMS. FAILURE TO ACT RESPONSIBLY AND COMPLY WITH THESE RULES WITHIN EVERQUEST AND THE OFFICIAL EVERQUEST FORUMS MAY RESULT IN THE TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT ANY REFUND OF ANY KIND. <br />
<br />
<br />
I can see why Jaanbaz pushed the compromising thing though, as they specifically state that people are required to compromise on contested spawns. I don't see anywhere where it says anything about first person there gets rights, or first to engage has rights. Only refrence to it is in the section about KSing.<br />
<br />
Even though these types of events aren't new, this one has however is pretty public (other people in my guild all knew about it), do keep us informed on the escalation process.<br />
<br />
A hint- if you keep asking to escalate you will eventually get somebody who is level headed and will be able to calmly explain things. You would be suprised how far it would get you to ask SOE to tell you that they will not take any disciplinary action or reimburse your beastlord for the actions that said guild did. (violation of #1 and #2).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">And if this was considered a favor to someone, to make someone start over their epic because you are a idiot, who needs friends like you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">My guild has been on both sides of this situation plenty of times.  When we get beat, we chalk it up to our incompetence, and learn from our mistakes.  We don't train the people who are able to do the encounter, even if we don't like the guild.  <br />
<br />
Coming to an agreement is the best policy, but many guilds are not willing to come to a compromise.  You have to stand up for yourself when you are in the right, or you will get taken advantage of over and over again.  Jharassik's group was assembled and ready for half an hour, spoke with their guild, and had no indication when they would be ready.  He had every right at that point to start the encounter.  Training, KSing and then gloating about it sure doesn't help the other guild's case any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>pyrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">This is one reason why I'm on SZ.  Besides the team atmosphere, relying on friends (not random_person3434234) for groups, strategy, and just fun factor of being the only person of team X in a zone full of team Z, there are so few a number of people that competition for spawns really isn't an issue.   <br />
<br />
You can run through many zones and find that rare spawns are up and no one in zone to kill em.  <br />
<br />
Maybe the people that have such a problem with this incident should move to legends.  Then you can be a carebear and have plenty of mobs (well maybe, is everyone uber on legends?). Anyways, maybe you should consider a less populated server.  Even the Vallon/tallon zeks are pretty empty compared to blue servers and heck, they don't pvp.  (and please don't tell me that Vallon/tallon are pvp, its 4 team blue server, I played vallon for 2 years).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">I knew everything was in the ****can when Frodlin popped up with his usual &quot;[warriors/you/etc] GOT SCREWED!&quot; hyperbole<br />
<br />
Mind pointing out where I said anyone &quot;got screwed&quot;?  I specifically said that the person lodging the complaint was being an ass and that they need to accept the consequences of being asses (The consequence being that the other guild returned the favor by being asses).<br />
<br />
No one &quot;got screwed&quot;, the first guild learned a valuable lesson in procrastinating, the second learned a valuable lesson in how to treat others at the expense of their beastlord.<br />
<br />
Of course, you can feel free to read what you want to read into it.  It's a really simple thing... respect people's claims if they're not abused, and all will be well.<br />
<br />
The decision to engage by guild #2 is what lost the BL his epic, not the GM, not guild #1.    How naive can they be to think that they can steamroll another force without consequence?    <br />
<br />
Finally, the only reason I posted here was because it was the 3rd board I've seen this story posted on, nothing like someone going on a cross-board spamming crusade like this when they are the ones who are mostly responsible for the situation.   <br />
<br />
So, don't get all high and mighty accusing ME of using hyperboale while exaggerating what I write, it's not becoming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Yes Frodlin, I am responsible for following the rules of the game as set forth by the game makers, even responsible for being more polite than the rules require.

While quoting PnP you need to pay close attention to all of it:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Note: A &quot;group&quot; in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal.<br />
<br />
<br />
In order for rule 3 to apply the other group has to be capable of taking the spawn in question. They were not, they admitted as much to us, and if they had been they would have taken the spawn when I offered them the first shot at it instead of declining to do so for lack of numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Jeez, get over it already.  It's just a freakin' game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Jharassik knows he was, legally at least, fully justified, and that the ksers/trainers/script-stealers were in flagrant violation of the rules.<br />
<br />
What can we all take away from this?<br />
<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
1) If someone is prepping for a mob but isn't yet ready, and won't gracefully step aside for you to take, be prepared for them to act in a vengeful and illegal manner if you choose to exercise your legal right to engage before them.<br />
<br />
2) Don't count on the rules being enforced.<br />
<br />
I have done this encounter with my two mains and it is trivial.  It is also up often enough that I would not hang around when someone was already prepping for it.  If it were a more commonly contested trigger, then I'd play FIF.  The explanation that the BL was going to ship out to Iraq doesn't convince me of any pressing necessity - just do it when he gets back then; if you're not going to play for months, why do you need your epic now?<br />
<br />
The GM should have, by law, at least warned the /reported ksers accounts.<br />
<br />
The GM should have restored the lost BL epic piece, but is not legally required to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>xvicex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Clearly you told them what you where doing. Clearly they accepted this. Clearly they intentionally waited for you to start to mess it up....and clearly the SOE rep did not do his/her job.<br />
<br />
They should have reimbursed every item the Beast Lord turned in. Banned for a week or maybe two every member of that guild that stole from your group...or at least those in that zone at that time. Sent them all email messages that do to their or the actions of members of their guild they are now on probabtion. If they repeat similar behavior and proof is shown they will have their accounts permanently banned from the server and their characters erased.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly none of that will occur. SOE is real tough with words and almost universally soft handed with punishment....but you should push it for nothing else then reimbursement of the items Beastlord lost.<br />
<br />
The most glaring thing here though is the SOE rep...basically they did nothing even with overwhelming proof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Yes Frodlin, I am responsible for following the rules of the game as set forth by the game makers, even responsible for being more polite than the rules require.

<br />
You know, the only thing that irritates me more than the fact that you've spam crusaded this nonsense across several EQ related bulletin boards, is the fact that you want to hide behind &quot;the rules&quot; while trying to justify your behaviour.<br />
<br />
Just because you have a right to do something doesn't make it right to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While quoting PnP you need to pay close attention to all of it:<br />
<br />
You'll note I never quoted PnP, because I think common decency is a MUCH greater route to follow, and when someone says they're going to kill something and you know this, common decency would dictate that you leave them the hell alone to enjoy their playtime, and to hell with your PnP and your bureaucratic rule reading sessions.<br />
<br />
You can have followed every rule in the book to a &quot;t&quot; and still been an ass, which is exactly what you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Fearcazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I'm sorry I must agree with the GM as well. This happens on our server all the time. The top 1 guild will come and say &quot;We give you 5 minutes to pull soandso. If you don't start, then we'll kill it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Too bad they were nice. They kill soandso for us and then let us loot the body. Thanks ED on Tarew Marr.<br />
<br />
That was awhile ago when numi couldn't kill king tormax =( We had been in CAMP for 4 hours trying to pull King.<br />
<br />
If this is the case then the TOP 1 guild can do what they pleased because nobody will be ready to pull but them. They can kill with less number of players so they don't need to wait on people as long. just imagine your raids when you are setting up and then you get steamed rolled by a bigger guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Bazlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">A couple of things...<br />
<br />
First, the only one in the equation that deserves any empathy is the BL.  That poor schmuck had months of epic work flushed down the proverbial toilet because of your greed, selfishness and completely ineffective leadership.<br />
<br />
Second, you KSed.  Just because the other raiding party's wait on a missing member was a bit extended, does not give you the right to jump their spawn because you are &quot;ready to enage cycle&quot;.  Christ, did you even try to place yourself in their shoes?  Have you never had to wait an extended period of time during raid prep for one member or another to join??<br />
<br />
Third, the other raiding party should not have trained you, that was unprofessional.....BUT, I can understand their anger and frustration.<br />
<br />
Finally, I think the GM's mediation skills were a joke, and her solution was questionable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Frodlin, I know you raid. Are you and your guildmates asses when you race another guild to a spawn? How is that different from this?<br />
<br />
You'll also note Frodlin, that a few posts above yours someone -did- bring up pnp, and if you had read the thread you probably could have made the leap that I was responding to them and not you on that point.<br />
<br />
It's honestly a bit silly to see how many of you are inferring waiting over 30 minutes for someone else to engage a mob is the same as not waiting at all and telling the other party to engage or lose the spawn when you first have the forces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>takk the silent one</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">It seems this issues are gray at best.  The  main idea  of  the &quot;play nice&quot; rules are the people play with  curtesy but  not taken literally. A lot of the &quot;play nice&quot;  are simply not done.  For example, when was the last time you heard of anyone requesting a GM to share a spawn? (The last time I heard that one was before Kunark came out). <br />
<br />
    From your description, a group was there first at the trigger mob and was attempting to get the force to handle the mobs that would appear once the cycle begins. That group made the claim to attempt  the cycle yet you still was trying to build a  force quick enough to  jump that claim. <br />
<br />
It seems that ever since Verant first came out with the rules of conduct, people have been using it literally when it favors them. In reality the rules were meant as a guide line and used  with common curtesy.<br />
 <br />
1. You may not steal kills.<br />
<br />
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.<br />
<br />
<br />
You applied rule 1 which  states that  your  group  is not KSing if  the other group is  not ready to engage in the mob.  It didn't matter that the mob they claimed for is a trigger mob or that  they were obviously  <br />
attempting to  get more  people  (probably waiting for  more people to log in ... which happens  in all gulds at certain times of day)<br />
<br />
From your point of view, you were in the right.  Was it  rude...  Ya betcha.  Was it against the rules? no.<br />
<br />
Then a hot head from the other group decides well if they are going to jump on our claim, we can return the favor. So  after your group got most of the aggro, they  leap frogged to the main  Epic mob causing the adds to go to your group instead of theirs  (causing that nice train)  Does leapfroging  to the main mob  mean they are KS .... No... not by the strict techinical  interpretation.  You have not engaged the main Mob so they  can literally claim him by STRICT interpretation of the rule. Also  by strict  interpretation, the other group did not intentionally train you since  it used your agro of the group against you and not through any direct action of theirs (unless I wrong in this assumption).<br />
<br />
So for me I would have called off the  attempt after I found another guild  claiming the trigger mob (as common curtesy). But instead you decided that &quot;might is right&quot; and  decided to  take it if they cant. And yes I think its  wrong that the other group made you lose the item to trigger the cycle;  the GM should have restored it to  restore some peace between the groups. As it is, both guilds are  pissed at each other, GM has  marked  you both as trouble makers and will basically  you're out of an important Epic trigger item. Was it worth it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">The raid analogies may not be appropriate, but I think this is very similar to the benevolence quest in WW back when it was more popular.  There were always multiple people trying to claim it when Scout Charissa spawned, and the first person to get their people in and engage were always the ones to get it on my server.  I was beaten to it on several occasions and not once did I think &quot;Hey, training these people and making them fail is the answer to my problem!&quot;  It's part of the game to compete and interact with others for spawns and loot.  It is what creates scarcity and therefore value.  Griefing, however, is not part of the game and should be punished.<br />
<br />
Instancing like in LDoN may remove the conflicts, but check out the bazaar items from LDoN to see what it does to scarcity and value.  The game economy depends on item rarity, which can't really be enforced with instanced content, but I digress ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">he said the guy was shipping out the next day. Waiting for the next spawn = waiting for several months.<br />

I think a few of us might be wondering how he's going to be using his epic in Iraq.  Seems to me he doesn't need his epic for several months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Absolutely false. I and one other person from my group were over 61, the rest ranged from 52 to 60. The other group had over a dozen there, and several of them were 61+. <br />
<br />
So they were there first, got together enough force to take down the mobs, which you knew were on a 72 hour timer, &amp; you engaged, beleving that manipulating the PnP would cover you. I see.<br />
<br />
Tigaman left my guild 2 or 3 months ago, as he wanted to get his epic, &amp; we didn't have the force to help him. We never had any problems with his behavior. <br />
<br />
I feel sorry for your beastlord friend, having to do the epic over is harsh, even if he did conspire with you to KS Tigaman. If the decision to KS was down to you, &amp; he had no part, I'd feel even sorrier.<br />

http://pub142.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=3717.topic&amp;start=101&amp;stop=118<br />
Leader of Zone has responded on the ARo board:  He disputes the time frame Jharassik says the events happend in, saying it was much shorter. He told them they were only waiting for 2 Iksars that had been killed zoning in. No mention was made of the guy being posted overseas. He says Jharassik's group should have been well aware that they had sufficient force to complete the event. Tigaman got two warnings, one more &amp; he's gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Who cares if he's shipping out? Its probably comething he wanted to accomplish before he left eq, and the clock was running out. Lots of people want to do something before they move on, die, leave town etc. Its not for you to judge the importance of someone accomplishing their goals. I guess the Make a Wish Foundation is even more stupid, because, hey, they're going to be dead, and a dead kid can enjoy (fill in goal x) a lot less than a guy in iraq can enjoy the memories of getting his epic.<br />
<br />
30 minutes is MORE than enough time on this fight. Its easier than a BoT named. Would you let a group claim a  BoT named for an hour and a half if they were unable to kill it? OmG... all BoT claimed by level 62 invis ranger! Go away! I have done this fight about 4 or 5 times, pre 65 (2 of them pre 60) and the most people we ever took was 8 or so (we could have done it with less). If it takes an hour and a half to get a group and change, it says something about what the other guild thinks of their beast lord.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they were there for an hour and a half(unlike that board i can actually attach the screenshots here) by their own admission, and piddled with the spawn for thirty minutes while our group was buffed and ready. Again, it is silly to imply sitting buffed and waiting for another guild for thirty minutes then engaging is the same as engaging right away.<br />
<br />
Wodon, you might reread that thread, because not only is he lying(see attached screenshots) but you either skipped most of the thread or are lying yourself  over its contents.<br />
<br />
Attached is their beastlord affirming they had been there for an hour and a half, as well as him checking to see if our beastlord had managed to get all of the dropped items from the spawned event. Also screenshot of him gloating that he ruined our beastlord's epic, as well as a member of his own guild deguilding over what they did, and someone who came to help them complaining that they took forever to do the encounter.</div></div><hr />

1.  It seems he was willing to make that very same judgement: that it was more important he accomplished his goal than it was for the other guy.  <br />

I saw a bunch of people say that they should just go back on the next spawn, that not getting that one was no big deal.  His telling us about the guy leaving for Iraq was an explaination why they couldn't just do the next spawn.  This was also an indication why they were loath to leave when the other guild was obviously unprepared for the fight.</div></div><hr />

I think it's wrong to monopolize a camp for 90 minutes without engaging the spawn.  Anyone who's been in a raiding guild or at least a guild that's pulled off a few raids in zones like HoT or even freakin' Hate can appreciate and understand this entire thread.  It was, without a doubt, a more honorable thing to just turn and walk away from this particular spawn but seriously, how long are we supposed to wait?  All you folks who disagree with Jharassik's decision, how long would YOU wait?  I mean, it sounds like you'd all turn tail and walk away even if they'd had 2 monks FD in the zone for 48 hours, calling &quot;FIVES ON EPIX MOB!!! WE CALLED FIVES!!!  FIVES!!!!&quot;  Where's the line, folks?  Obviously steamrolling a group after waiting a mere 10 minutes isn't satisfactory, but 90 minutes?  How in the world is a 90 minute wait for a raid to organize too little to wait and crappy on Jharassik's behalf?  <br />
<br />
I had my own Neh kill snagged by a group who got up there before me.  I didn't throw a tantrum, I waited 2 hours for a respawn and got on with my life.  But they engaged the mob first.  My tail was sitting down at the moat with my group while they were up on the ramp.  It's not their fault my forces didn't get there until 15 minutes after start time. And maybe I would have thrown a big ol' tantrum if Neh had been a 3 day respawn, but we've been living by these rules for how long?  First to engage owns the kill.  Period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If he's not going to be playing for several months, he doesnt need his epics right now. That's a feeble excuse.<br />
<br />
Big difference between needing it and getting it done for him before he leaves. While it wouldnt crush me to not get it done before i shipped out would be pretty cool to have it done before i shipped. Getting deployed sucks maybe they were just trying to do something nice for him before he left. <br />
<br />
   NOT saying that makes anything okie or not okie not giving my opinion on why it isnt so feeble.  Being prior military and my wife current military going overseas mostly sucks. When people get deployed tend to do something nice for them. Just a possiblity.</div></div><hr />

A soldier putting his life on the line to serve our nation at a time of war and his enjoyment of perhaps the last frivialities of civilian life is worth more in my mind then a likely JH/HS/College aged kid enjoying the frivialites of civilian life which he will likely continue the next day and months..while the aforementioned soldier is risking his life so that kid can continue to play his stupid lil game.<br />
<br />
He could die... he could be blinded... he could have psychological problems....... he could simply grow up. War has a tendency to wake you up to the realities of life and the world around you. To have his last moments of civilian niavety destroyed by a juvenile ass is a disgrace.<br />
<br />
Its important to remember those who go overseas to fight (or even sit in the rear with the gear) to protect you loose more then a few months or a year when they step off that plane wherever it may land them. They loose that niavety many of you possess.</div></div><hr />

Hate to bring some reality to this, but at the rate US GI's are going down for the count in Iraq, it could be considered wasted time to get his epic.  Wait till he get's back from his RL epic to Iraq, then he can worry about a silly game piece.</div></div><hr />

Reason the guy being deployed is relevent is its a reason why the 2nd group hung around instead of just leaving. Saying the guy couldnt use it in iraq is irrelevant because none of us can use our epics when we go anywhere. So you cant use yours at work (provided your doing work at work lol) so why should you bother with raiding on worknights? Because it matters when its happening thats why.

I have my doubts about the waiting for 90 mintes part, these things tend to get exagerated in the retelling when you're trying to make a point but it shouldn't have mattered. If you saw 2+ groups assembled to kill a gimp mob that for most of us is one-groupable why even bother to hang around waiting for the other guild to engage? We aren't talking raid level targets here. <br />

I do feel sorry for the BST that got screwed and lost his epic and hope he gets his turnin replaced put I have no pity for the original poster.

You'd be pissing and moaning if someone was claiming a bot named for an hour and a half without engaging it, and you know it. It says in the rules that you may not monopolize spawns if I remember correctly. Sitting there, claiming it without killing it certainly constitutes monopolization.<br />
<br />
Quit acting all self righteous. The guy has the right to enjoy the game just as much as the other people do. They were taking away from his enjoyment by claiming a spawn that they could have killed and started the respawn timer on.<br />
<br />
There is nothing more frustrating than people claiming a mob that they can't or won't kill. It doesn't matter if it's raid content or orc 1, it's still irritating as hell, and disruptive to other players. I would have done the same given the stated situation.</div></div><hr />

Well by summing up all the input from both posts we now have the answer.<br />
<br />
Number of attempts you allow the guild is N, where:<br />

N = X - 1<br />

X being the number of attempts the other guild will need to actually kill the mob.</div></div><hr />

Nice spin doctoring =D<br />
<br />
Yes, while I personally feel that its nice to give him a going away present, if the roles had been swapped, and the soldier had been the one screwing around for an hour and a half, ksing and ruining the other bl's epic would have been equally bad. The fact is, first to engage (and in this camp, you engage by hand in) gets right. I'm trying to look at it objectively. If one bl is retiring, gonna destroy it, etc, it doesnt matter. The group who can amass forces, and win, gets it.<br />
<br />
The group who arrived second could have left, and would have probably been better people for it. Its certainly more polite. However, they werent BAD people by taking the mob.  Its much WORSE to malisciously destroy someone else's work that you were unable to complete. Thats my issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">So, to summarize what happened here, two &quot;bad&quot; things occurred: (1)Jharasics guild steamrolled the other guys and (2) Tigaman killed the scout and attempted to regain what he regarded as his by killing the spawned mobs.<br />
<br />
We also know that, contary to Jharasic's claims, that Tigaman recieved multiple personal warnings, and that his guild recieved a warning. No one here is disputing that these guys did a bad thing. The only mitigating circumstance would be that they were severely pissed off by Jharasic's guild's behaviour, and that is likely the only thing that saved them from a suspension or worse.<br />
<br />
The only other remaining question is why didnt Jharasic's BL get re-imbursed? I would think the answer is pretty clearly the behaviour of Jharasics guild.<br />
<br />
First of all, the scouts are not highly contested spawns. Allthough they are 3 day spawns, they are usually up for extended periods of time. The GM's would be well aware of this, and hence their insistance on the need for the two guilds to have worked out a compromise before CS intervention. The entire incident should never have happened in the first place.<br />
<br />
When Jharasics team arrived, they found another large group of people allready gathered at the scout. The reason they were there should have been obvious to everyone. Now, most reasonable people would have said &quot;oh, the spawn is taken&quot; and come back some other time. And yet Jharasic's guild did not leave. Why would they do such a thing? I assume that the BL scouts operate like most quest mobs of that era, in that once you hand in they instantly respawn as a different version of themselves (otherwise both BLs could have done the initial handins and generated two sets of quest mobs - the fact that they didnt do this suggests that my assumption is correct). That means that if the first guild engaged first, the spawn would have been blown anyway, win or lose. The fact that Jharasic's team remained and attempted to pressure Tigaman's guild strongly suggests that they had no intention of letting Tigaman go first.<br />
<br />
Look at the time line in Jharasics post:<br />
<br />
&quot;After having over an hour to prep and still sitting there unready to engage, I told our beastlord to turn in his coin and start the cycle. I had given them first shot after all, and informed them that if they didn't take the mob at that time our group would.<br />
<br />
Our beastlord turns in his coin and starts the cycle&quot;<br />
<br />
Jharasic's BL was told to turn in before the other group was told to start at that time. There was no indication of any response for the other guild. So, if Jharasic's account of the events is correct, they jumped the gun, and that is likely what enraged Tigaman.<br />
<br />
Basically what it boils down to is Jharasic being an @, followed by Tigaman being an @ in response  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Quote from Mardark:<br />
They had several at the mob, and claimed it. You would have been better off by just coming back some other time and trying again. You basically screwed over your guild mate, because you were greedy and lack respect for others. Moreso, you escalated a situation that should have never happened in the first place, and then wasted the time of a GM because you wanted to be a prick.<br />
<br />
Its people like you that make it so GMs are not available when real problems arise. They are too busy wasting their time with situations that only occur because people are disrespectful of others and greedy.<br />
=================================<br />
<br />
Stuff it up you're buns, Mardark.  What a crap opinion.  Try playing this game sometime. <br />
<br />
I think you should escalate this as high as you can get it to go.  There is far more malice in training a camp and causing the loss of the epic piece than there ever was in politely waiting for an hour and then engaging after warning them you would do so if they didn't.</div></div><hr />

Or we and the members of DOM would be banned<br />
Thats why it has taken so long for a reply to most of the Guild bashing Because we Have told all members not to post for that reason but i just cant sit her and listen to all this BS<br />
we were in TD for no MORE the 30 MIN'S MAX when DOM zoned in and SAID i QUOTE DO THE TURN IN NOW OR WE WILL ) We told them that 2 members were killed on the way to TD and we were waiting for them to show they waited no more then a total time of 5 Min's after entering TD before Doing the Turn-in what Tigaman did was Wrong and has been dealt with by the GM he did not get off Scott free on this he was warned 2 times once for killing the scout and once for bragging about killing it / laughing he gets one more warning he's gone After they died we as Officers Offered a 96% rez and sent Apologies to them and even offered to do the epic quest for the BL that needed it we as Noobs can do it in 3 days max if the scouts are up then one of there members told us to Fu_k off and would never take a rez from us this could have all gone very well for them if they would have not Give us a DO IT NOW or else /ooc we would have gladly let them have this scout if they would have said he was leaving and it was his last chance to get it it's not a rare spawn it's there all the time it's really not a big deal (But no they had to be pricks about it and slam the guild all 198 members becuse of one bad group it kinda sounds like DOM is a bunch of name calling kids who just ditched school this is not a way to handle anything in EQ my god it's a Game not real life and then to make it even worse you as DOM have to get on a message board and LIE to everyone just to make your selfs Look better then us and as of to-date no one has quit zone over this if you didn't noticed (NotoriousRaptor) was not in ZONE when this happened. i'm not taking up for my guild in what they did i myself think it was wrong to kill the scout after they did the turn in but it was also wrong to even show up after we said it was camped you set on a spawn for that long and let me come in and tell you to kill it or else and you too would be pissed off Bottom line is it's Called Respect for other players in the Game and no Zone is not a Uber Guild and has never claimed to be one we are just a bunch of guys and girls who like to hang out and play EQ and Raid a few mobs along the way..... if you want to know anything else about this something i might have left out just ask no need for a war over a 72 hour spawn =)<br />
<br />
<br />
If there is a grain of truth, it infers that although people may have been waiting for the spawn for over an hour  (recorded by possibly doctored  screen dumps by Jharassik), the spawn  may not have occured until  Jharassik came (or shortly before he came to zone). (hmm.. if true meant that Jharassik had a oracle to &quot;Show EQ&quot;  spawns)  Also if what is being said is correct, they were within moments of being set up for the run when  Jharassik took it. Further, again if true, they &quot; even offered to do the epic quest for the BL &quot;  In reality the leader  of the Guild was not there for the incident and therefore must rely on second hand information (which tends  to favor  the view point of the teller). So for what's it worth, Tigaman has been  slapped on his wrist (should have at least been suspended) with a threat  of being banned if he did  it again.  And  there is no question that Tigman's action was wrong..... The question of  whether someone can rush people in  and take a spawn that someone has been waiting to spawn for a while   amounts to what values  of fair play people hold up to.</div></div><hr />

You're there for just 30 min and you haven't engaged.  Another guild comes in and says in ooc, engage or we will.  You have two options, and only two options.  Either begin the cycle, or sit there and do nothing.  Whoever is ready gets the damn mob.  Don't care if you've only been sitting there for 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
If you're pissed because you didn't get your mob, you DO NOT train them and ruin the guy's epic encounter; brag about ruining his epic; or raise a fit.  <br />
<br />
If two of your guild members died getting to TD, first, you have to ask yourself how on earth did you die going to TD? and second, why does it take 30 minutes to get to TD once you've died?  As a guildleader, if the guy with the epic was that stupid, I'd rip his head off, and say grats moron, you lost your epic fight because you're a retard with a 28 k.  If your guild isn't ready to do an encounter, either you're a sucky leader who can't motivate people to get off their arses faster, or your guild members are retards...in which case, the guild leader is leading a band of morons - grats you.<br />
<br />
To all you pansies claiming that this encounter shouldn't have happened...wake up...this isn't a god damned utopia.  The guild whose man lost the epic because of the whiney bitches...you should be emailing sony to get that guide fired.  That's bs.  As per every precedent that has been set before this, only the whiney guild (all those involved at least) should recieve warnings, your man should get his piece back that he lost so you all can engage epic mob again, and that guide should recieve a note on his desk the next morning saying &quot;pack your belongings and get the hell out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sony needs to implement a system where the players can evaluate the guides and GM's.  It's becoming a problem.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, your deductive skills are so incredible I am on the edge of my seat to see if you can tell us next what really happened in O.J. Simpsons house. <br />

Well, its obvious that  Jharassik had  doctored the screen shots . (crossed out most of the text he didn't want people to focus on and highlighting only those that he wanted people to see) but  I did not accuse him that he deliberately changed the content there.  It is possible that he could (unless  you think he's completely computer illiterate)  Its obvious that he has some means legal or illegal to monitor spawn has occured. Yes he can  have a  ranger or druid  mule   stationed  at the zone so it is possible  he  could do it legally as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">You're there for just 30 min and you haven't engaged.  Another guild comes in and says in ooc, engage or we will.  You have two options, and only two options.  Either begin the cycle, or sit there and do nothing.  Whoever is ready gets the damn mob.  Don't care if you've only been sitting there for 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
This is a common misconception I believe. VI's policy of first to engage has the kill applies primarily to regular mobs and mobs with no fixed spawn point (AC being a good example). In the case of raid and epic mobs they will award the spawn to whoever was assembled at the spawn with sufficient force first. How long you take to engage is irrelevant. Having a spotter camped at the spawn site is irrelevant. If there is a dispute, the two parties involved are supposed to reach a compromise, and failing that, request CS mediation. If the CS rep (usually a guide, sometimes a GM) can determine who was there first with sufficient force, that team will be awarded the spawn. If they can't determine that, they will make the two sides roll for the spawn (Guides don't have access to the all the information a GM might have access to, so when mediating they usually make you roll).<br />
<br />
So far no one has disputed the fact that the first guild was there with sufficient force. That meant they should have the spawn. No doubt that was a consideration in the GM's mind, and it explains why the epic pieces were not re-imbursed. If it was 2 or 3 people sitting there waiting for a viable force to show up it would have been different, but that was apparently not the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">takk the silent one, it is common practice to blur out chat you don't wish folks to read, take a look at any kill shots on major guild pages. Doctoring implies that he changed the text, or added text that didn't happen. There is an implication in what you said that appears to be deliberate. Of course it is possible he could, but I am not venturing that he did. You are.<br />
<br />
As far as having a ranger/druid stationed in a zone, that is hardly ground breaking news. On the other hand, it is not unheard of for groups of people to venture to zones looking to see if a mob is up, particularly a rarely contested one. Single groups hopping around epic sites are as common as muck.<br />
<br />
Talking of muck, has everyone finished raking this? I believe it is a good time to put this to bed.</div></div><hr />

All I have to say about you Bazlan is you are an unpatriotic @$$ who apparently has never served a day of his life in the military. I bet you're related to one or more of those unpatriotic hippy bastards that draft dodged and protested the vietnam war. Do you have any idea of what it is like to put your butt on the line knowing that you may never see your family again? Let me tell you this, I live this fear every day. I have friends that do the same. I know people who were held for 11 days on a Chinese Island with this fear. I know an officer that was in the U.S. Navy who was working in his office when an airplane crashed into the Pentagon and killed him and others. You seem to not have any respect for the military or the jobs they do. the jobs me and my friends are doing right now ensure your rights to sit your lazy @$$ around playing a stupid little game then having the gaul to make comments like that. Try living a like the military for month. Dont go see any of your family. Miss weddings and funerals. Try living in some of the conditions that the military has to deal with. Then your pathetic @$$ can say what you want.</div></div><hr />

No ****, Sherlock. I blacked out auctions and unrelated guildchat and highlighted tigaman's tells. That isn't doctoring a screenshot...and to accuse me of using show eq or any other third party program is laughable. <br />
<br />
Do you know how I knew the spawn was up? I was at the island looking right at it. Do you know how you can tell it had been up for some time? Their beastlord's tell in the screenshot saying their group had been gathered around the scout for an hour and a half.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jharasic's BL was told to turn in before the other group was told to start at that time.<br />
<br />
<br />
No. <br />
<br />
Context, what a concept. &quot;I had given them first shot after all, and informed them that if they didn't take the mob at that time our group would.&quot; is one complete thought, not two different thoughts even though you attempted to separate them. <br />
<br />
I had both given them the first shot and informed them if they didn't take it we would, at which point they said they were waiting on more people. I then told our beastlord to start the event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The definition of  &quot;doctor &quot; (from the American Heritage Dictionary) is <br />
&quot;To change or falsify (evidence) so as to make it favorable to oneself.&quot;  In this case I can definitely state by block out the other statement you did change the bitmap to show only favoritable arguments to oneself (As I stated in a earlier statement I didn't meant to state that you falsified the content).  If you presented evidence where you only had the person say  outlandish  things on the recording and  erased all the other content that is doctoring the tape.<br />
You were presenting the bitmaps as evidence of your cause and you had  modified it making it suspect (even though it is a custom on certain guilds to do that). So in this case, lets say you changed the bitmap with the intent to show favorably to oneself...  happy?<br />
<br />
<br />
That  crack  about &quot;Show eq&quot; was out of line and  apologize for that.  Which proves that you should read carefully before submiting. <br />
<br />
<br />
Do you know how I knew the spawn was up? I was at the island looking right at it. Do you know how you can tell it had been up for some time? Their beastlord's tell in the screenshot saying their group had been gathered around the scout for an hour and a half.<br />
<br />
 If you mean the bitmap with everyting  block out except a GM telling how he  was dealing with the BST  problem and his taunt . the beast lord  responded somthing like:<br />
<br />
&quot;Tigaman tell you, You a  streight  puk  we told you we had the scout we had alota pol seting next to scout and you went ahead and  did tne  way  after  we  been  waiting  for hour and half&quot; <br />
<br />
We  acknowledged that  Tigaman is a fool with poor  grammar. He sounds like he is stating two statements... 1) His group was around the scout and claiming him. At least him and some others had been waiting hour and half for him (It could have included the time it took for the scout to appear) From your personal knowledge which you stated ealier you know that it was taking roughly an half hour and they were still not ready. <br />
<br />
<br />
Context, what a concept. &quot;I had given them first shot after all, and informed them that if they didn't take the mob at that time our group would.&quot; is one complete thought, not two different thoughts even though you attempted to separate them. <br />
<br />
I had both given them the first shot and informed them if they didn't take it we would, at which point they said they were waiting on more people. I then told our beastlord to start the event.<br />
<br />
So you are basically agreeing with their leader that someone from their  group sent your group a message that there were just waiting for two incomming people that got killed at the zone? .</div></div><hr />

<br />
You ommitted the sentence before that where you instructed your BL to hand in. I'm sure thats not what you meant, but a literal interpretation of your statement/s has your BL being instructed to hand in before your ultimatum. You see, thats the killer about text sent over a computer, it doesnt display emotions. If someone isnt fluent in english, or is a poor typer, or careless, meaning may be lost. In my ignorance I assumed that since you were willing to make literal interpretations of Tigaman's (who is obviously having issues with English) statements, you wouldn't mind if someone else applied the same standard to you ;).</div></div><hr />

Sigh... I have no axe to grind with you but obviously when you posted this you expected everyone to sympathize with you and  agree with you whole  heartedly.  You took offense to the way I stated your evidence only showing conversation that seem to support how bad Tigaman is.  Reguardless of how bad he is, your &quot;evidence&quot; is rather one sided which is probably why GM , in general, won't accept screen shots.  For instance, where  is the conversation of you talking to the other group before triggering the cycle? <br />
<br />
Well as to say that  I attacked you from left field, you placed this exact same thread on an another forumn and   I didn't invent  Darkatt quote. If you have issues with that quote just say its false and be done with it. If  look at one of the links from from a earlier message thread by  Woden, it points to the other message thread.<br />
<br />
In your world you are always right and lets just stop this thread its pointless. Please DO NOT respond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">As has been said many times here.  First in force ready to engage has always been the rule.  Past policy has been once you have given the opportunity to engage and did not do so you have lost the spawn.   You allowed an extra 30 minutes to prepare.  Sounds like you got a bad GM decision.  Certainly the training/ks'ing should have been dealt with.  If you have e-mailed customer service (which you say you have) wait for that reply.  It is a lousy situation but by the way these incidents have always been handled in the past you were correct.  Let us know what eqcs has to say.  Should be interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Wodon, and a few others...yes, you can plainly tell by my superb ms paint skills in blacking out guild/public channels and highlighting the zone beastlord saying they &quot;had alota ppl siting next to scout and you went ahead and did it n e way after we been waiting for hour and half&quot;  that I am a 1337 mspaint wizard who faked those screenshots.<br />
<br />
What I and a couple of others pointed out were that the screenshots were irrelevant, rather than doctored. Your blatant attempts to spin all through this thread do little for your credibility. To be fair, I have my doubts about Darkatt's too.<br />
<br />
From what little I know of Tigaman, &amp; from reading Darkatts posts, it seems like the're benighted kids. As far as I can see, you made a selfish and arrogant decision to shaft them, then when it all came to pieces, quoted PnP at the GM, after conveniently ignoring the part of it regarding disputed spawns. I doubt we've heard an entirely accurate account of that too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now it seems to me that GM's are operating under the axiom &quot;If you don't do anything, you can't do it wrong.&quot; GM's seem more intent on not getting into trouble themselves than actually resolving situations. <br />
<br />
In the past I've had a couple of run ins with GM's on Vallon (before they became a nearly extinct lifeform there) that were easy to communicate with and always resolved the issues in such a way that both parties were happy with it. Sometimes they might have overstepped their authority, and I bet they took chances doing that, but the players liked these GM's and always respected their decisions, even when the players didn't get their way. <br />
<br />
GM quality has pretty obviously deteriorated over the years.<br />

I don't think many (if any) here were disputing that the BST should have gotten the item back. I'm happy for him. Just don't be too surprised that about half the people here didn't agree with you that you did the right thing initially. That one comes down to how much you respect the other players on your server and the fact that people disagree with you there shouldn't come as a shock to anyone.</div></div><hr />

Actually EQ doesnt really have Customer Service.  What it actually has is 'Bad Customer' Service - meant in the sense that their CS reps are constantly dealing with 'bad' customers.<br />
<br />
It would be quite nice if the CS reps would ban more people who demostrate an inability to behave with any consideration for anyone not in their own small peer group.  Then CS might have more time to help out their 'good' customers.</div></div><hr />
