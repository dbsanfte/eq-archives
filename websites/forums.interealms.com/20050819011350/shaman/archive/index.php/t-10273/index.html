<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm coming back to the game after a 2 month absense and was curious what I will need to know to reaclimate myself.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well.. still the same since ya took ya vacations :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One change, Kragg's Mending now has the same aggro component as CH.  Just be carefull when healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">basically Tarthug's nailed the only significant change, kragg's mending, while still being unaffected by any focus effects, now generates like 3x the hate it used to making it easier to get killed while healing and still healing worse than druid or clr for the same mana and now the same amnt of hate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some mobs mitigate slow, just as we suspected, but they now announce that fact.  While I was doing the trials yesterday (still haven't passed) every mob in there gave me the message &quot;Your spell was partially effective&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
Kragg's Mending, our iCH, now has a much higher agro level.  A few people think it's too much, others (myself included) think it's about right.<br />
<br />
Those are the biggest changes I can think of.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Typos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are three levels of slow mitigation - &quot;Your spell was slightly successful&quot;, &quot;...partially successful&quot;, and &quot;...mostly successful&quot;.  Might have gotten the exact wording wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, go to elemental planes and its few and far apart between mobs that doesnt mitigate slow at all. Most mobs mitigate partially. As far as I know PoF bosses(?)/minis seems to be slightly slowed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh also we foudn out sony doesn't give a sh!t about....oh nm they never did. My bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Malo and Torpor are vendor sold... just kidding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Weirdness, my post got added to the wrong thread.   Sorry.<br />
<br />
Edited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The storm giants in plane of storms mitigate slows.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ouch!</div></div><hr />
