<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just looking at some of this stuff, and so far, it looks like complete and total junk.<br />
<br />
Allakhazam's listed everything being attainable by lvl 45, but by then, it seems even the most non twinked character would have better.  <br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, it's junk!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ranger/Shaman/Rogue stuff is awful.  Plate classes are bad, but not as bad.  Int caster stuff can be ok. <br />
<br />
Some of the monk stuff is really nice.  Usually in main areas, like legs and gi and sleeves and bracers.  Stuff like cloaks and neck pieces and masks there are too many all/all things that are nicer.<br />
<br />
For the insane difficulty of the quests, the armor should be upgraded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Completing the quests at the level the armor would be useful is impossible unless YOU control the newbie horde!  The fact that the armor is both difficult to attain and useless leads me to think that it may have a purpose further down the road.<br />
<br />
I would not be surprised if this stuff popped up in some &quot;epic&quot; armor quest.  I think they let the programmer/designer responsible for PoA throw a bit of magic into every expansion :p</div></div><hr />
