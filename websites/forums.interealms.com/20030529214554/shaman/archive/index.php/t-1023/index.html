<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, splain me this.  Puller is bringing in a MOB (in BW, if it matters).  Arrow pulling.  MOB is running right to left in front of me, about the same distance between me and it and between the puller and it, although at 90 degree angles.<br />
<br />
I hit my PET ATTACK button.  The mob veers over straight towards me!  What the heck?  PET ATTACK outtaunts arrows?  Or does Verant hate shaman so much they automatically add us to the top of the hate list?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually I have noticed the same thing while soloing.  I am at about the max distance where the pet command to attack will take effect.  Soon as I press the button to send my pet in, and before I see the doggie run off, I see the monster running at me.  Just pressing the pet attack button acts as a taunt apparently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's you :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a guess, but were you siting?<br />
<br />
/pet attack while siting outtaunts Tash, snare, mez, slows, etc... until you stand up. Then the mob doesn't really care about it.<br />
<br />
I can get my mage summoned 99% of the time (when fighting apropriate mobs) just by sending in my pet while siting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aggro is depandant on alot of things.  Some mobs go by 'proximity' aggro; whoever is the closest gets attacked.<br />
<br />
Another explanation is that the puller only stuck an arrow in the monster, this does not create a lot of aggro, so you sending your pet in could easily make enough aggro for the mob to come after you.<br />
<br />
Also, level depends upon aggro sometimes, if a monster can decide between you at lvl 50, or your puller buddy at lvl 60, its gonna come for you; especially if you are creating sitting aggro, or are lower on hps, which also creates more aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm... yes, I was sitting - I recently changed my hotkeys around so that my SLOW hotkey stands me up instead of my ASSIST hotkey.  That is probably the explanation.  I guess my pet attack hotkey could stand me up as well.<br />
<br />
It's still weird that before the pet even closes with the mob, before it has damaged it one iota, I still have aggro just by ISSUING the /pet attack command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by weissblau <br />

<br />
Or you have aggro becasue you were sitting... not sure if the pet attack had anything to do with it. I am sure you have been caught sitting on your arse when the puller brings a mob to camp... you know what happens :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sitting while issuing /pet attack on a mob is high aggro.<br />
<br />
On raids when a mob has just been pulled and people don't seem to be fighting it where they should be, I can just staff the mob and sit down and it'll come right for me.  This usually only works within the first few seconds though, then it's laugh time as everyone poofs the mob through the wall and 5 mobs show up a minute later.<br />
<br />
It's also fun to do on your idiot tanks in exp groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use my high agro to do a lot of positioning too.  It's pretty useful really.  Sit brings mobs right where I want them.<br />
<br />
One of my friends thinks it's pretty funny though.  She call the mobs I am moving or parking my pets.   Since they never swing at me and follow me around so obediently.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dunno, at some of our raids, I've had mobs weave their way through 60 people just to whack me while I stood there and hadn't cast a spell yet.  =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Serves ya right for hunting in Burned Woods, foo <br />
<br />
hahahaha that was a good one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>brett_sc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you pull without doing any damage to the mob (ie. arrow misses, proximity agro), or doing very little damage, you get VERY little agro. This is extremely obivious in places like KC with pullers who refuse to melee a mob a bit before pulling it, mob will turn on the first other PC it spots.<br />
<br />
So, puller has little/no agro, you send in pet which puts you on the hate list. 2 people on hate list with very little agro, except one is standing and one is sitting. You know what happens next :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">try turning dogdogs taunting off<br />
<br />
Puller pulls mob with virtually 0 agro<br />
Mob comes into range, you send in dogdog<br />
Dogdog taunts straight away (pets don't need to be close to a mob to taunt it)<br />
Dogdog immediately jumps higher up the hatelist than the puller<br />
Dogdog = your pet, so you get agro too<br />
Sitting agro &gt; dogdog's first taunt, so you get all the agro =)<br />
<br />
Pets get agro wierdly, they can be higher up on the hatelist than pcs, but mobs generally won't attack them unless theres no other target in melee range, I'm guessing if theres nothing in melee range they will go straight for the owner of the pet thats on the top of there list also.  Interestingly though It does appear to be possible for a rogue to evade a mob onto a pet for a little while, managed to pull it off repeatedly as my rogue twink =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, but I don't want to turn pet taunt off.  How else will I know when Fido wanders and gets into trouble?  I'd rather just stand up *^)</div></div><hr />
