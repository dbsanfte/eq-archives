<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Obadia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">trying to figure out this aa thing.<br />
 <br />
 how does aa go up compared to exp?does like the time to get one blue of exp equal two blue of aa?i was thinking that,hmm someone is level 65 and they have say 70aa points,that must mean in reality they are actually level 135?! :p<br />
<br />
 how do titles work,what are the titles we aquire as we go along and at what level of aa do we start aquiring titles?<br />
<br />
 i'm guessing,from what i've been reading here that run3 should be my first goal to aquire? <br />
<br />
 i'm level 56 now and think that working on some aa would break up the monotony of grinding out exp all the time.i'd actually have two things to waste my time on!  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
 at 56 is there any suggestions as to where i might find some good areas to solo for the aa's?you know,the low risk dark blue low hp mobs! :D  <br />
<br />
 or does aa even work like exp?the harder the mob the more the aa gained?<br />
<br />
 thanks in advance for any help or advice anyone may have as i take my first steps into the realm of aa aquisition!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AA is just a way of spending experience points gained. So if you kill a mob that gives you 1000 exp and you have set you AA slider at 50 percent 500 points of exp will go to AA and 500 towards normal levelling.<br />
<br />
1 point of AA will cost the same amount of exp it takes to go from 51 to 52 so it is a set amount no matter what level you are. So as levels begin to take more and more exp to get through 1 blue of AA will start to get &quot;faster/easier&quot; to get than 1 blue of normal exp.<br />
<br />
There are many AA skill but none is more essential than Cannibalization. I am 61 and I have that AA skill but I dont have Runspeed 3 and I dont really miss it. Its all up to you and how you play. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How could you have cannibalization but not runspeed? =p What did you spend your first 6 points on to get to arch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3 stamina + 3 regen. Seems much more useful to me. Runspeed is for cowards that wants to outrun trains/groupmembers in dungeons ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah and putting AA in to stamina is for people with crappy gear that can't hit the stamina cap.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The statement I just made is almost as dumb as yours.  You're a fool to not get run3.  Run3 has saved my life countless times, but the 10 HP (actually 0 since my sta is capped) you get from 3 stamina does jack squat.<br />
<br />
Run3 -&gt; Regen3 -&gt; MC3 -&gt; Cannibalization is the AA path that almost all shamans start with.  After that there are many good choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dissing him for taking sta over rs is lame.  not everyone can max sta...  I've got some great gear but not quite maxing sta yet.<br />
<br />
but as far as the path for archetype and class skills, yes 100% THE way to go for shaman is MC3 and CanniV.  CanniV is amazingly good and you'll never regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The statement I just made is almost as dumb as yours.  <br />
<br />
He isnt really dissing him for his choice, he's proving a point that Spiritblood's statement was just as stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Reading comprehension is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How usefull is RS3? How many zones do you actually hunt, where you can't cast SoW? I XP in Tier 1 zones, and during indoor raids i see no need for the extra speed, as the raidforce moves pretty slowly for the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">3 stamina at level 60 is 9 hp.  If runspeed 3 saves your life, once, ever, in the rest of the time you are playing EQ, it has just proven more useful than 3 stamina ever will.<br />
<br />
Also who knows what dungeons and zones will come out in the future, right now you stay in all tier1 zones, but you're bound to leave those occasionally for other places, and maybe better exp will be found in sow-less dungeons of LoY?  Who knows, but rs3 is definitely worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">RS 3 is worth it, beyond doubt. <br />
<br />
I find it most useful when raiding in dungeons -- it allows me to keep up with the raid force when we are on the move.  It also allows me to outrun snared mobs more easily (if I get out of range 1 hit faster, it has saved me &gt;400 hp).  <br />
<br />
Its also nice when you can get past a mob before its agro triggers (there is always a short time between the time the mob perceives you and the time it agros you).  If you get out of its agro radius before it agros, thats pretty handy.<br />
<br />
I tend to think of run speed as a &quot;running to&quot; kind of skill, rather than running away from something.<br />
<br />
I would say that getting innate stamina 3 is not terribly useful.  Those 10hp arent going to save my life, ever.  I guess you need it if you want some of the planar power skills, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well at level 63 and  soloing POV mobs, i can get up to 2 aa blue xp per kill (at 100 percent aa xp).<br />
