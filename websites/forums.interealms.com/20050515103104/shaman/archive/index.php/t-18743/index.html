<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what everyone's preference on these were. To normal anymore seems like a joke cause we blow through collects and slaughters in 30-45 minutes. Hard to me seems liek a challenge and most of the time it comes down to the wire if you dont have the right group. (4 losses by 1 item left). The way I look at the Hard missions is risk vs reward. Granted on a normal, you could clear the entire dungeon in 60 minutes if you put your mind to it. The thing I find is 9 times out of 10 the loot is horrible on normal. Half of what I have got from it at 65 should be given out at level 35. Hard on the other hand has great rewards I would compare even if not better than tier 3 PoP loot. The first Hard Mission I did I won a nice haste cloak with 90 hp 70 mana and a bunch of other stats. I've also lost twice on a set of caster shoulders.<br />
Granted I seem to win about 50% of the Hard missions I think they are more worth the drops off the named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have a strong group, hard is better in every way.  When I group with guildies, we usually do a normal in around 20-25 minutes, and then we have to &quot;rest&quot; for another 20-25 until it will let us go again.  So, basically, we get 51 points every 50 minutes or so.  And the loot and exp are crap.<br />
<br />
If we do a hard, though, we usually do it in about 50-60 minutes.  When we are done, we have 105 points, usually at least one 30k+ item, and one more AA point than we started with.  And we don't have to &quot;rest&quot; (the penalty box, as we call it).<br />
<br />
edit - And the best part about hard is: it isn't boring!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I do hard when ever I can but I'm also picky about my groups I do hard runs with. So far i'm 15 and 0 i think for hard runs. Haven't personally picked up upgrades on the missions but have seen a fair amount of stuff drop and managed to get a couple sellables. I've gone petty from either extreme with hard missions. Had a mission where we literally won with 1 minute left on the timer. Was an assassinate and had 3 or 4 mobs in camp in addition to the named. Just managed to kill the named before the timer expired. I've also had a 37 minute hard adventure.<br />
<br />
Personally I've started to avoid assassinates on hard. The targets aren't that hard the difficulty seems to be thier spawn location often puts them pretty far into the dungeon which can make it a major pain to get to them. Collects and slaughters are our currently prefered options for hard missions.<br />
<br />
As far as the group goes we've always done warrior (my roommate), shaman (me), cleric, enchanter, bard and one other dps typically a ranger if we can get one. Bard handles the pulling and with Shaman and enchanter debuffs on the mob charm is pretty reliable and bard can backup mes to help recharm. With the charmed pet the groups dps is pretty good and with 3 debuffers and 2 crowd control people it's practically unkillable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm 100% win for hard adventures and find them more fun, and MUCH more rewarding use of my time in terms of exp, loot and points. I do not finish either normal or hard in under 45 minutes 90% of the time. Add to that the time to assemble everyone, buff, get adv, the invariable afks and ld's, and you are looking at around 1hr15min or more per mission, hard or normal. If the time spent is the same then by all means do hard. <br />
<br />
BUT, I also find it extremely difficult on Prexus to find anyone who wants to do hard adventures, or even do any adventures outside of MMC. Its sort of frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No reason to waste my time on hards.  A year from now the only thing I'll remeber is 300+ hours I spend mindlessly grinding away to max the charm augment.  I'd prefer be able to group with anyone and meet new folks rather than sit on my ass for a hour tring to build the perfect group of people I already know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ceno summed it up, more or less.  If you're already in the top end raiding Time, there's nothing in hard missions other than vendor/twink fodder.  You get more pts per mission, but it typically takes a lot longer to get the right group together and complete the mission.<br />
<br />
Normal missions mean I can join or form just about any random pickup group, relax and socialize while we breeze through the mission.  I'll do hard missions, but only if I feel reasonably comfortable with the group.   Usually though, I just grab whoever I see LFG or join the first group to ask me and fly through normal.  It's nice to get outside your guild and meet some new people on off nights IMO, plus the horror stories you get to tell your friends about some of the morons you meet can provide hours of entertainment! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That pretty much sums up my view of hard even from a lot lower then time point of view. Hard I have to spend too damn long getting together a good group that actually had a chance to win. Normal I can use whoever I got handy and not give a damn about the group makeup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 62 a &quot;hard&quot; adventure just doesn't seem very rewarding.  I received 48 points for completing one this afternoon.  The group average was 61.  That certainly isn't double the points I'd normally receive.<br />
<br />
I'd rather do a &quot;normal&quot; adventure and not mem malo.   I can CC a 3+ pull on normal but on &quot;hard&quot; I'm praying slow sticks or we're wiping.<br />
<br />
Like Ceno and Sciek said I'd rather get a group together fast then spend an hour looking for a bard, cleric, paladin, etc... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">basicaly if your looking to farm points and wins normal will give you more for your time.  if you looking for a challenge, better loot and better xp hard is the way to go.  however for hard youll want a group you know works well together not just a random pick up group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Could I get bit more info on the hard missions HATE getting friends killed becuase I didnt know.  Here is basicly what I would kinda like to know about the hard missions if others would be so kind as to let me know.<br />
<br />
Normal Mobs<br />
1. how hard they hit<br />
2. Meele to caster ratio<br />
3. How much Slow Midigation<br />
4. How tight they are packed. (Ie: Normal 2 on pull or 4-6)<br />
<br />
Named Mobs<br />
1. how hard they hit<br />
2. How much Slow Midigation<br />
3. How resistant they are<br />
<br />
I know there have been few people that have said all this hear and there though that was quite awhile ago and I was wondering has it been toned down a bit or up a bit or what.  Any ways thanks for any info you can provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They hit for 900ish and when slowed you get the red text message of &quot;mostly slowed&quot;.  The zones all vary, some are packed tight with mobs while others are so spread out they are all single pulls. Named arent much harder, but do hit for over 1k.  Usually i only malo the nameds or enc pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hit for close to 1k, all mtigate. Like normal nameds aren't much tougher, unless you do a boss kill, in which case they're hard, truely.<br />
<br />
The mob placement is exactly the same.<br />
<br />
A good group consists of a shaman a bard (a MUST), cleric/druid (ones i group with are EP equipped so so either does well), good tank. Rest is dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I haven't noticed any real difference on resists between high and normal risk. They bounce about the same. Mobs hit for 990. And yes a bard is a must. More than 2 in camp can get ugly fast if a slow is missed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Same here. i dont use malos on hard either.  My brother and I usually do hard alone.  He bots chanter/cleric, and i play shaman solo.  The pet kills them so fast, by the time malos would land they would be dead lol.<br />
<br />
I would much rather do hard myself.  Keeps things much more interesting, and your bank roll fat.  I tell ya, that hasted duel weilding pet will mow through all 3 of us in about 2 seconds flat. haha  <br />
<br />
I just wish the aaxp was better.  Its ok, but alas you can get better in PoP.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I used to play hard mode Ldon a fair amount before I got my elemental flags. It was a challenging experience for tier3 geared people (all 65 groups), but we could still win in 45-60mins most times with my usual suspects xp crew. The xp/loot RvR ratio also meant we could get better gear than tier3 pop offered to single groups for the most part. I am still using the girdle of bloodstained stones, and only recently upgraded 'boots of an aged mystic' for rosrark's.<br />
<br />
Since I have got my elemental flags however, I either raid or xp in elementals these days. We haven't been flagged for long, so still farming a lot of single group EP mobs for upgrades atm. The kind of group that can win hard Ldon can make far more xp and have a shot at much better loot/tradeskill drops in EP.<br />
<br />
For farming points, I usually do Hard MMC with friends. I very rarely do pick up groups though, the last i did was when my enchanter friend invited me to join a group with 4 time geared people. They were going to do normal but I talked them into hard and we won 2 adventures in under 100mins total time played ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I do just normals because of my play times (late evenings early mornings) so picking up a perfect hard group isn't going to happen much.  On normal I can pick pretty much any 5 people and win on normal.  Recently I had a group of  DRU, CLR, CLR, CLR, SHM, ENCH.   We finished in about 30 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Skitzoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't know why a few of you are saying a bard is a must. I normally do hards and I can't really remember the last time we had a bard. Enchanter is just fine. Plus a charmed chanter pet is very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I really prefere ldon hard adventures, the easy ones are just death boring.<br />
Hard does require a good group but it's not that bad as some think, once you have done a few you get used to it.<br />
Mobs hit hard, but have the same amount of hp and resists as in normal mode.  Hard names drop very nice loot for vt lvl guilds and lower, plus some nice 50k+ sellables.  Only thing that would like to see changed is that hard adventures give 2 adventure charm points ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I believe it's 'high' diff, not 'hard', not that it matters.  It affects the level of critters you face based on your groups average level, and it all breaks down on ranges by average group level.  Selecting high diff bumps up your adventure by one grouping/bump which is approximately 5 levels.<br />
<br />
So, if you're lower level you want to be careful selecting high diff because if your average level happens to be very close to the critter levels for normal diff you can easily get overwhelmed.  Conversely, if your average group level is at the high end of the range and you're almost to the next cutoff point then you really need to do high diff for decent xp and loot.<br />
<br />
For example, at higher levels the cutoffs are ave group level of 58 then 63.  If you have a group with an average level of say, 62.5, and did a normal diff you'd face critters level 54-56, which are extremely easy for your group.  If you select high diff you get critters level 59-61, which is more of a challenge and better xp and loot.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you uber equipped, all 65's, and have 100's of AA then you'd want to do high diff because normal would be completely trivial.  I have mediocre gear and don't even have canniV yet and I consider normal diff at 65 to be easy unless you have a really horrible group (rarely has happened to me in the 60's).<br />
<br />
The original post was by a 59, I believe.  If you had an average group level of 59 and did high diff you'd face level 59-61 critters - and would be facing a good number of white and yellow cons (for the 59's and lower, at least) - which could be rough unless you're in a strong group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I use malos on adds only so bard doesn't have to worry about resist on mezz. Hard adventures are the only ones not boring.<br />
<br />
I usually do normal adventures only if we don't have a cleric (I am the only healer). on normal I can do healing, slowing, buffs and be close to full mana all the time, if i have to do other things like a lot of crowd control, then i don't have alot of time to cani and go low on mana very fast since i don't have great equipment.<br />
<br />
I also often hydra on normal but not on hard ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Last hard I did we got hit with a server puke (Bristlebane) and only 3 of us made it back. Bard, Pally, and me. We finished the last 5 of a 27 collect with time to spare. Really need to have people who know how to do their jobs though in hard. <br />
<br />
Normal is for when you don't want to have to think or are with people who have no clue and you don't want them to get you killed six times.<br />
