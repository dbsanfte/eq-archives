<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm planning on attempting the Executioner trials soon and really appreciate all the input in other threads.  I have made quite a few DS potions already but I'm wondering if there are any other potions I'm not thinking of that could be off assistance for the trials.  Has anyone used any potions besides the DS?  I want to make sure I bring as much to the group as possible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah just give your MT and maybe your CC person a stinging wort potion if you really think its worth the trouble.  Other than that DS really all you need.  I don't bother slowing anything except the executioner so DS adds a lot.</div></div><hr />

Uhm. Why do you need to make potions? A naked level 52 shaman has other things to worry about than potions! <br />
<br />
You will NEVER make a profit off of alchemy. Well, maybe if you did it 24/7 but it will take AGES. And you MUST be level 58 to turn a profit.<br />
<br />
My advice to you: delete the shaman. Start a new one. Learn to play the class from day 1. Earn a reputation. Make friends. Don't jump in on some unknown character at level 52 that's probably been handed around five times already and expect to be good at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Quin, check the posts on these boards here and in the equipment section and use the search feature to find info on topics you want to know more about.<br />
<br />
No need to lambast the guy, folks, he's just asking for info.<br />
<br />
As for the trials, there's an insta click disease cure from old alchemy, but i costs 130pp or more per herb (ta! VI). If you can be bothered making some up. Check the recipe on EQTraders.<br />
<br />
There's also a mana regen potion, but it's probably not worth it. Maybe the regen potion might be worth it for yourself. <br />
<br />
Personally i've found you don't have a lot of time to be messing with potions. The thing that gets you through is the skill of your group mates.</div></div><hr />
