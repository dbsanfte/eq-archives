<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Enormious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heh, I finally decided to get LDoN (downloaded it online), and went to get my first adventure a couple of days ago.<br />
<br />
After a bit of running back and forth to POK (for Intricate Wooden Figurine) and Halas, I ended up in the Everfrost camp. There, a group was formed with me (52 shaman) and three beastlords (51,52,52). One of them had done one adventure before, and the 51 beastlord was to be our group leader, since he was the most experienced.<br />
<br />
Still, it was a long time since any of them had adventured, and it took some time before we were able to even get an adventure (we decided to do a normal one, since we were only four and a good mix of rusty/inexperienced). And then a 30 minute timer started ticking....51 BST went LD, and I had no idea where this &quot;portal&quot; was (my compass was gone, and I had no idea how to put it back up). Someone said we'd better hurry, since we were on a timer. I checked..oh, my, we only had 27 minutes left to finish the adventure!<br />
<br />
Anyhow, we found the portal at last and I zoned immediately. We were, after all, in quite a hurry.<br />
&quot;wait...don't click it&quot;<br />
Hm? Oh my, I had started the adventure, and the 51 BST was still not back. It slowly dawned on me what kinda timer the 30 minute timer was.....<br />
<br />
In short, the 51 BST went LD a couple of more times, one of the BSTs died 2 times...BUT we completed the adventure! We collected 22 artifacts, and had maybe 15 minutes left. It was a blast!<br />
<br />
What can I say...I wish I had done this sooner  :D <br />
<br />
Whooo! I'm now the proud owner of 15 LDoN points..only thousands to go  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congratulations!<br />
<br />
And if you don't raid, it's tens of thousands to go. I'm wearing over 15k of LDoN gear and four hard drops, but it's nice to know that you're chipping away at it each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All I play EQ for now is Ldon.  I currently have 320 plus wins.  I do things now in Ldon I wouldnt even have considered when I first started.  Mostly due to being scared then and not knowing what to expect.  Now I pull all zones, normal, and I have come to figure out something in Ldon.  I have discovered through numerous tells when I pull or when I group with people I don't even know even though I can't do much dps and am only good for buffing and slowing, I am the one that gives confidence to the group.  I can make things seem easy even when its going bad or I can make things seem bad when it going good.  I have gotten so many tells from people saying &quot;you made the adventure seem so easy, thank you&quot;.  My normal response is I didnt do anything you did all the work.  Have confidence in yourself, shower it on your group, and you will do well and even gain future ldon partners.  Go in a ldon with a bad attitude and it will rub the players the wrong way.  Trust me I have seen it.  Enjoy Ldon while you can though as I have a bad feeling Omens is going to ruin my future playing enjoyment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) To get your compass back, click Alt D (d for direction!<br />
<br />
2) There are two timers, the initial 30 minute timer is the time limit to start the adventure, not start and finish the adventure<br />
<br />
3) Hards are well named and would be tough with 1 shaman, 3 BST. You'd probably want a tanky type, cleric and CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congrats!<br />
<br />
I really Like doing LDoN's and the Armor is some of the best in the game for someone like me that does not play a lot or is not in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
once you have done a few you will get the hang of them.<br />
<br />
I just did one the other night with some guildies where I was tank, puller and slower. LOL and had a blast doing it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">After a while when you get the hang of things try a Pally/SK, Shaman, and 4 wizzy group.  Too much fun.  Or all pet groups although you really need to watch agro on that one.<br />
<br />
Purdy<br />
<br />
PS: LDON is fun if you try different group compositions.  With standard group, zzzzzzzzzzz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Haha - it sounds like you had a lot of fun and a steep learning curve. Good luck with your continuing LDoN progression.<br />
<br />
the &quot;Collect&quot; adv are generally thought to be the easiest, then the slaughter, with rescue and assasinate being the slowest...although I don't think that the difference is as big as people make out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats! :) <br />
<br />
I like LDoN, even though I see it almost as a spectator sport. The good news is, even though nothing I do has a large impact...I can do lottsa stuff :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Toppo,<br />
<br />
Get yourelf 5 melee classes and do LDoNs where you are the only healer and slower - you will not feel like a spectator then!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LDON will allow you to skip alot of content if you apply yourself.  I came back to EQ (rolled a new shaman) right after the release of LDON and managed to level, collect points, and equip myself well enough to bypass EP completely and work with a GoD focused guild.  I managed to collect flags here and there (for access to tradeskill and exp spots), but LDON definitely allows you more options than were available before it was released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Enormious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One thing I leaft out in my eagerness to share my exploits, was one thing which occured during one of the LD sessions of the 51 BST....<br />
<br />
We decided that we should move on and let him catch up...30 seconds later we faced 3-4 mobs, one of which charmed me (a new experience for me). Heh, I must say things got kinda chaotic when I started meeleeing and DOTing my group  :D <br />
<br />
I can't wait to go crawling some more  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heh.<br />
<br />
I generally pull when Im in an adventure.  Its something do to besides heal and root to try and drop agro if I DoT.  (Please fix dot agro, thanks). <br />
<br />
My regular group comsists of a druid for healer, so I dont have much healing to do unless she cant make it.    My regular group is Shm (me) SK, BL, Rogue, druid ,wizard that sometimes playes his rogue instead.  We usually finish with about 40 minutes left, regardless of mission type, though assasinations take a little longer.<br />
<br />
Still not close to getting my Specter yet.  Sigh...so many other things to buy....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hahah, or have 2 or more shaman in group, eh Purdy? ;)  That was a fun Guk adventure with ya, I need to do more.  I have not so many adventures under my belt, probably avg 15 each theme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Had two Enchanters in a group one time. Both charming. Also had a Necro and Cleric plus a couple others.  THAT was a fast adventure.<br />
<br />
Had a Pally heal one time.  Another time BL and Ranger.<br />
<br />
Once you get the hang of normals you can blow through them quick.  And yes, after awhile a &quot;standard&quot; group is B-O-R-I-N-G.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Try an all pet group with a shaman or druid as healer.  Surprising effective - the dps is amazing.  I spent a Saturday in this combination at about your level - we were finishing with 50 minutes left.  And it is a fun combination -- dogdog appreciates the company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I always heal and pull normals now. Even if I grab a druid or cleric for some reason, I ask them to dps and only heal me on the inevetible once-per-ldon 5-pull. :)</div></div><hr />

Hmm...why?  I let clerics and druids do what thy do better than I.  My mana is better spent doing what I do best, buffing, debuffing and dotting IMHO.  I can heal LDoNs but prefer it when one of the real healing classes pick up that chore, and I back them up.  There are plenty of other ways I can spend my mana - Bane and Anathema stack.</div></div><hr />

Because I think the Cleric or Druid DPSing and me healing is overall a better combination than me DPSing (underperforming) and the Cleric or Druid healing (wasting healing power). And I do this while keeping regen, haste, FA, and all the other buffs on the appropriate group members.<br />
<br />
I can buff, chain pull, slow and heal without downtime with a KEI; I cannot buff, chain pull, slow and put one Bane on each mob without downtime with a KEI. DoTs frequently don't run full course, even Bane - and since I sometimes have a Necro (undead), Mage (summoned) or Chanter in the group mezzing, I try not to DoT at all; we may get a healer add, and have to switch targets.<br />
<br />
But this isn't meant as an argument, just an answer to your question. We can each feel comfortable with different approaches.<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Samana you miss an important (yet sad) point.<br />
<br />
Not only do Druids out DPS us - they out heal us as well.  Now Clerics by design outheal us, but against undead they may just out DPS us as well. <br />
<br />
But I do agree - different strokes fer different folks.<br />

&quot;If it's stupid and it works - then it isn't stupid.&quot;<br />
