<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, first time posting and new to EQ. A friend and I have been play EQ for about a month and a half and we both have made it to level 14, averaging around 2 hours of play time a day. Both of us are Barbarians, she's a beastlord and I'm a shaman. I have most of my spells and all but as far as equipment goes all I have is the armor you get from cindil in halas, and a velium mace of some type that another high level friend gave me and a shield of some type. Most of the time I pull and tank some when it's just us. What I want to know is this pretty common equipment for my level or should I have something far better. Remember plat is hard to come by at such a low level but I have managed to save around a 100 plat in the bank. So if anyone can give some good advice to a young shaman I would give many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EverNewbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, everyperson that I've talked to says for that the person that is REALLY on a budget they should try to get a set of banded armor. The armor usually cost's around 100pp a set so u could afford some. It will help u emensely. If you could find a better way to make money and level (i.e. bone chips, silks, HQ Bear Pelts) thats good too. With the additional money get a decent pierce weap and a 1hb and maybe a 2hb if u want. Make sure to get multiple skills in weps up. If ur pullin in the cash well then you can also look into other items. There are orc fang earings that add +15hp and something else(forgot wat it was) and there only 30pp a piece. Go to the bazaar and look for things that are good and aren't expensive. I did that and now have some ok gear and it only cost me bout 360pp. Well I'm also a newbie and learning too, any other info that I get I will make sure to pass down, as long as its decent information. Oh yea you can get some decent pierce weaps for not too much.I bought a some like grimy harpoon for 100pp. It was 10/25 +5wis and +10 mana not bad weap until mid lvl. I also bought some other small stuff from NPC's for cheap too. look around and buy what u like. HP is good at low lvl. Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I remember of my time in the Halas area as a young shaman, from the patchwork armor you could look into the folowing items that are fairly cheap and good (ok not a jbb good but not everone is a million$ twinck when they start). <br />
<br />
1st thing if you dont have a neck item do this quest: <br />
Give Jinkus (inside shaman guild in Halas) a piece of Mammoth Hide Parchment (from Cindl - Ask her 'what mammoth hide parchment?'), and a bottle of datura ink (from Greta outside Smokes and Spirits - Ask her 'what ink?'). <br />
<br />
He will give you a wanted poster. Take this to one of the Bank guards in Qeynos. They will give you a List of Qeynos' Most Wanted. <br />
<br />
Return this to Jinkus for Initiate Symbol of Justice, exp, and faction (+ShamenofJustice, +MerchantsOfHalas, -CircleOfUnseenHands, -CoalitionOfTradefolkIII, -EbonMask). <br />
<br />
2 Hunt some bears cubs in everfrost for the low, med and high quality skins and do the following quest:<br />
Chanda Miller (near fire at Shurefall Glade Tunnel in Quenoshills) makes bear hide armor. The better the piece, the more faction you need to get it. (you must give gold not any other currency)<br />
<br />
Bear Hide Belt - 5 GP and Low quality Bear pelt <br />
<br />
Bear Hide Boots - 15 GP and Medium quality <br />
bear pelt; <br />
<br />
Bear Hide Cape - 21 GP and High quality bear pelt. <br />
<br />
Buying one of the items also gives you the <br />
following faction adjustments: +KaranaResidents, +GuardsofQeynos, +PriestsofLife, +KnightsofThunder <br />
<br />
3 Now for rings and earrings, go to Queynos sewers and hunt the following mobs: <br />
<br />
An Injured Rat  and a undead knight. Both are static spawn and have placeholders. go to eq atlas and find them on the map... go there and kill both locations until they spawn and you get 2 rings and 2 earrings... carefull for the necro who spaws near by I have never seen him come to the camp but better safe than sorry<br />
<br />
4 After that I advise you hunt gnolls whenever you see them and do the gnoll fang quest in Quenos, it's lucrative and will allow you to buy some ringmail just shout for a smith who is selling it goes for about 1pp per ac, this is good armor and is also used in the Totemic armor quest that you might do someday. <br />
<br />
Gnoll Fang Quest: Captain Tillin located on the top floor of the arena in Qeynos. give unstacked fangs for some experience and a moonstone. Use your Moonstones for the Moonstone quest. (give to Mcneal Jocub in the Fish's Ale) Giving a gnoll tooth to Captain Tillin raises your faction with GuardsofQeynos and Antonius Bayle and Merchants of Qeynos, and lowers it with the <br />
Corrupt Qeynos Guards, Circle of Unseen Hands <br />
<br />
Finally, you can also look into the Bandit sash quest it is harder to do (cause they aggro like mad) but lucrative:<br />
Chesgard Sydwen, in the house of thunder, is willing to reward those who help eliminate the bandits in the Karanas. Bring him a bandit sash and he will give you xp, faction, some decent gold and an item (often bronze). You get the following faction changes: Knights of Thunder, Priests of Life and Guards of Qeynos go up and Bloodsabres goes down, The sashes are found on the bandits in W Karana. look at the map for eq atlast for loc of 3 camps...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, I have played my shaman from 1 to 20 something this way and enjoyed every minute of it! Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another suggestion would be to KILL ALL THE SPIDERS!!!<br />
<br />
Spiderling Silks and Spider Silks sell pretty well to players, about 40-60 pp and 75-95 pp per stack on my Server.<br />
<br />
Tons of spiders in Everfrost.<br />
<br />
Get several stacks and go to the bazaar!!!<br />
<br />
Once you sell silks, bargain hunt at bazaar!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was wearing a mix of patchwork, banded and blackened alloy into my 20s.  With the bazaar around now, you can probably get much better equipment than that if you really care.  However, the game was designed for people with equipment like you have now, so I wouldn't worry about it too much right now, unless you just enjoy the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gallaena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with Shabby, you can make a reasonable amount of cash on spider silks. Buy a large sewing kit (it can serve as a 8-slot container in a pinch), and do the combines on your spiderling silk and silk to make silk threads and silk swatches.<br />
<br />
2 spiderling silk = silk thread<br />
2 spider silks = silk swatch<br />
<br />
Stating the obvious, but don't undercut your prices too much in the bazaar, get a good feel for costs on your server and price your wares appropriately.<br />
<br />
You can also go into Permafrost and hunt there. There is a fantastic ZEM on the dungeon. In here, you can loot to sell in the bazaar permafrost crystals, unrefined ore, and the high quality ores.<br />
<br />
My experience is that Permafrost is usually empty. You can also pick up some good upgrades to your gear with the ringmail (or even rawhide) that drops there. You will also get runes, pages, and words which are used for spell research. You can sell these items, or create celestial essence to sell (using celestial solvent &amp; a mortar) found in Shadowhaven.<br />
<br />
Check out www.eqtraders.com for recipies. Learn about what components are used in what trades. You will get experience for killing the mobs that drop tradeskill components. Use that to your advantage.<br />
<br />
You can make the money you need to buy your equipment. Take advantage of the bazaar and all the cheap gear that is available to you.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EverNewbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hi I'm a newbie too. There are many things that you can do at low lvl's with your money. I'm a lvl 11 with fairly decent gear. Granted I had more money to spend on items but I'm sure I could have managed with only 100pp. Oh ya I had about 500 pp. I've gotten many things from the bazaar. My sugestion is do a bazaar search. The Port for the Nexus is in South Karana. Get directions there from eqatlas.com. After you get to the nexus find the entrence for the bazaar. After your in there is where the real fun begins. You then start using the bazaar function. Look for each slot one at a time. You can usually find decent items at low lvl for each slot from between 5-10pp a pop. That means 10-20 items for your character that most likely add's mods and decent ac. I got some items fairly cheap. Such as a eye earing thing(forgot the name) for 80pp I know that it's worth a bit more and could sell it If I didn't wanna use it. You will most likely get more near to 12 items or so for your 100pp. I figure that with the other mods and stuff instead of strait ac you will get more benifit for your dollar. Well thats coming from a fellow newbie so I dunno what you wanna do. Banded is always a safe bet though. Strait ac at low lvl ain't bad.  I am not taking into account server price difference but I'm sure its not that different on the lower lvl items. Oh ya on your way thru west karana you'll see like 1-3 guys standing in the middle of the road. There most likely going to be bandits. make sure you go around them its a MUST because they root and you could get in a real sticky situation if you die next to em. Well thats only my 2cp so I hope I helped a little.<br />
