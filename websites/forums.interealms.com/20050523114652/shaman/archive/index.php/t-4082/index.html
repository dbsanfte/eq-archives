<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Getting HUGE lag in outdoor zones, its really bad in DL, or when running accross BW while going to chardok.  Odd thing is that its noticably worse when I'm in a treeline, or surounded by tall grass.  I have minimal lag in any dungeon, and many outdoor zones are pretty lag free.  I have no issues anywhere in the old world and most of Luclin is now ok.<br />
<br />
In case anyone asks, yes I do have an athalon CPU.<br />
<br />
Is there any setting, or INI file line, I can add, modify, whatever, to disable the swaying trees, grass and other things that shouldn't be moving?  IMHO, the only things I wanna see movement in are my exp bar and female BPs ... not in that order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sentress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know the answer to your problem, but why would anyone ask if you have an Athlon CPU? I have an AMD Duron 850 with a GeForce 3, and the swaying trees does not present much lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What is your system configuration?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a PC that lets me run around in the Bazaar with  very little lag.  Don't have to touch a thing.  Nice.<br />
<br />
There are still some Kunark zones that slow me down with all the swaying trees and such.<br />
<br />
I don't know a way to turn off the movement; it would be very nice to explore Kunark's outdoor climes lag-free.   I'm running an Athlon XP 1800, 1 Gb memory, WinXP, and GeForce 4 4400 with 128Mb.  One would think that would be enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To answer Sentress' question:  There are a lot of issues, both graphics and sound, with EQ's performance on Athlon processors.  The EQ code is heavily optimized for Pentiums (Pentia?) and seems to present more work for an Athlon.   I understand the choice they made in doing this, but there are a lot of games out there that say &quot;Optimized for Pentium 4&quot; and don't cause my PC any problems at all.  <br />
<br />
In fact, it's Verant's tech support--mostly the fact that there doesn't seem to be any, only an automated &quot;Reinstall your drivers and Directx 8.1&quot; emailer--that is my one big sore point.  Many SoundBlaster Live users had to turn music off because it stuttered and hung.<br />
<br />
And now their comment that they quite frankly don't give a rodent's rear about customers' sound problems reinforces that.<br />
<br />
EQ is a wonderful game and they've done a hell of a job with it, but they need to visibly attempt to answer people's major concerns.  Getting the same damned email back EIGHT times doesn't show a very high level of customer service.  Not like I'm asking for Ragefire to be triggered, for crying out loud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sentress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I guess that's why my 3D sound in EQ seems so quiet. Something will run up to me and start mauling me, but I don't know it until I see the message that says I've been hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My config is:<br />
Athalon 1.2, 512MB 266 DDR ram, GEforce 2mx 200 32MB, SB live value, can't remember mainboard, I'll need to look that up when I get home.  Cable access, over 66% free space on a 30 GB 7200rpm HDD, windows 98 SE.  Will likely upgrade video to the radeon 8500 128 ddr soon.<br />
<br />
I saw a setting posted on this board (but can't find it anymore) in the ini file about some setting that disabled grass, or something like that.  There used to be some settign in the old UI for level of detail on trees, maybe its in the card options before the server select screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is one of my biggest pet peeves about their design decisions.<br />
They're so proud of their new graffics engine, yet in reality, it's<br />
so much worse then in the old world. So trees sway in the breeze<br />
now. Big deal. They say it's not the movement, it's the increased<br />
number of polygons used to render each tree, and the number<br />
of trees. Ok, then cut the number of trees in half!<br />
<br />
I've had to turn off my sound, cut down the clipping plane, turn<br />
off all spell effects, etc. This is supposed to be more emersive? <br />
Just the opposite. I've had to shut off the most emersive <br />
elements!<br />
<br />
They designed their new graffics engine so that only those with<br />
a top of the line, latest and greatest PC, with a dedicated T1<br />
line (or at least a cable modem) can appreciate it. The reast of<br />
us have to make compromises to be able to play at all, and still<br />
experience far more lag then in the old world. I wish we had the<br />
option of using the original graffics engine. The game was so<br />
much better then. <br />
<br />
I hope they realize this and put in less background stuff (like<br />
trees) in Planes Of Power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a command you can use in-game to turn off the grass and foliage, but it doesn't change anything about the trees (a shame).  Anyway, when you're in the game just type /help and there are several options for help like /help chat etc. Pick the normal help and it will give you the command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;...new graffics engine so that only those with <br />

<br />
99% of the time your bandwidth doesn't have diddly doo to do with your framerate.  <br />
<br />
I have no trouble with the rest of that sentence.  One of the things I find most impressive about EQ is that my wife and I share 56k modem connection, and only suffer a noticable slowdown when we both simultaneously zone.  Quite remarkable if you think about it.</div></div><hr />
