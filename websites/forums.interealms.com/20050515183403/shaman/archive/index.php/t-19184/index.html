<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, since my first post about some parses for slow resists between beastlords and shamans, the main idea resulting was to get some shaman parsing around 100 slows  on themselves with an exact 150 RM <br />
<br />
If you have some numbers to post, please do it.<br />
If you are willing to do it, you are most than welcome.<br />
<br />
I will edit this thread in order to keep the total slows results at the top of this thread.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: <br />
Please don't call for a NERF or FIX of beastlords, whatever is the result of those parses. ( They did parses, no need to backstabb them ).<br />
<br />
Currently, over 600 casts, for Shaman slow: <br />
Success: 73 ( 12.10% ) <br />
Resists: 527 ( 87.90% ) <br />
<br />
Currently, over 321 casts, for Beastlord slow: <br />
Success: 44 ( 13.70% ) <br />
Resists: 277 ( 86.30% ) <br />
<br />
Many thanks to: Piglet, FVDladian, Cassdouf, Murkk Dakruul, Lefusgar and Murtak for the help.</div></div><hr />

I tried bumping it to 150, but just had no luck... figured it'd help a little bit. Note to self: Higher MR... heh</div></div><hr />

all we ever hear from several of the other class boards are complaints about us.. monks, I'm looking in your general direction!  So, when a shaman shows up asking us to parse our slows because a rumor says we have an easier time slowing than other classes, I think it's pretty clear why we'd be defensive about it :)  If there is conclusive evidence one way or another I think it's pretty clear people would either be asking for changes to their spells or calling for a beastlord nerf.<br />
<br />
I can't ask you to post on our boards saying you hope to debunk this rumor, as the point of a scientific study is that you don't go into it looking for a certain result.  Just try to realize that if our places were reversed you probably would not be very amenable to it ;)</div></div><hr />

It seemed pretty streaky, I had 3 slows land in a row on 2 different occasions.<br />

I'll go again when it's not 5AM.<br />

P.S.<br />
You should post this at http://www.beastlords.org/forums/, since that is the official site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have both a 65 shaman and 65 beastlord.  Without having official parses, I did notice that in the same areas, the shaman slow has consistantly landed easier to me than the beastlords.  This was noticed especially in BoT when the shaman that I use to PL my beastlord got killed quickly by a train, and I had to use the beastlord to try to slow.  After five attempts on two different mobs I gave up.  The shaman slowed the same types of mobs with a success rate without malos about 70% of the time.  I tried this again and I noticed the same thing.  There was no chanter in the group and no bard either.  The only way of debuffing was with the shaman casting malos (I'm adding that I used the shaman as the main tank, in a full group, so my first cast was always slow till it stuck and then malos, and then bane and BoS to keep agro).  <br />
<br />
Like i said, nothing conclusive, but I don't believe any of that bull**** about beastlords having an easier time landing slow.</div></div><hr />

Give us paragon and we'll probably stop with the bst slow recurent arguments. you have a spell you shouldn't have - don't complain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And who says we shouldn't have it?, you?. Well guess what we disagree with you, and obviously SoE does too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ahahhaha beastlords only have one thing to complain about - other people complaining about them.<br />
<br />
Just face it, you are overpowered as hell. Not only can you buff equally as well as a shaman can on single targets (yes I know you can't MGB or raid buff, but thats what shamanbots are for) or groups, but you also bring 3 to 4 times more DPS than a shaman, a Clarity II that stacks with everything plus a regen component, a &quot;avatar&quot; buff that is better than avatar by FAR, easiest epic in the game, and of course the single best raid or group-saving ability in the game, paragon of spirit. There is nothing that compares to paragon, period. Nothing else is MGBable and restores over 600 mana to a raid. Nothing. Paragon is an insanely overpowered raid/group saver even without the HP regeneration aspect.<br />
<br />
Oh they also get pets three times better than ours. And they Nuke better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There may be some selection bias - people who run the experiment and don't like their results (due to fearing some sort of nerf) might not post them.<br />
<br />
But, that seeming unlikely, with what confidence can we say that the likelihood of landing slow for beastlord and shaman is the same?  (which seems to be the reasonable assumption by default, given the spell data available on lucy.)<br />
<br />
I've never done any serious statistics, so let's just say that the true p_shaman=.118<br />
<br />
Now, let's get the sample variance S^2 for the beastlord data, 44 1s and 277 0s (N=321) (the mean is .137).  S^2 = (1/320)*(44*(1-.137)^2 + 277*(0-.137)^2) = .1187<br />
<br />
From that we compute the t-statistic, t=(.137-.118)/sqrt(S^2/321)=.988 which corresponds to less than a 90% chance that there is in fact a difference in the true rates for landing shaman and beastlord slow - in other words, not very impressive, run this experiment again 10 times and you'd get this result by chance once even if they were the same<br />
<br />
Or, go to http://home.clara.net/sisa/t-thlp.htm which indicates that  with 95% confidence, the difference lies between 7% in favor of beastlords to 3% in favor fo shamans (i.e. it could be that shaman slows land more often than BL, it just hasn't happened in this small data set)<br />
<br />
Or, using 38 successes out of 321 for shamans (by the percentage) and 44 (by observation for the beastlords), with 95% confidence the difference in a run of 321 slows should be between 24 more landed for the BL and 12 more for the shaman (if I'm not wrong in guessing that this sort of repeated bernoulli trial approaches a poisson distribution in the limit?)<br />
<br />
That's just a long way of saying that the data so far is inconclusive =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Murkk Dakruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I won't be doing anymore testing. I'm not going to trust people like pennyantics to do anything with this info besides bitch about it.<br />
<br />
Do you want your class fixed or do you want to whine and complain?. I think its obvious which you prefer. Grats on being able to list the things a guild might want a beastlord for.<br />
<br />
Goodluck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sorry to see that some of my community turned this way Murkk.<br />
But well, even if parses give beasts a slightly higher success rate, there is nothing to be mad at.<br />
So, maybe it is the result of the spell lvl ( 65 vs 51 ).<br />
If  you still want to add parses, you can, but if you don't want, it seems  that the rumor wasn't really justified.<br />
Thank you everybody for helping me gathering parses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have seen it in more times then I care to count now, when, for example in BoT, Gaukr is debuffed by me with Malos and then followed by Malosinia, has also chanter Tash on, and not a single slow of mine lands. Then BST casts his/her slow, and blam, lands, right away. I don't mean here the BST epic proc or whatever, but the spell itself. Yes, when looking from Lucy, both have resist check of 0, but beats me why this doesn't &quot;feel&quot; like this.<br />
<br />
This has happened on ALL slowable BoT nameds, and on numerous other slowable mobs everywhere. After full debuffs, that's from me, chanter and bard, I at times have to cast slow few times before it sticks, and BST just waves his/her hands or paws or whatever, once, and blam! Slow landed. I personally do not ask BST slow be &quot;nerfed&quot;, as some BST's are afraid, but simply to find out the REAL cause behind this. So far, over a long time (basically from the moment BST's got to my level and started to cast their slows on the same mobs as I do), very very very often, shaman slows have a hard time sticking on the mob and BST slows just land. It's even more peculiar, when BST casts the slow on incoming, not debuffed mob, and lands it right away, and I have to debuff the resists on the mobs before my slow lands, without debuff I can blow whole mana bar on the spell and it never lands.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is related to the fact that our slow, the &quot;last&quot; one we're using, is lvl 51 spell, while BST's have lvl 60+ slow spell. Maybe it's because that, I don't know. I am glad that BST's can slow like this, but I do feel that shamans, as primary slowers, shouldn't have such a hard time with their primary spell, basically, when their hybrid offspring can do it more effortlessly.</div></div><hr />
