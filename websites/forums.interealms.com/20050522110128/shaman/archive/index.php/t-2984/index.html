<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Normally my Shaman goes with the bald look with white beard. However, when I lose bearform all of a sudden I have brown hair in a ponytail. Whats that all about???<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;Tired of having to reconfigure this everytime&gt;&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, when bearform leaves, our hair/helmet isn't always what it should be.<br />
<br />
Usually, I just lose my helm graphics.  Sometimes, I loose my hair, too, and sometimes, it's just.. odd.<br />
<br />
Every now and then, I'm nekkid.<br />
<br />
Adding/removing items fixes it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hope they *never* fix this &quot;bug&quot;. Whenever I enter a zone, bear form, unbearform, to get rid of my silly silly hat.  It's a feature, I tell you!</div></div><hr />

That's the hidden aging hippie in you coming out, don't worry about it, just get in your Lexus and go to work and the baldness and white hair will return.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was messing with people in fungus grove today. Removed all my visible armor, epic, and shield... and equipped my giant's broom (crappy 2hb) and went bearform. Then I put it all back on and dropped bearform, and, Viola, fully equipped but looking nakd with a broom. people got a kick out of it :)<br />
<br />
For iksars you can use this trick to look like you have a robe on. Equip a shade silk robe (all all, looks like a shroud of longevity) and go bearform. then put your normal chestpiece on and drop bear form. presto, Robed Eeeksar! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I’ve noticed this over a few months period time. On occasions I can’t see myself using my Weapon or Bashing, though I’m dealing out damage. My 1st person view just shows the MOB hitting. <br />
<br />
If I go to 3rd person I can see myself. Been doing this for a while, but its so intermittent I don’t worry about it.</div></div><hr />
