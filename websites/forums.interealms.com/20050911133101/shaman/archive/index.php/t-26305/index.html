<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was told the mobs past lavastorm were for lvl 39 char, but they were dark blue to my 59 bard and my lvl 64 shammy.  A lvl 70 ranger came to IZ dead when I zoned in and was geting a rez.  I have been gone from EQ for the last 4 to 6 mths.  I don't know what all is different with these newer mobs but if you could give me any info on things to stay away from or selo speed mobs before I continue through the zone I would be most greatful.  <br />
<br />
Also I hear something about factions that I need to choose with the newest expansion.  Im not sure what to make of any of that info.  I think certain mobs will give you certain factions but I havent been told what to choose or what mobs not to kill.<br />
<br />
Also what the heck happened to the dang bazaar while I have bee gone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Factions are pretty simple, good or bad, but in both you do basically the same things but for different reasons.  Swear if they just sat and talked to each other instead of yelling and screaming and lableing each other they would enjoy a good draft together.<br />

Except that stupid Grimblax one. The Good version has the mob spawned on zone-in, and pullable to ZI easy. The Evil version makes you kill a set number to spawn him, then you have to kill guards after you kill the named. Sometimes I just dont get why they do certain things. Do they NOT take &quot;bards can pull this to zone&quot; into account when they tune events like this?</div></div><hr />

Pulling mobs away from other mobs is an exploit? Or was their something fishier going on?</div></div><hr />

there were no see-invis mobs in the zone so a bard could aggro Gimblax and drag him all the way to zonein. Had missions that lasted about 3 minutes because of that and it was clearly not intended.<br />
<br />
They then added alot of see-invis mobs and I think Gimblax is also tethered some. He may warp back to his spawn point when he has no aggro too. Not sure about the details, we just fight our way through now, exp is decent. <br />
He has also been buffed quite a bit with last patch, bringing a war or at least a knight and good healing is recommended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">level 39 sounds too low for anything beyound Lavastorm. 50+ would be my guess but many casters healers even in Broodlands.<br />
<br />
I choose my faction by which kind of people were on the most during my playtime. Makes getting missions together so much easier. The initial factioning was a bit exessive but all soloable and no issue compared to some Velious/Luclin factioning. Took me about 30 taks/missions to get indifferent with good camp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done nearly the same on quite a few Gimplax misisons...bypassing all the see invis. Usually we'd just pull and kill the few see invis otw to named though because even then you'd still be done so fast that you'd have to wait to get the mission again anyway.<br />
<br />
Still though, creative pulling on a bard's part isn't really exploiting in my opinion. It's kind of the whole point of pulling. Exploit, no. Bad dungeon design, yes.</div></div><hr />

They didn't hack the game, they just used &quot;creative pulling&quot;, so it was okay, right?  It's obviously the fault of designers for not anticipating that horses would fall through walls, dots, paci, snare, and CotH would all interact that way, right?<br />
<br />
The ability of one class to pull Gimblax to zone solo through a fully-spawned dungeon was not the design of the mission.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From your example, the best I can tell is (from the horse falling through walls part, although I'm not sure how that fits into pulling) that it sounds like you guys were consistantly recreating a bug in order to pull mobs, while in the Gimblax mission, no actual exploit was used...it was standard mob behavior.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the devs didn't intend for him to be single pulled out of the entire dungeon, but there was no cheating involved. It was poorly thought out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It was done the same way I used to pull Tormax in Kael to the zone. Invis and hall ass up, tag and invis, then hall ass to the zoneline.<br />
<br />
It wasn't cheating or anything, it was the players out thinking the designers and using their own game mechanics against them. Working as intended, just in an unexpected fashion. Once the learned of players doing it this way, they modified it to where they actually wanted it to be.<br />

If they were pulling nameds to the zone in they were using exploits. Its not called &quot;creative pulling&quot;, its called &quot;cheating&quot;.</div></div><hr />
