<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ryutono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before you post another event PLEASE PLEASE go back an delete your old out of date ones, cause if you dont an i finally figure out how to use my moderating rights they are history :)<br />
<br />
ALSO when posting a event, lets kinda keep the subject titles short an too point ie (Velks 00/00/00-0:00pm) then in message  peeps can read the cutsey wootsey stuff an important stuff<br />
<br />
the events board is very important an the area of much confusion   i know  with some of the old ones an new ones  i sometimes have hard time even figuring out whats goin on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We peons can't delete posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ryutono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ummm im not positive but im sure you can EDIT your own post an by doing this you can choose to delete YOUR OWN POST an if started the thread there by deleting it ...  ive did it on couple of mine  i know after thier importance had past</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, we can edit our posts.  Yes, there is the option to delete a post.  No, we don't have permission to delete posts.  I just tried :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ditto.  Can't delete a post once there's been a response to it.  (Not that that's a bad thing, unless you can set board-specific policies.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ryutono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ahhh okies well in thatcase  HEAR YE HEAR YE  .......<br />
<br />
Ryutono (thunderfoot/toe stommper) will be deleting OLD event hunts   ie ya know the hunt planned in january of LAST year :)<br />
<br />
this is btw hinged on the assumption i can figure out how to do it :) <br />
just tryin to do my little part as an officer im perty much a failure at outside guild relations  so ill stick to internal affairs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cutesy...<br />
<br />
Wutesey....<br />
<br />
<br />
Must be a technical term.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're not a failure at affairs outside the guild, Ryu: its a perception thing.  People don't realize that when you call em an @$$hole, you mean it in a positive way :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">actually I like when people write out the month, day of the week on title of the topic. easier to read than a bunch of number.<br />
<br />
For example: Thursday, June 7 at 11:30 am EST than something like 6/7/00-11:30  (i think some countries have the number of day first so it could be 7/6/00-11:30)<br />
<br />
but that just me tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Truant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes sin you are right...International date methods are<br />
date/month/year<br />
<br />
us bassakward american goofs do it month/day/year for some unknown bizarre reason.<br />
<br />
Probably the same reason they won't switch to the friggin metric system!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I will be going through this forum probably tonight, and deleting all the old posts. :)</div></div><hr />
