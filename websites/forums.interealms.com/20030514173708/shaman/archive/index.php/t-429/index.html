<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Squints</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or is the info for the Cannibalize 2 Quest inaccurate in Eq Shamans?  I did most of it and found out later that it was wrong.  I was on some island in Timourous for nothing searching for something that did not exists.  That really sucked :) But I did find the right info, just was wondering if anyone else had this problem.<br />
<br />
Also I was wondering if its really worth doing.. seems like you have to do alot for a spell that isnt really HP to Mana efficent.  But it would be nice to get that little extra mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jallail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Crushed Dread Diamond is a ground spawn on Golra isle. Or at least it was... got mine there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe it's on an 8 hour respawn, however, so someone may have just picked it up less than 8 hours before your visit.  It's plainly obvious as a bag sitting on the snow if it's there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye.  Done it twice.  It still spawns on Gorla Island.  Just a LONG respawn.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I went to get mine, there were several sitting on the ground.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there are 2 ways to get the diamond...trust me, the gorla island is better than the kaesora piece and praying alchemy check is success</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Squints</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok thanks for the info, atleast now I know whats up with this bag.  I was there for a long time.. guess I needed to wait longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information.  I was unaware of the 8 hour re-spawn also.  Spent about 3 hours there on GOlra Island, including a half hour with a guide after a polite petition.  The spawn had been seen that morning, but someone obviously must have picked it up before I made it there. :(<br />
<br />
Looks like I'll have canni3 in my book before canni2 at this rate...<br />
Have the clay only.<br />
<br />
Still need to get over to TT for the powder too. :P<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't forget, Frekkels, you need the BLACK powder, not the WHITE powder.  (it makes a difference, trust me!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got my crushed dread diamond the hard way, I guess. Got the junk from Kaesora and had guildmate charm the guy in Dreadlands. Fortunately, the crushing part wasnt a problem. Wish I had known about the ground spawn one, but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tirais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm a 35 Shammy wondering if Can II is worth the quest. Any feedback will be greatly appriciated. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>dfarls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes get it by 40 if you can it really helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Glori,<br />
<br />
Yes, I know.  But thanks for the reminder. :)<br />
<br />
I carried around some black shaman powder for a very long time, thinking I had the right stuff.  Inspected it w/ a mask that clicks identify (a very wise purchase on my part) that showed it to actually be &quot;Powder of Nok&quot; or some such, definitely not the stuff I wanted for McMerin's Feast. :(  (The Nok powder was picked up in FV, not TT)<br />
<br />
I still think I'll be scribing Canni3 before Canni2 at the rate I'm going.  Not due to difficulty...more a case of priorities.<br />
Canni1 has a better ratio, and exp/epic/5th shawl  all hold more interest for me at the moment.  Probably doesn't help my sense of urgency that I already have Canni3 waiting to be scribed... ;)<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

I didn't get Cann2 completed until 50... and then found it was at it's best at 51 (with regrowth).  All I can say is I am glad I got it.  It has been a lifesaver more than once in several groups.<br />
<br />
With it, have started taking some of the advice of the elder brethren here, and started dropping some wis gear in favor of AC.  What a survival difference.<br />
<br />
And the best part is, it is MQ'able.  So if you have guildies/friends hunting in the right zones, just have them pick up the parts.   Even the no drop parts.  Good luck to you.  This quest is entirely too hard for the level of the spell.<br />
<br />
And this was with both Cann3 and Cann4 sitting in the bank.  Cann does have a better ratio, but the cast/delay time, for lesser mana regen, does make a difference.</div></div><hr />
