<br />
I've been reading the posts, and haven't seen anyone put out this combo.  I've tried the camp in echo (4 rogues and the 2 archers) but with the warrior I mow through them quick enough to where I end up with a lot of down time.  I've tried the caves in jaggedpine, but after two hours of non-stop killing, I was left with about 8% per hour on each toon.  Is that about the max amount of exp I should expect for 2 toons per hour? Or is there better to be had elsewhere?<br />
<br />
I did a lot of leveling up in the harbor of LoY, and the exp there seemed to be good and safe.  Is that my best option for exp? A lot of places are out of the question for me since I have no way to do crowd control (cazic comes to mind).<br />
<br />
Here are the two toon's magelos:<br />

Thanks a ton!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Svaboda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know this is not really an answer just curious what you hunted in the harbour I am a 53 Shm and usually play when I can't get a group with my warrior.  Was curious, I am currently doing the DL crawl and exp is horrid there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Axtell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty much any of the first 3 boats...the other 2 were a bit tougher (and the exp didn't seem to offset the increased difficulty).  If I wanted more of a challenge I'd find a corner unoccupied by mobs and pull to there, but the boats are a nice stream of exp.</div></div><hr />
