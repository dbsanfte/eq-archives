<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am upgrading my system slightly. I have a crappy hard drive (5400 rpm) and a GeForce 3 64meg card. <br />
<br />
Please provide any comments if you can shed some light for me :-)  IE: is this not a good vid card to get (I can't afford the expensive ones).<br />
<br />
Here's what I am upgrading to:<br />
<br />
video card:<br />

<br />
hard drive<br />

<br />
CD-rom/cd-burner/dvd player (combo)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the video card is nice, you should be able to run EQ perfectly fine on it, just be sure to read up on SOE's community forums about problems with specific model video cards.<br />
<br />
The HDD is pretty average, should suit your needs just fine (a 7200 HDD will reduce loading/zoning times), personally I prefer alot of storage space, because I do alot of graphics and media work in the times I'm not at work and not on EQ. 200+ GB would be my preference, but they are obviously more expensive.<br />
<br />
CDRW/DVD combo drive, just like the HDD, pretty standard stuff, though your CD drive will have no bearing on the performance of your system for EQ. I'd prefer a DVD+R/CDRW drive, but again they are more expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how much RAM do you have? If it's 512 or less I would look into upgrading that before the HDD. Performance wise I think you would get more out of another 512 RAM rather then getting a new HDD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">very true, but they were asking about specific parts, RAM is usually the first thing people upgrade, but if you really want overall system improvement, upgrade motherboard/CPU package..lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RAM isn't a problem luckily... I run with 640 megs.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your feedback... I always get a little worried about buying new hardware since things always become obsolete... usually a week after I buy it :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">like 640 megs of ram</div></div><hr />
