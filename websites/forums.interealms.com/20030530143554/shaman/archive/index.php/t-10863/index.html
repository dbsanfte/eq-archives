<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At this point, I have SCR 1, Mental Clarity 3, Canni 5, MGB, Quickbuff 1, Radiant Cure 1.<br />
<br />
What would your advice be for my next 2 to 3 AA skills?<br />
<br />
Should I go for ND first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SCR2, SCR3, SCRM, Quick Buff 2, Spirit Call . . . take your pick from those.  I went for SCR2/3 and then SCRM before I did Quick Buff 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hardiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SCR2, SCR3, SCRM, QB2.  That's definately the recommended path.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would argue, Hardiman, that there is no &quot;recommended path&quot; beyond Run3, Regen 3, MC3, Canni5.  :)<br />
<br />
My 2 most valuable sets  of AA (after the mandatory cann5 route) are the quickbuff line and the spell casting mastery line.<br />
<br />
I would say go SCM 1, 2, 3 - then quickbuff, then SCR/ND/whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">combat agility is also good so you don't die as often on raids :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally I went mgb after cann v and don't regret it at all. I was for along time the only shaman we had with it and the first shaman to get focus of 7th. MGB all buffs at the start of a raid is nice.<br />
<br />
SCRM is definitely nice, SCM is great for mana savings everywhere. Quickbuff is nice altho i personally recommend stopping at 2 and lettings buffs/focus cover the rest. ND always helps too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">all the ones listed are good but dont underestimate SCM and CA.  both i am very intersted in..... i think i can gonna do the silly way and train lvl 1 in everything just because i am lazy like that.<br />
<br />
things i like thelook of are, QB, SCM, SCR, CA.  would like to see all those go up sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My path so far was canni5,  Spirit Call 1, NTCM1, SCM1, and now I've decided to bite the bullet and save up for MGB.<br />
<br />
After that, RC1-2, SCM3, SCR/M, QB2 (definately not QB3, 9 points is way too much for way too little benefit, with the focus effects and cleric buffs that are available now), ND3, CA3...then it's kind of open. Maybe lightning reflexes, more spirit call...and of course, more NTCM as I build tradeskills.</div></div><hr />
