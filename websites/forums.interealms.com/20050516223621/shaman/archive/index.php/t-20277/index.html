<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Between the introduction of the Berzerker epic and the half-azz patch today, we are seeing quite clearly the problem with SOE.<br />
<br />
Back when Verant ran the EQ show, items had limited effects, damage was low, speed was high, and you were lucky to see one stat improved let alone ALL of them. Kedge or Hate were the scariest places.<br />
<br />
Then Kunark came out. Ten new levels to master. Items saw little change for the most part. yes, they became more desirable, those Wurmslayers and Yaks were the sh...well you get the point. Classes were given other abilities to make them overall more useful like the Rogue and Shaman (tugurs/topror). Veeshans Peak was the scariest place conceivable. <br />
<br />
As the playerbase aged and maxed out the level cap, Velious became necessary to appease those who were bored with Seb and HS and Velious was good. Well implemented and balanced for level 35+. Plenty of raid level content and only moderate item scope creep. But the seeds of evil and destruction had been sown.<br />
<br />
The talent started to balk at the gigantic corporate structure that started to notice the revenue that this little bit of entertainment was generating for Daddy.<br />
<br />
Bean counters started making policy. Talent left, and the true Vision(tm) as convoluted as it was, left with them.<br />
<br />
Then came Luclin. While it may have had some small merit in the keying tiers to some of its zones and a general nice overall boost to xp granted, it single handedly killed EQ. UBAR became required. This is where EQ stopped being a MMORPG and became truly victim to blatant Scope Overrun. I wont ever forget the first time I saw some of the Vex Thal gear, how while it was cool for the people that took the time to get it, really blew balance out of the water. Coupled with the relative ease of travel for all classes with the spire ports, the game couldn't ever hope to retain its original Vision(tm). Oh and then there was the introduction of the Beastlord, and the 3 days it took to get one to 60th level, and the whopping 2 weeks it took for them to find their overly strong, non planar required epic.<br />
<br />
Then Planes came, and it had its merits , but mostly contributed to everything wrong with Luclin. Books made travel trivial. I remember running from Qeynos to Freeport to catch the 20 minute boat ride to Butcherblock to run to Mistmoore to get quest pieces for whatever quest it was I was working on at the time. SOE has made sure that the world of EQ is now gone. EQ is now ever only 5 zones large from any port point or book. Gone are the days where one would have to contend with encounters on the way to where they wanted to be. To me this marks the loss of one of the most important elements of any RPG. Items were once again blown out of statistical proportion with their old world counterparts simply to drive sales of the expansion. <br />
<br />
Then far to rapidly, so rapidly in fact I can't honestly remember which came first, Yekesa and Lost Dungeons. More scope overrun. But I must say that at least Lost Dungeons had the right idea. To make content for smaller groups or raids. To make it time based so that one could spend an evening after work doing one run and be happy with the progress that was made, and most importantly at ANY level. Well done there SOE I give you much credit for this.<br />
<br />
now<br />
<br />
What the hell happened with Gates? Did you loose all the LDON talent too? It was fubared from the get go. I can understand the need to feed the ravenous lvl65 200+AA raid set, but at what cost? Then for it to be so shabbily done that it requires the patches we have seen in the last month, and then to pat yourselves on the back for fixing GRAMMAR problems? And to do so while ignoring so many other payers ~er~ players requests to fix the playability of the game? Scope Overrun is as rampant as ever, the &quot;story&quot; of EQ has gone to the dogs, and the classes are still not balanced. <br />
<br />
Here is a clue SOE the classes can never be balanced until content for all of them is. This means you have set yourselves on a path that does not allow you to do what it is that you must do. Balance the game. Content is king and the coronation is done with balance.<br />
<br />
Until you can look at this game with gamers eyes, and understand all I have said EQ will always head down this wrong path.  <br />
<br />
meanwhile, all the talent you once had is drifting away and coalescing at Sigil.<br />
<br />
SOE, EQ meet your match.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EQ has met it's &quot;match&quot; numerous times, and kicked each of their collective asses.<br />
<br />
Sigil does have the right idea, though. I'd reckon WoW will be a somewhat strong blow to EQ, and Vanguard will come along a while after and draw the real old school EQers from EQ, leaving the majority of the idiots behind (and there are plenty to go around).<br />
<br />
BTW, Velious is the win. Much love for the Kodiak caves :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank god. Travel almost made me quit the game at one point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SOE is interested in making money.  That is why the game is in the &lt;insert expletive here&gt; shape it is in.  People want ubah items, and that is what SOE is giving them.  Granted, not just anybody can get the best ones, but any nimrod can buy ornate armor.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make a big difference to me, I still like hanging out in the abandoned dungeons that the wannabie left for PoP XP and loots.  My group of friends are interested in having fun and playing this game like....well, like it's a game.  I know what I can and cannot get, so I concentrate on getting that stuff and explore what I can while EQ still holds my interest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It still holds mine as well. at least until Vanguard. <br />
<br />
Garf you are correct about the other games that we supposed to be EQ killers, but weren't. I think that Vanguard has something that EQ lost..mostly it's creators =).<br />
<br />
You make me sad Gloriana, while I too like the idea of not having to beg ports from Druids and Wizards all the time, I still think the game was better served with having travel as a intergral part of it.  when was the last time anyone had to worry whether or not a HG would beat them down on the way to qeynos? or if it was night in Kith?<br />
<br />
I miss these things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not me, I'm a working adult with a limited time to play. Spending 2/3 of my online time running to a location or waiting for other people to run to a location made me miserably unhappy.<br />
<br />
I loathed the boats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well the boats WERE a little much. I too am a working adult... going on hour 10 here today as a matter of fact. <br />
<br />
i think trivial travel takes away from the feel of the world. I also think that along with the gross scope overrun on item stats are the major reasons eq isn't as much fun as it used to be, not that it isn't still fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me too.  I will never again play any game that makes travel such a horrible pain.  I don't care how pretty it is or who made it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is no Vision of any sort, disabuse yourself of that notion right now.  There is no-one sitting around reviewing proposed upgrades for 'balance'.  Ideas are not rejected because they don't &quot;fit&quot; the game.<br />
<br />
Here's how it works:  They give a little to the classes that cry the loudest.  They give nothing to the classes that behave.  And if they get any REALLY good suggestions for improvements to a class, they take them and create a new class with that information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey shaman, thanks for your ideas on what we could to to improve your class!  We took them and made Beastlords, isn't that great?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey pure melees, thanks for all your input on how we could add some depth to your respective classes with discs that affect your groupmates!  Check out this cool Berserker class we made!  No idea what it's for, but isn't it cool!?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Vision is dead.  All there is now is inertia and profiteering.  In AD&amp;D the term was &quot;Monty Haul&quot;, when the DM had no ideas or imagination or storytelling ability at all, and just threw phat lewtz at the players until they shut up.  That **** got old when I was 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">~Bing~ Flufy wins the Cupie doll!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&lt;kaff kaff&gt; ah yea, back in the old days we didn't have these newfangled books and weapons that buffed STA and AGI and WIS all at the same time.  Nosirree, we used our SOW and boats and were damn happy when we didn't catch aggro or drown in the middle of the ocean!  Don't know what the world is coming to these days, I tell ya.  Judgement day can't be far, with the way everything is going to hell, just you wait and see.<br />
&lt;mumble&gt;<br />
<br />
/ooc perhaps the deleterious changes you note are merely a matter of perspective.  The game you remember playing doesn't exist any more.  EQ starts at 50, or maybe even 60.  Everything before that is an extended tutorial now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I remember running from Qeynos to Freeport to catch the 20 minute boat ride to Butcherblock to run to Mistmoore to get quest pieces for whatever quest it was I was working on at the time. <br />
<br />
Heh, remember *before* they added the second ship?  Just barely missing the boat and having to wait for it to make a whole round trip used to get much wailing and gnashing of teeth from me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Weisblau, you are right. the game I got addicted to doesn't exsist anymore. And I feel I have a good reason to lament that fact.<br />
<br />
EQ is still a great game, the fact that according to most it doesn't &quot;start&quot; until 50 or 60 is sad. There is much good content for just about all levels. I am depressed that the game has degenerated, and yes it has, into the masive loot grab it has become only to cater to the lowest common denominator of its player base...greed.<br />
<br />
That is why I think Sigil has the right idea as does Flufy and Garf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>OldOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It still holds mine as well. at least until Vanguard. <br />

<br />

<br />
No one is forcing you to use the books and such.  Run if you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I do run. But when I say &quot;hey let's go beat up on the Ogres in lake Rathtear for a while&quot;, or &quot;let's run through Dalnir for the heck of it&quot; I get responses like, &quot;where is that?&quot; or &quot;how do I get there?&quot; or &quot;what's there?&quot; <br />
<br />
To me that's sad, EQ is HUGE and filled with overlooked content by players. I don't understand why it's so bad to miss these things. it USED to be a role playing game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">From my point of view SOE does balancing now using numbers.  Purely looking at ratios of HP gained to mana used for heals, HP lost to mana used for DDs, etc.  This is the only way I can wrap my brainmeats around some of the recent decisions (most of all the BoTr change).<br />
<br />
What I would like to see (and yes I mean see/reported/blogged) would be every member of SOE that makes game decisions play the game.  I want them to level up a shaman from level 1.  I want them to group at level 20 after Paludal.  I want them to LFG at level 50 with a mage.  I want them to solo.  I want them to group.  I want them to raid.  No /testbuffing, no twinking, just playing as the game is intended to be played.<br />
<br />
Come on SOE, roll out the all-star roster of your staff players.  Let's see the classes, levels and playtime found at SOE.</div></div><hr />
