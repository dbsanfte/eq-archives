<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galerian</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I've looked and searched for this thing for a few days now and can't seem to find it anywhere (if it actually existed and wasn't a product of my imagination!). I seem to recall awhile back someone had created a list of places to solo hunt for various levels althe way up to 60, with a lot of other folks adding other things to it to give it an almost comprehensive list of all the possible places to solo for each level. <br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the right direction to where it is? Or post a link to it for me? Thanks for any help, trying to help a friend who's recently started a ranger with some info.</div></div><hr />
