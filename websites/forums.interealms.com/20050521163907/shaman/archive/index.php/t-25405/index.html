<br />
Last night I was group with a 22 ranger, 21 Berserker, 22 Mage and 21 Wizard. We head to VS and found a blue group double up cones Rat Queen with 3 large rats. I have been doing orange double cone mobs with just me healing without problem so we decided to kill it.<br />
<br />
Warded (adept3 spectral) the Berserker before he pulled. The sec he pulled, ward faded and his hp dropped to 50%, so I quickly re-ward and heal. The 3 rats immediately jumped on me, I macro'd &quot;Help! %t is attacking me!&quot;, warded myself, healed myself, more wards and heals and 3x &quot;/g Help healer!&quot;. I lasted a full minute before my power ran out and died.<br />
<br />
Group was wiped. I asked the tank what happened and he said: Dude! I was out of power to taunt them off you!&quot; I was like ??????????????????? you were out of power right from the start when the 3 rats kept beating on me for almost a full minute??????? I could have sworn his power bar was 100% full.<br />
<br />
I said if something like that happens again I am out...the tank went LD and never come back for the entire night.<br />
<br />
I know things like this are inevitable in mmorpg games. I just want to get it off my chest since I wasn't too happy about that.</div></div><hr />

And don't forget to hand out cabbages before you start a &quot;hard fight&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rat Queen is NOT a trivial fight under any circumstances.  That fight is an undercon.  Its a lot harder than you expect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not only is she tough, she also has an AE Power drain. Best to burn her down fast, and have your tank use their power drain attacks on her. If someone can stun, then stun her too.<br />
<br />
Mostly just blow as much power into killing her as possible early on, as you'll be out soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If she has a power drain, that would definitely explain why your tank lost their power so fast. Maybe you jumped the gun a little with your tank?<br />
