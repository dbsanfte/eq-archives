Anyway, how can I disable the 'Order Omens' screen that pops up? It is really getting on my nerves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also thought it was stupid how, back when they first announced Omens release, they switched the spots of &quot;Order Omens&quot; and &quot;Skip&quot;.<br />
<br />
Still can't believe they were gonna release it without GoD retune, but maybe they figured if they got Omens out, people could get to 70 and tackle GoD... IF they were willing to shell out an additional 30 bucks in order to access an expansion they already paid 20-30 bucks for.<br />
<br />
It's a conspiracy, man!</div></div><hr />

its called guerilla tactics.</div></div><hr />

Its because EQ players are crazy.  We all complain about the game, and how much SOE sucks, and how sick we are of it all...but we still log in.  <br />
<br />
If they badger us enough, eventually some will cave in, if only to get the pop up to stop. (more money than sense sometimes)</div></div><hr />
