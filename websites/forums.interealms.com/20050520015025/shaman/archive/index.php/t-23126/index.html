<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if people find it easier to two box on one machine using Eqwindows or using two machines.  I have a P4 3.0 @ 3.6 with a Gig of ram and a ATI 9800XT and for a second box use an AMD 2500 @ 2.1 also with a gig of ram and msi 9800pro @ XT speeds.  The problem I have is that two keyboards take up alot of room and are just plain hard to watch both characters.  I also feel like I lose alot of dps on the character that is playing 2nd box.  With Eq windows it sounds like you have both characters on one screen and just use the one mouse and keyboard.  This sounds like a much easier way to control both boxes to me.  My question I guess would be how are others two boxing and what have you found to be easier one PC or two?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have the ability, using one machine is easier, at least I think so.  Not having to fumble with multiple keyboards and having to look at another monitor saves time and energy.  <br />
<br />
Try it both ways; use what works best for you but I would recommend boxing from a single PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use one since I hate playing on my laptop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a 3 a 2 and a 1 (6box)<br />
<br />
The 3box is easy so long as you have characters that make sense for it. I have 3 casters on it so its switch, nuke, switch, nuke, switch, etc...<br />
<br />
Got shaman, wiz, and cleric (mostly nuker depending on content) on that box.<br />
<br />
Tank and shammy would be better on two so you could reposition tank while doing shammy things.<br />
<br />
In the end it depends on classes and how you play, usually easier to box on one machine though.<br />
<br />
And I use SOE and its fine :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I think it would be much harder to use 1 machine than 2 but it probably depends on your situation. Yes 2 keyboards and mice do take up alot of space but i can reach over hit a button on the other keyboard and move back to main main keyboard alot easier and faster than I can switch between them. Often times I'll actually be doing things at the same time on both keyboards even something that would be impossible to do on 1 computer. Just repeately hitting a key on one machine to, for example, cast a cure on a mt while twisting on my bard is easy to do with 2 machines but probably near impossible with one.<br />
<br />
It probably depends on the classes. I rarely melee much on my bard on raids so it's essentially like playing 2 casters. I start casting malos on my shaman and hit the hotkey on my bard to assist and do Harmony of sound. Twisting resists songs and amp on my bard while curing mt or group on my shaman. I just find 2 keyboards to be more of an assest than a detirment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've done both and find that 2-boxing on a single machine with dual monitors is much better. I use WinEQ pro and EQPlayNice pro, (which supports dual monitors). I set my hotkeys to ctrl-z to switch between windows and the \ key to toggle quarter screen / full screen mode. Works like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I find it easier to deal with 2 PC's if they are right next to each other and can both run EQ well.  You dont have to look in these tiny lil windows, or switch back and forth if you overlap them. If the monitors are right next to each other practicly its not hard at all to keep track and its less laggy as well, cause i dont know how a top end machine would do, but i know my 1.1ghz 768 ram machine has enough trouble running one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a p-4 1.5 512 and I run 2 with no lag problems except in places like PoK, (the eqplaynice really helps a lot and I run with the sound turned off). I still have 2 monitors side by side so that's no different, only difference is I use 1 keyboard and mouse instead of 2. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with running 2 seperate computers. It's just that in my situation, the modem I'm using plugs directly into the usb port so it is impossible for me to run more then 1 computer off of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it really all depends on the classes.. if you have an EQ/AM ranger youll want him on a seperate machine for archery, if you have a wizard its much easier to just switch between windows on one computer.. personally i find it better to use 2 machines, less slowdown, higher resolutions, etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use eqw, it works fine for me.. I only have a 1.6 ghz computer with a geforce3 Ti200 with the swap drive on D. I don't get much lag for the most part. So performance wise your good. It takes a bit to get use to switching, after I got use to it I love it, playing with one character now just seems so boring. <br />
The benefit of using 2 pc's is less chance of crashing, and you can &quot;bot&quot; one if you wanted to.. it is against SOE's policy to do that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>servingme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">2 boxing with one computer is better forever~!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use EQPlayNice and WinEQ for my multi boxing and do it on one computer. It works rather well as play nice makes EQ not hog the CPU. WinEQ lets you have several instances running at once and you can set up hotkeys to pull your mouse out of the window or to just cycle through your instances. I have the tilde key set to cycle so I can very rapidly switch between characters hit a hotkey and switch back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Furree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I box 3 and I find it much easier to have 3 keyboards and 3 monitors. Certain things which sound so simple aren't when you can't see what one of your toons is doing. When you're autofollowing across and aggressive zone with invis on , it's a serious pita to not know that invis is dropping on your ranger. There are a number of other things like this but that's the one that comes instantly to me.<br />
<br />
Also since the change to the login program I can't run multiple eq instances very well at all. Even my best machine which used to do this without issue becomes really choppy when i do this.<br />
<br />
I would also think that if I was alt tabbing around I could easily end up hitting hot keys on the wrong toon. I've become very used to the physical location of each character's pc.<br />
<br />
That all said depending on what the &quot;bot&quot; is going to be doing you might be able to get away with the 2 on one machine idea. If you're raising a cleric bot who you intend to use as a one button wonder than I can see it working just fine. If you're going to be doing anything moderately dynamic I think it will be hard without multiple machines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If I'm 2 or 3 boxing, I'm using 1 machine per toon. It is just easier I think. Especially when you don't even have to look at the other two systems keyboards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I two-box a shaman and a ranger (and sometimes a paladin or a warrior or a monk) on on one PC. It works fine for me. It saves me space for having 2 monitors and keyboards set up. And on my 19&quot; monitor I can run 2 windows sized at 960x720 next to each other so I can always see what each character is doing. I used to use EQW for doing it but lately I have just been using the standard windowed mode.<br />
<br />
As some of the others mention one of the important factors is what kind of duo you are playing.<br />
<br />
If you are running several windows at less than 1024x768 the UI you are using is also important. If you need suggestions for a good one I would be glad to help just say the word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wineq supports 2 monitors so if you have a video card that supports 2 monitors and 2 monitors then you can have a different character in each monitor. That's the way I play.</div></div><hr />
