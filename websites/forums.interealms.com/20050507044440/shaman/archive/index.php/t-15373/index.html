&quot;Plane of Mischief changes going to the Legends server later next month.  The Plane of Mischief is the home of the trickster, Bristlebane.  One of the most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone is in need of a revamp.  We're looking at it now and plan to have changes ready for Legends later in August.  We'll be keeping the wacky style of the place while at the same time making it a bit more playable.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Would be only a mild expiditing of the journey if they had a book you click on in the PoK Rogue's guild building.</div></div><hr />

Cause we all have access to suicidal mages and bored rogues  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If the dragons are down its really not that hard to clear to PoM.  Hell most of the stuff is easier than the stuff most level 60+ xp on in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wonder if I'll manage to finish the last 2 flowers for my monk.<br />
I hope they keep the old formula in the game and add more drop rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not only is it a bitch to get in, but you can't bring along any melees for very long either.  They seriously need to change to zone in to Western Wastes or something, or just make a PoK book (I wish).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">zone in is fine .. its a very small zone, 2 groups could probly clear the whole place before repops<br />
<br />
a different zone in would just make another kc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't really see it needs much of a revamp.  It's quirky and fun.  <br />
<br />
The drops do blow.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing they need to add is the ability to melee bind.  That's flat out stupid.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'd just as soon they leave it alone.  <br />
<br />
The pathing is pretty good in there, especially since the pathing fix.  My dog never had trouble following me about.  After the fix I didn't have load summon companion at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Making zonein somewhere easier to access would kind of destroy the zone, I like how it is atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">no no no easier access. PoM owns because its quiet. Almost more quiet than West Cabillis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I haven't had a pet poof ever since they fixed the pet pathing (2months ago?).<br />
<br />
I was getting ready to say farewell to my bind point of 6 months, but with new things coming to PoM, I think I will stick around to see what will happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">sweet, they did fix the pathing.... good.. i ain't been to pom in forever...<br />
<br />
anyways, yes i agree... leave the ZI alone. i'm having trouble understanding the benefit of providing a melee bind area. i guess it would be neat if i was there without a rezzer, but these days, i usually hunt down a cleric and pay them 100+ plat depending on where i'm at to rez me.<br />
<br />
So for pom, same request for HoT, and a multitude of other zones...<br />
<br />
INCREASE THE FRICKEN DROP RATE<br />
<br />
i swear if i kill 20 more ancient guardians and still don't see one damn SS BP i'ma scream</div></div><hr />

<br />
After about 18 months bound there, I finally bit the bullet and rebound in PoK a couple weeks ago. Serves me right...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You guys assume they are making changes and still limit content to 2 groups in the zone? If they overhaul PoM im betitng it will be to make the zone more group friendly so you would want to take a crew thgere each night and exp. The zone even if the click in was moved somewhere much more accessable wont be overun for 2 reasons, PoP experiance and PoP loot. Although i would really like to finish my white flower one of these days i wont be there for exping.</div></div><hr />

 :D  <br />
<br />
God I love that story. I dont think I have laughed that hard in a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oh please, not even more resist clickies. It's bad enough as it is with poison and disease flowers being easy to get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is that a bad thing? I mean God forbid I should get my poison and disease resists over 90.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think you can do this anymore.  Last i knew they added drakes nearby. Not counting wandering ones.  You wouldn't have time to loot your corpse before you got spanked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Why is that a bad thing? I mean God forbid I should get my poison and disease resists over 90.<br />
<br />
PoM flowers just about ruined Everquest for me. Maybe ruined is a too strong word, but they certainly made the game only half as enjoying as it used to be. Yes, that many people have the PoM flowers on my server. Landing anything but malos or insid.decay in pvp is hopeless. <br />
<br />
As for your resists, as a priest you get spells to fix that. However, having every non priest class run around with +50pr/dr and sometimes even cr/fr/mr is just wrong in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Oh please, not even more resist clickies. It's bad enough as it is with poison and disease flowers being easy to get. <br />
<br />
Has fas has I know there is already a flower for each resists. So how could they add more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well the pessimist in me is assuming resist flowers will at least continue to exist in PoM even after the revamp, and possibly even get upgraded. I know how the saying goes with assuming stuff and basing your arguments on rumors, but after four years of game decay I can't help but be a chronic sceptic and source of negativity. Sorry bout that.<br />
<br />
And yes, you're right. They are already in, a revamp won't change that. From my point of view putting them in was wrong in the first place. Well damage is done already. I'll just bite the pillow I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">They haven't added more drakes.  It's just always been a very tight squeeze next to that zone to avoid aggro.  You have to get into the corner and stay there away from the drake nearest u.  Also, you wouldn't have to loot corpse, just zone in immediately, bind, take the CS tree out, run back to TOV, and have a necro corpse summon your body.  <br />
<br />
The important thing is getting into PoM and then getting bound.  Also it's kinda hard to get up into the castle.  Actually it's a real pain in the ****ing ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">getting in the castle is cake, as long as you knwo where the bridges are at :)    After running through deep a couple dozen times though, I can pretty easily walk within boundaries without seeing anything there</div></div><hr />
