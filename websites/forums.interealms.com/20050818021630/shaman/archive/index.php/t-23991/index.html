<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Correct - noted by numerous posts here and reported to SoE.   Response is it is a known problem and will be corrected</div></div><hr />

When pigs fly, hell freezes over and SoE decides to pay attention to shaman for a non-nerfing situation.  In other words, don't hold your breath.<br />
<br />
BTW, this was a known issue and /feedback'ed on DAY 1 of the friggin beta.  And they even extended the beta to try to fix more things.  Guess they forgot about the whole &lt;copy True Spirt to Ferrell's Companion&gt; bit they put in there.  Well, they've been told since DAY 1 of release (opps, we weren't sposed to discover that on the first day, now were we).  Been /feedback'ed about 120k times and posted in 3-4 threads on the SoE shaman's lodges sit.  What we get, we'll get to it, sometime (they did NOT say soon, they said they would work on it, which might even mean they won't do anything on it).<br />

Good luck my fellow bears.</div></div><hr />
