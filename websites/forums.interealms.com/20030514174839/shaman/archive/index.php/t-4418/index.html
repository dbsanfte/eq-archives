<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A little over a year ago, I purchased a Gateway P 4 1600 with 256 meg of ram.  I am thinking about upping this to 512.  Now my question is, what ram to buy?  I (/blushes) have no idea what type of RAM I have in the box, and I want to avoid the nightmare to realize the nice stick of RAM that I just put down my hard earned money for, is not working with the one inside my puter.<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you keep all that technical looking documentation that came with your new Gateway?  The technical specifications of your motherboard will be among all your paperwork.  If you take that to the store with you, the salesperson should be able to find out what chipset your motherboard uses, and then what type of memory to buy (normal PC133 SDRAM, or Rambus RIMM probably).  I don't think DDR RAM was being made for P4s last year.<br />
<br />
Or, you could simply call Gateway and tell them you want to buy more memory.  They will have your information on file, and can tell you exactly what your need, and/or order it for you if you want.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd max out your memory if you can.  Memory prices are quite cheap, realtively speaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a gateway as well, and as long as it's still under warranty you can go to the gateway website and hit the tech support area. Enter the serial number and it will tell you everything about every piece of hardware and software on your machine.(if yours is a year old it should still be under warranty)<br />
<br />
If you have trouble still, they have a live tech support chat feature that you can have a tech look at what you have and make recommendations. I just used this feature the other day because I'm upgrading my video card and like you I didnt want to get one that wouldn't work on my machine.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
