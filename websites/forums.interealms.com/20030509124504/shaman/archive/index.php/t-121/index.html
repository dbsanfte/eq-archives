<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it only drops off Sarnak Partisans.   I know it only drops in Fronteir Mountains.  I know its called pouch of dust, and only IDs as Sarnak Nightdust.<br />
<br />
I don't believe it exists.<br />
<br />
50 FM Partisans.  No dust.  Am I doing something wrong?  Is this loot table defective (possibly damaged in the patch that added Thuuga)?  Any other suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zenok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i got some just 2 days ago of a partisan there........seems to be working fine...... sounds like some bad luck ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, gotten 2 dusts in a day, I camped the ruins ontop of the cliff in the sw corner (I think), killed 1 partisian there, got the dust first time, then managed to blow the alchemy attempt (and the gorge moss/sponge mushroom/sanity with it), the night dust was the easiest of the 3 to get back taking 2 kills the second time =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've killed 2 partisens, gotten the drop both times (I failed final combine first timea round, grrr).  I did the camp on top of the hill near some iksar statues, a 4 spawn of sarnaks.  Lots of wanderers.  Don't recall the name of the dust exactly.  Just looted the no drop pouch of dust looking thing and that was it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, is that what dust is for? I actually got the drop when I was exping in FM early last year some time.  I got it exactly the place the posters are describing, the top of a hill near some Iksar statues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Szlia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It drops in FM only as you know. I got it after I killed a grand total of 1 Partisan. Well I paid that because we messed the Potion hand in in Dalnir (at some point it's good to stop questing and start sleeping instead to avoid silly errors). My Shaman friend got the second dust and it took her a little less than an hour.<br />
<br />
There is a good spot at pos2000 neg1600 to hunt Sarnaks in FM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Took me 2-3 hours to get that damn dust &gt;&lt;  Stick with it, the loc in the above post is a good spot to find partisans, but there are a lot of wanderers in the area.</div></div><hr />
