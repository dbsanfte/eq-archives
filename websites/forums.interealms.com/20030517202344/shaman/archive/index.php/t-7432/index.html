<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Northbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is how to not be fat, lazy, or on your wife's **** list.  Breaking down in order.....<br />
<br />
FAT Ok, here is the deal.  Sitting on your ass all the time with a $10 a day Cheetos addiction is bad.  First grab a KEI, then head to zone of choice.  For me...Tim Deep at Gorlas.  Kill, kill, kill.  Till you are LoM.  Canni down 2 bubs.  Sit, med, get up from your chair and bust out 30 push ups.  Sit down kill, kill, kill.  Canni, sit, med, get up from chair.  60 Crunches.  Sit down kill, kill, kill.  Canni, sit, med, get up(keep dumbells next to desk)  do a couple sets of curls.  And so on.  Please don't be the stereotype fat assed computer geek.<br />
<br />
<br />
LAZY   Ok, some folks call in to their job so they can play EQ all day.  That equals A. Gettin fired.  B. Developing Fatass Syndrome .  And C. Placing you unceremoniously on your wife's **** List .  Easy soloution.  Wake up 1 hour early.  Get KEI, head to your xp zone.  Maybe kill 1 or 2 mobs.  Canni, sit, med, camp.  Check weather forcast so you had a reason to turn on your computer that early.  Get your ass to work.  Bust ass all day but refuse to work overtime.  After all in today's world hard workers get worked to death and get the same raises as the lazy asses.  Come home and kill some mobs while placing your boss's face on them.  Wouldn't you like to poison and disease your boss......?<br />
<br />
The Wife's **** LIST   Log in from a.m. camp.  Kill till LoM, canni, sit, med, pushups or whatever, and go was a few dishes.  Repeat process.  When KEI runs out don't bother for now.  Gives you more time to do housework.  lol.  Kill till LoM, sit...you know the drill.  Go pick up the dog crap from the back yard.  Repeat process according to what needs to be done.  When wife gets home you will be in a fair sweat.  Explain that you worked your ass off and EQ is the only relaxing outlet you have.  And that you are sevearly depressed and that playing your shaman cheers you up because your are so powerful.  Watch some TV with her, eat dinner, 1 more TV show, and back to EQ.  Tell her you need to talk to your friends.<br />

Hope this helps for all you guys out there.<br />
