<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fastosus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, well i have been away from this game since about june. I restarted the game and have read some of my older post. What im trying to do is find a place that i can solo at 52 and get a decent amount of money while i level. <br />
<br />
From what i am seeing, it looks like dulak would be a decent spot, the first two boats. I have about 1800hp and 104 AC.  If anyone has any suggestions as to where i should level pls post here.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gin_juice68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The hole was an alright place to solo early in 52... Muc better fr 50 to 51 but still alright i thought when you dont want to be bothered b y people and just kinda do your own thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">104 ac? :)<br />
<br />
Head to Seafury Island in OOT (Can bind there and port out with faithstone self port).<br />
<br />
Sea fury cyclops are blue to 55, drop semi precious gems (Ruby, Opal Bracelets etc) and Mug of Sea Foam (for smithing).  You will never run out of mobs to pull....<br />
<br />
Also can kill named HG (Gornit) for Plat and Ice Giant toes for Alchemy. <br />
<br />
One of the named clopses casts a mana drain, so use puppy to kill him after slowing from a distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, Dulak is good and comes highly recommended.<br />
<br />
Another nice option is CoM, particularly if you don't have your epic drops from there yet. Mobs don't hit as hard or have as many hp as in many newer zones, cash drops are quite reasonable and there's a few reasonable drops there too. Exp mod is pretty decent, plus its and outdoors zone so you can use sow, horse etc, and mobs don't run when low on health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fastosus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sorry, at the time i meant to say 1004. but ive been doing some shopping in the bazaar. i now have more along the lines of 1050 AC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>thaiska</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just wondering i went there not to long ago to work on my 2hb with my new tarnished steel driveshaft, and i cleared the boat twice and didn't get ANYTHING, weapons (5p to vendor)were even scarce.  has anyone else noticed this, has it been nerfed, or just bad luck???</div></div><hr />

In CoM wouldnt the Adds be a bit much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Godzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">CoM mobs don't seem to run.  Was there last night killing in a circle around the Goo House.  They do have a pretty big aggro radius at lvl 52 but not too bad.  If you like a challenge solo along the shores of GoD zone natimbi.  The turtles, mights and hynid thingies are pretty fun.  Alot of hp and hit kinda hard but I think any can drop some random good items.  Went here at lvl 50 and people said I couldn't do it but it really isn't that hard.  With kei and horse its pretty much non stop pulling but mobs take awhile to kill.  I pull with slow, ebolt and stoicism tank for alphaed doggy.  Horse comes in handy as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">highkeep bards and nobles will still be your fastest solo exp from like 50 to 55, plus loot from guardsies :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well I spent two full evenings up on the second floor with the Nobles and the Bards and to be honest EXP was moving a bit slow. Not sure if they have made any changes recently, but loot was crap as well. I made better money from the guards who were green then I did from the Bards and Nobles.<br />
<br />
I have yet to try Dulak or Seafury Island. I want to pick up a Spiritstone prior to heading out to either of those locations. I would expect the loot to be better than HHK.<br />
<br />
Anyone has news to the contrary, please i'm all ears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grammaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try the rockhopper caves in DSP.  Pretty good exp, and while there are no real cash drops, the hides can sell to tradeskillers for decent coin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rockhoppers sound good to me. I need to up my tailoring anyway for shawl.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I have another question to pose. I am hearing that in some of the new zones that mobs can now mitigate our slows. I would like to know if there is a list on where we can look to see what zones have mobs that mitigate our slows or is it expansion specific? I will or intend to me mostly a solo'er and I don't want to deal with mobs mitagating my slows if possible.</div></div><hr />
