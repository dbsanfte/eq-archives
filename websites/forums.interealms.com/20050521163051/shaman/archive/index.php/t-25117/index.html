<br />
I have not seen this posted (and it isnt a purley Shaman thing so...)<br />
<br />
has anyone else noticed (or has anyone esle been dying horrible deaths below the world like me?) people dying under the *skin* of EQ? <br />
<br />
since the release of OOW i have had at least 6 deaths...none of them from agro of falls...well not a fall off a cliff, or a jump off a roof, but instead a fall THRU the skin of EQ. each time my body has been unreachable with /corpedrag, or /corpse...the only soloution has been a necro summon=/ <br />
<br />
this usually happens in caves, on hill sides, and once in POK after doing a tribute. i can see other content thru the *skin* like other lands , and then i fall thru.<br />
<br />
OWW!!<br />
<br />
feature?<br />

i think sony is aware of the current problem though. every time i log on i see the yellow GM test about what to do if i 20k splat. /petition and /bug i beleave...still, really bothersome.</div></div><hr />

That fall in T5 is due to the fact that everybody tries to click through from T4 to T5 at the same time; it stacks characters in the exact same spot so deeply that it can't handle it, at which point you actually get stacked above the floor, and then fall repeatedly for a short distance extremely quickly, hitting the floor over and over until you are pounded to death.<br />
<br />
Get through first some time, dodge to the side, and then turn back and watch as the rest zone through. You'll see people hovering in the air above the zone-in spot and &quot;bouncing&quot; up and down. Its actually quite amusing to watch, as long as it isn't happening to you :(<br />

<br />
i hope someone knows the settings to change=)<br />
<br />
Oof! what a horrible thing to happen when a group is there waiting for you=/</div></div><hr />

The T5 thing is buggy as hell, no question. We have started trying to warn people ahead of time to space out clicking over to T5, to move RIGHT AWAY when you do get there, and NEVER to click over while mounted. This has helped a lot.<br />
<br />
As for the falling through the world thing, I have had somehitng peculier happen to me a couple times since OoW came out, but not in OoW zones. I seem to get &quot;stuck&quot; . . . somewhere, heh, not exactly sure where. I find I cannot cast, move, mem spells, use potions, nothing. Both times have been underwater too, /hug Faerune items! The only way to cure this is to /q, wait til you crash out of the world, the log back in and immidiatly gate. If you attempt to move or mem a spell or anything, you may get stuck again.</div></div><hr />

I had the exact same thing happen to me on a raid in PoI, Xamamech I believe.  Drog, backward into wall, black space, death after falling for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bladefury~fennin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One thing ive noticed is i play a 67 dwarf cleric and a 70 barb shaman.  Many and i think of 12+ as being many, ive zoned into any zone and dwarf will continuously fall for no reason what so ever i mean there are no one else present to cause this.  ANd each fall is a 300+ hp hit... not a normal like 40 hp one.  And if im not paying attention he dies rather quickly.<br />
<br />
now this NEVER happens on the barb ... i mean for the amount of times it has happened on my cleric i cannot recall it happening on my sham.  This may have to do with race? im not sure... both are on the same type of machine/graphics so i dont know what else to look at.  but like i said just the dwarf and not the barb....  soo.... /shrug not sure whats going on<br />

More recently though, I was standing by the small bank in POK and became immobilized (couldn't move, sit, duck etc) and was seeing repeated &quot;falling damage&quot; messages for 600-800 points each time until I finally died.  I couldn't cast either or swap spells.  It was really weird as there was no visual distortion either, just being immobile and seeing those darn damage messages unto death (sob).<br />
<br />
GM petition resulted in a 100% rez within 2 hrs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Happened in Dranik's, PoK, Time and a few other zones (think WoS was one of them)...Hopefully it will be fixed soon kinda sucks to zone in and die cause you 'fell'.</div></div><hr />
