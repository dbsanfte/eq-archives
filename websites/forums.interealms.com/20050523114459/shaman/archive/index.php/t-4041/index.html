<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the Bazaar opened up, is it me or has Rathe been overrun by druids ? Druids make me sick, I went to Rathe mountains to hunt HG's for exp, mostly loot. And I got some friggin 60 druid and his druid partner each quadding HG's and wouldn't kill any placeholders. And I got KS'ed a couple of times by these jackasses, who had a Slowed and debuffed giant courtesy of yours truly. <br />
Needless to say I spent 2 hours in Rathe and killed 3 HG's and a ton of PH's. <br />
So I went to DL (Yuck I hate that place).......<br />
<br />
Do HG's still give exp at 60 ? And next time I see a druid messing with my pulls, I'm gonna take a wizz all over their druid rings. <br />
Lil assling bastards !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lol, no HG's do not give exp at 60. Heck, they stopped at 51-52 I think.<br />
<br />
Remember tho - &quot;Not all Druids are jerks - but all jerks are Druids.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Every now and then I find a light blue at 54.  I tend to pull for a bunch of lower-level friends.  Had to park Goner way the heck away from the party site so I could babysit the giants all the way back to the group.<br />
<br />
Shaman--not in bear form--backing up a few feet in front of a hill giant coming after her, and STILL these morons were snaring them.  &quot;Oh, I didn't know it was taken.&quot;  Riiight.<br />
<br />
Changed tactics.  If they took mine, I'd immediately dispel it,  eBolt it and beat it up.  Friends didn't get xp for it, but at least they'd get the cash.  Other than root and epic, our stuff will last through dispels quite nicely.<br />
<br />
Chanter friend joined me just before we left.  Charmed the giant, SoWed it, buffed it to the max.  Set it standing there, then invis'd ourselves.<br />
<br />
If the &quot;wrong&quot; druid or person picked it up, he'd re-charm it and I'd bring them a slowed one.  There are several Heirophants who took a good beating that day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was there the other week and some jag off Mage had his jobaber running around too.  Turd would say i was KSing him, if he even glanced at it i guess it was his.  So anyway there were a few that i'd slow and he'd send in his pet. so i'd root it (so it looked like it was still fighting his pet) then ebolt and epic.... maybe throw in a bracer boom for good measure and walk over for my cash.  did this a few times till he started catching on.  then it happened again but he starts nuking for all he's worth, he got the kill (WTG!!) and sends me a tell &quot;dont mess with me or you'll never get another kill&quot;  oh boy...  so i let him in on a little secret.  Sham with epics and jobabers dont use mana to kill things, it just takes me an extra 30 secs per mob.  so while he's medding up for the next 5 minutes i pulled probably 3 or 4 mobs infront of him and killed them.   /flex his direction after each kill and move on.<br />
<br />
Towards the end of the couple hours i was there i had to take off i was so heavy (had 800pp and probably 200pp in gold not to mention all the FS weapons) but as my last hurrah i ended up fighting 3-4 HG consistently for about 10 or 12 kills.  As long as i kept them slowed and let them beat on me while i epic and bracer them all i could last like that with canna and torp forever i think.  just ran out of HG towards the end :(<br />
<br />
Anyway i hate Rathe, too many turds there for my liking.  Everyone bitches about KSing though i've never taken one from someone on purpose and if the people are cool about it i typicaly give them like 10 - 30pp for the hassel reguardless of what actually dropped.  But the number of dr00ds there out numbers the real people so i hate it there.<br />
<br />
BTW we have been warned about the charm/buff/invis trick.... except what we did was we went up to the damn dr00d that trained us with a charmed, buffed, hasted, INVISIBLE pet (when you could invis your pets :) ) and then went invis after parking jobaber next to him.   heh try running or casting when you cant see the fool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stay away from HGs, the exp is terrible and while the cash is okay, you will make tons more by getting loot/gems in exp groups while getting better exp to boot. Then you can sell the loot to the Druids quadding HGs to get up the money to buy it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I should have stated earlier, I don't group very often. I like to solo.......so in order to try to make up for the loot I'll miss out on by not grouping I hunt HG's for cash and exp. The exp isn't that great but the money more than makes up for it. I would try Ice Giants in EF but, they seem to be a little tough for me to take solo at 42.</div></div><hr />

Am I the only one that sees the irony in a high level shaman dominating a lower-level zone, then complaining about the &quot;too many turds there&quot; for his liking?  I don't suppose there are any mirrors in EQ are there?<br />
<br />
Are you above level 52?  Unless you are PLing another character, why would you spend time in Rathe?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One positive came out of my short time in Rathe Mtns (maybe 5 or 6 hours).<br />
<br />
To avoid KSing, simply target the HG and /assist.  If he is being kited/snared/whatever it will change to the other person.<br />
<br />
if /assist didn't turn up a name, it was fair game.<br />
<br />
I didn't learn this technique until I was there for a bit.  Might be old news to some peeps, new info for some others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe he wanted to make easy pp?  A little trip down memory lane to give some payback to those big uglies?</div></div><hr />
