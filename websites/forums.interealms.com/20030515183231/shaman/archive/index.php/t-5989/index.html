I was looking to Either Purchase a Lozi Shield Since I will never be able to kill him, or There is a Jaudiced BP for sale on my server for 26,000pp  I've got about 30k to spend and Lozi Sheild is about 30k even. I was planning on going out and doing the Shield of Bane Warding Quest soon. I'm leary about the BP since I've been doing Kael/PoG Recently and think as soon as I buy it, I will get one to drop :) Otherwise I've looked at Buying MQ Chain armor for Thurg/SS. I have horrible luck in Kael and PoG. Been on 40+ raids and only have a PoG bracer to Show for it. <br />
