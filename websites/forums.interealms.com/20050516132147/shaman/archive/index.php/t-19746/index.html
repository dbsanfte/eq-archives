<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We are quite experienced via ldon easy and hards, so we thought we would try it.  <br />
<br />
On our first night, we spend 2 and a half hours crawling through the sewers, killing everything, moving slowly, until we realized the zone respawns behind us.  So we start moving faster, but keep killing everything.  We wipe out near the path out of the 3rd room, the room with some named NPC who responds when hailed, saying something regarding how he doesn't want to be tortured any more, but thats all.<br />
<br />
On our second night, we spend just about 3 hours pushing ourselves and make quite a bit more progress but still far from the far end of the sewers.  We went well past that named NPC again, same results from hailing.  We tried different combos of words, handing him drops from the dungeon, all resulting in nothing.  <br />
<br />
We thought about invis'ing to push further faster, but found the presence of undead and living mobs would make that tough if not impossible.<br />
<br />
We found a common no drop item, mud.  We did get 1 good item, a no drop cloak off of a regular mob, which had extended range 4, 100 mana and endurance, singing modifier, bunch of stats and saves, all all, which went to a mage in our group.  <br />
<br />
So anyways, the group wants to know more before we return there for a third night.  Anyone out there with some insite to shine our way?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use invis and you can run past 90% of the dungeon.  The cubes see through invis, and there are ghosts which require IVU.  Run to the named you found and hail him.  He's labelled on the eqtoolbox maps.  Then, run past a few more rooms, go down a hole, swim west out of water.  Turn left and go to the southmost room.  It is labelled &quot;stonemite room&quot; on eqtoolbox maps.  Use levitate to get up on the ledges above the water.  Pull the stonemites one at a time.  Leave the last one alive and med up to full and make sure everyone has all the buffs they need.  Once you kill the last one, the named spawns.  He is unslowable but doesn't hit too hard.  Time geared tanks have no trouble tanking him at all as long as the cleric isn't asleep, so I imagine any group with a decent tank and a competent cleric + blast healer can kill him.  Once you kill him, go back to the scribe and say &quot;what issue&quot; then talk to high priest again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, this is the beginning of the quest (if you got the zone from the HP that is) to get flagged for the zones of Vxed and Tipd.  I'm sure they'll be stuff out soon that tells you what to do, but what I will tell you is that you don't need to hail Ansharu, but you do need to keep pushing on, and find the Aged Stonemites (9 of them) and afte they die a named mob called the Ancient Cerwhatever spawns, once he's dead, you will get the first flag (or tempt flag if you didn't hail the HP first).  <br />
<br />
The plant, which is the zone that you were in, is easily the hardest zone.  It's the only one that has the constant 1200 hitters the whole time.  Exercise caution.  You can theoritically make it down to the mites in about 10 min if you are good with the invis/pacify techniques.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We got to the stonemite room, but they keep respawning in like a min so we cant kill them all.  Did we miss something to start the ring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BTW if you die while your group is killing the Ancient Kaypheros you will miss the flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use levitate to get up on the ledges above the water. <br />
<br />
You can fight on the steps, just have the melee in one corner and the casters in the other corner, and stay out of Line of Sight of the little mites in the hallway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We got to the stonemite room, but they keep respawning in like a min so we cant kill them all.  Did we miss something to start the ring?<br />
<br />
Run past the hallway with the little guys.  The next room will bring you to the aged stonemites.  They can be single pulled without pacify.  Kill all 9 and the named will rush you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was in there last night, we got our expedition from Gamesh.  We talked to the named guy on the map who said he was studying the bugs.  I couldn't get him to accept any items or respond to text.<br />
<br />
So we fought down to the stonemite room on the map and it was empty.  We tried killing the stonemites in the nooks but their respawn is too fast for us to kill all.  Perhaps we took too long to get to the stonemite room?  We had a bard for tracking, so the Stonemite room was out of reach for a while, but when we got close enough there was never any Aged Stonemites.<br />
<br />
A guildie of mine reported that they got the same cloak (that is mentioned in the first post) in an Expedition that was given to a group of 3, two of the people were 65 and one was 61.  He said  it dropped off a mob that had no special name and that it and the other mobs in the dungeon only hit for like 250.   In my dungeon the mobs hit for 1200ish and the golem guys were unslowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Henora, there is no possible way to get into the aged stonemite room without invising past those last set of stonemites.  They just respawn the instant that you kill them.  The reason that you didn't see the Aged Stonemites is because you got the quest from Gamesh.  Gamesh is used solely for exping purposes.  If you want to see the aged stonemites, then get the expedition from the High Priest.  He is the one that starts the flag progression in GoD.  He starts you off with going to the plant.  I can't confirm this as true at the time, but I think that if you go into the sewers through HP, then you won't see the named mobs up that can drop the items/spells.  At least, i don't recall ever having seen one in the bunch of times I've been in there.  Most of the time I asked someone where they got their expedition from, it has always been Gamesh.<br />
<br />
Remember that there are four different sewer zones.  There is Plant, Crematory, Lair, and Pool.  Plant is easily the hardest, it's where the mobs hit double 1200s.  More than likely your friend was in another sewer zone.  I know that the Crematory especially starts off with 300 hitters and slowly progresses up to about 700 - 800s.   Most mobs in all of these zone are fully slowable too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah I had read something about the difference between the Gamesh and High Priest instances this morning.  That would explain the problem.  Thanks for confirming.<br />
<br />
About my guildmate and his adventure.  I was thinking perhaps these zones may scale in difficulty to group composition (number of players/levels)..that would be shocking, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jarelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you have to have had someone who has talked to the scribe and high priest in Barindu before you can complete the sewer trials...someone who has talked to the high priest then hails ansharu, and he will give a different message, then the mites will spawn in the mite room...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Completed the plant expedition tonight with the help of 5 people from a time flagged guild (Im wearing ornate for comparison)  :) <br />
<br />
You probably will get a temporary flag (well I did), which will be converted to the permenant flag once you have hailed the High Priest and said 'what issues' to the Scribe.<br />
<br />
Zethrir</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Completed the Plant expedition tonight as well.  Was as simple as talking to the High Priest, as suggested.<br />
<br />
Scored this off a common mob, as well, a rock guy (not a noc, like this picture shows)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Stayed there in the flag instance during 3 hours  and didn't get any drop. So, it's rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So after reading all the helpful suggestions, we tried again last night.  We went to the right npc to get the mission this time and were delighted in the new zone that spawned (we had been in the xp/pharm instance of the same mission before).  We began to understand what &quot;cubes&quot; were.  Some of the mobs were 65, and presented the same difficulty as hard ldon's, so we stayed on our toes and soaked up the xp as we moved to the appropriate npc's on the map.  When we got to the boss room, we tried a tactic that our monk had read about on his boards, and unfortunately failed / wiped due to the water issue causing spells not to land.  The xp was nice, we even got a very nice dropped earring with a magic based nuke damage focus on it.  We are planning to go again and use the other tactic of standing on the ledge or stairs out of the hallways los to hopefully land spells on the bugs.  <br />
<br />
From the shaman perspective, I can only imagine how nice our new slow spell is going to be.  Faster casting time and innate resist reducer will have it bounce less, as I have even bounced slows off of malos'd stonemites in there.  I think it will replace root, as single pulls are easy, and there are 2 other rooters in my usual group (plus I have VP, just in case).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wow that ring is nice, too bad its not shaman wearable /sigh.<br />
<br />
Anyone seeing spell drops in the sewers ? I finaly ot a group tonite and im loving it. But a prospect of my spells would be nice too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Had a 65 SK nuke drop from the boss of Phase 1 Sewer Trial<br />
Had 65 wizard Black Ice drop from Sludge-Eating Fly in Phase 3 Sewer trial, once out of four kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">we've seen a few spells drop, but nothing in the sewers, but as I stated earlier, I don't think that the spell can be found in the flagging sewers zones (as opposed to the exp sewers).  We did get a 65 beastlord spell from a named in Barindu earlier yesterday.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you talk to the HP before you go into the sewers, then you will get a permanent flag when you kill the ancient dude in the plant.  You don't need to talk to the scribe unless you get a temp flag.  You don't even need to talk to ansharu either.<br />
<br />
When fighting all normal mobs, I would pull them out of the water to fight on land.  When fighting the aged stonemites, you can do it a few different ways, but if you fight themin the water, the healer has to be on the same level as the tank, and the casters have to be out or on top of the water.  Sometimes I had to push myself up and down just a bit to get my spells to land,sometimes I didn't.  Named is actually pretty easy too if you experiment with him and notice what he doesn't do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just to be clear, both of the spells I had drop were from trial/flagging sewers, not the experience versions. And I know guildies have gotten another wiz nuke, and a 65 cleric nuke from the trials too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok cool, thnx for the feedback. Im wondering what spell of ours will drop from there, if one will drop. Hopefuly the slow or something useful. Hoenstly i couldnt care less about the DR DoT. I mean if i get it yay, but im looking for the new Q the Slow and the  Cann4.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Got a spell in Lair of the Trapped tonight, which is the 3rd trial.  Yes, trial from the High Priest.  Had 4 items drop there, 2 spell haste IV augs, type 7, a pair of plate sleeves with comparable stats to TAK plate sleeves, a nice 100hp/mana caster/priest earring with anger of druzzil and the Wizard spell, Black something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">hehe, similar to what I had when I did it.<br />
Had two plate arms, one spell haste 4 aug (now in my arms), black ice, and a Earring of the Mooncaster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Deluda and Nihil drop from the trials/barindu areas.  Trushar can be found from the Taelosian stone turn in.  Havne't found ancient yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So are spells dropping off of just named, or also off of trash?  If it is off of nameds only, how hard are they to kill? (i.e. can I solo them)<br />
<br />
I know I can solo trash in sewers and the four city zones, but I am not sure about an unrootable summoning named that mitigates slow.  The reason I ask is because my guild isn't really interested in farming these zones.  We either do expeditions or go to pofire to farm AA =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">http://home.comcast.net/~demonmage/images/BalanceSlow01.JPG <br />
<br />
This is from the gimp named in the Sewers of Nihilia, Lair of Trapped ones, the 3rd phase Sewer Trial. This was NOT trial version, it was the EXPERIENCE version gotten from Gamesh or whatever, instead of High Priest.<br />
<br />
Sludge hits for 980~, and I belivve partially effective is the mitigation message. Not sure on hp, it's not THAT high, probably on a bit more then normal mobs in Phase 3. Hope that helps on wether you can solo it or not... but unless you sit there and cycle instance until named is right by zone in, you may have trouble getting to it, more then killing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grats to you.  Do you by chance remember if it summoned and/or was unrootable?  Slow mitigation?  Max hit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just added that information in. And yes, it summons, was rootable.<br />
<br />
And not being a shaman the spell drop kinda sucked, but we managed to find a shaman outside who could use it, and added him in, since the only shaman on in guild was afk for hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I just tried my hand at soloing the crematory expedition looking for nameds, and it sort of worked.  After about 1.5 hours of clearing see invis mobs I found a named worm down near the blue crystal room.  It was a giant wuss - didn't summon, fully slowable, rootable, hit for the same as everything else in the zone.  Dropped an 80hp melee only neck =\  no spell.<br />
<br />
Going to hook up with a tracker and a tank and farm a ton of these tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Henora, there is no possible way to get into the aged stonemite room without invising past those last set of stonemites. <br />
<br />
Those little ones that respawn instantly are indifferent to you unless you  piss them off and smack their friends around.  We waltzed right through them to the room with the water, no invis.<br />
<br />
That was as of the first night, has it been changed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">No, it hasn't been changed.  We went to quickly redo mission 1 for a groupmate and it was the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">/shrug.  I never conned them, just assumed that they were kos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">So we journied in again, attempting the 2nd trial, as we are now a little burned on the first.  Collect 4 remains.  Sounds pretty easy, and could be.  Nice thing is that even though all 4 of the remains are lore, they are not no-rent.  So we went in, and started killing in the direction of the 4 ghost spawn.  We got the first 3 drops pretty quickly, and even repeats, two full second sets of 3 and some odd ones that rotted.  Monk was our main holder, rogue was our secondary, cleric tertiary.  We finally got the 4th piece after FIVE (5) hours of just slaughtering deep inside.  It was sure a trial of endurance to stay awake and aware.  But we finally got it, killed the 4 ghosts, had our monk outrace the whisp and do the final turn in.  On the way out, the rogue finished his set of remains, so this might make the next run for flagging our friends easier.  We did see one interesting drop:  Veng 3 slot 7 augment.  Nice, but after 5 hours, kind of disappointing.  So far we have gotten 1 good drop every 2 missions.  <br />
<br />
Most of us couldn't get the flag for this mission, as we still have to complete the first one.  We have been assured by others that once we pass the first one, we will get both flags.  We shall see.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Tell the scirbe next to the High Priest &quot;Issues&quot; and he will straighten out your flags, you can do the trials in any order, you just need all 6 completed to move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Keyline Wintermystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Would like to clarify...<br />
<br />
The aged stonemites in the plant trial do not have to be pacified?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I pulled them for my group last night with Malos. Warrior taunted off me when they came up on the ledge, I backed off, counted to eight, and slowed, then crippled.<br />
<br />
Ancient Kayseros is *not* slowable, verified. He can be crippled, and hit me for a max of 1640 when cripple aggroed him.</div></div><hr />
