<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently found the battle.net forums for WoW. Was browsing through it today and found this (http://www.battle.net/forums/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=10738&amp;P=1&amp;ReplyCount=12#post10738) thread. I really hope it doesn't happen, and if it does I hope the company that buys them has a &quot;hands off&quot; approach. :(<br />

Vivendi Hawking Games Unit <br />

Vivendi hasn't stopped trying to sell its video game parts after all. The struggling company is looking to sell its biggest moneymakers - Blizzard and Sierra. Both companies are responsible for creating some of the best selling games of all time. Reuters reports that Vivendi has looked to three different potential buyers so far - Microsoft and Electronic Arts as well as Japanese games giant Sony. The deal is for all of Vivendi Universal Entertainment and not simply the two gaming companies. Vivendi Universal Entertainment also owns assets in television and film as well as theme parks. The proposed deal is for $15 billion. An EA spokesperson said the company wouldn't discuss the matter &quot;prior to the announcement of an agreement&quot; while spokespersons from the other companies declined comment.<br />

I plan to buy WoW though anyway. Oh yeah, while browsing through screenshots I found this really awesome one of jungle trolls, that looked a lot like shamans. Go to www.worldsofwc.org (http://www.worldofwc.org/screenshots/script/show.cgi?dosearch&amp;multipage=&amp;resultnumber=8&amp;searchquery=a&amp;submit2=Search&amp;highlight=&amp;skipnumber=0) on the screenshots page and the trolls are the second ones down from the top. I really really hope trolls become playable. This kind of troll shaman seems like what I'm missing from EQ. My shaman doesn't look like a shaman. In fact, any barbarian can look like me, regardless of class. Not only do I hope these trolls are playable, but I hope the classes have different looks to them. Like sort of a witchdoctor voodoo-ey look for shamans, and a different look for warriors, etc.<br />

Anyway, currently I think the trolls are npc only. :/</div></div><hr />
