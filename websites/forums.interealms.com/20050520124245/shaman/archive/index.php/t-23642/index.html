<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frejadotter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So here is my situation...<br />
<br />
I'm one kill from 66 and have 30 banked aa.<br />
<br />
I am going to put regular xp to 100% and race to 70, mostly to help my guild which became fully elemental within the last month, but has not done much exploring there yet.<br />
<br />
Do I keep my 30 aa banked til 70 and buy the good stuff:  Call of the Wild and Spiritual Channeling.<br />
Do I spend my 30 aa at 66 spread between Healing Adept, Mastery, Boon?<br />
Do I spend my 30 aa at 66 going defensive on Reflexive Mastery and Defensive Instict?<br />
Do I spend some at 66 and some at 67 on Improved Critical Affliction and Ancestral Aid?<br />
<br />
My choices are torn between these.  <br />
I still love LDON's where defense for shamans helps alot, but LDON won't be a big part of the expansion for 66-70.  I still like it for sewers runs in Vext and Tipt.<br />
I am asked to patch heal on raids, especially on ramp tank, and can be expecting more of this as we progress through PoP, so healing is of big importance.<br />
I will be soloing during down times, weird times, etc..  HoH is trivial now, PoF has been good soloing for me while LFG.  I have max crit affliction, so do i go for Improved Crit Afflixtion at 67?<br />
<br />
Shamans can do everything well, and our AA are obviously a reflection of that.  I will be 70 within a month tops, sooner if possible.  Feedback will be of great help to me, so thanks for your time to respond.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm maxxed 65 with 30 AAs banked. I plan to grind to 70 and get the rez (9) the new can (12) and two levels of the new group heal (10). <br />
<br />
(okay, that's 31, I'll make the other AA happen somewhere. I figure I'll get the 3 AA spell gem sometime before 70 as well).<br />
<br />
Then I plan to get:<br />
<br />
Last level of group heal<br />
Both healing AA upgrades<br />
Crit HOTs<br />
Persistent minion (7 AA for pet that is there when you log in?, I might get this earlier)<br />
<br />
After that (which will probably be several months for me), probably on to defense AAs and a little more flowing thought. Respendent cure is also attractive. I'd love to get more nukes/crit nukes but I haven't topped off the hugely overpriced GoD AAs yet.<br />
<br />
They did well with the new AAs, plenty to keep me busy for a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm also max 65 and 30 aa saved. I think I'm going to get 1 kill to ding 66 and see which I can buy then. Maybe the first levels of adept/gift and get the first level of the HoT when I can. Also probably get the extra spell gem when I can along with crit HoT's. Basically a combo of any of those and whenever I run out grind to 70, then aa again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am in the same boat.  I'm leaning towards:<br />
<br />
extra spell gem<br />
reflexive mastery<br />
expansive mind<br />
<br />
When I get 70, I'll help all the bluebies catch up and get Call of the Wild and Ancestral Aid.  There is no way I could sit on 30aa until 70. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Because of my work schedule I'm not going to reach 30 by time GoD goes live.  I have 22 atm.  I'm planning on getting Mnemonic Retention (3), Healing Gift Mastery 1 &amp; 2 (9), Healing Adept Mastery 1 (3) or Healing Boon (depending on initial parses by people), and saving the remaining 7 till I reach 70 and purchase Call of the Wild (7).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First thing I am gettign is the HoT Crits. If it works on regen it will be a huge huge factor towards keepign groups healthy.<br />
<br />
Then Extra spell slot. (Man that is going to be weird)<br />
<br />
Then I will figure it out from there. Probably level a couple times then get a couple aa. Then level again and so forth. I would rather have abilitys that help me get aa Now. Rather than in the future.<br />
<br />
And yeah Level greater than all and such. But Leveling without spells is foolish. A ton depends on the spell distrubution model and how available they are. I mean I was still getting Spectrals in PoJ before I actually leveled to 63. (Before my guild could complete Trials  Once we got trials done I shot to 64 till I got a decent spell to mem in 65 then Got the one kill to 65. (remember this was when everything greened out early and My guild still went to places like Howling stones to xp because almost noone had flags)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">- Ancestral Aid(level1)<br />
- Reflexive Mastery<br />
while getting 70.<br />
<br />
Near future:<br />
- Defensive Instincts<br />
- Call of the Wild<br />
- Healing Gift M.(1-3)<br />
- Healing Adept M.(1-3)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I will go for extra spell gem first, then Ancestral aid maxed. After that I will probably save up for call of the wild. Then we will see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm nearly maxed on 65 (like 90% into level or so now after a few raid deaths) and like 28 aa's saved up. The most appealing aa's initially seem to be the ones that add new abilities.<br />
<br />
Mnemonic Retention seems cheap and something you can buy right away and pretty handy to have.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid seems really nice and will probably be 5 per level from what I've heard but will require you to be level 67, 68 and then 69. First level right after you hit 67 is a definite altho at this point each additional level seems to only add 25 hps a tick and a bit of endurance regen. Not that significant an improvement for 5 aa's imo. I'll personally probably hold off a bit on the later levels of it.<br />
<br />
Slight of hand was looking pretty nice but that latest I'm hearing is that has been removed for wis casters. If it's still around I can definitely see sinking points into that. <br />
<br />
Call of the Wild looks pretty handy to me too. I'll probably end up saving 9 aa's for it till I hit 70. <br />
<br />
Spiritual Channeling looks interesting but I can't really say I run out of mana often enough to make this a high priority aa.<br />
<br />
Healing Boon doesn't look bad but have to wonder how frequently it will go off at given levels. Personally I could see this being a really handy since I usually use HoT's heavily when I have to heal. Probably wait to see what parses come out looking like.<br />
<br />
If I go with Mnemonic Retention, the first level Ancestral Aid and save for call of the wild thats 17 aa's total. With the 13 left over aa's I think i'll probably do 2 levels of healing adept and then the first level of Healing Gift or Reflexive Mastery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think I'll go for Mnemonic retention first, then Anceseral Aid 1, Call of the Wild, healing AAs, defensive AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Spell Gem (Mnemonic Retention), then as much Damage Avoidance (Reflexive Mastery) as I can (based on level). <br />
<br />
After that, if I have any left banked, I'll get as much Resplendant Cure as I can. That'll probably tap my meager reserve. I blew a bunch on ASC1&amp;2 recently.<br />
<br />
Lots of the cooler stuff requires higher levels, and the reports of cost to benefit should be in shortly from the more uber of you, to help me decide. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For some reason I didn't realize I could start buying ancestral aid at 67. I'll definitely buy the three ranks as soon as I can!</div></div><hr />
