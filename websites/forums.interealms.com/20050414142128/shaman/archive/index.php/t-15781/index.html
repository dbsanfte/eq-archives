<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ikari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright want to know if this video card is good enough to work for EQ it is  XFX GeForce FX 5200. I dont know much about video cards so i need some help. All I know is that a new card is has to be better than what i have now.</div></div><hr />

I guess it all depends on &quot;what you have now&quot;. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ikari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">right now i have a Radeon 7000 i was also thinking to get the Inno3D Tornado GeForce4 Titanium Ti 4200 but i am no sure what to get really thats why i am looking here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The radeon 7000 series is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Upgraded from a GeForce 2 MX with 32 MB of RAM to a Radeon 7500 with 128 MB of ram and it runs pretty flawlessly.  The GeForce was a bit laggy (I'm pretty sure what you mentioned above is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; above my old GeForce) but it was certainly functional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd skip the 5200 series.  Get a Ti4200 if you're mostly playing EQ and don't need directX9 compatiblity, if you want directX9 fo 5600.  Much more bang for the buck.  Maybe read up on Tom's Hardwareguide (http://www17.tomshardware.com/) on the performance of the different cards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't recommend the Inno3D Ti4200 card. Get it from a different manufacturer. Mine has fried (without me modding or OCing at all) twice in the past year. Luckily, I did get it replaced under warranty =)<br />
<br />
Ti4200 is good. But not from Inno3d</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I personally like Radeon. I had a Radeon in my old EQ pc and it was perfectly fine - just the rest of the system was a bit slow. My new system has a GeForce and the pc is a lot faster, but I still get lag in a few zones (like Plane of Valor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FX5200 is no faster than a MX440.  If you get a 5200 Ultra its ALOT better.  Ti4200 is a great deal, really good performance and low price.  If you can still find a Radeon 9100 they are also great performance/price ratio.  A radeon 7000 is bottom of the barrell and shouldn't be considered a gaming card at all.  <br />
<br />
Surprisingly one of the best bangs for the buck is a Xabre200.  Same performance as a 5200 but costs half as much.</div></div><hr />
