<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What do you think is the best designed zone in the game? The zone doesn't have to be popular or drop good loot, but from a design stand point is good. I personally like the Hole. I know its buggy and the loot sucks, but I like the way it works. Random drops off almost any mob in the zone with guaranteed drop of one of the many random named bosses. If it wasn't for the bad pathing, wierd aggro, and insane spawn time it would be a cool dungeon crawl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm...<br />
<br />
Just from a visual stand point I'd have to say Vex Thal. It's layout is fairly straight forward but it just looks soo cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd have to say...Karnor's Train, er Castle. Yes, Karnor's Castle is the best designed zone in he game! (Imagine trying to say that with a straight face)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sordar Spiritrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dragon Necropolis. Funnest zone in the game imho.  Traps make things interesting, and one group can do well there.  Went down and did paebala other night, and got my fetish with a few guildies, it was a blast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quick Question: Can a necro and shaman duo in there sometime in there life?  just a thought.<br />
<br />
Favorite Zone so far would be Paludal Caverns.  Not only is the exp great there, but the layout and design of the dungeon makes it somewhat easy for travel, and so much that a cleric can solo there.  I just really like the way they made the zone with sections for different areas, so that even a magician or necro can easily tank things in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sleepers, pre awakening.  <br />
<br />
I loved the atmosphere of it.  Especially the main entrance hall, the high ceilings, etc.<br />
<br />
I even liked the emotes and whatnot, heh.  I'm usually not into the story of EQ.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has been in the zone remembers their first time, and thought, man, this is a cool zone.<br />
<br />
I don't care for much of any of Luclin.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore will always be a perrenial favorite of mine.  I also like SG and Dragon Necro.<br />
<br />
Yes, a necro and a shaman could duo in DN.  You could do PS's, but you'd get better experience elsewhere.  You could do rats, too, but I think it'd be a waste of time.  I enjoy going with  a full group every now and again, or less for a bit of a challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">CT for old world. Havent been since the change since im not 60 yet but the old school CT owned!  Favorite new zone would be Scarlet Desert. Hole dungeon crawls are also a blast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Astalus is a wise man. He is correct, the answer is Crystal Caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Have to go with Kylemall on this, Blackburrow!<br />
<br />
What other dungeon can support 40+ people comfortably at once for xp?  3 ways in, only one way out.  Trains galore help to get all the newbies schooled at dungeon delving.  Fair loot for the level.  And best of all, its a continual game of 'Whack a Gnoll'!  I love that place. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The new CT, hands down, omg this zone just rocks so much, challenging enough to weed out the crappy players(who belong in seb!), yet not so hard no one can do it.  Another good one, is PoM, they better fix that in Planes of Power (2 expansions late! ***?) or i'ma gonna be pissed...more than I already am :mad: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Kedge because of the added difficulty of being underwater.<br />
<br />
OLD CT, and new CT to a lesser extent.<br />
<br />
City of Mist. Can progress from zone-in to stables, to back near temple to temple and BR killing.<br />
<br />
Plane of Sky. Don't like the key acquisition, but that zone is one of my favorites. Different strategies for each island.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Old World I had to say my two favorite  zones were Estate of Unrest and Cazic Thule. I love the hole as well though hehe. New zones, Cazic Thule is awesome again.<br />
<br />
For the really low levelers, I have to agree. Blackburrow is awesome, and don't forget Befallen. Spent time in befallen and I think that one is pretty well designed as well, except for the damned well that the newbies fall down inside of it hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Tower of Frozen Shadow<br />
<br />
So much variety in decor and mobs all in the same zone, has an actual palpable history, some decent loot, room enough for lots of groups or soloers without a chance of many of them getting in each other's way, places that a soloer could hold, places that require some solid strategy and a group, exits located at strategic locations throughout...I could go on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Howling stones.<br />
<br />
Second favorite would be Lguk.<br />
<br />
Third Favorite? Chardok.<br />
<br />
Tied for last place: Any open outdoor zone with mobs over level 25. Umbral. the Planes, and Maidens don't count, but maidens attracts all sorts of idiots somehow anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hard one to say. My guesses would be PoM, PoH, DN,DL, and yes, Ocean of Tears,and SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I would have to go with:<br />
Old World: The Lost Temple of Cazic Thule - Or- Lower Guk<br />
Kunark: Dalnir<br />
Velious: Crystal Caverns<br />
Luclin: I dunno, maybe Shadowhaven, but only pre-cheeze guy nerf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Old World: Kedge.  6 months ago, I didn't know squat about this zone, and I'd say it's an acquired taste.  But as an officer, I was forced to fish out some kedge guides on the internet, and subsequently spent around 3-4 hours getting a good feel for it.  I don't regret it though, it's a very unique zone and it's fun cruising around, I swim around so fast that I often end up taking falling damage :D (think about it).<br />
<br />
I don't think many people would agree though.  Apart from phinni raids, I tour there maybe twice a week to smack cauldronbubble and estrella up.  Hardly anyone in zone except for the occasional tracker mule, and I know why:<br />
1) Your spells get interrupted much easier when the mob is hitting you<br />
2) CR's are a pain if you're stuck without an extra eb item or fish scales in bank<br />
3) AE's are not really viable<br />
4) Most mobs are immune to cold-based attacks (= no jbb sorry =/)<br />
<br />
But it still doesn't change the fact that it's very well thought out.  An entire zone submerged under water, permitting you to freely move about the z-axis.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For Kunark, I'd have to say Skyfire, god knows how much time I've spent there helping various friends/guildies camp ragefire.  The mobs are pretty much spread out according to level of difficulty, which is cool.  Like around BW zoneline, you have the level 40ish ones, and as you proceed further in, they start getting tougher and tougher ie guardian wurms.  Those platforms with globes are beautiful too, and the wasteland motif fits in well since after all it is the home of drakes, wurms, etc.  The only thing I dislike about that zone is the pos dispelling chromes, but good for kiting I guess (not that I'd know anything about kiting I swear!!! Please don't burn me at the stake :D :D)<br />
<br />
Velious...  Lemme think, um, maybe Western Wastes.  What can I say, I'm half-Welsh, I love dragons and there's a-plenty in this zone of all shapes, sizes, and colours.  For people who've never been to Veeshan's Peak, you get to see dragon clones in this zone.  People on Everlore (pre-Velious) always liked to dig up dragon pics, and in Western Wastes, you pretty much see it all.  Some of them are scorching hot, others are really intimidating ie Sontalak.  Also, when you're on cov faction and have to run through WW, you really crap your pants, well I do anyways.  I know, invis, but some dragons see through it, so it's all about getting the adrenalyne pumping and trying to avoid them at all costs.  Temple entrance and the dragon nests are tight too.<br />
<br />
Luclin:  Day after it came out, I went exploring, and stumbled upon Grieg's end.  The moment my pet got transformed into a female ogre, I was like, uh, who's this ugly doofus with a pet's name.  Actually took me time to figure out what had happened, and I nearly jumped my chair when I saw myself as a medusa.  <br />
<br />
The illusion novelty of grieg's wore off fast for me though, so I wouldn't say it's my fave luclin zone.  I think I'd go with Sanctus Seru just because of the fact that it's so picturesque.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">BTW, about skyfire, call me sadistic, but I love how &quot;safe&quot; wizard portal is :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Crystal Caverns and Sirens Grotto.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Katta Castellum.  I was in awe when I first saw it.  Interesting layout and history of the zone, for a city.   The only thing I don't like about it, is the skinny ramp that connects the bottom and top levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Low Level:  Paludal Caverns, awesome dungeon zone with TONS of critters and lots and lots of space to crawl around it.  Great xp for a lower level group.  It beats my old favorite of Blackburrow because its so much larger with 20x more spawns.<br />
<br />
Mid Level:  Netherbian's Lair,  again, nice dungeon zone with a lot of mobs,  nice area to crawl around in.  Good coin and xp.  Close to civilization.<br />
<br />
High Level:  Akheva/Deep, love these zones, great for crawling and awesome xp.<br />
<br />
Uber Zones:  Vex Thal has to be by far the best looking zone, its designed in a fairly nice way as well.  But GDI I'd like to see it instead of being blind all the time....</div></div><hr />
