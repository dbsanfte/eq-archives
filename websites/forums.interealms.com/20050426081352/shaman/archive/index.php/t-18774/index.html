<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all<br />
<br />
I normally play 2- 3 hours per day - but Im looking for a really boring and easy camp where I can kill the same 1-3 mobs over and over and get a chance to loot a decent valued item (like in the 10K and up range)<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that very often Im watching my young son, I frequently need to go AFK - so a camp like this would be great for me.<br />
<br />
Currently Im a level 65 Shaman - 3000 hps 1020 AC self buffed - not great but not too dreadful.  I have Q and all the best DoT's.  No epic or JBB.  (sold JBB to pay for Q :))<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

thast going to be hard... why dont you get a group and head to droga... and kill named they get you like stuff worth 7k + and the goblins drop about 20pp per kill.. also they have a chance of dropping a rare quest piece that might sell for a few</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dugok Grumblehawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Head to droga and go to the Runri camp.  That camp would be trivial for you, you could go afk whenever you liked and the named has a chance of dropping a belt that is 25k (atleast on Karana).  It's common drop is a dagger which is only worth a K or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Killed runri about 10 times, never seen the belt. Best advice is do the jepal camp which is located in the table room, look in the 'droga nameds' thread on this page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
<br />
You can camp the stampeding piglet in Tactics.<br />
Drops range from a War Marshall's Bladed Staff (sells 7k easily), a Tactician's Bulwark (9-12k), Blood earring of rage (20-25k), or Adjutant's Saber (2-3k).  Spectral parchments are also a common drop, which MQ for about 3k on E. Marr right now.  Only downside is all but the specs are Lore, so you either need a friend to come pickup stuff or make a quick bank run to toss stuff in the shared bank slots after a kill.  I've seen 3 WMBS drop in a row before.  Stampedes are a random event, but you will generally see one every hour or so.  You can easily solo the 2 static spawns in the room outside the stables using root/rot techniques.  VP3 makes this trivial to do.  You can pull pit or back hall mobs as time/mana allows, just keep a reserve of mana ready in case of a stampede so you don't miss any opportunities.<br />
<br />
You can park yourself pretty safely in a corner (wanderers won't aggro) and AFK as necessary, but you do have to pay attention, as there isn't alot of time if you miss a stampede message.  Competition for the spot is somewhat stiff, as it seems a favorite spot for druids or necros who afk there w/ some macro or something that let's them know when the stampede call comes.<br />
<br />
I personally solo &amp; group there still for exp, and the drops from piglet are a nice bonus.  I've made alot of cash at this camp both soloed and grouped, and it is very convenient if you need to afk a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd say droga.  The safest camps would be, as someone else mentioned, Runri, and Earth Seer Gamolk as well.  Both have spots nearby where you're entirely safe &amp; could afk indefinitely (if not for other people and the silly/stupid things they do).  Flame Master Jepal and King Dronan are slightly riskier camps but with better rewards, Jepal's boots go for up to 15k on my server and the CHoS up to 18ish, with a great demand for the hammer to boot.  All mobs are singleable, no need to kill their friends as well.  Respawn is 20 minutes.  For the King you need to stand directly behind him or his PH, up against the wall in the corner.  Can't move from this spot, and I've heard shrink helps.  Also can't melee at all, as this will push him just far enough out to aggro his friend on the other side of the oven.  For Jepal, just stand on the table slightly east of him, slow from there &amp; fight him from there - neither will run, both have mobs nearby enough, as does Gamolk, but you'll need root and/or snare for Runri.  Pet is an absolute no-no for King, and I wouldn't recommend it for Jepal either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would have to say droga or seb.<br />
<br />
Droga you can go to just about any of the named camps and there are places that you can go afk with no fear.<br />
<br />
Same with seb really, there are lots of camps, that you can get nice loot, and can go afk with very little fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kukgulano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dis be Kukgulano callin at ya!<br />
<br />
One of my spots I hunt in on those situations now is Veksar.  There are very few wanderers in the zone, and the aggro range on the mobs there is small compared to other zones I have seen.<br />
<br />
Although there are more than a few static PH camps, I like to head to the one that drops the Kylong Leggings.. which sell quickly for around 10k on my server.<br />
<br />
Hunting in Veksar means alot of undead.  So get you IVU potions ready, and your Velium Strike, Epic and Bane.  No poision based dots will work on these undead.  Camping the Soulscream Belt camp is also doable, but really hard to break alone.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Veksar is perfectly dull and safe soloing - if you want 100% risk free, go to the church area - there are 3 named that spawn within a tiny area, all are utterly single pullable, there are no wanderers to add, and keeping all 3 cleared is yawnably easy. The loot is pretty gimp, from about 1k items (Naraithus, Bow of Gloaming) up to 5k items (Ribbon of Empathy, Mantle of Ill Omen) and a few in between (Dented Kunzar Helm, Moss covered leggings, Moss covered handwraps, etc). Not exactly gonna make you ricj, but safe as houses and easy as pie. If you want more action, there is another named close by that can be single pulled with care, and another couple that can be got to without too much effort, so you can keep as many cleared as you can be bothered with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For Veksar you'll need your curse dots from LDoN, and I would go to the chef camp or do the theatre if you can.   Theatre is boring as hell, but there is a chance for the ring of dark intellect to drop which is worth about 10-20k depending on your server, plus a good chance that words of Torment will drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You don't necessarily need LDoN dots - if you are patient, dogdog and epic will get the job done...I should know heh heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you can get the camp you can also go to Velks and camp what we call on my server the US (Upper Spider) camp.  It's a ledge near the top of the icy ramps.  With your back to the wall, immediately to your left is another ramp up that's slick and you will slide up it that leads to a bunch of spiders.  Directly in front are a grouping of 3 spiders and around the ramp to the left is a 2 spawn of spiders.  There is also the named Frenzied Velium Broodling that spawns here.  YOu can't see it from the camp spot but if you pull the 2 on your left and move to where they are the PH/named is right next to those.  I spent 5 hours here (my main purpose was getting threads for the 5th shawl) and killed the named 4 times.  I got 2 Silver Chitin Hand Wraps (lore so a guildie looted one) and 2 Silver Chitin Bracers (sold them for 7k each).  I also got 3-4k in velium and a few assorted velious armor qest gems.  All in all, after selling in the bazaar (took one night) I made about 18k for the 5 hours.  I also got 50% of an AA.  Sure, not as good as Inner Acrylia or Droga solo xp but it's better than nothing.  It's definately a laid back camp as there aren't any walkers and everything single pulls with slow at 65.  I only used slow and blood of saryrn plus dogdog.  It's hard to get this camp even now however.  I was lucky to zone into velks and find it empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have wanted to get the US camp for sometime but i always find something else to do before i can get there.  I need Chitin bracers for my twinks and handwraps for a few twinks also.  On inny is pretty much hit or miss:  there is either 24 players in Velks or no one.  Maybe i will hit it up this weekend but i seem to be pulled toward getting Zimmie to 65 before camping for alts.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another underutilised soloing zone is Greig's End - it is as empty as Veksar, possibly moreso, everything is dark blue. As far as I can tell, everything is potentially a PH for named that drop items in the 1k (Crappy helm) - 20k (book) range, and everything in between. 90% of mobs are single pullable (except, ironically, zone in mobs haha), if not root splitting works well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Inner Acrylia (in Acrylia Caverns) is another option.  You can sit in the back of the jail and nothing will get you while you are afk.  From that spot you can pull a PH or the Grimling Sage, who drops gimling earbone, or something like that.  After him, you can either wait for the Grimling High Priest (or his PH) to come wandering through, or you can start pulling common mobs from the next room over.  The only not lazy part is fighting the Grimling High Priest (he nukes hard, and CHs himself sometimes) but if you don't want to deal with him, just pull everything to the back of the jail and you'll be fine.  For info on how to get to IA, as well as info on all the other mobs there, check the Inner Acrylia thread in this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gulbane -One other option for you to consider would be The Crypt of Nadox. <br />
  <br />
   Zone in from the caverns so you are at the 3 elemental spawn . Shrink 2x invis, jump in the lava and swim untill you see the bridge. Climb the right bank of the lava river about 15 feet prior to the bridge. Cross bridge going to the left side of lava  river.<br />
<br />
  After crossing the bridge  you will see 3 tunnels to choose from. Take the center one, it'll open up into a large cavern/ room of Luggalds - this room has 4 side rooms ( one in each corner) and a tunnel on each side. <br />
  <br />
   The tunnel you want is the continuation of the one you originally used to get there. Once you have exited the largish cavern of luggalds you are in a rather short hallway, this hallway is the safe spot for your upcomming loot farm. Has no wanderer's, no spawns and can go indefinetly afk. <br />
<br />
    The room just after this hall is your target area, has 1 wandering mob who will path up to the tunnel entrance, but no further also has 7 static mobs, any one of whom can pop as a named ( read loot droppping) mob  &quot; An Undead Weoponsmith&quot;  his loot table is a weak charm  * Rusted Sword hilt *  or   * Cracked Darkwood  Bow of Suffering *  and rarely a * Sand-Eroded Shell *. The shell is the big money item here- easily 8-10k on  my server  ( Tarew Marr ). <br />
<br />
  In addition there is a chance for another named to spawn in this camp  &quot; 1st Mate Bresanev&quot;.  He spawns off the death of a previous mob- i.e.- when the corpse hits the ground the 1st Mate shows up and says *hi*. Bresanev's loot table is  * waterlogged britches* and rarely  * Gem-Inlaid Longsword*. Britches fetch anywhere from 1.5k to 3k, sword 10k-15k. All mobs in this  room drop 7pp-13pp + 2/3 zombie skins, some gems as well  ( ruby / fire emerald / sapphire / diamond / blue diamond ) sometimes you'll get a decayed coin-purse, pouch of bone dust or a sand eroded trinket, vendors pay 9pp, 95pp and 23pp respectively for these. If you have the room to stockpile and save them the zombie skins can be sold to tradeskillers in vendor mode for 2-5pp per skin, and they DO add up. Room is simple, cash is decent and can make about 1 orange aa bubble per hour no muss, no fuss and no stress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ohaern,<br />
<br />
I just tried this camp, and tried 8 times to slow the 1st mob I saw - all were resisted.  Was the camp &quot;fixed&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hehe, I was just at that very spot pulling luggalds from the other direction to get the last comp for the blood of nadox spell quest.  Maybe it's a good thing it was late and I didn't feel like trying the critters mentioned here?  I'd like more info on this because the entire time I was in Nadox I never saw another person in the zone and I could see returning to that spot on the rare occasions I want to solo with loot potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chelesa_Reborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you go into Nadox through the castle in Gunthak, invis up at the zone.  There is an imaginary wall there that you can run right through.  This will put you in a room with light blue conning trolls.  Instead of running straight into the next hallway, take a left and follow it all the way down.  You will come to a little rock room with nothing in it.  This is where I set up when I was camping for the blackened vial for the Blood of Nadox quest.  Broken skull adherents and initiates are in the first room as you look out of the rock area.  Taking it pretty easy, I can clear about 5 or 6 mobs before there are repops.  Quite often a named spawns there, Dulein Gadasai.  He drops a few caster things, not great but can go for 1-2k usually and pretty fast.<br />
<br />
In this same area is a pretty rare spawn.  I'm not sure if this is the only place he spawns but it's the only place I've seen.  High Priest Grumsalot.  He will spawn the second another mob dies right on their corpse.  The two times I have killed him he has dropped a saltwater idol which I had a heck of a time selling in the bazaar.  But he can also drop a ft1 caster shoulder item.  http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11678  He's a very easy kill.  You can sit in that stone room for hours undisturbed by mobs if you wanted.  There are better camps in Nadox but here the cash is pretty good, the drops are ok, not bad for little effort.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gulbane - To my knoweledge nothing has been changed in nadox . I took a freind down there last night to see, she is a 65 shaman, had no problems. I tried the undead that are further down the left side of this room, again no problems. Could just be a  bad run of luck with mob resist checks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When I was down there, I was 61 or so and I just pulled with Malo.  I did have some problems landing slow until I started pulling with Malo.  That fixed all of my problems.<br />
It was a great camp since you can go afk and come and go as you please.</div></div><hr />
