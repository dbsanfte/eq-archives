<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do you think its possible to do PoD, PoI, PoN or PoJ with that combo?  I have been hunting in LoY which is loaded with good stuff .. just wanted to take advantage of PoP zones if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll assume you aren't uber.  Given that, I think you'll be able to manage PoN yard trash.  Though I'm not sure it's the best place for you.  At 51, you need to take a good hard look at the Plague camp in DL.  You can easily solo it and it should be decent xp through 53.<br />
<br />
With a Warrior, you may have aggro issues.  The fights will probably be long and your slows may not stick so well.  Also, the mobs run at low health.  You'll need to either root them (removing the benefit of fighting them from behind) or have some sort of snare.  The Inny clicky snare necklace thing is hardly noticeable on these bad boys.<br />
<br />
You could definitely do PoJ.  I personally just hate the zone.  Too cramped and too camped.  <br />
<br />
On my server (Zeb) PoI is a nightmare.  The zone-in is overcamped to the 10th power.  The xp is good, the mobs are cool, but you're gonna get trained like mad.  Maybe someone knows a spot you could duo away from the zone-in and I'd love to hear it.  So far, I haven't been more than 50 feet into the zone.<br />
<br />
I wrote off duoing in PoD for now due to the benefit/risk factor.  You'd be doing yard trash and if you're gonna do yard trash, you might as well be doing it in PoN where the trains only run once every 5 minutes instead of every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
I've been duoing with an SK in PoN since 54.  At 56, with BoN, it's starting to be more worth the risk.  We are doing the hedge now and it's pretty decent.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully, you'll garner something useful from this.   ;)   In short, there's better places for you at 51 than the Planes.  It's cool at first, but quickly turns into just plain old grinding like every other zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your probably better off going to dulak or jaggedpine at your level. Either case you'll need to root or snare runners. But the xp probably isn't to much worse than you'll get in pop due to downtime and the loot is better, especially in dulak.</div></div><hr />
