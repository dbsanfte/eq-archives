<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am deployed to Okinawa, the land where everything in the water will kill you...I arrived here in May, suspended my playing on EQ in late may.  Have I missed anything important?  Any real changes I should be concerned about?  I would go to Casters Realm but my pc at work for some reasone blocks that web site.  I do know about the pet thing, and IM excited about that, and Ive hear rumours of other big changes, but Im stll concerned.  The last big patch sony put out was a killer for me.  It was the one that left every slacker who didnt buy PoP access to pok and forced me to run eq in 98 compatability mode, that or I had to avoid pok due to freeze up each and every time I went there..Drop me a line and let me know if there is anything I should be concerned about..The cable man comes this morning which is the 17th at 0900 Okinawa time..I imagine my first few hours will be spend doing downloads..grrrrr...but tonight, when I get off duty, Its on!..I can hardly wait...Plane of Mischief, here I come!</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't think that it would be worth it for you until you ding 65.  That is... if you are doing it for the points and experiece.  If the only thing that you care about is the experience, then it might be worth it for you (until 65 then it's worth to do it for whatever you want).</div></div><hr />
