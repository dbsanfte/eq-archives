I'm hoping I dont somehow get conjuration to pop over one day and be screwed. I <br />
would like to get some info on this so perhaps it will actually do a little bit of good.  <br />
I appreciate any help you have to offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dude your lvl 62?  One casting skill can go over 50 .. the rest will cap at 50 I believe .. ya sure you dont have another skill maxed?<br />
<br />
I hope your kidding =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">go to your trainer, put 1 point into the rest of your specializations (divination, abjuration, evocation).  Then cast your alteration spells over and over until it goes over 50.<br />
<br />
If you have points in all your specializations and they are all at 50 and none will go over.  Do a /bug and do the quest to reset them.<br />

Actually im 63 now.  And no, none are over 50, I only put points into the 2 above mentioned Specializations.  NONE ARE OVER 50 OR EVEN STARTED.</div></div><hr />

You'll need to put one point into each (not just alt and conj) of the spec's before one will go over. Once you've done that, just chain cast whatever spec you want until it goes over the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks, never put much thought into those but you tend to think of these things when your bored at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can just imagin the amount of mana that you wasted ... Then again in the KEI world maybe its not that big of an issue.  Specilization is/was a very important skill way back when you blew ALL your mana per mob =)<br />
<br />
According to http://eq.castersrealm.com which you should visit everyday =) they posted that specilization ...<br />
<br />
It will reduce the mana used on the spell. <br />
It will reduce the chance of fizzling. <br />
<br />
At 63 it might not be such a big issue but i am sure if there was something you could do to reduce those 2 things, I bet ya would =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lol I knew  a druid that never trained in Channeling until like level 58. He was bitching to a Monk friend of ours about how all his spells were getting interupted. The monk asked him what level his channeling skill was at and the druid was like whats that for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HAHA  I think i goto castersrealm too much as a matter fo fact.  I knew the benefits of specialisation but thought it was bugged because it wasnt going over 50.  We'll see tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A level 1 spell and a level 65 spell have the same chance of making a skillup for you.  Get yourself a KEI for the WIS buff, put on every WIS piece you own, find a quiet zone and cast minor healing on yourself for an hour or two, to get your spec skill up near max.</div></div><hr />
