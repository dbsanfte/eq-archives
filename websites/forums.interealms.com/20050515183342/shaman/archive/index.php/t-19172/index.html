<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you fall asleep while playing, or for any other reason, spaz into the next room, eat the death -- DO  NOT come back to the group.<br />
<br />
This is mostly for the new people.<br />
<br />
In 2 years of playing, I have done this before, and seen it done, including last night, and just wanted to pass this along. <br />
<br />
If you wander and get reamed, its just blam, a rez, and back to fighting, if you wander BACK, its a wipe.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well my view is - If Im at the keyboard falling asleep then the groups killing too slowly and deserve to wipe.<br />
<br />
If its due to alchol however...........train em, wipe and blame it on the booze next day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe we were clearing VT the other week and had just taken out Blob 1.  Half the guild is on the west stage waiting for COH, the other half is already COH'd, and one person drops their keyboard on the floor and hits the autorun button.<br />
<br />
We all watch in horror as she runs across the room, pulls about 6 Eoms and Plis through the wall, and turns to run back to us.  Fortunately she came to her senses and died in place.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise I would make fun of him every day.  I'm his brother and play on Rodcet Nife as well, and am in FoD.  Good to see another shm from RN on here :)</div></div><hr />

I charged a boss in VT once because I nodded off before the raid moved to the boss.  <br />
<br />
I woke up because the mob was hitting me and saw in /gu &quot;Gart aggro&quot;.  I turn and look and the whole raid is lined up down the hallway just staring at me.  <br />
<br />
That was a shining moment in my EQ career.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There's actually quite a few from RN here, most are just abit quiet bout it.  I can think of 3 or so others who regularly post.</div></div><hr />

/g sorry, I am an idiot.<br />

Outside of invis dropping and getting pummled, I have only had to use this once.  Beer fell out of my hand and hit the auto-walk key on it's way down to my newly steam cleaned carpet.  By the time I noticed my nice sized train, there was really nothing left to do but hit the button, and /gu umm...  Could I trouble anyone for a rez?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've told this story a couple of times:<br />
<br />
Soon after the release of Luclin and the implentation of the /facepick command, I'm in a guild raid in The Deep, we're going after THO.<br />
<br />
We're slowly clearly our way there and I'm getting kind of bored. I start experimenting with the facepick command, hair color, eye color, braids, woad, no woad...<br />
<br />
I can't really see myself, so I change the camera view. Then, I hit numlocks and ran right down the hallway into about 10 mobs. I didn't train the raid, but man, it was pretty horrifying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">lol lucky wasnt many people to see this. Had just gotten my pallies aa horse. My friends had gone for the night and the zone was quiet finished the AA  up and summoned the horse. Ran around the spire a few times and decided was going to get the house closed and locked for bed. You catch the auto run on the way afk and the angles right with the horse running ......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just remembered something funny that happened on a raid. A guildmember started acting very strange. He did not wander off very far though but said some uncomprehensible stuff (like hitting the keyboard at random).<br />
<br />
A few seconds later he starts cursing his cat for running on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Would have been funny if his cat had trained the raid though :D</div></div><hr />

What does numberlock do?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A LONG time ago, I was leading a raid in the Hole... going for something in the Undead Tower... can't remember what exactly... but anyway...<br />
<br />
I did the normal &quot;ALL FOLLOW&quot;... and ran ahead.  I turned while running to make sure people were following.  I got turned around and didn't realize which direction I was facing.  Instead of leading the raid to the hot tub room, I led them into the open area in front of the waterfall room... and about 10 MOBs.  Like good raid-goers, they all followed me assuming I knew what I was doing.  &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Questos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On KB the server router was messing up. <br />
<br />
I was playing my necromancer alt way before LoY came out. I had a group with goblins in HHK. My group was working down to WR (think thats the name) i was lagging behind,i figured i let the tanks get agro first incase of spawns then i go in. By then the router played up and my group all started running into the WR room so i followed with out thinking twice. I then stopped and i looked at my RED ping bar turn green as a group member said OMG and realize i was in the middle of the room with full spawns. I FD instantly with 10% hp to spare. The server went down. <br />
<br />
The server went back up 10 minutes later and i logged my necro back in. As i got back in i was agroed and i reFD a bit closer to the door. LD again. I spent about 15 attempts of trying to escape but the router kept playing up so i went ld 15 times. In the end i made it to the stairs and gave up.<br />
<br />
The next day i decided to see if my necromancer lived from the last night Crash. I sighed in relief as i saw him in the character select screen full clothed and still in HHK and logged him in.<br />
<br />
I saw my toon falling from the sky and i looked down. I was spawned at the ceiling and dropped onto the courtyard at 30% Hp. I died instantly.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story, keep an eye on your Ping and don't try getting out until router is working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LOL I just did something like this. I was bringing up a stalking probe to scout ahead and did not wait for it to actually be called up yet. G/f had just given it to me and was my second time using it, ran into a Tak room with 7 mobs in it. luckily the rest of the regular party just stood and laughed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Talk about funny guy i knew in real life after playing for a year, wanted to do something in OoT and was swimming there. Well as he told me he had to go to the bathroom bad, so he called his 9 year old into the room and had him hold the run button till he got back. My god did me and the other 4 people standing there die laughing, he didn't know about autorun. Can still picture him standing there telling his son, you better hold that button.<br />
<br />
As far as falling asleep and wandering, I still think some of the people in my former guild thought i was a tanking shaman, as usual our raids got boring and I would drowse off only to find myself standing in front of some mob getting whuped on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">heh, another horrid pickup group for a MM adv. (I ALWAYS seem to get the retards/drinkers/people who never passed grade school.) The group was disfunctional in the first place. We had NO CC, and our MT was a ranger. So we just pulled as fwe as possible and hoped for the best. Well, our puller was getting impatient, so he pulled practically an entire room. Well, things where going bad cause i was OOM and had no HP to heal, the druid was OOM, nothing he can do about it. So the ranger runs, but he doesnt run towards the door, no.... he runs right into an uncleared area. About 15 seconds later, its like PC all over agian. He hells help, runs towards the group, dies, everyone gets whiped except me, i was on the other side of the room luckily. Just another reason Clerics are required...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Clerics are not required.  I do fine as a healer so long as my group can communicate.  I don't offer mana messages, I tell them how may I can take in a pull (ie: &quot;good for 3&quot;) and I go from there.  It gives them a clear picture of what they should or should not be pulling.<br />
<br />
I've had some very crappy luck with PU groups lately.  The only good groups have been with &quot;old school&quot; players (not uber, but just a bunch of folks who have played for 3 or more years, some very casual).<br />
<br />
One tip I've learned that I will share is if a friend offers you a group, even after you've accepted a PU grp invite, quit and join the friend.  Everytime I've tried to do the honourable thing and stick with the invite I get hosed with a crappy group.  I keep thinking that even if I lost with friends I'd enjoy it more because they're peeps I like being with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Questos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah whats up with players who have a urge to get up and wonder around while every ones lom/oom and low on health? <br />
<br />
I seen a rogue that didn't ask the bard or ranger how close named was in LDON and decided to try and sneak past the mobs to see if named was in next room. Luckily the rogue died standing but slowed down the group from finnishing the ldon.<br />
<br />
As for those probs GOD i hate them. In one guild we had this stupid mage who like to wander around during pulls or during med break and get agro and get snotty when he/we die. The guild officers didn't do any thing but what bothered me is that the mage kept summoning those probs and didn't sit and always end up running into the room filled with mobs so i use to kill the probs as he casted.</div></div><hr />
