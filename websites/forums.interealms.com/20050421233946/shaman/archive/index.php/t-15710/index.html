<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is a shame you do not have LoY because Dulak is the perfect zone for you to solo. Once you get that, as you intimate you will soon in your post, you should move along there and play the boats. There are many posts to give you some ideas in this section so check them out.<br />
<br />
In the interim, you can try and solo the entrance mobs at Veksar, although I am not sure if you will be able to single pull. They are quite spaced out though, so if you are careful you can have some fun and get good xp. If things go sour gate is always your friend.<br />
<br />
Seb (if you have your key) is fun, but the entrance mobs come in pairs at your level. Root one and take the other one on with pet, dots, nuke, etc. keeping root up on the other.<br />
<br />
Can't really think of other places for your level, but I hope these ideas are useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wudlaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just finished level 52 in Burning Wood at the giang fort. There is a 2 spot at the front that is pretty easy to break up and there are 6 more that spawn inside. The forest Giant Ancients have roughly 4500 hit points and are the toughest of the spawns. The Arbors, after slowing, can be solo'd by our dog. Verdants are a little tougher than Arbors. Spawn time is 5 minutes. The loot is usually up to 7 plat and some vendor stuff which sells pretty well. Ancients drop spells too and there are chances for spell drops. Hope this helps. Now where to go at 53? <br />
