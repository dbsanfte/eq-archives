<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No not a bug.  Sometimes zones just crash.  It should be up and available sooner or later.  I had PoI crash the other day when we were killing in the factory.   Also had LOIO crash when helping a monk friend with an epic.  So don't worry, it will be up later.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At times, Verant has Ultra rare mobs that have great items.  When they spawn, the programmers don't want &quot;just anybody&quot; to get the loot, so they put in code to drop the zone.  The &quot;Tanning Oil of exceeding Worth&quot; drops off Firiona Vie when she spawns on the beach of Cleric Island in TD.  Since the +150fr that the oil gives was too much, they just drop the zone whenever she takes a vacation, rather than nerf the drop.</div></div><hr />
