<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the 8th Cudgel - Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients, I'm looking for info on the An Iksar Apparition.<br />
<br />
Does he have his own separate timer (if so, what does it look like?  A week?) from the stuff in the room?  Or does he have PH's.<br />
<br />
Went down with some people earlier and cleared the room twice..no spawn.<br />
<br />
Would be kind of annoying to have to get him on server up...cause everyone and their brother tells me &quot;yeah i saw him, he aggro'd me so we had to kill him.&quot;  Niiice.  :(<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated, thanks!</div></div><hr />

Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He doesnt have any ph in that room, he spawns next to the wall with the gap in it, on the right as you come through the passage towards the altar.<br />
I think i saw mentioned he is on a 4 or 8 hr spawn time<br />
Good luck with the final battle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Respawn seems to be 8 hours.  Went down in hopes of completing the quest for a friend.  He was killed a few hours before we arrived, and didn't show up on tracking till 8 hours after the time we had been told it had died.  :(</div></div><hr />
