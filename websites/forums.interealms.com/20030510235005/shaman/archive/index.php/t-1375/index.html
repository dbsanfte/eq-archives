<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i have the drop from Xalgoz and the changeling essense, going to get the stuff from the named froggy. Tried to kill him yesterday but he was lvl 55 and more difficult than the named mob in FM. I killed the FM mob with just my 52 warrior and 53 shaman. The named froggy was definitely more difficult. Was just my warrior , shaman and friends 55 sk and we tried him for the heck of it. He hits alot harder but can be slowed just took 2 attemtps at slowing him after debuff and my friends sk was to low of health by than and went down than shammy got summoned and went down so bring a few more heh. <br />
<br />
     Anyway my question i thought it said it could be mq'ed on the items and my wizard has the blackened bones from VSR from doing a raid there but a friend got his druid to close to the oracle that you turn into and got killed in 3 hits. We werent doing the turn in yet and just happen to be in fob and i think he didnt know that oracle was there. So since he is kos to people not on cab faction Mq'ing seems like it will be difficult. Am i missing something? My wizard is erudite and while she isnt Kos she is threatning in con. Am i going to need to either raise her faction or get my shammy on a vsr raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok first off threatning is still KoS they will still attack your wiz you need a faction of at least Dubious. Now a trick to get indiffrent is once you hand the item to the Npc but befor you click give have someone invis your wiz. I am in the same Boat but its buddies SK that has the blackend boans. Bit easire there he can run up and FD then give the items to him. <br />
<br />
Some info on the frog Hits for 241max and can Dulb attk procs snar. He didnt even take 2 bubs of hp from a 60 ogar war. I would add a clr to you group and let the war pull to help maintain aggro and you should have NP next time.<br />
<br />
Now my question is dose anyone have any info on the VSR that pops in HS?<br />
<br />
Good luck everyone</div></div><hr />
