Surefall Glade (AP) - After hitting his career peak 2 years ago, Goldeneyes winning both a Dark Cloak of the Sky and a Bow of Doom, it has been nothing but a downward spiral for a fallen star. After his fifteen minutes of fame were used up in a blink of an eye, Goldeneyes the ranger has turned to a life of drugs, alcohol, and prostitution.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don't know how it all started,&quot; Goldeneyes told the press. &quot;One day I was like OMG check out my Bow of Doom, the next thing I knew, I was sitting in the cave next to the poacher in Surefall Glade downing a 40 of Captain Morgan's and sobbing helplessly on his shoulder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Today, Goldeneyes is in rehab at Betty Ford, where he still fights bouts of withdrawal from his life of debauchery. &quot;Sometimes I just stare at the wall and click my Dark Cloak of the Sky incessantly,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Good luck to a recovering Goldeneyes. Next week, we will visit another thread to ask &quot;Whatever Happened To This Ranger?&quot;<br />
