<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a repost from my guild's boards. I wondered who has input/education for me as we don't have too many enchanters at the moment, and are in the process of recruiting some. This seems the best place for advice on this matter:<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's the scenario: The group consists of one shaman, one enchanter, and at least two tanks. For this scenario we're going to assume both tanks are capable of being the MA, if needs be.<br />
<br />
We're fighting tougher mobs - hitting in the 200 - 400 range. On 'incoming' the puller calls an add.<br />
<br />
The shaman starts casting malxxx, the enchanter is ready to Tash (both low enough on the hate list to not pull aggro - usually). Slow begins to cast right about as the first mob is as camp. Three seconds later, the mob is usually slowed, and the add is unslowed and wailing on the tank. Complete heal has already started.<br />
<br />
What do you do about the second add? There seem to be three main options here, and I'd like to know what is the general concensus?<br />
<br />
1) The second tank pulls the add away, and we fight it as normal - malxxx, tash and slow.<br />
<br />
2) The enchanter mezzes it, then the shaman slows it.<br />
<br />
3) The shaman slows it, then the enchanter mezzes it.<br />
<br />
Personally, I vote for three. The reason being with mobs as hard as the ones we are fighting, a resisted mezz means almost certain death for the Enchanter as the cleric would be mid CH as the enchanter pulls aggro, and honestly the shaman heal is unlikely to get off before the enchanter dies, even with Chloroblast, our quick heal.<br />
<br />
If the slow gets resisted, the shaman will pull insane aggro, and the enchanter will get at least 2 mezz attempts (in my experience) before they go to the top of the hate list and pull aggro from the shaman. The shaman should be able to survive that long.<br />
<br />
So it seems to be a simple choice - both the enchanter and the shaman are crowd control, but the SAFEST way to do it seems to be for the highest AC/HP character to take the aggro, then let the enchanter do their work.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here? Do the enchanters in the guild have some advice on why it's better to let them mez first? This is an important issue for us as we are now mostly fighting the higher end mobs that kill the casters in one round - we need a very tight strategy to survive. I'd like us to know these things before we group together, so we can get straight down to business.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any input - no flames if I'm making some dumb assumptions please :)</div></div><hr />

Slow MA mob and then slow add as soon as possible. Let the enchanter get on to do their business. You worry about getting the mobs slowed.<br />
<br />
If the enchanter mezzed the mob after I slowed then I reslow to put myself above the enchanter on the hate list. If slow landed after mez then you will already be top on the hate list. I do this so the mob jumps me when mez breaks and makes life easy for the enchanter. <br />
<br />
An enchanter can stun and mez a mob before you can slow it. Their stun/mez has resist adjusts so they don't even have to debuff first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ditto.<br />
<br />
A wise shaman once told me that Shaman are essentially at raids to save clerics mana.  Quicker slows = tanks taking less damage = clerics casting fewer heals = clerics with more mana for when they really need it.<br />
<br />
Whenever I am making decisions on raids or in hairy exp group situations, my first consideration is always, What course of action is going to reduce cleric mana cost and ergo keep the group alive?<br />
<br />
Obviously if the cleric is ****ty or oom this changes but the above is the rule rather than the exception.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Generally I'll slow the add first and get back to the primary target afterwards. We do not have to be the end-all-be-all saviors of the entire group at all times. Slow the add so the enchanter doesnt get his butt kicked, and let the tank and cleric do their jobs until you get back to mob #1.<br />
<br />
But it can be situational sometimes...if the add is a caster and doesnt come straight to camp (stands back and blasts the puller) then I will slow the first one in camp and then the add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Assuming reasonably tough mobs, I'll worry about helping the enchanter lock down the add before worrying about a mob beating on the main tank. The tank can take a few hits from the unslowed mob, enchanters often can't. <br />
  Whether I cast slow, malo or root first depends on the situation but I certainly wouldn't wait on the Enchanter to mez it before trying to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have to agree with it being situational.  If I trust the chanter to land their mez (this depends on critter and chanter both), I'll see to the 1st mob.  If I think it's remotely possible that the chanter will bite it, I'll slow the add first.  Let it beat me while the chanter does their stuff (whether it's slowed or not), I'll be slowing the 1st mob in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Option #1 isn't really efficient if you have a capable chanter.  Why slow yourselves down that way?<br />
#2 is fine if the chanter is faster than me - as well as high enough level compared to the mob.<br />
#3 is definitely the safe route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&lt; Always assumes the role of chanter protector.<br />
<br />
In the above situation (sounds like the mobs are split), I would slow MA first and then hit the chanter mob with slow.<br />
<br />
If the mobs were pulled together, I would /as chanter, then Turgur (no malos, my job is to either slow the mob or gain aggro so the chanter can do their job), I would then toss a heal to the chanter (if needed and if slow landed), then I would go back and slow the MA mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Assuming 2 tanks, shaman, chanter, healer in the group I would slow the main assist first, then work on slowing the add asap, but let the enchanter do his mez asap as well.<br />
<br />
Depending on what kind of 2nd tank you have, the situation might be different.<br />
Assuming you have warrior/ranger tank as the 2nd tank, both of them on the main target.  Shaman slows main target.  If the add gets mezzed before it's slowed, then yay!  If the mez is resisted, help the cleric heal the enchanter if it's needed.  Only when the extra heals aren't needed asap, I'd try to root the add (it's tashed already.  should be low resist rate) then do malo/slow on the add while the enchanter keeps working on the mez.<br />
<br />
If there's a paly/sk as the 2nd tank, send that tank onto the add but do NOT melee.  That tank only taunt with stuns/taunt ability, or the taunt spells/taunt ability.  Shaman slows main target while the enchanter tries to mez add.  If the mez is resisted, since the 2nd tank is actively taunting the add, it shouldn't matter and the mob should stay on the 2nd tank.  You shouldn't have to watch for the extra heals on the chanter, and can actively slow the add.  You might need to help on heals with the 2nd tank, but probably won't have to.<br />
<br />
Basicly, in any case, slow the main target, heal chanter/cleric/2nd tank as necessary, and then slow add asap when you can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Some quick remarks:<br />
<br />
After such a fast Tash no enchanter is really 'low' on the hate list :) (though hate reduction helps a lot), so depending on the hate generation of the MT, he will draw some attention occasionally.<br />
<br />
Personally i would prefer clerics to come up with some quick heals or HoTs, when adds come in camp, and not timing a CH on the very  last second. In such situations mana efficiency is not so important as buying a bit time to get the situation under control.<br />
<br />
For me it's slowing the MAs target as fast as possible and then switching to add. When you have an experienced enchanter, that is best way to handle, because BOTH mobs normally get under control PARALLEL. A good enchanter should be able to handle even a difficult add, and when things go wrong, you can still switch target and help the chanter out (normally not necessary in my experience).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Unless its exceptionally tough mobs, I normally throw a slow on adds first. Adds without control tends to kill groups first.<br />
<br />
Guess it depends on mana, how good tanks you have and mobs you fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">im in the root one first camp. if its rooted as long as it doesnt summon the chanter will get at least 2 tries at mezz before it comes loose and is whailing on them. after one is rooted i slow the other and then go back to the rooted one. slow and re root.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Slow it, and if that doesn't work, slow it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As described.... you ,malo/slow the first mob on incoming,, the only question is what to do with mob #2.<br />
<br />
My answer is for the melees to stay on the first mob, and let the shaman and enchanter take care of the second one.<br />
<br />
Shaman casts malo/slow which agroes the mob off of the tanks and onto the shaman.(assuming that the second mob didnt just go straight for th shaman when slow landed on the first mob.  if it did, slow it anyway.. you should be able to live long enough to slow a mob anyway)<br />
<br />
The chanter casts mez (assumption is that the shaman malo'd so no need for tash).  Its far easier for the chanter to mez a mob that is beating on the shaman than to mez a mob that is beating on the chanter.  I do not advocate the chanter waiting for any sort of call from the shaman- this is where knowing each other makes the difference.<br />
<br />
You want the agro on the shaman not the chanter, and the melees on the mob to be killed.  The caveat is if the mobs hit too hard for your shaman to survive the agro, then you need to offtank with a melee (loss of dps here) while the shaman and chanter get it under control.  This second option is more dangerous for the chanter due to the possibility of a broken mez.<br />
<br />
In any case with adds, my main priority is to keep em off the chanter.  if the chanter is alive and unagroed and doing their job, the group wins -guaranteed.  If the chanter goes down, we are in trouble -we may still win, but its not guaranteed.  Lose a cleric and I can scramble to heal, lose anyone else, and we can mez while they are rezzed.  lose the chanter and I have to use root to crowd control, IF they are rootable, and IF there is enough room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">On inc I cast slow on the add to separate the pull.  <br />
<br />
While the slowed add is beating on me I'm working on slowing the MA's pull.  IMO with the mobs separated it's easier for everyone to do their job.<br />
<br />
If the chanter can't lock down a mezz right away I can always ghetto mez or kite the add around till chanter has it mezzed.<br />
<br />
I know on non PoP mobs I can just toss a stoch on myself to keep up with adds DMG output.  If you have Torp or Q you'll probably be able to offtank the slowed mob yourself without a problem even in PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I slow it, I don't pay any attention to whether its been mezzed or not.  I will actively try and get agro on adds if the chanter is snoozing though, root park rar!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Depending on what kind of 2nd tank you have, the situation might be different.<br />
<br />
Assuming you have warrior/ranger tank as the 2nd tank, both of them on the main target.  Shaman slows main target.  If the add gets mezzed before it's slowed, then yay!  If the mez is resisted, help the cleric heal the enchanter if it's needed.  Only when the extra heals aren't needed asap, I'd try to root the add (it's tashed already.  should be low resist rate) then do malo/slow on the add while the enchanter keeps working on the mez.<br />
<br />
If there's a paly/sk as the 2nd tank, send that tank onto the add but do NOT melee.  That tank only taunt with stuns/taunt ability, or the taunt spells/taunt ability.  Shaman slows main target while the enchanter tries to mez add.  If the mez is resisted, since the 2nd tank is actively taunting the add, it shouldn't matter and the mob should stay on the 2nd tank.  You shouldn't have to watch for the extra heals on the chanter, and can actively slow the add.  You might need to help on heals with the 2nd tank, but probably won't have to.<br />
<br />
I have seen this work with warriors on raids.  It certainly easier for Paladins / SK's to generate a ton of taunt, and this makes the Enchanter's job easier.  However, to get mobs split for debuff / mez, the warrior can generate enough taunt to help get things started, but if things go bad (resist) they will have a tough time regaining agro off the shaman / enchanter.<br />
<br />
In any case, what Juujuu says here is what I would do.  Use an extra melee to hold agro while debuffers go to town on it.  If mez is in the equation then attack is OFF and they are taunting with spells like Snare and Stun, abilities like Taunt and Beg, and other things like sitting down.  Heck, as long as the group communication is good, the melee could have attack ON provided it was perfectly coordinated with the enchanter.  Then let the debuffers do their job uninhibited :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have a slightly different take on this, depending on whether I'm playing my enchanter or my shaman (both 65).<br />
<br />
Why is the cleric in a CH immediately, though?  <br />
<br />
That's a sign of a &quot;watching TV while playing&quot; cleric, and I would never group with such a cleric.  The clerics that I group with are people who know their class and know the value of fast-heals (at least until everything is under control).  What if the shaman gets a resist on slow?  There are many mobs that will hit hard enough to kill even a high-HP tank before a CH will finish.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, when there is an add, I prefer to malo/slow the add first -- to prevent the enchanter from getting a resist (if malos lands before mez) or to snatch agro (from the slow).  The main tank will take care of himself for a few rounds with no difficulty if the cleric is paying attention.  <br />
<br />
When I play my enchanter, I never worry about what the shaman is doing or what the cleric is doing -- that isn't my concern.  I'll do my best to put the add on ice as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">2 AND 3.   Slowing a mob doesn't break mez.  So I don't see the issue here.  It's generally best to all kill one mob while the other is mezzed then kill the mezzed.   You split camps this way and kill faster 'cause dps all on one mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Try a cripple instead if you have the space to keep it memed... Cripple is the aggro king!<br />
If I don't have the space, I'll root the mob (if it's susceptible) so that when mez breaks it doesn't come after anyone. Only on a non-rootable mob, with no space for cripple, I'll toss another slow to up the hate-list.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thank you for all the replies.<br />
<br />
I think I could have stated my position a little more clearly. At the moment, as soon as the first mob is slowed I move to the add. I always slow the add as soon as possible, no matter what.<br />
<br />
My question is more regarding whether our enchanter should be holding off on attempting a mez BEFORE I get that slow off on the add (resisted or otherwise), not whether I try to slow it or not - I will always slow it ASAP.<br />
<br />
Why is the cleric in a CH immediately, though?<br />
<br />
Honestly, I group with the best cleric I've ever played with. He's extremely good at his job. The reason we get into CH so early is our MA is also our puller. Throw in the initial whacks from the unslowed mob, a stun, and a few nukes on him and by the time he's at camp he has to be thrown a CH. We've tried it with smaller heals and it doesn't work. I'm very confident with our cleric. If there were a more efficient way to do it, he'd find it.<br />
<br />
As for rooting the add on incoming, my concern is that the add is then rooted on a path between the hunting grounds and camp. This has sometimes led to a passing mob getting aggroed and further messing us up. I've gotten gun-shy about parking adds on route to camp for just that reason. I don't THINK it's an issue of how we're pulling, but I'll look into the possibility, it may be the way to go.<br />
<br />
The suggestion of slowing the add first may also work, as I could step away from the pull spot and root/mez where the mob can't reach the tanks until we want it to. Then I could get back next to the MA and slow the engaged mob - by which time I doubt if my slow will pull aggro anyway. I'm guessing we can get the timing down so the CH has just hit by the time I'm returning to the first mob, so it would be safe. I'll suggest this to the team, it sounds like a good solution.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the replies. I think I'm pretty good at being a shaman, my problem is I'm a total noob when it comes to other classes abilities (apart from warriors as I have an alt), so I'm in the process of learning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">63 Enchanter here. Pov, Bot, HoH are usual hangouts. (COD favo 'cool' zone).<br />
<br />
Two inc. Ok my mentality is &quot;You 5 handle that one, I got this guy.&quot;  /assist MA, then ESC and retarget. If similar named then I Mez the trailer.<br />
<br />
Whoever said Enchanters get stun hasn't played with an Enchanter post Tier-1. Stun is useless in BoT for example and a lot of other places. Enchanters get Word of Morrell which is a MEZ, but only 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
Like Krak said - Root is your friend. Oh and you want aggro? One word - tash. Don't know why, but the reduction of a MOBs MR by 50 pisses them off a heck of a lot more than an across the board 30 reduction in every resist. Go figure.<br />
<br />
Back to the situation at hand. Enchanter is dealing one way or another with the add. I will Mez first. If that fails then root n scoot. Then re-mezz. If second mezz fails then it goes like this:<br />
<br />
/g SLOW / MEZZ RESISTED - TASHING NOW.<br />
<br />
This is a 'heads up' to the group that: a) The add is not locked down, and b) I am about to take a beating (Arcane Rune is long gone by this point).<br />
<br />
I then Tash, root (As I just got summoned) and re-mezz.<br />
<br />
That is a long winded answer to your question.  But to summarize:<br />
<br />
1) MA - never, EVER, switch targets. You have just killed your Enchanter.<br />
2) JuuJuu's method of &quot;Ghetto Tanking&quot; works wonders. <br />
3) Trust in your Enchanter to lock down the second. Now granted there are some crazy resist MOBs (Kriegers come to mind again), but you have to give them a few seconds to work their magic.<br />
4) As a healer, understand that even if you don't see the Enchanters health going down, they ARE getting hit.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I also have a /g SWITCH SWITCH SWITCH hotkey. This one is VERY situational and is usually used when the MOB I am on is unmezzzable. (Think I created it after a situation in CoD). Now, as I said it is very situational. Grouping with a DoTing class (Drood, SK) generally negates this key / strategy.<br />
<br />
EDIT # 2: IIRC it was an unslowable, unmezzable MOB. One of the Greater Puslings, which for sure are unslowable, like I said - very situational and your group needs to be wired tight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">That's the kind of info that really helps. I believe our enchanter DOESN'T have a resist message hotkeyed - seeing that message would instantly tell me he may be in trouble and needs watching for a quick heal/root. I'll pass on the info.<br />
<br />
Also JuuJuu's non melee taunt looks like a great idea - we'll try it out tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">First: don't slow MA mob first, slow the add first.  Then get around to slowing the MA mob.  The cleric/druid/healer of the group should be competent enuf to outheal the unslowed damage on a tank for the time it takes you to cycle malx/turgurs.  If they're not that competent, boot em.  This is the safest way known to me to control an add.  And I almost never group with an enchanter.  And if I do, the chanter is charming and thus can't be counted on to mez ****.  Shaman is all you need tho.  <br />

That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">When add's are rolling in, I'd rather hold aggro with the shammy than a tank. I know it's a rare occurance, but a few times mezz managed to land between the mob swinging and a tank riposting, which will break the mezz right away, and give the mob over to the chanter. Having the tank turned away from the mob to prevent this, gives most tanks a heart attack suggesting it.<br />
<br />
Then again it also seperates those tanks that just stand on a mobs toes, from those who even in xp groups, will turn a mob to give the pets it's back, and prevent the pets from suffering due to enrage and such.<br />

Malo/Root the add, and work it from there, works for me.<br />

<br />
In the above situation (sounds like the mobs are split), I would slow MA first and then hit the chanter mob with slow.<br />
<br />
If the mobs were pulled together, I would /as chanter, then Turgur (no malos, my job is to either slow the mob or gain aggro so the chanter can do their job), I would then toss a heal to the chanter (if needed and if slow landed), then I would go back and slow the MA mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
In our raids we usually have 7+ active shaman.. so we have 2 peeps malosing, 2 people slowing.. 1 on ma the other on main mezzer.. the rest of the shaman assist slow (for resists) and take care of other things like spoting the ma until the guy is slowed..<br />
<br />
It's funny, we get a post about how overpowered enchanters and bards are and how underpowered shaman are, but then we get posts about how shaman should be protecting enchanters and it has validity at least to some extent.. <br />
<br />
The only real relevant comment I have to say is that enchanters have runes they can take a round or two no problem.. do yourself a favor and debuff the mob before you slow, even if the chanter dies you'll get the mob slowed and it can be dealth with.. and if the chanter lives then he'll mez the guy easier with -55 to resists.. <br />
<br />
The problem is, if the mob resists and puts you as top priority and nails you (its hard to slow when mob is hitting you, so it's gonna happen more often than not).. then if the mob is highly resistant (like sol ro those guys resist mez 4x in a row, seen it often while farming) then the chanter is now super high on the hate list and will die, so the rest are left with an unslowed mob and no chanter/shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I have 2 or more mobs inc, probably the last mob I slow is the ma's mob.  I do this because the 2 tanks I group with can handle unslowed mobs for long time if needed.  The enchanter cant.  Enchanters mezes &quot;seem&quot; to be resisted less than my slows are, but if the enchanter goes down when we have 3-4 500 plus hitters in camp, things get a bit more complicated.  Plus, it's easier for an Enchanter to mez something thats hitting you than them.<br />
<br />
Of course, it all depends on where we are fighting.  Tier 4 mobs in hate, heck, we can wipe out with a 3 pull if we get really unlucky.  Droga, I can do with my eyes closed almost.  Hoh, Tactics, Bot, are all somewhere in between.  Sol c mobs hit like wimps, but are resitant bastages.  Chardok b are probably a bit closer to Droga mobs.  My tactics change slightly depending on where we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hitting for 2 to 4 hundred... why are you using Malo at all is my first question.<br />
<br />
  If it is an area where a root doesn't mean tons of adds, I would be rooting one as soon as it is in aggro range, then slow the other at leisure.<br />
<br />
<br />
  if I can't root one, I would be slowing the first one I targeted, then rooting the other if it gets on the ench and tanking it while I slow.<br />
<br />
  Ideally... I would want to slow the one that the enchie is trying to mez, THEN I would slow for the MA.   But I don't bother wasting time finding out which mob each other person is targeting.  Slows fire as fast as I can maange on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
   And of course I also agree that the cleric should toss a heal over time on the MA when doubel was called, then work on either rooting one to help with CC, or heal the puller to take some aggro themselves.   (a properly played CC cleric is an amazing thing to see, and you will HATE every cleric you ever group with that doesn't do the same once you see it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I'm using Malosi (the 49 one) so the slow doesn't get resisted. In emergencies, I'll go straight with Turgurs and it'll stick much of the time, but as mal doesn't take the aggro from the puller, I cast it as soon as the mob is in range then slow it. Just seems safer than to risk a resisted slow, and helps the others in the group know my rhythm. Apart from the obvious debuffs, the sound and sight of me casting Malosi is our staring gun. May sound weird, but it works for us.<br />
<br />
The rooting doesn't work in many of the places we fight - an example being PoS around the Armadillo camp. While a rooted mob usually doesn't pull any adds, it does occasionally, and that's when the crap hits the fan. Every time I have rooted a mob outside of camp I've been unlucky and pulled more - so I stopped doing it. Now I get them to me, then take them off to one side to park them (when there's no enchanter). Then I get back to the first mob and lay on my dots, refreshing root every so often until we're ready to take the add. As long as I keep my dog in check I don't get summoned, so it seems to work well.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a chance to put the idea of slowing the add first - I'll try it with the group this evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My question is more regarding whether our enchanter should be holding off on attempting a mez BEFORE I get that slow off on the add (resisted or otherwise), not whether I try to slow it or not - I will always slow it ASAP.<br />
<br />
Totally depends on your gear/skills vs enchanters gear/skills. Fact of the matter is the mob needs to be locked down without killing people. Personally i've always slowed everything I see ASAP no matter what. (unless I am main healer) Don't wait on anyone for anything. Your job in a group is to slow ~ do it asap.<br />
<br />
 I've found that most of the time if I get early agro and draw 2-3 mobs onto me at one time ( in the case of alot of adds ) and die, the group will still live on because the chanter had time to mez them all. Generally when the chanter dies before me the group is more apt to wipe. <br />
<br />
Lets face it Mez &gt; slow. Shaman is the speedbump for the chanter/cleric most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Canuus brings up a good point.<br />
<br />
Crowd Control is everyone's responsibility. A Cleric who doesn't have root memmed - well.....<br />
<br />
I don't know about you but my spell lineup rarely if ever includes a buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">For me the fun part is when they (whoever) solo pull you always seem to get the slow in first time everytime, but when the old double pull arrives its like RESIST RESIST RESIST :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">root the add as its inc, slow the one thats beating on the tank, then turn attention to the rooted one. <br />
<br />
never ever ever unmem root unless raiding. ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with Krakster that you should never unmem root.  But, I would take this even farther and say to never unmem root, even when on a raid.  I have been on tons of raids where we are clearing trash mobs and pulling 5-6 at a time and I slow one that doesn't have a tank on it yet.  Root is my best friend.  I love my ornate chain pants!<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding the orignal topic.  Both the enchanter and the shaman should mez / slow as soon as possible.  One of my normal hunting grounds is the SW corner of the pit in tactics.  My typical group is War ( puller and tank ), Clr, Enc, Shm ( me ), Rog, and Rng.  That corner of the pit is bad for adds and we live through 2-3 adds at least 99% of the time.  We once lived through five adds ( not all at once ).  It was crazy seeing 4 mobs mezzed and one root parked.  <br />
<br />
I malos, slow, and optionally root park, every add as soon as I can.  We almost have it timed where spells on the add land like this:  malos, mez, then slow the mezzed mob.  Don't forget to drop a Q on the chanter, cause me doing this has saved our group sooo many times.  Work with the chanter as a team.  Sometimes their mez is resisted and you save them when you pull agro with slow.  Sometimes my malos pulls agro, but then I know the chanter can lock it down with mez easily.  It is just simply a matter of working together.  If you are a HP / AC shaman, you should be able to live through a few hits, and always remember, spell haste items rock for malos and slow.</div></div><hr />
