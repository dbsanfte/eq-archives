Casters Realm is outdated they still have sup healing instead of chloroblast and i jsut went to buy engulfing root and was changed to lvl 255 so they took that away from us.  Guess a new root spell was to over powering.  Thankyou for any help in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As we have now a whoopin 300 hp heal I know im not the only one looking for an upgrade. Face it, in high end gaming our heal spell is considered a joke among the other classes. <br />
<br />
So the the roumors started about PoP I was thrilled to find out we got Superior Healing! Instead i find out that we only get chloroblast. :-(<br />
<br />
I have never played a druid or shammy but from what i read about this spell its a 428 HP heal minus a 10% penalty for non cleric healers which brings us down to 375 :-( <br />
<br />
Please correct me if I understood this spell wrong but atm it feels like an insult.<br />

<br />
Chloroblast is a better form of healing then Superior Healing.  Please check the numerous threads in the Glade that talk about the advantages of it being nealy instant cast, mana ratios, etc.<br />
<br />
BTW the 10 percent penalty was removed for non clerics a few months ago.  Clerics still retain a 5% healing bonus though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raltar</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">chloroblast is way better because it is faster and it has a better heal to mana ratio.  I am so glad we got this instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinuvian Mistwalker</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Chloroblast now. It heals for 428. It IS very nice.<br />
<br />
Or do you not like an extra 128 points healed for 25 more mana and faster cast?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TT-Ranger</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for swift replies fellow rangers.<br />
<br />
Well I did some calculations and of course Chloroblast is 428 hp for 175 mana, a 2.445 hp / manapoint, and Superior healing is 583 hp for 250 mana, a 2,332 hp / manapoint, which makes Chloro slighty more efficient.<br />
<br />
That made me feel a bit better however, i wish eq was that simple.<br />
<br />
If casting Superior Healing 2 times, takes 9 sec total and gives me 1166 hp, and casting Cholorblast 3 times, also takes total of 9 sec and gives me 1284 hp, a better deal by 118 hp.<br />
<br />
But whats not taken in to consideration is fizzles, interupts, recovery etc which affects alot when u playing.<br />
<br />
Point is i rather pack as much hp into each cast , and lose a small amount in the long run, than do alot of small casts. This would be escpecially usefull in fights when ur limited to shorter breaks for complement healing.<br />
<br />
I can see why u like the better hp/mana but im also tired of casting 10 times or so to heal up which I only got time between fights.<br />
<br />
Anyone agree?<br />

<br />
Ever tried tossing a Greater Heal at a caster who's going down fast and have it get there just a split second too late?  My wife's a Wizard and we duo almost exclusively.  Let me tell you that Chloroblast would've saved her on countless occasions.<br />
<br />
Ever tried healing yourself while getting pummeled and get bashed or interrupted because it takes so long for Greater Heal to cast?  I have, way too many times.  Faster heal means you'll have a better chance of tossing a heal on yourself between mobs' attacks.<br />
<br />
Chloroblast is much better than Superior Healing.  The mana/hitpoint ratio just makes it all the more obvious.</div></div><hr />
