<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well Valgoth (He of the Shaman outfit and dogs) spurred me to action.<br />
<br />
So I am in the market for a new VID Card. I can put it in, I can shop - but I am not up to date on the latest and greatest.  And frankly, not really sure I want to fork over $500 for a top-of-the-line vid card.<br />
<br />
(I am getting RAM)<br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Note - I will eventually either continue to play EQ and or move on to W.O.W.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if not you might as well get the best possible and pick up an ATI x800 Platinum or the Nvidia 6800 GT Ultra - depending on your brand preference.<br />
<br />
If you don't really care the Nvidia I think is slightly better, and I have heard most people who are able to run shadows on are Nvidia users. Overall though both cards are good.<br />
<br />
If money is a problem the ATI x700 line is their new mainstream chipset and probably the best bang for your buck</div></div><hr />
