<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently do NOT have Luclin...The whole /auction thing has pretty much shut down, no one buys or sells anymore, except in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
This does not help, because I don't have Luclin...I have EQ and Kunark.<br />
<br />
My question is, can I get Luclin without having Vellious? They sell Luclin at my local store here, and I woul dlike to trade tomorrow... I've never been to Luclin, but dammit, I wanna go.<br />
<br />
So...Can I get Luclin W/O Vellious, or is it a chain or order thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know, you can get Luclin without getting Velious.  Obviously, you can't use the Luclin bus to Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>slitherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can go to velius with out haveing it installed as long as you have luclin but everything looks like a human</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>slitherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">whoops was suppose to be a replay and yes you can all you need is a velious key i ran eq that way for 4 months i lost my velious cd and had to do a clean install</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yes you can all you need is a velious key i ran eq that way for 4 months i lost my velious cd and had to do a clean install<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason you were able to get into velious is that your actual account had been velious enabled when you originally installed it.<br />
<br />
The chap in the thread you were trying to reply to hasnt purchased velious at all, therefore he will not be able to go there as his account has not been velious enabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes you can install Luclin without Velious. Luclin is worth it IMO because of the Bazaar, I really don't hunt in Luclin, I don't care for Luclin other than AA, new models, the Bazaar, and the Nexus. Other than that I really don't use Luclin for anything else. But the deals and gear I was able to pick up because of the Bazaar made getting luclin worth it by 10 fold !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't have Velious, I do have Luclin.<br />
<br />
The only problem I have is my guild is often off doing things in Velious and I can't go...so I spend my time up in Luclin.<br />
<br />
I am quite aware that I am missing some very good zones, and content...but the moon has plenty of stuff for me to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can I use a used copy of Luclin?  or Do I need a brandnew copy for the  cd key?  I want to shop in the bazaar!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, you can't use a used copy of ANY expansion.  When a player registers the expansion with their account that CD key is unusable by anyone else, it stays with the original account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thats what I was afraid of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here's the bad news.  EQ is worthless to a player aiming at the endgame without ALL expansions enabled.  When I started a second account for my TP Biatch, I bought the Trilogy and Luclin for it, that's less expensive.  Without the expansions, your character will have holes in their spells/equipment.  And it doesn't work to get someone else to get it for you, as the good items and spells require that expansion enabled on the specific account for the character.<br />
<br />
Kunark is prime for many spells a shammy MUST have. You can't do WW, ToV and Kael (all are PRIME zones for guilds trying to break into 00berness) without Vellious.</div></div><hr />
