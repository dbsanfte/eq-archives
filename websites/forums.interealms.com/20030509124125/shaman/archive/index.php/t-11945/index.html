<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a troll shaman I like my regen, I have quinessence and cann 5, and notice with replenishment cast on myself I can maintain myself at a higher lvl of mana consistently. So was wondering what kind of regen items there are apart from fungi tunic. Also Does Coldain ring 10 Frostreavers blessing stack with replenishment?<br />
Thanks in advancee.</div></div><hr />

Im not positive on the 10th ring, but Im assuming that since it is a worn effect and not a clicked one it will stack with other worn effects and spells without problems.  I could be wrong on that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 10th ring clicky doesn't stack with the castable Regen series, but it's free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Theres not many that actually stack with Replenishment unfortunately, I can't think of any buyable ones that do, however the boss rat (Can't remember his name, sorry) in the rat caves area of CoD can drop a 1pt innate regen neck item thats 1 groupable, unfortunately the stats on it were somewhat shoddy, theres a few others around such as the Tallon necklace (2pt innate of the top of my head, as well as nice stats), but they all really require a raid force to get.<br />
<br />
Loading up on regenerative boosting items looks like quite an interesting gear route to go though, reminds me of diablo 2 in a way, really heavy focus on regen items plus twisting elemental types (My favorite char was a druid /wince) to get multiple bonus' made pve stuff trivial to the point that I never needed to use potions except for the harder bosses, playing it potionless really did make it quite a lot more enjoyable and certainly a ton more strategic =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Could check out 'Aura of batte' items like (off top of my head):<br />
<br />
Vindi BP<br />
Belt of Dorf slaying<br />
<br />
These add 2hp a tick each but stack with each other and all other forms of regen ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aha yes, add the spirit wracked cords to that list too, painful timesink to get, but they are worth the effort imho.</div></div><hr />
