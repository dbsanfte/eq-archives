<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if you guys get these posts all the time but I figure the guys and gals at Shaman's Crucible are pretty wise..:D <br />
<br />
I am hoping to take my level 51 shammie and a full grp of around the same level to Maidens Eye on Luclin.<br />
<br />
Are we too low for this zone or will will be ok here? Does anyone have advice on the zone?<br />
<br />
I have heard the trains can be very bad here :eek: <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamrox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With a full Group you should be able to hunt in ME.<br />
<br />
Try the Gorangas, they are close to the DSP zone.<br />
<br />
Trains to the Zonelines in ME are always a Problem. If you fight Gorangas fight them a bit offside the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sow your group, then Invis your group and run the the little Lake.<br />
Centi's there are good to figth and will drop some loot every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You should try the Gongas that stand under the tree next to the wall on your left as you exit the zone building.  The Chief spawns there, and he drops Divine Inspiration, an item so 00bear that yer eyes will pop out ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But, in my limited experience, it's damn hard to single pull those guys from the tree at level 51.</div></div><hr />

<br />
51 trying to single pull the Cheif Tree is a pre made wipe unless it is a very good fd puller, and even then, there are many monks who have probs fd pulling on the moon. The little lake ( NE corner ) is a better alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Find a lvl 50 or 51 ranger and tell him to pull some of the  HT mobs in the zone :D<br />
<br />
I watched this one poor fellow die like 5 times before he said he wouldnt pull anymore.</div></div><hr />
