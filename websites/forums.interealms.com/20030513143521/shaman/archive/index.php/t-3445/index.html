<br />
Can you tell me the best possible way to get this piece from the Hole? I can assemble 1 full group from level 51 to 57. We are a small guild with never more than 6 high levels on at one given time so very hard to get more than 6.<br />
<br />
The farthest we seem to be able to get in The Hole is the first pool area (think thats what they call it). <br />
<br />
Is there a walk through of this part and the piece needed from the Planes that can be of some assistance? How long should it actually take to get in The Hole and to Kirn? As time always seems to be a factor with us. I have been stalled on this part of my epic since last October believe it or not and I am tired of waiting friends and really need some help.<br />
<br />
Thank you all very much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's a few ideas:<br />
<br />
First idea - Find another Hole raid. Ask nicely if you can join them. When they kill High Scale Kirn (assuming they do), your group stays in that room and rakes in Phat XP for 2-4 hours while waiting for Kirn to respawn. A lot of people say it's a 4 hour respawn but I've seen him repop in less time.<br />
<br />
Second idea - Find a Mage with Call of the Hero. Get the mage into somebody elses Hole raid, and bind him on the safe ledge outside the undead tower. When you are ready to head in, the mage gates to the safe ledge, and summons your raiders.<br />
<br />
Third idea - Find a Mage with COTH and a low level Brell worshipping Dwarf Cleric. Make a level 1 Brell Halfling Rogue. Drop the cleric into the Hole using DA, and then using ITU the cleric runs to the safe ledge. Kill the mage, and drag their bod to the safe ledge using the rogue (warning - bodies from duels can't be rezzed after 10 minutes). Rez the mage, pay off the dorf. Rest of your group gets a summon to the safe ledge, use ITU to get up the tower. Kill Kirn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fourth idea - find a Ball of Golem Clay (effect: illusion earth elemental - one charge) or two.  Find a mage who has never hunted in the hole, and - with the illusion on - they'll be non-KOS to everything but the rats, I believe.<br />
<br />
Big problem with this method is that the balls used to drop in CT before the revamp.  Rumor is that they drop in Feerrott now, but I haven't talked to anybody who's gotten one this way.  Anybody know for certain?<br />
<br />
The other epic pieces that I know are in here are ranger and chanter.  Pretty sure the chanter epic mob is right next door to Kirn.  So if you have any friends going after these bits, just keep tabs on em and tag along.  ;)<br />
<br />
If you're going to fight there, from everything I hear, you need 2 groups of 55+, there are GOBS of mobs on the way there.<br />
<br />
The tear from hate is easy - tag along on open Hate raids till you get one.  One dropped to a friend shaman on my frist one, I got mine the second trip - didn't seem hard.  Or ask a couple of guilds if you can tag along just for the tear next time they go.  We would never turn down a shaman for such a thing, provided a guid shaman didn't need.<br />
<br />
Fairly good map of the hole at eqatlas.com</div></div><hr />

This sounds like some very good ideas. I will work on them and figure out what is best for me and my guild members safety.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't believe the ball of golem clay drops anymore, just FYI.  To be honest, you guys probably don't have the level to make it to kirn by yourselves.  I'd also be concerned about your ability to take him down.  He's not super difficult, but you guys are a little low in levels.  I think you'd be a lot better off if you could field another group.<br />

The tear is from Fear not Hate, and you were extremely lucky.  It has taken me four months to get this - and I have raided Fear at least twice in each of those months and have never seen the golems up to get the tear.  In the end I noticed that an uber guild on my server was in Fear, asked and was told that the golems were up, so I begged to be allowed to come into Fear and loot the tear since they didn't need it.<br />
<br />
I have my Rak raid set for saturday, so fingers crossed.....<br />
<br />
As for the Hole - all you need is two mid 50s groups to get to Kirn without any tricks.  Once you are there you should be fine.</div></div><hr />
