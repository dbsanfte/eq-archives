<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wear a Piranha Tooth Necklace that I bought in the bazaar for too many pp, after I never saw one drop even while camping fish in the Blue Pool several times. In the &quot;Pools&quot; camp, the &quot;Blue Pool&quot; is the one full of fish, while the &quot;Green Pool&quot; is the one full of oozes, with a twisty hallway full of oozes between them.<br />
<br />
Just last week, we were headed down to kill Ring of Slime (An Acidic Mass), and a couple named fish were up. We cleared the Blue Pool and one of the named piranha had the necklace. It went to a guildee's shaman twink, since I already had mine. Too bad I spent all those pp!<br />
<br />
But anyway - yes it still drops. The Blue Pool is the right spot. It seems like a rare drop in that camp though.<br />
<br />
I do not believe that the correct named fish can spawn in the &quot;Planks Pool&quot;, which is the pool on the way to the FT3 Boots camp.</div></div><hr />
