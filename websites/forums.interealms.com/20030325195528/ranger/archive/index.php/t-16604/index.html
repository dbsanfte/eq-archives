<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lingerie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I am currently working on my epic blade &lt;Swiftwind&gt; and on the part fot the epic mob in The Hole...just wanting to get some feedbacks from rangers who have done it successfully...I noticed there are 2 ways to get into The Hole, and was wondering which is the best way to do this...I'm planning on taking 2-3 full groups of lvl 50-60 peeps with me...We will have a CC on hand and clerics as well...I noticed the map and from the Paineel ent, the epic mob is on the other side..Quite a long trip, and was wondering if there are any easy way to get there, or we just have to fight our way through...Thank you for the feedbacks....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just did this last week. We did the drop-in method, vs. the fight-in method.<br />
<br />
Drop-in.<br />
1) Make an initial group that includes three critical people:<br />
  - A mage with CoH<br />
  - Someone with some sort of invulnerability and ressurection (a cleric comes to mind)<br />
  - A group leader who is not one of the two above.<br />
<br />
1b) Everyone else going down goes with the group leader and enters the Hole through the front door and sits tight.<br />
<br />
2) Drop in advanced party. If you don't have the firepower to clear the landing area, you can scout using a Brell-worshipping halfling rogue. When all's clear, jump in from above. You'll zone in during the fall. The mage will go splat, the cleric will go bump, and you may have a fight on your hands. DO NOT JUMP IN THE GROUP LEADER!!!<br />
<br />
3) Rez the mage.<br />
<br />
4) Disband everyone but the mage and the group leader and invite the first four going in. Cast CoH, repeat.<br />
<br />
Alternate method. Group up and bash your way in. We had 52 (yes 52) 47-65 level guildies and probably could have just maimed our way to the bottom, but we spent the time more wisely. The result was a 4-hour raid that netted 12 epic pieces (6 ranger, 6 from the castle)<br />
<br />
Have fun, and bring someone who can punt or port you out. There are teleport pads, but that's another battle to get to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaylah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As long as you have talent and firepower in your raiding party, plowing through is a fun and easy way to go.  Just make sure someone has a good map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Panteroo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">for a less than experienced guild the drop in method is a sure fire way to a mass coffin summons. I just completed my epic last night and did the Hole fight with me (51ranger), a 62war, and a friend 2boxing a 64 cleric and 62 enc. Killed him no problems at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kimexe Calmbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With 2-3 full group of 50-60, kill everything on your way.<br />
Learn map and where-to-fight, then you'll be fine.<br />
get a puller who know how to pull things in the Hole, and you are more than comfortable. and more chance to gather some IGS =)<br />
<br />
With a few Enc and/or Bard, you can break through city quite speedy. Speed is key.<br />
we went to the Hole for Yael last month, it took about an hour for 2group of around 60 from first drop-off to Yael-prep-point.<br />
<br />
maybe you'll get most adds at safety pool point (quite safe, where you can even camp out), but personally, i think most hectic part is broken pool near Hole-Middle (or before library). <br />
&quot;ugh, next roamer there&quot; &quot;ok, mezzing elemental #5&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild went to the Hole just the other day and got 4 rangers their Soulbound Hammers. We had about 16 people in the 52-62 lvl range. We fought our way in quickly with no problems whatsoever, and got to Jaeil in a very short amount of time.<br />
<br />
With 2-3 groups, I'd recommend just fighting your way there. As long as you have a good chanter, and decent dps, it shouldn't take too long to get to him at all. And besides, it's much funner that way. :)</div></div><hr />
