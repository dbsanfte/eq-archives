<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zimbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there I was in Oggok wasting my platinum doing alchemy combines while waiting for the raid start to be called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to The Deep&quot;, the raid is on.  So I finish current combination, close all my bags, click sow boots and race off to The Deep.  After only about 1/2 hour assembly time, we're all in raid groups and I note that I'm the only shaman on a 7 group raid.<br />
<br />
Talisman of brute on all 7 groups with cani 4 down about 2 bubbles. Khura's Focus on 2 groups, hit cani 5 - DEAD!!<br />
<br />
OMG, how embarrasing, I note when I loot my corpse that I'm all in WIS gear from doing alchemy and all my HP gear is bagged in the bank.  I realize then too that I didn't have Aego/Virtue on me yet....so I hold up THO raid for an extra 10 minutes while restoring myself and finishing buffing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well at least if you guys had gotten ganked while you were buffing stamina you'd have had plenty of mana.  And you'd never get resisted either with that uber Charisma buff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tonight after a small wipeout to Mithaniel Marr, I was rezzed into the graveyard, and as is habitual, I canni5'd...this time I brought myself down to 4 hp...I love freaking out clerics like that.<br />
<br />
But then Mith Marr showed up in the graveyard, and somehow (I'm at a loss to understand why), I got low health aggro.</div></div><hr />
