<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I'm sure this is probably the 1024th time this has been asked but I've read various sources with conflicting info.<br />
<br />
Does CHA affect the way our Malo, Listless Power and Tagor lines operate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, it has nothing to do with it.<br />
<br />
See bunch of uber shaman here with very red charisma due to stuffs with cha-25 like Cazic brain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard a new one the other day -- had a tank asking me to buff his charisma because it affected the size of his faction adjustments as we killed mobs. <br />
<br />
I immediately threw the idea out, but after he claimed he tested it, I can't really completely disregard the theory without testing it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think a lot of people are superstitious, whenever I get a request like that I just chuckle a little and honor the request :P<br />
<br />
When I started my shaman I was told from the start that cha effects your chance of landed a spell. I always kept charisma up, but I eventually realized that having more or less charisma does not effect anything but merchant prices and charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">NO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">charisma does not effect anything but merchant prices and charm <br />
<br />
Charisma also affects the chance of Death Pact and Divine Intervention successfully going off, according to Ester the Tester at VI.<br />
<br />
She said it was the charisma of the Cleric that did it, not the recipient, but to be on the safe side, I usually buff both.<br />
<br />
I learned the other day, oddly enough, that Talisman of the Serpent does not give the same charisma effect of Unfailing Reverence the way that Talisman of the Brute = Riotous Health now.<br />
<br />
Oh yea.  NO NO NO, charisma does NOT affect our debuffs.  Lets not perpetuate that rumor again, pretty please.  It took months to stomp out, and still raises its ugly head every so often</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I remember I used to think that Charisma affected faction. Whenever I wanted to check my faction, I would cast Spirit of Snake and toss on the few pieces of Charisma gear that I had before /con.<br />
<br />
Hmm, it didn't seem to help, but it sure made sense that it would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's because the better your faction the better your prices with vendors are....   just like charisma.  :D  But charisma doesn't increase your faction, only your price on top of how well your faction is.  I hope that made sense, I'm not about to reread it and see for myself.  :D</div></div><hr />
