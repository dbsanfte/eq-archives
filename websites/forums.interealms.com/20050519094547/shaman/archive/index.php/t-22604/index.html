<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just starting to use tribute points here.  <br />
<br />
Looking for some suggestions on something that might cost 100-200 plat to turn in to get a few points maybe 500-1000.  <br />
<br />
I have turned in a few drops I have gotten and never really gotten more than 200 or so points.  <br />
<br />
I really am just looking to use a bit more tribute but not sure what I could maybe buy in the bazaar to get enough points to use some of the higher focus effects.<br />
<br />
Thanks for anyone who can point me in the right direction on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look up howling stone drops on LUCY (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/) , especially now that there is a big draw to going there, you may see the market flood in the coming weeks.  A couple examples are a bloodpoint worth 1080, bile drenched jewel worth 1765, hand of the reaper worth 1570.  Do your research, there is probably a ton of stuff I am missing.  Allakhazam (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/)  is a great place to search zones for loot names, and LUCY (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/) is where you can see what the tribute worth will be.</div></div><hr />

You can usually get one for about 6-8k, and they're worth 20k+ tribute points (unless it was changed since I last checked)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes its changed.  only 11k now.<br />
A lot of turn ins were changed on July 17th, so be sure to check your faves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The best thing to do is get an item and check out the item on lucy.  it will tell you it's tribute value.  Just like the tacticians bulwark was changed.  My old personal favorite was the Gomdurig, which was usually available for a whie there for 4 - 6k and was worth about 24k tribute points.  It's down to 10k now of course.<br />
<br />
Not sure what's good anymore as I stocked up on points a while ago and haven't hit the critical point that I need to get some more.</div></div><hr />

What's the deal?  Is Sony actively trying to make tribute stupidly expensive?  I realize it's supposed to be a money sink but at this rate it's going to take one's entire cash flow just to keep fire resist up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its the same mentality that has them changing vendor prices so its impossible to make a profit from tradeskills without selling to other players.  I dont understand it because the tribute system is an item sink; it KEEPS mudflation down.  The player gets an hour or two of beneficial focus effects in return for the effort on Sony's part.  But, because it was too good they had to nerf it.  I understand changing things like Forged picks; that was a great little ride while it lasted and Im not ashamed that I rode it as long as I could.  Changing items like Tacticians which takes camping and effort is punitive and silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think they are watching what folks turn in a great deal then adjusting prices accordingly. <br />
<br />
That way the best deals get lesser rewards. And they can lean it into a 1.5 tribute to 1 plat ratio or so. The problem is If it requres camping to keep up I am gonna be pissed. And Won't use it as much. Now an item here or there to feed the beast sure. But when I have to go out one day a week to get enough points that just isnt as worth it to me<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SOE know a lot of people have 200k (or did until 17th) tribute points as a result of items such as the Forged Pick.<br />
<br />
Its another reason why they may be dropping prices trying to force people with huge tribute pools down.<br />
<br />
Another concept is that tribute have begun serving the purpose for which they were created, refreshing the PP economy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I decided not to use tribute anymore. I like the tribute, especially since you can turn it on and off. But I don't want to spend all my time gathering items to turn in.     *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Same here.<br />
<br />
Forged pick was certainly a big outrageous, but, I think that Tradeskill items should give large amounts of Tribute.  I mean, we know the *(&amp;@ vendors won't pay *(&amp;@ for that stuff, but, at least if the Tribute guy paid well for it we could have some recourse for all the plat we sink into Tradeskills.<br />
<br />
But whatever.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">whats the big deal? <br />
now its harder to farm tribute points but on the other hand you can<br />
leave it deactivated while you run around and do other stuff.<br />
fair imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not a &quot;big&quot; deal really, just that by making it more cumbersome people are less likely to use it.<br />
<br />
I personally would rather put in a large chunk of Tribute points and forget about it for a week than have to think about turning it on and off.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A week? I spent 10k in the bazaar like a month ago, got 60k tribute for it, and still have 50k left. I always have MP4 tributed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Look into the crappy LDoN normal drops. I use LDoN for my tribute personally and find that the unwanted LDoN stuff (esp. the weps) are great bazaar farmable tribute. Not alot of points per item in some cases but you can often get 300-1500 pts at a 3-5pt/pp exchange rate.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For folks who are interested in Smithing the LDoN cycle is a good idea.<br />
<br />
Some LDoN smithed items have Tribute rates of 300-700pts.  If you are working on raising smithing this is a good place to dump your successes.  Even if you buy the materials to make the armor you will still come out with a Tribute Point profit and the possiblity of gaining a tradeskill point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">New &quot;utilities&quot; in EQ are all about plat sinks now.  Tribute is a plat sink.  The casino is a plat sink.  Augmentation removal is plat sink.<br />
<br />
However, SoE has overlooked the best plat sink that could ever be implemented: NPCs that buff you in PoK for plat.  You could simply go to a vendor who sells tokens (say one for Virtue, one for KEI, one for FoS, etc) and buy the tokens for the buffs you want.  You could even pay more for extended versions.  You hand in a token to the NPC and it casts the spell(s) on you.  Voila, happy players, happy plat sink and no more &quot;any C pls?&quot; in ooc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't see why they just don't keep tribute as it was on day one of Gates.  Not only would it suck out a lot of items, those items would also be out of the market.  People would farm cash just a little bit less because something they could buy cheaply could keep their Tribute going for a long time.  It's not like the Tributes are imbalancing either.  A lot of them seem like alternatives to having to buy a focus item,  such as the Mana Preservation IV Tribute Effect.  Problem is, by now, you're almost better off selling what you would have Tributed and BUYING a MP4 item.<br />
<br />
But Jzak, a lot of players make a living selling buffs to others.  Also, with NPC sellers, there would be guaranteed Focus, further hindering the need to invite a Shaman along.  And every sub 60 shaman, enchanter, cleric, and druid would try to cast their buffs on their group only to get &quot;Your Spell Would Not Take Hold.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps NPC only spells that were slightly weaker versions of their parent spells.</div></div><hr />
