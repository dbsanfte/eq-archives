<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd put this together for the Karana boards but as there are an awful lot of serverwide channels too, I thought I'd offer it here.  I'll leave the Karana channels after the serverwides, and invite others to add their own server's channels.  If enough people like this and add stuff I'll compile it all in this post.  Corrections are also welcome.<br />
<br />
The following are chat channels that are available to the general public.  Channels that require a special process to acquire the password are not and will not be included.  (Nothing against them, they're just not public.)<br />
<br />
serverwide.bards:bards<br />
serverwide.beastlords:beastlords<br />
serverwide.cleric:cleric<br />
serverwide.crucible:crucible (shamans)<br />
serverwide.druidsgrove:password<br />
serverwide.enchanter<br />
serverwide.eqdruids:eqdruids<br />
serverwide.eqtraders (tradeskills)* (sometimes has password &quot;eqtraders&quot;)<br />
serverwide.fanfaire<br />
serverwide.graffe:graffe (wizards)<br />
serverwide.gucomics (fans of GU Comics (www.gucomics.com))<br />
serverwide.magetower:fluffy<br />
serverwide.monklybusiness<br />
serverwide.necro:necro<br />
serverwide.paladins<br />
serverwide.pom:pom (Plane of Mischief)<br />
serverwide.ranger:ranger<br />
serverwide.rogue:rogue<br />
serverwide.sk:sk (shadowknights)<br />
serverwide.thesteelwarrior (warriors)<br />
serverwide.tinker (tinkering)<br />
serverwide.W T F comics (fans of W T F Comics (http://69.57.151.222/index.html)) (without the spaces between the letters W T F)<br />
<br />
*Note: Serverwide.eqtraders is not officially associated with the EQ Traders website or the management and staff thereof.  <br />
<br />
Karana Server channels:<br />
bottower (forming BoT Tower raids)<br />
ldon (forming LDoN groups)<br />
magician<br />
plane (forming PoP groups)<br />
trader (auctioning)<br />
tradeskills:tradeskills<br />
<br />
Veeshan Server channels:<br />
eqsn (auctioning)<br />
<br />
Many servers have &quot;taxi&quot; or &quot;auction&quot; channels that may or may not have the name of the channel as a password.<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
For reference, chat channels are channels that can be joined by anyone on any server who knows the name of the channel and the password, if there is one.  If there were a channel on your server named &quot;greeneggs&quot; and without a password, you would join it by typing:<br />
<br />
/join greeneggs<br />
<br />
If it had the password of &quot;andham&quot; you would type:<br />
<br />
/join greeneggs:andham<br />
<br />
You create a chat channel by being the first one to join it.  If it does not have a password and everyone leaves, it ceases to exist.  If it does have a password then it will require that password for up to 24 hours after everyone has left.  That is why many public channels have passwords that are the same as the channel name.  They prevent someone from joining when no one else is on and giving it a password so that no one else can get in.  <br />
<br />
If you create the greeneggs channel (no password) on Karana, people on other servers could join it by typing /join karana.greeneggs.  Players on Karana could also join it by typing /join karana.greeneggs, but don't have to put the karana part on if they don't want to.<br />
<br />
For channels that are intended to be available to people on all servers, you can designate them as such by using &quot;serverwide&quot; as the server name when they are created.  Serverwide is just a generic term you can use to avoid having any particular server's name attached to the channel.  Everyone on every server must use the serverwide part of the name to join that channel.  <br />
<br />
You can also automatically join channels.  If you type:<br />
<br />
/autojoin tradeskills:tradeskills,serverwide.eqtraders,greeneggs:andham<br />
<br />
you will be joined to those three channels every time you log on.  As of the October 9, 2003 patch, the autojoin channels are saved independently for each character you play; you must autojoin the channels you desire whenever you start a new character.  Changes made to the autojoin list on one character will not affect the other characters.</div></div><hr />

I haven't used it in a very long time, but it may still be in use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">serverwide.sk (shadowknights)<br />
<br />
serverwide.sk:sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Erm, please be sure to include the name of your server if you want a local channel included. (Psst, Battleaxe!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe - it was used on several servers, so while it was local, I didn't think it was only my server(s) :)<br />
<br />
At times it was taxi:taxi and others just taxi.  Don't know if or how much it is still used though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">a lot of servers have local &quot;taxi&quot; and &quot;auction&quot; channels.<br />
<br />
btw, serverwide.eqtraders currently has a password of eqtraders.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If it does not have a password and everyone leaves, it ceases to exist.  If it does have a password then it will always require that password, even after everyone has left.<br />
If I remember correctly, a passworded chat channel will exist for 24 hours after the last person has left.  Then it is deleted.</div></div><hr />
