<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Long and rambling as usual:<br />
<br />
Well, it was a great weekend, but I'm depressed.  I'm lower level than many of the vets here so many of you have been there and done that...but maybe you can smile at some of the things that happened to me this weekend thinking back to when you were in the low 50's, get a laugh at my expense, feel nostalgia, or otherwise be entertained.<br />
<br />
The Woohoo:<br />
<br />
First off, I dinged 54 and immediately inscribed canni3.  I never got canni2 since the quest is ridiculous and I was leveling fast.  Things did slow down at 51+ but I still hit 54 pretty quickly.  I was VERY happy to escape the carpal from cann1, even though I still canni3 a lot.  I've been looking forward to canni3 for a very long time  :)<br />
<br />
Secondly, I acquired a Soulstripper, something I'd been coveting for a while.  I kept peeking at it in the bazaar and realizing I could never afford to buy one until I wouldn't need it.  I have a RL friend on Xev and duoed with his 55th Beastlord at the camp til we both got one (he for his 60th druid who never got lucky on previous camps).  We spent about 8 hours there...it was traumatic...enraged soul only spawned twice but with weapon in hand both times.  We actually did well for xp and pp too since we pulled everything around us to keep busy between PHs....and every time that PH spawned we groaned.  Anyways, Soulstripper is going for 5-7k on Xev, which I could never afford right now due to saving for and hoping for spells, so it was a major coup for me and a considerable upgrade for my weapon.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, I did the stoicism quest.  I'd put it off forever after a bad experience trying to get it at 48 (I'd just leveled, had no idea how to work the pirates, and got killed nowhere near them and lost my level).  At the time I said screw it and just put it off to focus on leveling and canni3.  This time at 54th things were easier (of course).  I got lucky in two ways and majorly unlucky in another.<br />
<br />
First time there a bored BL (thanks Sbasis) offered to help me slaughter the area (side note - there's nothing like having invis drop in the tunnel and building up a train of 20-30 critters to take to Dulak zone with you).  After about 2 hours (and this was after the Soulstripper camp - I was a glutton for punishment that day) and many plats the flask dropped and Sbasis retired for the eve.  I was delirious and went to do the turn in and finish the quest.  I totally screwed up by summoning my pet first...because in my haste in delirium, after totally buffing myself and my dog, I handed the flask to my pet instead of the spirit.  I sat there stunned for a while.  I was thinking, oh well, torpor is selling for 22k in the bazaar and I can probably hit 60 in a month if I'm diligent.  :-/<br />
<br />
So, the next day it's late and I've got nothing better to do, and I'm pissed, so I decide now that I know how to fight the pirates (everything is easy there at 54th, solo pulls, and the plats are not bad) I'll go try for another flask.  I happen to arrive just as Quintanas (51st shaman I'd grouped with before) is gating out.  I fight for a while with no flask and Quintanas returns and asks if I'm after flask for just dinking around (he wanted to solo the spot for xp/plat).  I tell him I need a flask.  He replies that he has a flask offers to pop the critters so I can finish the quest.  I readily agree so we both win - he gets to hunt and I get to finish the quest.  I easily dispatch the killables and get my Stoicism spell...finally!  I guess kharma of sort of struck...I messed up the quest but was able to somewhat cheese it to finish it without having to fully camp a second flask.  Since I'd died once and legitimately camped my first flask I didn't feel too bad about the cheese.  (and another thanks to Quintanas for his time)<br />
<br />
Fourthly and finally, I was checking my trader this morning before heading out and doing my regular spell searches, and I found someone selling Infusion of Spirit for 1k, which is about 2k less than it's been going for forever (and I refused to pay ~3k for it).  I immediately scooped it up and now finally have that spell.  I've been watching this one since the 40's.<br />
<br />
All together it was an eventful and awesome weekend for me...I really should be happy...but I have to whine and be depressed...<br />
<br />
The boohoo:<br />
<br />
I'm half way to 55th now and have all my spells bought and ready...except one...and that one is the 55th pet.  I'm crushed and strongly feel a need to have this spell ready for 55th.  I've whined about this enough in two other threads here so I won't elaborate...but as of now it's looking really bleak.  My only hope is luck.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the 55 lvl pet is a joke compared to the 61 pet.<br />
<br />
i think it adds 4-7 damage to the max hits.  don't worry about that at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 55 pet is a nice upgrade but the 61 pet is indeed a monster.<br />
<br />
Start saving now for torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*nods* The 55 dogdog is next to worthless.  Save for Torpor, hit 61, and it'll all go away. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taiyed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Spell: True Spirit summons a level 58 pet.  I was not-so-pleased with the level 55 pet.  However, I'd still pick it up as you, like me, sound like you won't be 61 in to near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&lt;shrug&gt;<br />
<br />
I'll level to 61 fast enough, I expect, but I still want the 55th pet - it has to be better than the 49th.  It's more a factor of want than need.<br />
<br />
The thing that sucks is people are always saying - skip such and such and just level up for such and such - which might work for some but I don't care for that approach - I'd like to have the tools of now to use now and not be going 5-6 levels without!  I want to (and generally do) enjoy all levels - I don't just want to level to 65 as fast as humanly possible (even though I tend to advance quickly).  I skipped canni2 because the quest sucks and suffered through many levels of cann1 to get to canni3.<br />
<br />
If the pet isn't that big of an upgrade and not that big of a deal then why the heck is it such a pain in the butt to get?!<br />
<br />
&lt;sighs&gt;<br />
<br />
I really believe that SOE should re-evaluate some of the zone-specific quests and drops.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow...I'm on a roll...I wish everything worked out like this.<br />
<br />
I found the finnok's I needed for 1k and the flake of lodestone I needed for 300p this evening in the bazaar - after searching for days if not weeks and seeing the finnoks always going for 10k.  After tipping the researcher that did the combine for me 200p I ended up paying 1500p total for my Spirit of the Howler, 55th pet spell!  Me so happy!<br />

<br />
Well, i've been using my level 55 pet for over 6 months now, and he's not that bad really.. He puts out decent enough dps for what i use him for.<br />
<br />
Comparativly to the 61 pet he's a kitten comparitivly, but see'ing as how i've never had the 61 pet, i wouldnt know. ;) If i had to do it all over again, i'd pay 1.5k for him (but I only payd 100p for him, back during the summertime price wars)&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gratz to you man. You and me in the same boat, cept the spell I'm missing is G Bear. Yeah, not a big bonus, but I wanna be a polar bear because I CAN BE. That and I like a full spell book just because. I still have inner fire scribed back there somewhere ;)<br />
<br />
Sounds like you had one hella weekend in my book, good job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">People need to hunt in Sebilis.  <br />
<br />
Spells like Spirit of the Howler drop like rain.  We used to sell that stuff to mechant vendors for 20pp or whatever.  <br />
<br />
But glad to hear you are having fun.  Getting ahold of your spells and abilities is important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gratz to you man. You and me in the same boat, cept the spell I'm missing is G Bear.

<br />
Thanks!  I have all spells for 55 now including the bear form that I picked up in the bazaar for a steal one day.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, I could be a noob because I still keep Inner Fire active and cast it sometimes.  I don't think there's ever an upgrade to it and it stacks with everything if you don't have clericals on.  So, for that extra smidge I'll cast it on me and doggie sometimes.  Half the time I space it though and most of the time I'm grouped.  It's amusing when there's no cleric and you buff people with a level 1 buff.<br />
<br />
BTW, I wanted to hunt sebilis but I'm in my 2nd EQ life and don't know a lot of the expanded zones and didn't get around to it due to camping Soulstripper.  I was trying to convince my BL friend that we should get keyed and head there or anywhere that the spell could drop.<br />
<br />
It sounds kind of wacky, but 1.5k isn't that much to me, particularly for something I want as badly as a spell, despite my shammy being my main and me being only 2-3 months into my 2nd EQ run.  You probably missed my genius level post where I mentioned I bought Spirit Quickening for 750p even though it's butt useless.  I have to admit that wasn't very bright but I really wanted the spell.  I also paid 1600p for the reagent free levitation spell (and that was via research too, it was going for way more in the bazaar at that time) mostly because I just wanted it and don't like to carry garbage around if I can help it...then I was furious when I discovered that it is level restricted.  I'm still looking to eventually get the comps for the everlasting breath spell...it goes for 3k+ but I'm holding out til I get those comps via conquest as I just can't continue my reckless spell buying ways.<br />
<br />
I was up to 10k saved and possesing of decent gear when I bought the pet spell and I can make around 1k or more an hour or so exerting almost no effort with my various fund raiser activities and I'm not doing bad for plats when xping lately.  I guess I'm used to Xev's brutal economy where everything I want is expensive.  &lt;shrug&gt;  I'm so confident in my plat gathering and was so happy to get that spell (and I have many others thru 58 on deck) that I blew out my bank buying 2 gear upgrades (Tae Ew Chain Leggings and some shoulder piece I forget the name of - working on a magelo profile lately).  But I ramble (as usual).<br />
<br />
Lastly, I think the 55th pet will do nicely compared to the 49th.  4-7 damage more per hit considering the number of times he hits per battle will add up and the higher health means he's more durable.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the 61 pet crushes the 55th pet...as I'm sure the 55th pet is superior to the 49th.  I see no problem with paying 1500p for the 55th pet considering how many plats I'll accumulate between now (54.5) and 61.  &lt;shrugs again&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've been in seb a lot lately (had to farm juggs/reets for a while to get a crown), and spirit of the howler never dropped for us...  ANyway, the 55 pet is a very nice upgrade from the 49 pet, but my advice would be dont bother with form of the great bear unless you see it cheap.<br />
<br />
61 pet is of course much better, but not getting the 55 pet (unless you're going to be going 55-61 in a week or less) would be a mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thought I recalled really thinking the 55 pet was a big upgrade over the 49, but thats been a long time.  Pretty sure a friend suprised me with the spell when I was 55 or shortly below but I easily would have paid 1.5k for it, I paid 5k for form of the great bear the week it came out and it turned out to be fairly easy to get ahold of.  The 61 pet spell is much better though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just ran over and setup camp at the VP zone in Skyfire.  2nd kill dropped my pet =)  Was selling for 9k on Bristlebane.  I'm all for buying stuff that you cant find and even using researching for some items but good old fashion camping stuff you need is my way of doing stuff.  Just like you did with the soulstripper or the suggestion to goto Seb.  I really hate that people gouge classes for spells.  I remember when splurt was selling for 30K .. haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Spirit of the Howler dropped for us in Chardok, Durring a &quot;Royals Raid&quot; about a week ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm sure economic situations vary from server to server based on many factors including average hunter level, popular zones, number of powerful guilds with surplus loot, and more.<br />
<br />
I've seen some items in magelos here that people say should be cheap that're very expensive on Xev and vice versa...and then there's items I've seen on magelos here in my level range that I have yet to ever see for sale on Xev.<br />
<br />
I prefer to get my gear via drops or my own efforts but it's not always that easy and many times the item you want is well beyond your ability to obtain.  I guess you could say that farming plats and buying stuff is a product of your own efforts, and is how I've got much of my gear, but buying something isn't quite the same as a nice, grueling camp for something like the Soulstripper.  ;)<br />
<br />
Xev's economy is wild to say the least and I'd guess it's the same on most servers.  For example, I have an enchanter alt and have been pursuing research with him, which is a good thing, because their 16th AE Mez spell (mesmerization) is research only and I saw it selling in the bazaar for 1k at one point (and that's the only time I've seen it in the bazaar - somebody bought it eventually).  I also know someone who sold it for 500p.  The comps for it go for as high as 150p ea.  Either way, that's 300-1000p for a freaking level 16 spell!  I made it a point to get pages and constantly offer breeze or haste for pages when my chanter was in paludal and ended up researching that spell and others for free.  I guess when you have many 65's with tons of plats and alts that them paying 1k for a twink spell is nothing.<br />
<br />
Spell research seems to be a great way to save money and a potentially great way to make money, especially making shaman spells on Xev! <br />
<br />
/cry<br />
<br />
I've saved a bunch in the context of Xev's shaman spell economy via researching instead of buying spells.  Getting the spells as drops would be most ideal but sometimes that's easier said than done and involves a lot more luck than the financial approaches.<br />
