<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anybody here worked on, or better yet COMPLETED the Deepening Barrier quest in Thundering Steppes?<br />
<br />
It starts from a board you get dropped from a mob (Think I got mine off a Centaur) and you inspect the board, it mentions that this board would make a decent piece of armor, but you have to find some laquer and some Gnoll fingernails (***?!?!) then the third and final step is to bless the board in the Valley of the Ancients.<br />
<br />
I did the first two steps (Mostly just killing Gnolls and Centaurs until I got quest updates.) and finally found the Valley of the Ancients. When I got the &quot;You've discovered the Valley of the Ancients&quot; quest update, and even got the discovery Exp for it, I checked my quest log.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, it said &quot;I've visited the valley of the ancients, I should inspect my board again.&quot;<br />
<br />
I inspected the board and all it had on it was the first two items.<br />
<br />
Is there something I'm doing wrong? I tried inspecting the board while standing IN the Valley of the Ancients, still no update.<br />
<br />
I'm completely OUT of room for quests, and I need to either delete broken ones, or figure out what I'm doing wrong so I can complete this one.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
