<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I never noticed this until last night when I was there PLing my warrior (lvl 20 now, w00t). if you slow the centaurs they only single pull. chargers are still light blue to my shaman, and I am pulling archers for my warrior with slow from right next to them.<br />
<br />
Now I remember when I was 24 and hunting here in groups, we would have the whole town chasing us back to north karana, I suppose if I had known this my shaman would be lvl 50 already :P<br />
<br />
I don't know who this helps if anyone, since there were only 10 of us in zone last night...</div></div><hr />

I tried this yesterday, but not with the same result. When casting slow one one centaur, and 2-5 came after me.<br />
I think that it was not the slow that made you single pull, but the fact that you are higher level now.<br />
