<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dratcha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I was just wondering what everyone else thought about exclusive camps to multiple named. The best example I can think of is 6 spawn in WoS. On Innoruuk, this is pretty much a perma camp. If another group tries to setup anywhere in the backyard and pull even one of thier named spawns, a war begins between the groups. Wars are basically the 6spawn group bitching through ooc and tells, and training the second group. <br />
<br />
Should six people really get exclusive rights to all those named spawns? I think there should easily be enough room for three groups there. I had a group once and we tried to basically fit in anywhere in WoS. Everywhere we went, people bitched that &quot;these mobs belonged to them&quot;. Fianlly we decided the least affected by our presence would be 6 spawn. In 60 minutes we got two of thier named. Apparently that was legal grounds for thier monk to train a bunch of crap on us and wipe the group. <br />
<br />
I just think nobody has had the balls to really contest it so it stays the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I think in situations like that the PnP rules, however randomly they are enforced by CS, must apply.  Its not your mob unless you have agro on it. Of course, thats impossible to enforce really, unless everyone agrees to work by those rules.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, where is this 6 spawn of which you speak?  My play time in WoS consists of the &quot;hill camp&quot; (Kyv Assasin), the NW caves that are near Anguish (3 possible names there), near the zone in (Bazu named) and Anguish zone in.  Considering that on my server population has taken a hit lately and there are rarely more than about 60 people in WoS even at primetime of weekends, Id like to know where to go to max my rune collection.<br />
<br />
As far as other groups training your group, that is still a petitionable offence.  If it happened to me Id toss in a petition just to get the incident logged, rez up and keep on killing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sony does not recognize such a thing as a &quot;camp.&quot;  The closest thing they recognize is that if you tag a mob first your group gets first crack at it.  They won't help in disputes about spawns.<br />
<br />
But, they will handle situations related to training.  Almost impossible to prove though.  You have to have the balls to keep coming back and petitioning until a guide or GM sees you being trained.  Then they will chastise the offenders.<br />
<br />
So, unless you want it to escallate into tit-for-tat training find somewhere else to camp.  Lately even WoS has been relatively empty so there are plenty of spots around.<br />
<br />
If the server population generally recognizes a number of spawn spots as belonging to a camp then give it to them.  Someday you'll be in that camp and will appreciate not having to defend it against every group that walks in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It all depends on your group.  I normally set up at the Tents which allows for 3-4 named spawn.  At this camp though with a good monk or bard, we've pulled named from all over the north part of the zone, including lvl71 named such as the ukun and warfiend.  <br />
<br />
I think the attitude on Saryrn is it's 1st aggro gets the mob.  This is how its been since before BoT.  Most people understand that and named in WoS are so common that there is no retaliation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On MM, the 'tent' camp has about 3 spawns, plus any other nameds it can pull - there are some nameds that don't 'belong' to any camps, but are pulled by whomever. Just south of that is what we call 'north wall', in a cubbyhole of the wall facing north, two in from the passthrough. This is the best camp, apparently, and has 3 or 4 that it claims, plus whatever else can be pulled.<br />
<br />
Of course, I never pull there, so this is just my perception. Definately don't group in WoS without a tracker, or you'll never kill a named. It only took once to learn that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Walls of Slaughter is a disaster.  Puts Dreadlands to shame.  Here is a zone with no defined &quot;camp spots&quot; (just places along walls), an insane named mob spawn-rate, and a bunch of greedy muthafocka's tripping over each other to kill these mobs.<br />
<br />
A lot of pulls are contested.  I can pull a mob with my monk and he can plainly, visibly be chasing me when I see a spell effect go off on him... some SK or ranger or pally has casted a spell on a mob that I've pulled and agro'd first and boom, I need to go find another mob.  It's one of the few zones where the rules go out the window... KS'ing, pull-stealing is all accepted.  Any other zone, and people would be freakin' out, but nooooo not WoS.  If you get griefed, well it was your fault, according to the schnubs who hang out there.<br />
<br />
IMO, WoS is a disaster in zone-design.  It just feeds griefing and greed.</div></div><hr />

Me and a cleric would duo this spot, except we'd set up in the middle of the area between the &quot;hill&quot; and the bridge to MPG.  Depending on whether she or I was tanking, the other would pull the named if they spawned.  Both the cleric and I had all the named PH locations marked on our map and we were good at keeping times of when they died. We would get about 90% of the named spawns, even if the group at the north wall were somewhat competent. We even duoed the Warfiend, which everyone usually cowers from.  We've never been KSed and we never KS.  I let whoever has first aggro on the mob retain it, even if it is proximity aggro.<br />
<br />
The closest I got to a dispute was once me and a druid approached a named and I cast Nihil first, aggroing the mob, then he landed a snare about half a second after.  Since snare aggro is greater, it started to follow him, that is until he ran out of prox aggro range while I stood there at its spawn.  Eventually it came running back to me and I slowed it again for more aggro and ran it back to my camp.  When he got back to his camp and realized he didn't have a mob, he promptly came to my camp and said I &quot;pulled it off his back&quot; and KSed him and that he was reporting me for KSing.  I laughed in his face, told him to learn about aggro and looted the rune off and crappy gloves off the corpse.  Then he berated my guild in /ooc and I repeated it in guildchat for a good laugh and that was my exciting event for that day.<br />
<br />
A GM never contacted me about it, and I bet he got one of their canned responses that said: &quot;We can't do anything about it; no evidence. Don't be a whiner, grow a pair and move on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, that is the best camp in WoS to get runes at.  The NW caves are the second best place because the spawn rate of the named in that area is really good.</div></div><hr />

Depending on distance.. Sit... You will have greater agro... and if it isnt watching.. he's prolly running off thus further lowering his agro due to range....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet another example of why pullers who insist on pulling with snare drive me nuts.  It's a horrible spell to spell to pull with in 90% of all situations and 100% of outdoor situations.  <br />
<br />
I believe camps should be respected, but defining what a camp is and whether someone is actually controlling it are different issues.  There are some folks on Innoruuk who appear to believe you can claim camps without actually being at the camp or clearing spawn - including folks from a resident uber guild.  I think PoP and GoD guild isolation really spoiled some of these folks and they just don't get how things work in a more messy environment.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes though I think the craziness of these zones is part of the fun.  Reading /ooc wars is often very amusing.  There's a certain energy with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a simple rule. If it aint up then it cant be stolen.<br />
<br />
Overreaching or claiming that that is your mob is crap. If people lack respect enough to try and steal something of yours then mark thier names and remember. Remember for a long time. And make sure they are treated like they treat others.<br />

<br />
Yeah I know sit aggro, I would have gotten the mob right back on me with it, but I didn't want to fight over a spawn, so I was going to let them have it.  The mob liked me more and ran back to me despite me doing nothing additional to gain aggro.  They lost a rune because of their puller's stupidity.<br />

Flame Lick is 100 times better for pulling and maintaining aggro.  It casts faster and refreshes faster than Ensnare.  Tangling Weeds is also good since it has a very short duration and doesn't slow the mob's run speed as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 6 spawn is reffered to as &quot;The Cubby&quot; amongst my associates. It is about half way along the north side of the wall thru the middle of the zone - between the portal room and the hole in the wall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no fun in that.  Why bother switching to a PvP (still broken in EQ) server just to kill people who have 5000hp less than me over a rune I don't even need?  PvP isn't really the answer here.  PvP just delays the inevitable when you fight over a spawn in an open zone: the better geared will win in a fair fight, or whoever trains 20 mobs on the opposition will win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I suspect you have a somewhat skewed perspective of PvP servers Drib...<br />
<br />
On VZ at the upper end, PvP is actually relatively honorable. If you are the sort of person who deliberately trains mobs, you very very quickly become the sort of person who gets killed on sight by everyone. And since most groups for somewhere like WoS are not pickup groups, but guild groups or alliance groups or freinds groups it is fairly easy to encorce that particular &quot;Play nice policy&quot;. In fact, what tends to happen is that guilds, or alliances of guilds, will fight for the rights to a zone - i.e. have a big PvP fest to establish whos zone it is. The winners then pick their spots and any non-KoS guild groups are welcome to come and pick any spots not taken...and thus it stays until the vanquished guild or guilds get their act together to reclaim the zone.<br />
<br />
I cannot speak for the other Zeks, but on VZ, there is far less deliberate training and general Fefery than you might think...particularly at the upper levels....so in the situation that you list, PvPing for a camp is actually a perfectly good way to sort it out. <br />
<br />
And while I understand your comment about PvP being (largely) determined by who has the better gear, the point in this case is that most people who want to camp WoS are probably going to have similarish gear...I mean, If you are fully time flagged, you wont be in WoS anyway, and if your gear is seriously sucky (like, say, worse than mine) you probably aren't going to survive PvE in WoS...so again, given that it is probably going to be at least 6 v 6 PvP (and usually more like 12+ v 12+), on average, the gear over the opposing forces is likely to balance out fairly well. In this case, it becomes about which guild (or alliance) has the resources and the motivation and the will to get some reinfircements there fastest, because essentially, in PvP with more than a few people involved, numerical superiority &gt; all ather factors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There's 2 camps there on seventh.

Some people started camping up on the hill, and they call it &quot;honey hill&quot; which is retarded.<br />
<br />
Late at night usually only one of the two is camped, and that's when I play. Exp sucks but it's easy money.</div></div><hr />

It isn't SOEs responsibility to design zones, so that kiddies can't hurt each other. Would be an impossible task anyway.<br />

Not directed at you Poguk, but i absolutely abhor people who let themselves get dragged in stupid ooc or train fights and blame SOE or the opposing side for their lack of maturity. Mommy Mommy, Billy stole my shovel - grow up  :mad: . (that doesn't mean, you will never hear some snide remarks over ooc from me - but it's rare and usually ends with 1 comment or 2 maximal ;)).<br />

Well... actually it is kinda their responsibility.  They had to know when they designed a zone that is basically a big square open area, with no definition or style or design (it's just a big square zone with a pointless wall dividing it into two) that forces people to just pick a spot along a wall, and then pile 50 mobs into the middle of it, all wandering, and with an insane spawn-rate of named mobs who drop ridiculously good gear for the difficulty.... how else would people behave in that zone?  All the d00dz flock to that zone and all the respectable people I know won't touch it with a 10-foot pole, because of exactly what you said --- they don't wanna get caught up in some KSing drama.  Which is bound to happen.<br />
<br />
Someone above mentioned that they've only had one incident in all their time there... well I gotta say is, you're damn lucky.  I've not had a single session there that didn't go without someone taking one of our pulls or vice versa, some d00d in my group KS'd another group and an /ooc-/shout match got fired up.  And the quality of players there for the most part has been poor... as in I watch a cleric fail to heal a tank for a solid min, letting him die, then coming up with some bogus excuse as to why they let the tank die, then gate out about 5 mins later.<br />
<br />
That zone is a cesspool.  The only time I rarely go there anymore is early in the morning, when it's empty and I can get some guildees together for some nice quiet grinding and loots, but otherwise I'll never accept another LFG invite in that zone...</div></div><hr />
