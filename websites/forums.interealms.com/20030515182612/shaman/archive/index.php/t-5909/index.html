<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tallerlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to complete the first cudgel quest from Cabilis with my Barbarian Shaman.  I have turned in thousands of bone chips and am now dubious to indiff in all of Cabilis except the librarian in the SK building.  <br />
<br />
What I am wanting to know is if there is any way to get the quest started because he won't give me the cursed wafer quest, or the skulls quest.  <br />
<br />
Forgot to mention that I can no longer increase my faction with the Mystics.  As stated when I am turn in the bone chips.<br />
<br />
Also would this work?<br />
<br />
Use a noobie shaman to hand in note and get petitioner's cudgel, then have that shaman turn in cudgel and I turn in the 3 skulls which I already have?<br />
<br />
Please if anyone has done this quest that is not an Iksar could you help out a tad and let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
