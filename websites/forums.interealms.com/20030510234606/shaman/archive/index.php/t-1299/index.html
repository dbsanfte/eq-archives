<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FenrisBound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to try to camp out the Iky BP it looks awesome, expressly with my new cani II spell. What Lvl would it take to solo or group this cycle? I read the Guide to TT, and got a 50sh Druid to help me get the BP and we were unable to do the cycle the 1st spawn was to kicked our arsses, the forager.  If anyone could help me with any advice It would be much appreciated<br />

So add in a 45+ to melee (or 2) to churn through the frogs and named pops...  You can kill forager with you and your druid buddy but its a long kill in a not so friendly kiting zone...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, you can camp this and get very few adds... The trick is where you camp.  If you zone in from the swamp, follow the river till you hit the big lake thing.  Set up shop at the end of the river on top of the hill.  Camping this bp for 2 weeks I never once got an add here.  I had a ranger to snare, which is important.  Otherwise, root then when they run and fight it out.<br />
<br />
Here's the downside:  there are some lvl 50 named mobs on the forager cycle.  A lvl 50 necro will be hard to handle at lvl 41 and the lvl 50 sk will be down night deadly.  He harm touches for somewhere around 650.<br />
<br />
I hired a lvl 37 ranger (he was 38 when we finished) to pull with snare, and then did all the fighting myself at lvl 53.  I had a jbb, but no regen/epic and pretty lousy gear exept for the jbb.  With a 50's druid and 40's shaman, you're gonna have to kite, and some of this stuff is gonna be brutal to kite, esspecially if your magic resist is low (getting adds while being fear kited sucks).</div></div><hr />
