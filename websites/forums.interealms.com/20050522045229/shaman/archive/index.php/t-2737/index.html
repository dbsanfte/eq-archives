<br />
Have you ever wanted people to stop whacking your buddies the Othmir?<br />
<br />
Maybe you have a soft spot for Frogs in U Guk?<br />
<br />
What if you could tie yourself to one faction, and IF you saw someone killing your buddies you could PvP / PK them.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned the Othmir. LOVE that zone. Love the music, the ocean, fishing, watching their little waddle. ( I contribute to various animal charities and can't walk inside a vet's office. My Mom had to take the cat in for his regular shots. Otoh I am trained to drop a human being at 300 meters with one shot - ok will stop sharing now)<br />
<br />
Get sort of PEEVED when I see people slaughtering them. Don't ask me why - it's an irrational feeling I know.<br />
<br />
I know my idea is too chaotic to implement and rife with SPLOIT capabilities, but just once I would like to Inner Flame some damn Othmir hunter for 1500 in about 9 seconds, stun them into next week and yell to the zone:<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU HAVE RUINED YOUR OWN LANDS QUAD_KITING_DRUID_01 - YOU'LL NOT RUIN MINE ! LEAVE THE OTTERS ALONE!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a nice idea but as you pointed out there are too many ways for it to be exploited. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure which faction I would fight for.<br />
<br />
IF you don't mind risking getting warned/banned you could get a friendly enchanter to charm an othmir for you then you could buff him to the gills memblur him then sit back and enjoy! ;) <br />
<br />
I would pitty the poor person who pulled a shaman buffed mob!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe remember when the epic was bugged to be a HEAL instead of a DOT, but was still considered an attack?  There were great stories about casting epic dot on some beetle in a newbie zone, and zoning out and in... newbs couldn't figure out why it kept getting healed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, that's pretty Whacky :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That would be fun ;)<br />
<br />
I don't know how anyone can kill those cute little guys either. Everytime I see someone training a few of them around I instantly think &quot;root the Druid&quot;. Alas, I have to watch those adorable little things get slaughtered needlessly in the pursuit of XP :(<br />
<br />
*hugs the Othmir*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is sort of along the same lines as the &quot;realm&quot; concept from DAoC or the PVP-Teams servers, where you have players on your &quot;team&quot; and you can kill players on the opposing team.  The major difference is that your team is set for you when you generate your character; using faction to set the teams is an interesting idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I miss being able to buff anything you want and heal the mobs.  :(  oh well.<br />
<br />
But mem blur and buffage.  Hmmm I may have to champion some mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heh i regulaqrly use my idol to gate to everfrost then find some bear cub and focus/sta/regen/haste/sow/avater it, then i gate to bazaar ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gallaena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm. Can't buff mobs unless they are charmed in some way. Sounds like a funny idea if you charmed animal first.<br />
<br />
;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I was camping gloridin (sp?) in EW for my 8th ring, I would charm snow bunnies, buff the hell out of them, and then send them against the orc scouts (or whatever they are). Amazingly enough, the bunnies lasted long enough tanking a rooted orc that I could kill the orc. :D</div></div><hr />
