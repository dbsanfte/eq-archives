<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you could start the game over, meaning no luclin, no velious or kunark, the way it was when EQ first came out, but the nerfs/new things would still be there(Not zone changes, only things like Jboots quest instead of dropping, and DE mask, Rubi Bp would also drop off 45ish level mob.) would you? I think i would cause it would just feel newer to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope...I didn't particularly like being poor and scrounging for coppers for backpacks and tattered leather.  <br />
<br />
This will probably be my last MMORPG, been there, done that, got the t-shirt.<br />
<br />
You also never experienced the joy of trying to level 40-50 pre Kunark, Velious and Luclin.  If you think cramming 100+ people in LG and Sol B because there are basically no other spots for leveling, is a fun thing to do, knock yourself out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I basically am gonna have to go with Gloriana on this one.<br />
<br />
Being a n00b again does not appeal to me in the slightest.  That's why I twink, hehe.<br />
<br />
Also, unless something insanely cool comes out soon, EQ will probably be it for me and MMOs as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">100+ People in LGuk is nothing compared to 230+ in ToV. Overcrowding just shifted from dungeons to high end zones. Same problems are still there, if not more.<br />
<br />
It's my last MMOG, unless SWO is really that good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Would I know what I know now, or be totally new again?<br />
<br />
If I knew what I know now I would say not likely...my opinion of the human race has lowered drastically since I started playing Everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think it's relative.  If the game was new and everyone else is new... then you can still be top of the heap even if you're only level 10.  :)  You can still explore areas no one has ever seen, you can still be looked up to, yadda yadda yadda.  A lot of people have some of the best memories from when they were newbs... because everyone was a newb and the sense of adventure was still there.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't want to start EQ over again because it's all been done.  No fun in being level 1 in a world populated with level 60s.  Given a whole new world, though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No way, uh-huh, no how.<br />
<br />
1-20 stinketh.<br />
21-30 is palatable<br />
31-40 is doable.<br />
41-45 is full of anticipation<br />
46-51 is happy, happy, joy, joy<br />
52-60 is grind, grind, grind.<br />
<br />
I left EQ for DAoC for two months. Came to the conclusion that if I am going to play &quot;whack-a-mole&quot; I am gonna do it with characters i already too the time to level up to 51, 53, 60 etc.<br />
<br />
Played The Realm before EQ. Gave DAoC a shot. Will stick with EQ until they turn off the servers or something better comes out.<br />
<br />
But will the &quot; next hot game &quot; be just a derivative of EQ? Will WoW be that different? Will Shadowbane be a combination of Anarchy On-line and DAoC RvR / PvP.<br />
<br />
The 400 pound gorilla is resting comfortably atm. Sure the game has flaws, but right now it's king of the jungle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it might be interesting.  What bothers me about EQ is that I started late.  I'm a relative newbie to the game, and I'll never be at the top of the pack since everyone else has such a head start on me.  I still enjoy the game (most of the time) but this bugs me because I am very competative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Toreden_Demonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My first char wasnt a shaman, but i loved the game back then, when i was in guk and solb most people hasnt reached 30 yet =)<br />
necropet rocked back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You have an interesting point, Jinheim.  I started playing in August of 99, there were already levels 50s!  By starting just 4 months late (Emarr came up in May) I lost a huge advantage, being &quot;old school,&quot; ie, having the necessary experiences and relationships with the powergamers which would have given me opportunities to join a powerful guild.<br />
<br />
Those people that got ahead of the curve reap huge benefits.  For example, two guilds on my server had nearly unrestricted access to NTOV for 6 months, there just wasn't any competition on the server.  After nearly completely decking their people out, they're off to be the only ones in Vex Thal while the 5 remaining second tier guilds squabble over spawns in NTOV.<br />
<br />
Being first gives enormous advantages in Everquest.  Be the first to kill Naggy, Vox with no competition?  All your melees get dragon haste while the rest of server melees are struggling to camp/purchase an FBSS. Be the first to be able to clear Fear/Hate?  Your guildmates get full sets of planar armor, which prepares them to be the first to kill Kunark dragons, where they get the high level spells which give them the ability to tackle SoL boss mobs...<br />
<br />
Maybe the reason I don't want to start over again, is now I know what it would take to &quot;win&quot; for me and I'm afraid of my own obsessive personality.  <br />
<br />
&lt;-- frustrated power gamer, YMMV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would like to go back to that time, but only if everyone else would go too. No game know-how, no mules, etc. Thats not possible though. So let me be nostalgic once again :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok, most seem don't seem to. But I'm you wouldn't know anything, you'd be level 1, and on the first day servers went live. Also, the old world game would be the same as it is today like i said above(No manastone..) and there would have been NO beta test, so to everyone its still new. I would cause as people said before, i would like to have a jumpstart type of thing on people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't mind not being first honestly. I don't have the time or dedication to be first even if the game were to start today :) <br />
<br />
Mostly, though it's no because I don't miss what I wasn't around to be a part of. I like how the game has evolved. I like that Troll SK's aren't paying an XP penalty up the wazoo anymore. I like that when I /consent people they can't loot my corpse and take off. I like that the planes, the hole and epic quests exist. <br />
<br />
Going back to a lot fewer zones with the same amount of people playing? Not the best idea for me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would start over if they went back to 50 levels as the cap, but added the extra content.  IMO going post 50 was one of the worst moves they made.  Game was pretty balanced at 50th, but then Kunark came out and it went downhill...<br />
<br />
They are finally getting close to being balance again, and how long has it been?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Be the last....  it has enourmous advantages over bing the first ;).<br />
<br />
You don't have to grind forever in NToV trying to make sure all of your people are equiped before the second tier guilds get there.<br />
<br />
Want an FBSS  ...  go get one it is no longer perma camped.  Or buy one for a skimpy 3 or 4k because since all the ubers already have better.<br />
<br />
Seriosly<br />
<br />
If joo are having fun in the game then joo are fine.  If it is not fun quite. <br />
<br />
I am still having lots of fun.<br />
<br />
When EQ2 comes out I will go have more fun. :)<br />
When EQ3 comes out I will have yet more fun. :)<br />
<br />
Mez think the key is to remember that this is a game not a job.  Do what is fun and have a blast doing it.<br />
<br />
Some characters are clearly more uber then other character...  some of the people playing them had lots of fun...  other did not.  If NToV is not fun becuase of all the compitions the just do something that is fun.  If a great zone is full of jerks then find another great zone that is full of people that hate jerks, or turn of /ooc /shout /auction...  the world of Norath can be a very quite and relaxing place to unwind.<br />
<br />
Try a third tier or forth tier guild :)  We have lots of fun and when we get to the point we can do NToV it will be empty again and just as fun as when the first tier guilds did it so very long ago.<br />
<br />
Gerka != Uber and never will be, but Gerka == lots of fun.  Gerka == Uber for 2 years ago.  The day he is no longer fun then ....  hello Berka ... or Serka ... or ....<br />
<br />
I just can't wait for EQ2 *smile*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I made a monk and a druid 2box pair to play with some friends when the Kane Bayle server opened.<br />
<br />
It was actually fun and challenging when everyone was a newbie.  The new armor quests that have been added for the newbies are also really really good.  Being a newbie now, even on a new server isn't as hard as it used to be.   I mean the monk newbie pants, that my monk soloed for at like level 6 are better than monk pants from PoF.  /giggle.<br />
<br />
My druid won a combine scimitar at a GM event the first day the server was open(omg uber).   It was a very fun and interesting diversion for all of... about 8 play sessions.   Then my chars were both in their teens, there were already people that were level 40+ and the levelling got kinda slow after level 10 or so...still didnt have enough money for the druids spells... /bye newbieness.<br />
<br />
The idea of being a newbie for a few days was fun.  The idea of being not a &quot;late-comer&quot; to the game was attractive as well.   I did not even start playing until right after Kunark was released and the game wasn't new.  Howver, it was quickly apparently that I did not have the time or energy to powergame to the high levels on a new server and I missed Henora.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sounds like you just described restarting on a new server.<br />
<br />
I really don't think anyone who went through the game from the first few months till now is nutso enough to go back :p</div></div><hr />
