<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need a viewpoint from the experienced players please.  I've looked at the stats of these 3 sets of gear (planar, Thurg, and JB) and I don't think that the planar OR the Thurg quest armor is a big improvement over the JB.  From my point of view, It's not worth going on a plane raid for 6 hours to get a chance at such a minor upgrade.  Same goes for Kael...I've heard drops are pitifully rare.  For comparison, I picked the boots, but any slot could be dicussed (arms, head, etc).<br />
<br />
<br />
Rune Etched Boots (from Hate):<br />
AC: 14   WT: 4.9<br />
AGI+9  HP+20  SV COLD+7<br />
<br />
Rune Crafter's Boots (Thurg Quest):<br />
AC: 18   WT: 3.0<br />
STA+5  WIS+3  <br />
Effect: Extinguish Fatigue(Unlimited Charges)<br />
<br />
Jaundiced Bone Boots (500pp in ECommons):<br />
AC: 18   WT: 6.5<br />
Effect: Nimble(Unlimited Charges)<br />
<br />
I am currently lvl 46, never been on a plane raid, don't own Velious (yet).  I am wearing the JB in the 'common' slots (boots, gloves, arms, head).<br />
<br />
Recently, my guild has started raiding Kael for the armor drops, and we hosted a plane raid as well (Hate).  Although we have quite a few experienced players, our guild is just now getting large/powerful enough to do these places in-house, with just a few friends.  <br />
<br />
I would prefer to NOT raid Kael, or go on the planes...The idea of spending all afternoon with my friends is great, but I think would be better off hunting in Luclin, and grouping/xping.  I have several pieces of gear that need upgrading, and so I'd rather not 'waste' my time.<br />
<br />
Here is my current gear setup, I'm saving for a JBB as my next goal.<br />

Comments?  Opinions?  Can I just skip RuneCrafter's, RuneEtched and get gear from other places until I can hit ToV?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didnt find the drops in Kael to be abnormally rare.  I didnt go very oftern but still managed to pick up the BP and Legs, plus a circlet of tallon from the arena.  The BP, Legs, and Bracer are big upgrades from your current gear unless you are married to the having the regen from your Ikky BP.  Plus the drops from the Kael arena are a hell of a lot easier to get than the ones from HoT.  You can take 1 to 2 groups into the arena and be pretty sucessful.  To raid HoT you will need quite a few more people to have a chance and the mobs are much more difficult than the giants in the arena.  My point is the thurg armor is not quite as good as the HoT stuff but unless you are in a pretty solid guild with a significant number of folks 55+, the kael stuff is a good bet.  You can save your money and buy some of the dragonhide armor as an alternative to raiding.  The legs are cheap( sorta) but the BP will cost you a pretty penny usually.    Heck alot of folks sell the MQ of thurg chain pieces for next to nothing nowadays.  That might be your best bet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most peices I'd probably rather have jaundiced bone over rune etched or the Thurgardin quested.  Bp and Legs being the definate exception, because most shaman wont have the jb legs and bp.  <br />
<br />
On another note, the biggest thing you need for HoT is levels mostly.  My last HoT raid, we were beaten to the entrance camp by a 7 person raid.  No, they didnt take the mobs down superfast, but I dont recall them wiping out the whole time I was there.  They werent bothering to use a channel, so we had to here they &quot;attack x mob&quot; and &quot;plate gauntlets dropped&quot; in ooc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm going to have to disagree on the levels thing for HoT.  It's not just levels.  To do a 7 person HoT run, you need very high end equipment, and a hand-picked set of classes.  If you need the drops for HoT (and I would strongly suspect that group of 7 didn't--they were probably either goofing off, or farming armor for their twinks/guild), then you probably will need 2-3 groups.  I'd say 2 full groups of 60 minimum.  Most guilds needing HoT armor drops won't have the uber weapons for the necessary DPS, or the AC/resists to handle extended engagements with fewer characters.<br />
<br />
Comparing a single piece isn't necessarily a good way to go.  Compare all of them.  Some may have a difference of a few AC.  Keep in mind that small changes in AC can have a sizeable difference when worn, as a defense bonus is included.  5 raw AC may be an actual 9 AC difference.  Stats and resists are very important, too.<br />
<br />
On the boots, notice that the stamina of +5 will be a +15 hp at level 60.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I have my wisdom at 255 for a larger mana pool (not that I wouldn't be willing to drop it in a heartbeat for more AC/HP if I see a decent upgrade).  I would consider 15 more HP and 3 more wis a decent upgrade.<br />
<br />
If you choose to go the route of the velious armor, I'd try for SS or Kael armor, not thurg if you can swing it.  Either of those are substantially better than even thurg.  However, I wouldn't turn my nose up at thurg either.<br />
<br />
Some other thoughts . . . if you want to do the shawl or ring quests in thurg someday, killing in Kael will help get you faction.  Also, I don't know what your guild is like, but my guild would happily boot someone that was out exp'ing during a raid.  Even if you'd rather be doing exp, it might behoove you to take one for the team and go anyway.  You might get a decent armor upgrade, but you are definitely building more goodwill.  You may need help later (epic!).<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In order to advance to higher things such as TOV, your guild should gain experience raiding together.  Hate and Kael are good places to do this.  At the same time you can upgrade your equipment which is also necessary.   All this is in addition to gaining levels.   <br />
<br />
Hate is important for epic drops for many classes, such as enchanters.  Having an epic enchanter for haste helps lots.  Getting rangers with earhtcallers can help a lot.  In order for your tanks to be able to survive tanking in places like TOV, they need to have good armor Hate and Thurgadin Quest can help them with that.  It's too bad you don't see the value of helping your guild obtain these things.  In the long run it helps you too.  It takes time to gear up a guild, but that's how things work.  If everyone in the guild only thought about themselves then you would get no where.<br />
<br />
You can't walk into TOV in banded with a group of strangers and expect to walk out with arms full of loot.<br />
<br />
Regarding the quality of Rune Etched.<br />
Sure it's not great.  The legs can be decent until you get Velious quest, the bracer is okay, if you have great equipment at 46 then it may not be an upgrade at all.<br />
<br />
Thurgadin &gt; JB in all slots for me (except one bracer)<br />
<br />
and OT....I dunno, HoT doesn't seem to overly hard for us to do with 6 people.  Look at my stuff, any Skyshrine armor I have was obtained with 8 people or less(lacking arm and leg for full set).  Same with all the rest of my friends.  None of us have uber weapons or armor, but decent.<br />
<br />
The key for us is 60 shaman with malo and torpor, 60 bard for resists, oos, hastes, 55+ warrior, cleric, monk puller, dmg class(rng, rog, hell we have done it with 2nd warr, sk, 2nd bard).<br />
<br />
First time we did it with 60 shaman, 60 monk, 60 bard, 55 warrior, 56 cleric, 59 ranger.  It takes people knowing their stuff and working together well, but it's clearly doable.   We have spent vast amounts of time working together and learning exactly what we have to do to make things work and have even survived LDs of the cleric and others at times.   <br />
<br />
We do it with 6 because I am in a guild of essentially 10 people, so we have to.  However, we aren't an ordinary 10 people, we are nearly all now level 60 and very experienced working together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its my opinion that thurg helm, boots, legs, chest are better than JBB. And the thurg bracer isnt bad either.<br />
<br />
My experience has been that the kael drop rates on chain legs and bp are pathetic. Same in HoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
whoa...lets back that train up.<br />
I would have hoped that after 200+ posts I would have made at least a bit of an impression on some of you.  I am far from 'greedy', or selfish.<br />
<br />
I admit to not writing out 2 pages of details on how things currently are in my guild, so I'm not going to get too upset about your comments. <br />
<br />
I personally have no desire to get this armor, and so I asked for opinions on what I was missing.  I missed the Velious boat, I don't own that expansion and it hasn't hurt me so far...Luclin is far, far better in my opinion. <br />
<br />
What I *perceive* to be the case is that most people think Planar armor and Thurg armor are the next logical step in gear.  Just like people think Oasis - LOIO - OT - DL  is the sh*t when it comes to getting xp.  There are tons of nice zones to hunt, but the sheep all go to those zones.  The same goes with gear.  Hey, after you get your Kunark Armor go get your Planar Armor to go get your Thurg Armor to get your Skyshrine Armor...blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
After carefully reviewing the gear, I think we could do better (as a GUILD) if more time was spent on the moon instead of Velious, or the Planes.<br />
Because my guild is just now getting to the level where we can achieve these things, I believe that if I can present a nice, well reasoned suggestion about other places to hunt (and include a list of possible drops) we can get *better* gear in less time. Hell, our tanks could do better by getting cultural armor from our guild smith.<br />
<br />
At lvl 46, I don't even make the level requirements for the current raids. I'm about 6 - 8 levels below the core group of raiders in my guild. Most of them are in the low 50s, and we have 3 or 4 that are 55+.  I'm not keeping us out of NToV, our levels are.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the opinions and comments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay perhaps that came out sounding harsher on you personally than I had intended.<br />
<br />
Basically what I am saying is that there are genuinely good reasons to go to these places.  For the betterment of the guild as a whole.<br />
<br />
Planes for epics and to fill in spots of armor.<br />
<br />
Velious for equipping your whole guild, in full suits of armor that many will likely wear until the day they quit.<br />
<br />
Tell me somewhere in Luclin you can go to get armor of the same or better quality than Velious for each slot for each member in your guild at once.  Hit Kael arena for a day, you get armor for plate, chain, leather and silk classes.  You get items ranging from BPs, to helms to bracers.  All at one time, on one raid, in one location.   You don't wait for one spawn to be up.  You can raid any time it's open and you have a virtual unlimited number of mobs to keep you going.<br />
<br />
Umbral is the only place on Luclin that compares in the slightest.   <br />
The only decent stuff there is the plate really.  Look at the laughable shaman armor.  The drop rate is also FAR less than in Kael in my opinion.  I see lots more armor in Hate in 3 hours than in Umbral for 3 hours.  Umbral is good for equipping your melees with weapons though.  Radir/Tawro can drop nice ones.<br />
<br />
I think you are really discounting Velious.  Velious armor is the starting point for almost all guilds moving on to bigger things(ntov, luclin bosses, ssra), in my opinion.  For example, to get Kunark BPs, you must kill Trak and to get Kunark legs you must kill VS.   A Velious BP has a chance to drop off any mob in many areas of Kael.  Same with Velious legs.  And there is armor for every class in Velious.   Including monks and casters who have no armor in Kunark.<br />
<br />
Are all your tanks of one race, the same race as your grandmaster smith?  And of the proper religion?  In that case maybe the smithed stuff would be nice for them.  However it also takes BDs to make that stuff... Hate is a really good place (the best IMO) to gather BDs.  hehe.<br />
<br />
If you can come up with a way to avoid outfitting your guild in Velious armor, while still getting them better gear in less time...  Well, more power too you, though I don't believe it can be done.  I'd certainly be curious to see your plan.<br />
<br />
-Henora<br />
<br />
PS - I think Old world planar was pre-kunark, so the order was more like... planar/kunark/velious.  Which is probably why you don't think old world planar stacks up with Kunark.. and it doesn't in many cases.<br />
<br />
Personally I never wore any planar armor.  I never even went to Hate seriously until I was level 60.  For me it's always been about Velious armor, first thurgadin, now Skyshrine.<br />
<br />
--edit:  Chutoi best not be calling me names!  /smack :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Snap, before you dismiss velious, I'd go look up the various armor sets on the moon.  There are some nice single pieces, though quite hard to get, but few sets that can be done that are equivalent to velious armors.  Most of the high end mobs in luclin require velious armor and damage.  Frankly, I think SoL is a horrible expansion, though I know a lot of folks would disagree.<br />
<br />
Even the new crafted armor, which is indeed quite nice, has limitations.  I believe it isn't flagged as magic.  Most high level mobs are magic weapon only--so your tanks can't bash them with the crafted guantlets (or shoulders--I don't remember which piece determines bash).  Not to mention the amount of work needed to get the smithing skill up that high is just plain silly.<br />
<br />
Additionally, if you want to be a raiding guild, and it seems that your guild is (I apologize if I'm misinterpreting what you wrote), then you'll want to get velious anyway.  There is a LOT of stuff to raid in velious, and fewer and much harder things in SoL.<br />
<br />
To be perfectly honest, I don't know if you could go from a low tier guild to a high tier guild without velious weapons and armor.  The raid mobs SoL jump from merely difficult to insanely hard without a lot of middle ground.  I think it'd be awfully hard to make that jump without velious.  :)  SoL mobs tend to have strange AoEs and insane AC.  VI tried to balance out the melee and make the casters more effective, but instead came out with an abortion of a expansion.  :p<br />
<br />
Ah well.  At any rate, you know your guild far better than we do!  Do what's best for ya!<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmmm, I can't think of any SoL armor drops (besides the bracers in UP) that are decent for shaman (the ME shaman stuff is pretty awful).  I mean, sure there are some great big raid drops (that bp from the ring of fire, for example, but not a lot of options for lower level, small group stuff).<br />
<br />
Are you sure you don't want to get Velious?  It's a pretty decent expansion.  The Ringwar alone is nearly worth the price of admission.  Thurg is a great little city for crafts, SG can be incredibly beautiful, outdoor WW dragon hunting is a blast (and also drops semi decent shaman stuff, the bracers/bp are particularly nice!)  DN is a fun zone for exp and drops (phase spider carapace).<br />
<br />
Henora was quite right, as far as outfitted an entire guild of people, the planes/Velious quest armor is a very time efficient way to do so.  HOT is especially great, the mobs pop every 72 minutes, chances of drops for everyone.  It's also really really good practice with AOE mobs!  With SoV armor, you combine hitpoints/AC/wis/resists, so you don't have to do so much armor switching...you can maintain a nice high mana pool AND have the resists to help offset a 300 point AOE.<br />
<br />
As far as melee weapons, it would be funny if you told your melees you thought it was a good idea to just skip the Velious expansion! :p   Sorry guys, no primal for you!<br />
<br />
And I'm sorry we don't know the exact circumstances for your guild, but when you say you don't want to go the planes or Kael and &quot;waste your time&quot; that seems pretty selfish, especially considering how many epic drops are available in the planes (gloves for necro epic, sword for SK epic, essence for enchie epic, shissar thing for enchie epic, bp for pally epic, mage staff for mage epic, orb thingie for ranger epic, tear for shaman epic *cough*, broken golem oil for wizard epic, book for rogue epic...)<br />
it makes you look self centered.<br />
<br />
Most of us have &quot;wasted a lot of time&quot; in the plane soley to benefit others and react to such statements accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gud lord!!  Buy Velious because it is a ton of fun and has quite a few worthwhile quests to boot.  I would rate Velious over Luclin any day because of content.  Luclin just looks pretty and has some weird end-game encounters with supa-ubah lewt.<br />
<br />
Since you have &quot;never been on a planes raid&quot; I would highly suggest you go.  You might even have fun and decide that larger encounters can be fun too.  There is something pretty amazing about 30+ people all working to take out a single mob that can't be found in the Sebilis Jail or Funless Grove.<br />
<br />
Don't limit yerself and try it all...heck at 46 you is a youngin'!!!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rune-etched sucks, imho.  I have never owned a piece of it and probably never will.  The AC is low and most of the stats are junk (yay, the helm has int and dex on it.  woot!  uber!!!!)<br />
<br />
Thurgadin armor is definately the way to go.  The AC might be a little bit lower than JB, but the hp/mana/wis boosts on select pieces makes it worth it.  Any piece that has hp/mana/wis and respectable AC is an upgrade from JB.  It's not a huge upgrade, but this is not a game about advancing by leaps and bounds.  You have to go slow.  Unless you join a guild that is willing to take a level 46 to ToV and get them dragon armor, you're going to have to settle for thurg first.<br />
<br />
btw, go to every raid that you possibly can.  Your guild will appreciate your enthusiasm and will have nothing but good things to say about you.  I went to kael for the first time when I was 47.  I had some trouble slowing stuff, but I did slow a few things and my buffs helped.  You won't be useless - just go.<br />
<br />
(btw LEVEL UP and your armor woes will come to an end)<br />
<br />
edit:  WW dragon armor has some good pieces.  The legs have great AC and STA (I used to have peerless, downgraded to worked b/c I needed cash =\) and look great.  The bracer and cloak are also excellent.  The mantle is great for any class.  If you've got someone in the guild with the right faction to turn in great dragon heads, you can get yourself some Barbed Dragonscale Boots.  19ac 30hp 9sta (not sure on sta).  You can also get your melees some frostbringers while you are at it.  WW has some nice stuff, the only downside is that it will trash your dragon faction in a hurry, which can come around and screw you later on.  Right now I am applied to a guild that raids tov several days a week, but cannot come b/c I am KoS to dragons.  This is hurting me badly b/c I don't get to spend nearly as much time as I want raiding with this guild, and I am not getting and dragon armor and am stuck in thurg/jb/random crap armor.  I really should get myself back on faction before the end of the month, when they move off cov faction =\ (/rant off)<br />
<br />
edit #2:  can you even do the velious armor quests at 46?  I thought I heard that you needed to be 51+ or something?  I could easily be wrong though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can get the armor before 46 even, I think around 44 or so My shaman started getting his</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you can get pieces with better AC than JB then go for it. I will never bother with rune-etched. It , like most other classes old plains armor , sucks . Exception if your an iksar .<br />
<br />
The thurg bracer is nice,the other pieces are  kinda blechy . If you get the pieces that have the same or better AC ,it's an upgrade,losing AC is not an option for me.Same can be said for the BP, I love looking at the stats on it but then I look mournfully at my Ikky BP and say hmmmmm.......nah .<br />
<br />
Wis on the pieces will not sway me,I'm a shaman , I have no need for wis ;) . HP are nice tho,I might consider lower AC if it has a ton of HP .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well bro if you dont want to raid Kael or planes your armor will only be so so at best or its going to take you a VERY long time to get good armor. You have to look at the set's in the over all. I still use my Hate legs, boots ect.. in ToV just for the resists past that they stay in the bank. So by not doing the raides your actully going to hurt yourself in the long run.<br />
<br />
Now instead of looking at the thurg armor look at the Kael. Thurg and PoG armor is more or less = the stats revers on a few parts. And I belive the ac is about the same has JB. Personlly I got a full set of thurg then changed factions and started in on Kael. (there was also a guild change in there :P ) But anyway compair the kael armor aginst thurg and JB and I think you will notice a big diffrents. Your not going to get major wis and resists but the ac will be a big help at the later lv's. And you can use other slots for resists when needed ring and ear's. And there are some major wis items out there to make up the diffrents, Epic 20, 8th crudgel 15, Sheild of the wurms 15(?)  sheild of bane warding 20 ect ect..<br />
<br />
My advise bro is that even if you see it has a waste now go and spend the time in the long run you will be glade you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for all the input...that's exactly what I was looking for when I asked for other viewpoints.<br />
<br />
After all the different comments it appears I was wrong about Velious but right about the planes.  <br />
<br />
I suppose I'll see about picking up the Velious expansion.  I still don't plan on attending many planar raids (I just can't commit that much time online in a single session - the wife would strangle me).  I'm mainly talking about 'pick up' raids or alliance raids where the epics are spoken for, and peeps are along just for a chance to roll on armor drops.  In-Guild raids for epic drops are different (although the wife would still kill me :) ).<br />
<br />
Additional Question:<br />
Are Thurg/Planar/Kunark Armors similar for other classes?  I mean are the stats differences for Cleric gear similar to the Shaman's?  Or is there a nice jump from one set of armor to another?<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Snugglegutz - You point about the Kael armor being a big jump in gear is exactly my point.  When I started this thread, I was considering jumping (slowly) from Kunark armor to Kael Armor.  In between I was hoping to pick up random items in other places, instead of getting Thurg then going Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">snap here is a crappy partially done chart I made for my guild when we were gearing up that shows the differences between the sets for many classes.<br />
<br />
http://pandemonium.uoregon.edu/drunkentsunami/armor.htm<br />
<br />
for you, as a shaman it is a bit easier to stick with older equipment.  For example, having a velious BP isn't so important as most shaman should be wearing a fungi tunic until they get Torpor.  (I believe you will be thankful for extra HPs and AC on other slots as you level and mob difficulty increases though.)  So if you don't want to, or cannot attend planes raids for chances on armor rolling, probably no huge loss other than raiding experience.  :)<br />
<br />
However, to be most effective as a guild your tanks really probably need better gear than the kunark stuff they can pickup in their 40s.  For example, Hate pants and BPs can really help out warriors because their Kunark BPs and pants are much more rare.  So hopefully they could pick that up.<br />
<br />
Many guilds that want armor from Kael quests skip fighting in Kael for Thurgadin armor and instead fight in Plane of Growth for armor drops there.  (They are comparable to Thurgadin)<br />
<br />
Fighting in West ToV requires a total guild commitment and extensive faction work.  West ToV from what I understand is not ever a 1 grp possible thing, even for a well balanced group of 60s.  Fighting in Kael even at the low 50s can be done with a single group and you can do the minimal amount of faction work needed at the same time you are fighting for armor drops.   While you fight in the arena for drops you also gain CoV (skyshrine) faction, in addition to Thurgadin faction, so when your guild is powerful enough to  do Halls of Testing their faction is ready.  It doesn't take hours and hours to fight in Kael either.  Lots of times we went for an hour or 2.  It's easier because you don't need a 60 tank, x number of clerics, an enchanter, etc etc that you need for bigger raids and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Sadly, if you don't have time for 4-6 hours in the planes, you probably won't have time for 4-6 hours in TOV in the future either.  :(  So you might want to take advantage of grabbing armor when you can since you can't raid as much as others in your guild/alliance.<br />

Best of luck.<br />

If you are interested in drop rates and stuff from HoT, here is some data I gathered.  This is with a group of 6-11 people who can fight 5-7ish mobs per hour.  171 kills, 54 drops, 28% drop rate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">if you want full thurg/kael/ss armor there's not much to do but get in a guild that can handle it and spend 100+ hours farming with your friends.....it can get very tiresome at times, not seeing chain drop for ages for example, or maybe not the pieces you need. just gotta hang in there and you'll get full sets of what you need. but you need to stick with your guild and attend raids.<br />
<br />
but as said, velious is the most fun expansion no doubt. lots of great quests at all levels, many places to raid for low end guilds level 50+ and up to the high end stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am not sure that I understand the question, but here is my amswer to what I think the question is:<br />
<br />
The Rune Etched armor from Hate was originally the uberest of the uber armor from when EQ first came out (before the Kunark expansion). When Kunark came out, the new toy for shaman was the JB armor. JB armor is probably marginally better than the Rune etched (except some slots), and the stuff that drops from Karnors is relatively easy to get, but the stuff that drops from deep in Sebelis is actually quite hard to get, almost on a par with Hate. So, yes, things like JB arms and gloves are much &quot;cheaper&quot; or easier to get than Rune etched, but the BP for example isnt.<br />
<br />
The velious armor came out, and more new toys were offered. Most of the Thurgy quest armor (Rune Crafters) is no better than JB/RE, but it can be got by 1 competent  non uber group, whereas Hate and Deep Sebelis cannot be done by 1 competent non uber group. So, for small guilds, KD arena will allow a good path to get quite reasonable gear with only 6 people. My tiny guild did arena this weekend with: 60Warrior, 58drood, 56Mage, 53 Chanter, 51 Shaman, 49 Cleric - and it was pretty easy to control. We got about 5 drops in about 2.5 hours in the arena...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>fenwyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Of the 3 armor sets, JB is BY FAR the worst.  The Bracer is the only piece you will be wearing at level 60, unless you luck into some VS or Trak raids.  At 46, you probably think all of the click buffs are nifty, but by your mid 50's you will never, ever use those buffs again, leaving you with nothing but decent AC.<br />
<br />
The next best armor set is Thurg.  There are several nice peices that are minor upgrades to JB, basically just adding sta and wis to an almost identical AC.  However, the only piece really worth the effort is the helm, as its the first helm with wisdom on it since totemic, and even if you hate raiding Kael, you can get this for 3k in a MQ.<br />
<br />
The Hate armor that so many trash is actually the most solid armor set imho.  The BP and Legs are very nice, and the bracer works well as a compliment to your JB bracer.  To say that you need to bring a raid force to hate is funny.  1-2 55+ groups in decent gear can exp in hate and get these drops.<br />
<br />
Now keep in mind that I am not currently a raider of ToV.   Full SS armor blows away just about anything, even if it does have a chain graphic *pukes*.<br />
<br />
Here is my list of visible armor pieces, notice how many are non raid items, how many are from velious, and how I managed to maintain a full plate look.<br />
<br />
Thurg Helm, Hate BP, Hate Legs, JB Bracer - CC Arms, Bracer of Hammerfall (for the looks, but comparable to Hate Bracer anyway), CC Gloves, Tribal War Boots<br />
<br />
I use my non visable slots to max out wisdom, or ac/resists depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
What I am getting at is that at level 60 I wear 4 pieces of armor from the places we are discussing.  I sold all my JB other than the bracer, I let Kael drops go to people that don't mind looking like newbies in banded, and The rest of my Hate gear is in the bank.<br />
<br />
Velks has some incredible armor for Shamans, and if you don't mind wearing chain, Velious is a boon for shaman armor.  Not to mention Velious contains the quest for the Othmir Prexus Totem, which single handedly but my wis and stamina through the roof.<br />
<br />
The planes are efficient yet bland, Luclin is pretty but has little in the way of items (barring cloak of truth and shielf of bane warding), but velious is efficient AND pretty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Katyana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think that the Velious Expansion was very well done and would advise you to install it and see for yourself.<br />
KD is a wonderful zone for a Guild to &quot;practice&quot; tactics in and the reward of armor drops important if you have aspirations of tackling ToV. Although I earned a BP early on in my raiding there, I found drop rates to be a major incentive to move on to the next level.<br />
I think that Henora's data regarding HoT drop rates is the best argument for directing your Guild/Core Group towards the goal of raiding there. I have seen nights where a piece of armor dropped every three mobs, some slightly less, but always many good pieces in a fairly short time. It is doable with a single group of good players, but levels and classes are critical. Perhaps I was lucky, but I gathered all but my Helm and Arms after the first three raids.  I love the color of SS armor, and the ultimate goal of any Shaman is not high Wisdom, AC or Hit points. The whole point is to look good~~ <br />
Raiding zones like KD and ToV is great fun in my opinion. They will demand more from your group or Guild than most zones and force players to play their classes well. I think the RvR in these zones is very appropriate. My experiences with Planar raids is quite the opposite. I think for the difficulty of the fight, drop rates and armor quality, Hate is awful. The Planes are a necessary evil in Epic piece aquisition, but I would not have gone post Velious solely in the hopes for armor. I almost petitioned when I saw the Shaman armor drops in UP. I still do not understand the Moon. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bordainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My advice still is to level and it will all come soon enough, if u are not 60 that the best road.  I moved servers and have been pretty much  guildless since 55 and am now 60.  I have no hate, no ss or kael armor, and one thurg drop legs. But i have over 1kac and 251 wis.  But now i am 60 and going 100% at armor, Can't wait for my ss/kael armor.<br />
<br />
Anyway my point is, dont spend to much time in kael etc.... its rare and in long run not worth it, if u gonna play game to the max, u just gonna end up putting that stuff in bank and not useing anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you dont want to mess with Thurg armor and arena raids. Then go stright for giant faction and hit PoG every oppertunity you get. Same Ac has thrug but the stats revers on the arms and legs I belive, like say Thurg arms are 3sta 4wis PoG arms would be 4sta 3wis (Yes I know these are not the actul stats just an exsample) And I also found the PoG drops to be MUCH rare'er than kael chain. Personally sinces I had Thurg I never looted PoG armor. Also do the Kael quest Girdel of refection (sp) This bealt is better than the one from fear and not a very hard quest. I got lucky on the tofs mob and had the whole quest done in under 2 hours. 12ac 6wis 35hp is the stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Can do Hate with 1 group, if you know what you're doing, including 2nd floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I disagree with one of the first posts about a 1 group deal not being able to do HoT unless goofing around.  Me and some friends (once all level 60), in a mix of hate/kunark armors, started farming HoT 1 group.  It's a tough place to start, but once you've got it down we never died.  Took about 2-3 weeks, outfitted all 6 of us in full SS (except robe, f silk), and made 200-300k in sold mq's from extra drops before we finished our sets =)<br />
<br />
As for the original post, some thurg stuff is better than JB, some not, but don't forget about getting HP gear.  I don't remember pieces off hand, but giving up 1-2 ac for 20-30 hp is well worth it.<br />
Get 3-4 groups in the Arena and you'll get enough armor drops to start equipping people.  The rates aren't that great if you're killing slowly with 1-2 groups, but a good sized raid can get some nice stuff in a few raids.  Plus named mobs and sceptres of mastery for your monks =)  Gladiator chain sleeves/legs are both nice pieces at that level too.</div></div><hr />
