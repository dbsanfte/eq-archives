<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lomotil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I may have missed it, but I just wanted to let the shaman community know of a way I found to raise my skill from 135 to 180 in a very cheap manner.<br />
<br />
There is a new recipe from the SoL expansion called Titan's potion. The ingredients are in Shadowhaven. Can't remember them off the top of my whiskers, but one of the ingredients is tri'fern leaf. Making these is just a bit more spendy than making SoW potions.<br />
<br />
Again, forgive me if I am repeating anything, but I discovered a disgruntled shaman in the hustle of the bazaar once..she was in despair over how to raise funds (besides asking frieds the help) to make gate potions and such to raise her skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks Opi, but that's been known for a bit.  Even been afraid that they'd remove it as it was too easy to raise skill on.  If they ever make Alchemy worth having, expect that to get nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Knowledge knows no time contraints:)  Had no idea that was the way to go.  I don't spend as much time in-game or even out doing research on these things...so it's nice when someone posts the occasional 'reminder' for those of us who miss previous threads or messages.  Thanks Opi for sharing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the Titan's tip.  Is there a new cheaper &quot;Luclin&quot; way to go from 103 to 135 then as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">best way to go to 135 id that named giant in OOT ... he drops fire,ice and hg toes .. just buy a few stacks of leaves from the gypies and get to work ... with the money from gromit and the sell back of the potions .. youll probly break even if not gain alittle <br />
<br />
there also a little  pirate gnome off to the side of the gormit camp .. farm up some gnome meat .. everybody loves gnome kabobs !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suggest you start making titan potions at skill level 104.  Even though your failure rate will be high at first, it will still be cheaper in the long run that producing 27-37p potions with no resale market.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's nice to get skill increases and not have to worry about a full inventory of useless items... like potions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Leebae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">cheaper maybee but still not cheap cost me almost 1k tonight using those to get from 173 to 180</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hehe - before Titan potions, it would have cost you 5 times that much.  OR MORE!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just wondering-could someone with a low skill make these titan potions just to raise skill? I know I would have a huge failure rate but if I could get my skill up jigh enough to where I rarely fail on SoW potions I could actually make money off them to support future training.<br />
<br />
When the bazaar forced me to stop making potions my skill was 47, so is it possible/viable to do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kinring - if I understand your question correctly, yes.  Any recipe has an equal possibility of improving your skill (in alchemy as well as other tradeskills), provided it is not already trivial of course.  Titan potions will get you there as quickly as any others that are trivial above your current skill.  However, at 10.5pp per attempt, Titans are still more expensive than quite a few other of the potions that trivial up to 96.  Aura of Heat and Aura of Cold both cost 8.4pp per attempt, with several others of the same cost clustered at nearby trivials.  See the EQ Traders  alchemy prices (http://www.eqtraders.com/prices/alchemy.htm) for more details. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used cheaper potions with closer trivials, as Verdandi suggests.  Don't resell for much--tho I think I read in another thread some of the resale valuses have been improved a bit--but your cash outlay is less to begin with, and should have more sales back with things closer to trivial.</div></div><hr />

I can't see much of a use for this, besides the occasional gnome with an attitude problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I see them for sale in Bazaar for about 150.  When I was skilling up I'd never be able to get rid of them in /auc for that price.  <br />
<br />
I had 3 at that price for 3 days.  I finally got tired of waiting for sales and dropped 'em to 125 just to recoup the cost.  Sold overnight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Those stat potions aren't useless.  I used to make them in 5 and 10 shots and give them to clerics who rezzed me.  I would also occasionally give one to someone who bought 3 or more potions from me.  Sometimes it is the little things that keep people coming back.  My skill is currently 104 and once start making titan potions, I will probably do the same thing with those.<br />

<br />
I was working on my alchemy skill again ( hehe yes yes unbelievable:) and was trying to find the ingredients for the Titan Potion:<br />
Maliak leaf and trifern leaf.<br />
<br />
Now where can i buy them? I checked the vendors out in SH at the porter hall which leads you to the shaman guild.<br />
<br />
Anyone can help me out?<br />

For the 20-30 hours I've had the mule selling stuff - I think 3 have actually been purchased...  and 100p is BELOW cost.  :(</div></div><hr />

What's the market like for Grow?<br />
<br />
I can't see much of a use for this, besides the occasional gnome with an attitude problem. <br />
<br />
I spent over 1k making a single 10shot Grow to skillup with.  Been on my bazaar mule for days and days /played time for 150pp (is this not the price of a shrink potion?), even put it in the top slot so everyone sees it when they browse me for other potions.  It hasn't sold.<br />
<br />
I've decided I'm just gonna give it my alt, who just so happens to be a gnome (warrior) with an attitude problem. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, I can see that any type of potion above trivial gives you a chance to skill up, but does success or failure on the potion itself modify that any?  It seems intuitive that if you succeed in MAKING the potion you're trying to combine that you would have more chance to actually learn something...but as we all know logic has often eluded the folks at Verant.  ;) <br />
<br />
If that's so, it might be a bit more productive to attempt things closer to your current skill.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just made Grow potions after 103 to get to 180.  Gave most of them away to guildies, the Rangers like them to help see over people for Archery.  I sold a few back, but the buyback price is so low that it hardly mattered.<br />
<br />
Right after the Bazaar opened I used it to clear out my bank of 3 years worth of accumulated crap :)  That funded my 180 Alchemy skill :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've been giving them to druids for ports recently... also I've sold 1 10shot in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
But only 1.<br />
<br />
Luckily, my sales of shrink and sow enable me to skill up further, as I've had some requests for flurry, ds, and gate potions, and I want to trivial these before I even attempt to make them.<br />

Going on a tangent - diggin up old info and adding more FUD....<br />
Theoretically the top you can &quot;have&quot; for Alchemy is 198....<br />
180 Cap and Philosopher's Stone with a 10% bonus giving ya 180+18=198...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don't have 180 atm so I cant confirm the rumors that 180 is absolute cap and this stone doesnt help...  Nor do I fully understand the AA skill that suppose to help....<br />
<br />
Any experts out there want to put this to rest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Crymsinshade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've had no problems selling my Titan potions for 200pp per 10 dose in the bazaar. And I've also noticed people buy up all the Grow potions I have on me at one time, whether it be 2 or 4 10 doses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>wyrdrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thining about it, I bet they made the trivial's for the luclin potions &gt; 180 because some person thought that alchemy was like all the other trade skills and could go to 250, and this was their &quot;kind&quot; gift of letting shaman skill up via it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">They sell slowly. Very very very slowly. Like this weekend, my trader was up 24/7 and I sold...... one.<br />
<br />
I have eight up for sale now.<br />
<br />
Since it took me 1k to get 4 points (now at 146 skill), I am going to have titans potions coming out my ears before it's all over... and don't even get me started on the 39 opal steins I have to sell (for one measily skillup, to 208).<br />
<br />
Drastic measures will have to be taken...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dargadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Face it, you're not going to find a market for most potions.  I don't know why Verant sees fit to make the potions so expensive to make and of such limited value, but they do.<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't think most player have any idea how useful some of our potions are, they just figure that 70pp per dose of Kilva's Skin of Flame is way too much.  We really should invest in a public awareness campaign of some sort...<br />
<br />
My alchemy is at 122 now, I will have to check out making Titan potions.  I also save up cash until I can get a KEI to work on potions.  It cost me about 4k to get from 72 to 122 with KEI.<br />
<br />
As for selling potions, my best sellers are SoW, Shrink, and Levitate potions.  SoW potions have been driven down in price to the 80's  by the Bazaar, so I'm actually getting a much better margin on Shrink potions.  Still, it's SLOW selling them.<br />
<br />
And just to be sure, skill increase rate depends on the GREATER of INT or WIS, right, not just INT?</div></div><hr />
