<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today (30-3-03) I did the turn in to Shardwurm Broodmother with a mule, and log in my main which is parked right outside the Coldain mines.<br />
<br />
Broodmother did not attack either of the coldain when arrived, and Korf did not flee which I think he's supposed to....and both coldain npcs despawned after like 3 minutes standing there doing nothing. Broodmother starting walking back to cave after like another minute.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done this quest lately and succeeded? or did I do something wrong...well the quest had been triggered successfully anyway. I petitoned and hope they would reimburse the control harness to me.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That is not supposed to happen. They should restore your harness to you, then see if you can try it again with a GM watching the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am not sure that the Broodmother does attack the other NPC - I have a vague feeling that the broodmother becomes the 2nd dwarf's pet. From memory, once the broodmeother arrives you attack Korf and he takes off running. I could be wrong though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Done the quest about 8 times now for myself and friends. 1 of the 8 times the same thing happened to me. The Broodmother arrived and Korf did not run. 7 times he ran like a ranger and I duely removed the bracer off him.<br />
<br />
The one time that did happen was when a wizard (obviously KoS to dwarfs) kited near by. Looked to bug the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just did the quest for a druid friend on 28-mar-03 and it worked fine!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gothra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just wanna make sure....Korf runs to south (right hand side when you're looking at coldain mine entrance), correct?<br />
<br />
They reimburse the Giant Harness of Control, I did the turn in second time and this time Korf poofed right after Broodmother arrived and attacked Korf's friend. Should not be lag though....well I petitioned again anyway.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried this quest twice about a month ago and it bugged both times on me.  Same thing happened to me as you Gothra.  I used a faction mule for the turn ins, wonder if that somehow causes a problem.  I petitioned but didnt have 4 hours to wait around for a response.<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NEEKLOT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have done this many times for friends and twinks with the level 1 Halfling Rallos Zek mule method. Remember that the original NPC will poof and another will reappear running away from mines along hillside. Root and kill and there ya go. I only had a problem once when someone interfered with Broodmother. It was quicker to just run to CC and get more Karsic Acid than to petition. <br />
     Well worth it though. My 53 Druid DOTs ramp up in power nicely with this item equipped. A must have for Druids and Shamans (necros too I guess).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sit on the hill and watch Korf. Of course you have him targetted and are bored because it is taking about 6 minutes for Broodmother to get to you. Korf does not have CMW as you watch him. Korf despawns and respawns running. If you are not watching the second this happens you can miss him easily. He takes off due south and runs pretty fast. Twice when I counted on others to root him, they missed him and lost him so I always work with them and help, logging out before kill to save faction hit.<br />
