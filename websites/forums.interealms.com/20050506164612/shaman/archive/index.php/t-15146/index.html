<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me if the +Chardok faction hits you get in the new Nurga/Droga are greater than they were pre-change? Ie, is it still 1 goblin = 1 point of Chardok faction?  I really hope they greatly increased this since killing L55+ goblins is considerably more time consuming than laying waste to 4+ mobs at a time.  <br />
<br />
I also read that salts/skins are dropping less frequently- is this true as well?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like the same to me. I went in indifferent, wandered around for an hour in a group, cleared down to old chief's room, cleared it a time or 2, invis'd and killed a few more mobs that looked important (but weren't), then left.  Still indifferent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Salt and skins seem to drop a fair amount still, if it's less often now, it's not by much.  I can't really speak to faction per kill.</div></div><hr />
