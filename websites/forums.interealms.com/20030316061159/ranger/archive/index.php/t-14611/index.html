<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maigraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Guys<br />
<br />
Looking for your words of wisdom again, any suggestions for a 54 Ranger, 51(practically 52) Druid to go level for good xp (not to worried about loot) we are currently in JP doing gnolls but just wandered if there are any better places to go with better xp?  Had tried doing Griffs, but it gets to be tio much of a race to get the them now so we gave up on that.<br />
<br />
I have also heard the entrance of the Hole suggested, but someone else in game said that would be to hard and as never having been there myself I do not know.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Velks? seems most wait till 55 to go there but with a 52 druid (sup. heal) backing you up you should mow through em' also consider Sebs or maybe teir 1 planes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 54 you are rapidly running out of animals that you will be able to fear-kite for xp.Western Wastes would be a challenge cant remember what lvl druids get that animal only tash,otherwise might be too difficult.CoV faction is almost a necessity for that as well.<br />
<br />
Problem is without slow the druid will have a hard time keeping you upright for toe to toe melee against any xp giving mob.<br />
<br />
Ever done any agro-kiting? Druid pulls a mob,snares it,dots it,then proceeds to run around in circles chain snaring to keep agro while you beat mob down from the back.Not a pretty way but it can be effective and that would work in just about any outdoor zone.Maidens Eye,The Grey,Scarlet Desert would be prime candidates for this.<br />
<br />
Druids get animal charm spells as well but not real familair with them.Once they have those go to charm-kiting pet tanks you plink arrows into mob,good xp and good loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Scarlett Desert isn't bad. I killed a LOT of Bloodtribe there in my low to mid-50s, with a druid healer. The named have decent drops, and as long as your gear isn't hopeless you should do OK (can't check Magelo, I use Netscape). I assume you have a way to slow them, if not get a Swarmcaller and head there.<br />
<br />
Velk's Spiders aren't a good option for you yet. While you can probably take one, you are too low level to single pull them so if there is another one in the area you're screwed. They  are also simply not available very often.<br />
<br />
The entrance to the Hole is a good idea, IF it is open. You can certainly do the front 6 with that combo, and should be able to single pull them. Might be able to take the roamer too, but the double spawn (warrior/crusader) will probably be a bit much, and those things don't root worth a damn.<br />
<br />
Have you considered Old World dungeons? SolB bats would be great for you, as would LGuk dead side. Stuff there is wimpy compared with most of the stuff we fight these days, but still gives full dungeon exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maigraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great, thanks for the suggestions :)<br />
<br />
My Druid friend dinged 52 yesterday, and also now there will probably be a 50 Mage along a lot of the time as well, plus the fact I got a Swarmcaller yesterday as well so fingers crossed we will be able to manage the above places sometimes oon :)</div></div><hr />
