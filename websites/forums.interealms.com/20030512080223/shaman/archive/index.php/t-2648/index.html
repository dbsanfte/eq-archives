<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made my shaman alt (main is a monk) and have him setup as follows: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=262023 <br />
<br />
The cloak and tunic are loaners from monky, but I was wondering what could be upgraded without blowing a ton of cash. Also, I have the bracelet of woven grass and PBB for the focus effects only, same with the drakescale belt. I also have a cape of midnigh mist in inventory, my question with the focus stuff is is it worth using a focus item over a stats item just to get its effects? Or how do you guys normally work this? Thanks alot for any help</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It depends on the focus item and it depends on my other gear.  Right now, I'm just considering any item I have with a focus item a happy bonus and I'm not seeing to replace any of my gear JUST for the focus item.  However, if a gear upgrade had a snazzy focus effect as well, I would be happy.  The only exception, if I didn't already have a NTOV shoulder item, I might consider getting an obulus death mantle, it has halfway decent stats AND mana presevation III.<br />
<br />
But stuff that is just SO awful, like that bracelet of woven grass, no way I would wear that, unless it had spell haste III and FT6 or something outrageous.  It's awful gear, even with spell haste I.  (this is my opinion, of course, YMMV).<br />
<br />
You have a fungi tunic, you're going to be great.  Get rid of that druid stuff and get some AC/hitpoints stuff.  Do a search for equipment threads.<br />
<br />
Rings - pair of velium fire opals<br />
face - artic wyvern mask, bone mask of the jarsath, enshrouded veil<br />
JB helm, boots, gloves, arms - no more than 500 plat each<br />
belt - spider belt from velks<br />
legs - shaman don't have a lot of great choices, I know you said you don't have a lot of cash to spend, but dragon hide from WW would be a good bet (those quest ones from GD might be good too).</div></div><hr />

AC &amp; HP &gt; Wisdom gear...<br />
<br />
Yes, but I don't see it as an end-all be-all law.  More of a general principle to help guide your gear decisions.  Things also change as you hit certain benchmarks.  <br />
<br />
One benchmark is when you get Cannibalize at level 24.<br />
Your wisdom and mana that used to be the sole determiner of your mana pool now aren't as important as your total HP.  AC is very important.  It becomes less so once you start hitting soft-caps, but that won't be a problem for you for a long time.<br />
<br />
Hitting 45 and obtaining a JBB is another benchmark in my opinion.  This completely changed my game.  If you are an Iksar (I didn't notice) then hitting 45 won't mean much to you.  The racial restrictions of this one item have created a large # of threads on these boards, but I would say most are in agreement that it is an extremely powerful item.  Definitely get one if you can use it.<br />
<br />
Hitting 50 is another, though lesser benchmark, as now more equipment choices that were level restricted become available to you.  Finishing our comparatively easy epic starts to gain priority in your choice of weapons.<br />
<br />
Once you have Torpor (I do not at 53) at 60 things will change again.  I can't comment on these changes as I'm not there yet.<br />
<br />
HP regen is also extremely important.  You have that taken care of, courtesy of the monk's Fungi loaner.  Flowing Thought items would also factor in, although not as much as HP regen items.<br />
<br />
Focus Items...  Almost all of the powerful shaman here did not start a shaman with the availability of focus items, so you are actually in newer territory here.  The importance of these items (with a few exceptions) is much less at the end of the game then maybe for you currently in the Focus Item I level range.  I would test things out and see how each item benefits you.  Gloriana's advice is sound, so don't switch out your Fungi for a Lockjaw Tunic just because it has a focus effect. :p  (Not to be insulting to think you would, but just to point out a glaring case.)<br />
<br />
I personally set aside my Thurgadin #7-8 Prayer Shawl Quest as a high priority since I've obtained an Obulus Death Shroud.  The mana savings to me is worth much more than a little AC/HP/Wisdom.  My #4 shawl will probably sit in the bank for a long time since I can't stand the population that dwells in Velk's.<br />
<br />
When I put on the ODS, I took off the Chokidai Hide Spaulders I had been wearing.  Now I only where the Spaulders only for tradeskills...<br />
<br />
Definitely dump the wisdom rings for HP/AC.  At your level, courtesy of your monk, hunt or buy the easist pieces of JB armour for the AC alone at your current level.  <br />
<br />
Complete a search for equipment threads here, and in an hour or so, you will have a good idea of other gear choices to strive for.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and welcome to the ranks of Shaman.<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
