<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, after much debate and losing my corpse when someone from my former guild played Callir and died and didn't recover the body, I finally ended up getting rid of him. In return, I got a fully equipped 51 shadowknight, and a BE BP, so I'm happy. However, the canabalize button is calling, and I've decided I'm going to start a new shaman. <br />
<br />
I've settled on an iksar this time around, instead of a barbarian. Don't get me wrong, no one will ever be as sexy as a Barbarian, but I felt that since I likely won't hit 60 and even less likely get Torpor, the regen and ac bonus was nice. Anyway...I was wondering if I could get some links and advice from Leezard Shamen of varying levels on quests, equip progression, hunting progression, all the general newbie stuff.<br />
<br />
And yes, I know, I could have searched, but I didn't want to. If it bothers you, don't respond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You say you are to lazy to search after you whine about lossing your shaman from something &quot;techniccally&quot; you can get banned over anyway. Not to mention just plain dumb.<br />
<br />
Exactly why should people put up links if you are to lazy to do it yourself or even click on the hunting grounds forum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I didn't whine about anything. I merely stated what had happened. Please reread the last sentence.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;quote&gt;&lt;font size=+3&gt;If it bothers you, don't repond.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;<br />
<br />
Oh and I didn't ask for any links, I asked for advice from Iksar shamans. And finally, I dunno if you've looked (you obviously haven't) but there's not much in the hunting grounds for early levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">God forbid you figure out for yourself then contibute to the hunting ground forum.<br />
<br />
But hey if hey if you need to be hand held out to the field of bones just ask a L1 iksar to show the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Targar, do me a favor.<br />
<br />
Go the hell away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xulak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">http://www.championsofcabilis.com<br />
<br />
great source for quests as an iksar, be it shaman, sk, warrior, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only links I've ever used as my Shaman have been this board, EQ Caster's, and Allakhazam's. There really isn't a lot of info for Lizard Shamans specifically out there, although Champs of Cabilis might have something aside from the Cudgel quests.<br />
<br />
As far as armor progression goes, I started off in a suit of the quested Iks/Shm armor (Scaled Mystic). A tip now: don't bother trying to get the sleeves. I gradually upgraded it until I'd reached the 200 wisdom mark, and since then I've been gradually swapping out armor as I obtained larger wis per-piece for AC/HP gear. Some simple pieces you can get for him are: PMM, Forest Loop, 6/65 ring, Chitinous Belt, Shadel Bandit ring, etc.<br />
<br />
If it'd help at all, feel free to check out the link I've got in my sig. As far as your gear goes pre-Velious armor, you should (imho) aim for having mostly Barbed Ringmail and various pieces of Dragon armor (from WW). Great AC/HP, and the bracers especially combine a lot of AC with nice +Wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As a newbie Iksar you'll spend a good portion of your levels in the Field of Bone. There you can do the curscale armor quests, very easy quests and it will yield you some free armor. It's not that great of armor but its free. go to this link if you want more info on the quest: Curscale Quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=96) <br />
You can essentially level all the way to 20, I don't recommend it but it is possible. I leveled to 17 in FOB and went into Kurn's tower until 19 or so. I bought a full suit of banded at 19. I started the cudgel quests but got frustrated because they bored me so I gave up. But I will go back to finish them. The last cudgel is quite a nice weapon. <br />
I began the Scaled Mystic quests at 22 (Iksar equivalent to Totemic). The quests are not too difficult as I had nearly a full suit at 24. I asked to loot the no drop items I needed and turned them in. I didn't bother getting the helm or the sleeves, not worth the effort IMO. I got Rygorr instead. <br />
You can wear Scaled Mystic Armor for quite a while. <br />
You can get various gear all near your home of Cabilis. I got lucky and got a Forest Loop to drop in the Warslik Woods Giant fort at 21. I got my other one in Frontier Mountains at 29..FREE ! I also got a Strawspun Belt in FM...FREE ! <br />
Hunting progression (for me at least)<br />
1-17 Field of Bone<br />
17-19 Kurn's Tower<br />
19-21 Overthere Mud Pit<br />
21-22 Warslik Woods Giant Fort<br />
22-29 Lake of Ill Omen<br />
29-30 FM Giant fort<br />
30-34 Golra Iceberg in Timorous Deep<br />
34-35 Cougar Island in Iceclad Ocean<br />
35-39 Ulthorks in Eastern Waste/Crystal Caverns<br />
39-41 Ice Giants and Drakkel Wolves in Great Divide<br />
41- ? Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains......that's where I'm at now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure of armor progression:<br />
Banded<br />
Scaled Mystic<br />
Rygorr<br />
Jarsath<br />
Seb Scale<br />
Scaled Heirophant<br />
Barbed Ringmail<br />
Velious quested stuff</div></div><hr />
