<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sodami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After an extended break I am coming back to EQ and I plan on making a shaman. I have some items and a 45 druid on Terris Thule I can use to pl a shaman, but I am considering switching servers. If I do decide on switching servers, which has the best economy? Cheapest and easiest to get spells (torpor etc) and cheapest equipment like Fungis etc. Any insight is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">NOT Inny.  Inny's economy sucks, big time.  Oh, did I mention that Inny's economy sucks?  That you can rarely if ever find the useful high end spells.  I've seen malo for sale once in about a month.  As a casual player, I had full intentions of buying malo.  I hit 63 last night and am seriously considering not even bothering with it now.  Malos sells regularly for 25k.  Q for 40k.  Fo7 for 50+.  Heck, Pox is 10-20k and Bane of Nife is around 5k.  Forget torpor unless it's a gift.<br />
<br />
Aye, might wanna change your handle.</div></div><hr />

Here is where I got my name from, it is from engrish.com Personally, I think it is funny.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problem with your question is you are asking about economy and then asking specifically about very unique items/spells that rarely follow the general economy of the server.<br />
<br />
Brell has a very good economy for equipment and most spells.  I've seen most all shaman spells for sale at reasonable prices.  Lots of equipment at fairly good prices.  Bazaar is always packed with near 600 people or more.  I wouldn't worry about the Fungi for a while, learn how to play a shaman without one.  Its a crutch imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a better time to shop for spells?  Am I just doing it wrong?  Or is 50k for Q a reasonable price?  I had a hard time finding Q at all, but got my friend who has a trader in the bazaar all the time to check for it for me.  I can't check continuously as I work and go to school.  She was generous enough to buy it for me for 50k.  I paid her 42 so I still owe her 8, which I have to get ahold of before I even start saving for the next spell.  It took me 6 weeks to save up 42K for Q.  Last time I saw 7 it was 70k.  Is this really considered reasonable?  Cuz I have to tell you that I don't think it is.  <br />
If I am looking at the wrong times or the wrong days or something please let me know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh -- and the other method is to find a researcher -- many MANY of the spells can be found for less than 20% of the price if you buy up all of the research components and do not flub on the combine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, I love spell research.  I have almost all of my 60 and below spells because of spell research.   I paid a total of 4k for torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A person could, I guess.  I don't believe in holding our spells hostage for huge amounts of money, and I always know someone who needs whatever spell, so I would give them all to my friends I am sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is possibly the most f*cked up thing i have ever seen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, come to VS, great for noobs.  Stuff is always cheap here, no clue why.  10k Q's/topor's ect..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shaymin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">omg is your shaman Trini? this is Fatn from kurns the other day =p<br />
also known as the newb shaman Shaymin McShaymus<br />
stay on TT cuz we rox all other servers, Q is only 10k, and 7 is only 25k...FA about 10k sometimes, a bad thing is the jackasses that sell form of the great bear think its right to make it 5k now since LDON came out, it used to be really cheap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is Sodami pronounced like Sodomy (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sodomy) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The economy on Venril Sathir is very nice.<br />
<br />
Torpor usually goes for 5-6k, the 65 spells all go for 9k. (Atleast one bazaar regular has a couple of copies up all the time for 9k each. Q is sometimes sold out, but it's never more than 2-3 days without seeing it under 10k.)<br />
<br />
Fungis run at 60k, and are exceedingly rare. VS has an incredible amount of level 65s, and hence also very many twinks. (And there are pretty few new fungis entering the market, Sebs is pretty quiet these days.)<br />
<br />
Don't expect to make any serious cash by selling tradeskill supplies though. That market seems to be oversaturated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Economy on the Rathe is whacked.  Severely whacked.  Just spent 62k for Q the other day, and that was a good price. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Rallos. Its the only way to fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Worts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Stromm is probably the last place you want to go.<br />
<br />
Granted Spell prices arent that bad (20k Torpor, 45k Q, etc) but everything else is super rare and thus, outrageous.<br />
<br />
WTS Fungi 570k anyone??<br />
WTS Soulstripper 20k anyone?<br />
WTS JBB 100k anyone?<br />
<br />
See what I mean.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I don't think that name would last long in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wow cant believe VS and TT prices are that low, pretty amazing.  Was going to say Prexus was pretty decent, but we cant touch those prices, availability seems to be pretty good here though, if you want it, you can find it.  Most 65 shaman spells I got in the 20-30k price range and fungi tunics seem to be around 45k+.</div></div><hr />
