<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got the basics + a few more.  My main point of interest is input on people that have CA and CS.   I've heard differing stories about the effectiveness of each.  A little about my playstyle:<br />
<br />
I raid alot.  My guild is late Luclin/early POP.  We're all pretty much keyed for VT, and will be entering it as a guild for the first time in a couple of weeks.  We are just starting to focus on POP progression.  I'm usually doing CC type actions:  meztanking, AOE slows, slowing adds, root parking when appropriate.<br />
<br />
When I'm not raiding (or camping VT parts bleh) I usually LDON.  I like the combined AA + long term rewards more than grinding BOT or Tactics (I actually haven't done exp in either since LDON came out).  I do it all in LDON normal mode:  I'll MH, pull, slow, CC, offtank, and every once in a while I'll do all of the above.  Don't do much hard, I wouldn't do a pickup group unless it was one of the uber guilds, and they are all in GoD.<br />
<br />
I slow early, in particular when I'm MH.  I don't mind getting beat on for a bit while the tank establishes agro.  I can take the beating, and Q puts me right back up to full, even on a failed slow.  I don't do much pickup, so I know and trust my tanks, and they rarely suck, so the beatings are usually brief.  I just stand right next to them and bust it off so they odn't have to chase it down and change facing for rogues.  I rarely die outside of raids.<br />
<br />
There are so many I want.  SCR for the extra tick of Q (buffs don't hurt either), CS and/or CA for taking the beating, stupid pet tricks, extra levels of VP for CC, etc.  HA is in there somewhere too, but our heals are gimp enough that I rarely use Tnarg's beyond emergency the-tank-is-at-20%-and-slow-was-resisted situations, and 10% of that just isn't important enough to prioritize over some others.  To top it off, my STA and WIS are both maxxed unbuffed, so the PP and IE route is valid too.<br />
<br />
So, who has any input?  CA?  CS?  SCR?  other?  Magelo shows what I currently have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where do you want to improve? Do you want to become better at raiding or better at grouping or better at soloing?<br />
<br />
My personal preferences would be - in that order - <br />
For raids:<br />
(Radiant cure depending on how many curable AEs you encounter)<br />
(Spirit Call if your guild likes to push stuff into walls)<br />
Healing Adept<br />
Healing Gift<br />
Combat Stability<br />
Combat Agility<br />
and then the PoP versions of the above.<br />
<br />
For groups:<br />
Virulent Paralysis<br />
Combat Agility<br />
Combat Stability<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement<br />
Spirit Call<br />
Healing Adept<br />
Healing Gift<br />
and then PoP versions.<br />
<br />
For soloing:<br />
Virulent Paralysis<br />
Critical Affliction<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement<br />
<br />
You said the healing AAs are low on your list because Tnarg's is not big enough to make much of a difference but a lot of our AAs suffer from that.<br />
Our nukes are just as bad as our heals.<br />
Critical DoTs are hideously expensive.<br />
Our tanking ability is not that impressive.<br />
Extendend Quiescence still gets overwritten.<br />
<br />
About the only AAs that do not have this problem are the ones that give you a new button to push.<br />
<br />
So I would not discount healing AAs. Focus either on what you do most or on your biggest deficiencies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd get SCR3 and then SCRM first. Extended buffs and extended Q are very, very nice. Then it's sort of a toss-up between CA/LR5 and the healing AA's. If you dont have VP or RC yet, I'd get those somewhere in there. Both come in very handy. VP is more generally handy in groups and soloing but if you raid, RC is nice to have. I'm working through the healing AAs now and am quite pleased with them so far. Tnarg's isn't that big, that's true but once it's beefed up a bit, it definitely feels more useful. As a poster above mentioned though, go with the AA's that fill in the gaps best. Look at your gear/focus effects and see where you're weakest and go from there. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been answering this question alot lately.  AA path is pretty individual, tailored to your preferences.  But what I say to shaman working on AA is this:<br />
<br />
The hallmark of our class is our utter, inexorable survivability.  We don't put out a pounding under normal circumstances, and we aren't great at keeping others alive in day-to-day situations.  What we ARE good at is surviving long past when the cleric and druid have bit the dust.<br />
<br />
Bearing that in mind, I recommend the following AA path (this is assuming SCRM/MGB/Can5)<br />
<br />
RC1<br />
LR5<br />
VP3<br />
PP5<br />
HA3<br />
HG3<br />
AHA3<br />
AHG3<br />
<br />
AFter that it's a free for all.<br />
<br />
But those first three are must-haves if you want to walk away from insanity with your life.  LR5 is huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ignoring all other AA and just focusing on your CA/CS question this is my opinion.<br />
<br />
  CA and LR mean avoid hits completely.  As such, it is prone to EQs RNG.  That means streaks of not getting touched, and others of being slapped like nobody's business.<br />
<br />
  If you love to slow early and normally wind up getting a round or 2 of aggro, this can help a bit with getting in a second slow when needed.<br />
<br />
  If you farm a lot, this means you can start tanking 10 or 20 greenies at once and still casting spells.   Pretty nice IMO, but useless to a non tradeskiller.<br />
<br />
<br />
CS and ID mean that you take less damage per hit.  But ONLY on the hits that did not hit for full.   The usefullness of this is closely tied to your AC.  I would say if you are over 1100 and in Luclin or Tier 2 or lower PoP that this is a decent option.<br />
<br />
  The way I have read that this particular AA works is that it adds a percentage to the amount of damage you DID NOT take.   So if your check against AC says you should take 100 less than the max hit of the mob, you will take 105 less with a 5% mod from this AA.<br />
<br />
  So for your particular situation of heading to VT, if your AC caps 1100 with buffs, it is a toss up.  If you farm for tradeskills or quests a lot, go with CA and LR.  Otherwise stick with CS and ID or you probably won't ever get em</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Combat agility makes you better at channeling through getting beat on. Combat stability makes the damage you take more predictable.<br />
<br />
Other then preventing those procs that can only go off on a hit I vaguely remember some parsing showing that the two skills prevented similar amounts of damage.<br />
<br />
Given the above combat agility is superior if you still want to cast after you aggro (i.e. groups) and stability when someone else will heal you (i.e. raids).<br />
<br />
The margin of that superiority is very very small however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LR5 is better than ID5 for us easily IMO.  If you get hit (even for less), you still might have to channel your spell cast, or you might get stunned (if non-ogre).  If you don't get hit ... spell goes off with no problems.  Plus, it's a hell of a lot more fun to get agro on a mob that triples for 1200 and see miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss =)<br />
<br />
That being said, SCRM is better than both of those combined IMO.  Ups Q healing by a huge amount, ups duration on haste if you're doing it for a group (ldon), and let's you cast less FA's than you would have otherwise (big bonus).  Whether you like buffing or not, you're probably casting a lot of them, and 50% more duration is huge.<br />
<br />
Popping at least 1 point in VP, spirit call, and radiant cure are also well worth it, so you can at least try out the skills.  Odds are, you'll put 1 point in VP and immediately want 2 and 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">(this is assuming SCRM/MGB/Can5)<br />
Are you suggesting that SCR3 and SCRM are a no-brainer?  As much so as Canni V?<br />
<br />
CS and ID mean that you take less damage per hit. But ONLY on the hits that did not hit for full. The usefullness of this is closely tied to your AC. I would say if you are over 1100 and in Luclin or Tier 2 or lower PoP that this is a decent option.<br />
1225 AC 3853 HP unbuffed.  This is the most informative info I've seen in a long time - is this confirmed?<br />
Given the above combat agility is superior if you still want to cast after you aggro (i.e. groups) and stability when someone else will heal you (i.e. raids).<br />
Great observation - this pretty much sums it up.<br />
<br />
Great input all - thank you for the input.</div></div><hr />

I for one do not want to channel anything after I got aggro on a raid MOB. :p As I said above, generally speaking you want to channel spells in groups and you want to reduce the spikes that kill you on raids. The difference is pretty small though.<br />
<br />
That being said, SCRM is better than both of those combined IMO.  Ups Q healing by a huge amount, ups duration on haste if you're doing it for a group (ldon), and let's you cast less FA's than you would have otherwise (big bonus).

This is where I entirely disagree. My heals still get overwritten by a cleric so I do not put much importance on extending it - sure, it is nice, but as long as it heals my canna5 I do not worry about it too much. I would much rather have any of the utility AAs like VP or SC or any of the heal or tanking AAs.<br />
<br />
Popping at least 1 point in VP, spirit call, and radiant cure are also well worth it, so you can at least try out the skills.  Odds are, you'll put 1 point in VP and immediately want 2 and 3.<br />
I second that. Each of these is immensely useful and the basic level is very cheap for what you get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As with lots of shaman things, you can see how opinions vary based on where you are in the game =)  I don't ever raid, and am still often enough the only healer in a group, so extending Q is huge.  If you raid a lot and are the only shaman, it'd probably be a big boost as well, you'd have to buff less often.  I suppose in a large guild with numerous shaman around, it would be less useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One thing to put into the equation is SCS.  If you're doing plenty of raiding, and are in the pre-blade of war phase of quipment, that might be an AA to consider early.  If you get summoned and smacked early on a lot of raids, put that high on your wishlist.<br />
I'd go SCRM, CA, LR5 and then SCS from where you are now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.</div></div><hr />
