I can confirm as of this morning that DS damage is considered damage dealt by the user.  I tested this while PLing a melee alt w/ a druid: ds them up, pull the entire zone of PC, stand there and collect the xp.  You no longer need to tag the mob for 1 pt of damage to get full xp, in fact, once the train of mobs drops &lt; 50%, drop AE's to speed up the process. I don't know the implications of this elsewhere, but for PLing it's a godsend.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>joofntool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sucks for me cause i been letting my SK tank to PL my shaman.<br />
<br />
SK only has self DS (17pt cloak of akheva + banshee aura) so SK pull and keep agro on 3 mobs while they get hurt by DS and the shammy melee/cast from behind.<br />
<br />
This no longer works cause the DS on the SK is outdamaging the Shaman.<br />
<br />
Change DS back to environmental!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Intrestingly enough , if you cast a DS on the power levelee while he is being attacked , the damage from the DS will draw aggro as if the caster was doing the damage. Poor druid learned the hard way to cast the DS before the fight , or to be sure to not sit until the fight is done if she forgot heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grelf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its working great for me :), Safes me the problems of hitting each mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wonder if the changes mean that tanks that gulp a DS potion will get extra aggro from the DS now.... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bah..the problem with my 22 Sk is his Kilva's potions don't outlast the train...but man we sure lagged up the tunnels in Paludal pretty nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wasn't this addressed in the patch?  I thought I read something about DS damage being assigned inappropriately, and that being fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>joofntool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thats what im wondering weissblau<br />
<br />
is it now back to environmental?.....my experience is NO....although the patch said it was changed back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I heard that the ds was changed to mess up power leveling.  There is a group of people on the Legends server that where running a power leveling business for rl cash.  The Legends server was changed (before the rest of the servers where changed) so that if a char has a ds cast on it, it has to do over 50% of the damage or it doesn't get the exp.  <br />
I am all for this change.  I would also like to see C3 and AEGO get nerfed.  They changed the game completely.  They should have a min lvl.  Have you played a newbie and got C3 and AEGO?  It is boring.  People should play the game for the fun of playing it, not just to race to 65.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lovely!  This means that casting DS on anyone in a group, excepting the MT will get you killed.  Imagine the chanter who mezzes a DoT'd mob and has a DS on him.....  no way to save THAT one...</div></div><hr />
