<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Estrosiath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">EDIT : I am not sure If I will be able to attend, due to circumstances that, I am afraid, escape my control. Therefore, I would like to report this raid to the 16th of July. All other conditions will be unchanged. Anyone interested for that day, please send me an e-mail.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello!<br />
I would like to go on a mini-raid in tower of frozen shadow. I have checked the item drops there, and they aren't half that bad, for a dungeon that isn't extra-high-level. So I would like to make the trip there with a group. A single group... I do believe we won't get much experience from this trip, since the highest level mob ( for now, since either 8th floor isn't implemented yet, or no one has yet found the key for it ) is on seventh floor, and is Tserinna, a 51 vampire.<br />
I suggest we meet in Iceclad ocean, near the docks.<br />
I would like to run this raid on an off-hour... But I will be flexible, if need be. Ideal would be to start at 12:00 GMT+1, on Thursday the 4th of July. Random note : I will just have finished my exams for first year of University, and I'm going to take a week and a half of vacations ( starting from the 5th, ending the 15th ), so I will be in a great mood. =) Expect to stay there at least 4 hours ( I want to Pharm, so I'm willing to do up to 8 hours ). We don't need many people to get to the top floor, but I would really like to have at least a cleric that can rezz with us, just in case. Bear in mind that this is a dungeon with keys that are NOT soulbound. Ie : If we die, we're gonna have to do all the floors naked, or make sure a cleric or a magician has time to camp.<br />
Drops that can be found there include sorcerous bowl, harnessed soul gem ( this is a Mag only loot, but it's the only one there is ), and all the Tserinna items ( all very good enchanter stuff ) . Yes, this raid will mainly benefit casters. And I certainly won't deny that I'm going there to get me some better items. If you are interested, I suggest you check allakhazam. EDIT : I forgot to say something... Most of the loot is NO DROP. So If an enchanter is interested, I would suggest he looks up the items, and sees if interested. He/She is gonna have to make the trip with us. )<br />
I would like to gather a force with two tanks ( no need to be warriors, actually paladins would be great, lots of undead there ), a cleric, myself ( lvl 55 magician ), an enchanter ( that is, if one wants to come with us, he gets dibs on this spot. If none wants to, then this spot is open ) and one open spot ( although someone with teleportation spells would be nice when we're done. But it isn't a requirement ). I will bind myself in front of the tower, so that if we have no evacer, I will coth everyone back to first floor in order to zone. Anyone level 45+ is welcome, with an emphasis on level 51+... Bear in mind I don't want to get experience here, but items. Any experience will be incidental, but welcome. =) And we're gonna have fun. This is the principal goal... Discovering new dungeons always is for me (  I love Kaesora.=)  )<br />
RE-EDIT : Okay... I will be keeping the first set of keys. If anyone wants to have another set, or a particular floor key, we will stop in order to get it. Just don't ask for everyone to have a complete set, or we're in for more than 8 hours. And if anyone is planning to get married, we will stop at the corresponding spawn in order to get either the diamond wedding band or the rune etched wedding band.<br />

Hope to get lots of answers, and good luck to everyone in their ventures,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Couple of notes on the Tower of Money, er Shadow.<br />
<br />
Your bank account will not suffer for coming here at all. Lots of coin and FS type weapons. <br />
<br />
A note on the keys.. Making possible arrangements to have a necro with a coffin might be a prudent thing to do if you get spanked. The key holder can be summoned to the zone and off you go again. <br />
<br />
While many of the mobs are undead, many are not. Just depends on what floor you are on. They are packed in pretty good, so if you can get the chanter or a FD puller, you can control it. If not, well, they call it green death for a reason.<br />
<br />
Key holders do pop pretty often, so without too much trouble, you can get a duplicate set of keys. <br />
<br />
I would not hold out too much hope you will get something out of the wedding party.. their drops seem to be very rare. The enraged relative is a load compared to the rest of the mobs on that floor and will be blue to you. Be prepared. <br />
<br />
The upper floors will present some tougher mobs that you will get xp off of them. Tserrina is just a plan nasty mob and you never know when you will get her. She is not stunnable or snare/rootable. (She will head down the hallway and out into a big chamber where there are a lot of mobs on a very fast respawn). She does drop some awesome stuff, not only for chanters but her neckpiece (5 wiz, 45 mana, 5 char 2ac) rocks for wizzy casters. <br />
<br />
All in all, I like doing the Tower.. Goodluck and good hunting.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Based on the time and day assigned.<br />
<br />
I lookforward to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkcast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was unable to add a request to go on this raid because of the time frame, but forget to post that my shammy has the first 5 keys of Tower of frozen shadows.  The tower is one of my favorite in the game because it is very active and good variety of loots drop there. If you ever want to plan another raid on the tower, don't hesitate to send me a tell. Whether you need my shaman or Paladian (who ps has no keys to the tower) I would love to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you still need a canter, count me in.<br />
<br />
  If my math is correct, and I'm bad at addition and subtraction, that would be 7:00 am EST.  please post if I'm wrong, but I can be in Iceclad then, where are you meeting?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My mother's birthday is today, however, she wants to celebrte it tomorrow.  I won't be able to go on the raid, I apologize.  Fedora is even camped out near the tower.  My mother just told me this morning before work that we were going to day hike tomorrow, so I won't be able to go.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm sorry.  I hate backing out, but I have no control over this.  I could probably make a different day, depending<br />
