<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grubnuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Decided to create an Ogre shaman after levelling a Troll to 26.  (Decided that the Unstunnable ability and the extra STA would be more useful at 60+ than Troll Regen and a clicky necklace...)  Personal decision, please don't derail the thread on the 'Which Race Is Best' debate... :P<br />
<br />
I'm trying to determine the best way I should spend my bonus allocation points when creating the new shammy.  I know that HP = Mana at high levels, due to Canni.  What would the pros and cons be to assigning the majority of the points to STA rather than WIS when creating a new Ogre, and what do you think the perfect balance would be?  (Remember, I'm designing this character with long-term play in mind, so I'm more interested in the effects on high level play rather than what's necessary to get there.  If it takes me an extra couple months to level him up in order for him to be more powerful at high levels, so be it.)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

If you're looking for 'best,' I'd say 1 point WIS to 2 points STA and maybe 5 points total to CHA (if you're concerned with merchant prices only)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grubnuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I was thinking a 66% STA, 33% WIS build before I posted the question.  I'm not too concerned about merchant prices, so I'll probably just ignore the CHA.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the fast response, FinalJustice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In the long run it doesn't matter - I had sta at 280 with a Wis at 220 for the longest time (and that as a barb with high starting wis and lower sta).  A bit of reshuffling of equipment took care of it.<br />
As an ogre you start us with very high sta to begin with.  I'd put all points you can into wis, since at low levels that gives a decent return manawise.  Sta/wis will come pretty much equally on nice pieces of equipment, so you can catch up on sta later.<br />
But to put it into relation, wearing a glittering ring of judgement over a valorium ring at level 60 makes up for all the wis you might not put in now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ogres have a base agi of 70 right?  There is a huge ac hit for agi less than 75.   So 5 points to agi will help alot.   As far as stamina goes... I play a barbarian and have a base sta of 100.  At 60 full gear and buffs I have about 275 sta....  Basically no one stat will make a huge difference. and Sta gear is much easier to get than it used to be.<br />
<br />
If I were rolling an Ogre I would likely go:<br />
<br />
5 points agi<br />
25 points wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Put 5 in to agility, then the remaining 20 in to wis.  As an ogre, you will have no trouble capping your stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yet another vote for getting AGI to at least 75 and rest into wis.  Stamina on gear has become much more common than it used to be.<br />
<br />
Wisdom festoons just about every piece of shaman-equipable gear out there as well, so its not hard to get a decent sized mana pool.  But remember, you cant turn HP to mana till 24, so mana pool till them is kinda important.  Of course, you can hit 24 in a day or so now, so /shrug.</div></div><hr />

IMO your agility will not matter in the end because early you will be buffing agility anyway so the below 75 rule won't matter much if any.. I ran my barb shaman with 169 wis (after kei!) until level 59 w/o any problems.. (that's when I could afford tae ew etc..).. STA is hard to raise, wis is easy to raise, so if it was me I would invest all in sta and 5 into wis because the wis will cap much sooner than your sta will. <br />
<br />
Also with kei around the early years will be spent full mana all the time even chaining anything you want and later on your maximum mana pool does not mean anything.. the only time it means something is when you buff like mad or when you have to chain targs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">5 points into Agility to make it a base of 75<br />
25 points into Wisdom<br />
<br />
Looking down the road 50-60 road that is, you will hopefully be wearing a Fungi which gives you -10 to your agi.  When I was wearing mine intially, I always had an agi buff up due to Fungi/Lodizal combo which was -15 to agi and brought me WAY down in AC without the buff.  Having to buff yourself sucks and I was quite happy to stop doing agi buffs once I got equipment to compensate for the negative agi but that took a LONG time.<br />
<br />
Unless your guild/friends are going to mq an entire set of SS armor right off the bat for you, I would recommend what I and the others have said about the agi minimum.  You'll be thankful later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, maybe I'm missing something here (I play a 34 shammy part time), but why would a shammy ever put starting points into agility?  We get spells to boost it... ;)   <br />
<br />
I could see bumping agility if we're talking about a starting agility of less than 65 (or whatever 75 - the first agility spell is), but I can't see it for any other situation...am I just missing something? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would say max into wis then either stam or agil. I always do stam but it's your choice. <br />
<br />
There is no wrong way. If you want the best possible shaman and work for it hard, you WILL hit the AC soft cap and have 250+ wis. I would go with wis, simply because you will be able to switch out some of your wis gear for hp/mana gear once you hit the cap.<br />
<br />
Agil/stam isn't that big of a deal. Sure they're nice, but they have a lot less effect on us than they do most classes. Not only are we NOT melee's, we get MAJOR stam and agil buffs. So I wouldn't worry about it too much. If it's killing you then just level up and buy your next buffs :P.</div></div><hr />
