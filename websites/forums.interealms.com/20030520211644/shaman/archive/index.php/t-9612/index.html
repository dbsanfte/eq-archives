<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got 55 and tried to give 2 weapons to my new pet.<br />
I read he can dual wield and double attack<br />
(http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=1202)<br />
if given 2 weapons.<br />
<br />
I gave him 2 hammer of wrath (summoned by Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal : http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1209), which are SHM/CLR/PAL (same as http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7789 but with 32 delay and 3 dam against undead I think).<br />
<br />
I didnt see any difference, pet was beating by a light blue goo in CoM even with pet hasted and goo plagued...<br />
<br />
Question :<br />
- can the pet really dual wield if given 2 weapons ?<br />
- can the summoned hammers be used by pet ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe our pets are warrior type, and therefore can only use weapons that are warrior usable.<br />
<br />
Please correct me if Im wrong.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Correct me if I'm wrong here.... Most weapons that doggy can use appear to be melee (rog/war/rng) based. I usually go with a 1hs that is war, pal, sk, bard, ranger/all, or even use the mage summoned war/none (none = pet only). Also, only give items that are either primary/secondary, and non lore items.<br />
<br />
Try any FS weapon, or even velium weapon for starters. If possible, upgrade to &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2665&quot;&gt;Gnoll Hide Lariat&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=625&quot;&gt;Dagger of Dropping&lt;/a&gt;. Those work well, and are kinda fun to watch your doggy use / proc. Another one that the 55+ pet can use is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=246&quot;&gt;Whip of Strangulation&lt;/a&gt;, just adds a little debuff to str and agi, along with a small dot. I once even tried a Sword of Skyfire when farming, but sadly the 55 pet was too young to proc the AE on it (lvl 45 pet, and need lvl 47 or so to proc).<br />
<br />
What ever you try, make sure you turn on &quot;Others Hits&quot;, and watch your pet go from biting, to 1hs, 1hb, or 1hp as per the weapon you give him. Give him dex if he has an item that can proc, and haste him. If you question his abilities, give him a FS dagger, a velium spear  and watch him work. It's very nice to see the dual wield, along with bash and kicks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">any items we can use to summon weapons for the PoP pet? or am i stuck lugging around bags of ghl's...  a lot of times i just have dogdog go without project alpha since im too lazy to go get weapons...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Duurg are you sure your pet procs using Dagger of Dropping? I think mine (the 55 pet) didn't, and the dagger doesn't seem to be warr usable :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">An easy way to tell is to use a 1hb and a 1hs weapon. You will see crushes and slashes as opposed to just bites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep do as Epyx said. However I have seen some wierd oddities at times even with rusties. Once in a blue moon I'll give doggy two rusties of different types and see him bite and slash instead of crush and slash...very wierd.<br />
<br />
But yea given two weapons that doggy can actually use you'll notice a difference. The first first bub of a mob's HP goes down a lot faster and dogster can hold aggro a lot better while you dot away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">an easy way to get him to dual wield without having to carry quite so many weapons is to give him a weapon that only goes in secondary. Wurms in GD tend to drop a 10/40 secondary only piercer pretty often. Give him 1 of these and he will bite/pierce.<br />
<br />
Anyone who is doing the shawl quests probably has a few of these as we need to kill quite a few wurms for the 5th one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have seen the pet proc when wielding the dagger of dropping, so yes he does do it but I didn't see it proccing alot because it was in his offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Okay, let's say I wans to give the pet two weapons... a velium short sword and a gnoll hide lariat (just examples.)  What order should I give them so the lariat procs most?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Tribunal symbol weapon is nodrop if I'm not mistaken...nodrop weapons poof when you give them to pets.  It has to be tradable for it to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since our Hammer of Wrath is clr/shm/pal only, Goner cannot equip it.  I tried this just the other day, you can give them to him, but they won't be equipped.<br />
<br />
The nodrop stuff to pets thing is kind of buggy.  Had only 1 velium weap on me, so I gave Goner one of those nodrop Maiden's Eye warclub things.  He equipped it, saw slashes and crushes.<br />
<br />
Edit: Speld bad.</div></div><hr />

Actually as far as i know pets ignore class on weapons. They however can't wield no drop weapons. This was nurfed long ago when people started giving flux bladed axes and such to pets in PoF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My understanding with pets (was a necro before they made necro pets dual-wield without weapons) is that they will equip any droppable weapon regardless of class listing on the item.  They follow NPC equipping rules, basically.<br />
<br />
I was pleased to see last night that even our lowest level pet dual-wields (tested with a slasher and a crusher).  I'm sure Verant doesn't care, because every other class pet can dual wield also, and the trouble of carrying weapons makes up for the benefit.  I remember that from my necro days, and necros aren't known for their strength.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Whatever weapon you give them first is the weapon they put in thier primary slot.  If you only have one proccing weapon give it to him first, primary slot will swing more if I'm not mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Truely the 55+ pet will proc the Dagger of Dropping, if you don't believe me, turn on Other's Hits, spell effects, and other's spells and watch your pet proc it. Researching Project Alpha, I didn't believe it myself, since it's not a war based weapon until I tried it, now I'll buy one for 10pp every now and then. I've even heard of some ppl getting those Dragon Horn Yekesha's which are rng/all and had them proc too. So basically anything is possible, and up to your imagination (and plat) to try it. Just hope your pet has the will to proc it (appropriate level).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No drop weapons will poof on pets everytime. I also had found that slashing weapons would sometimes not appear to have been equiped on the 55 dogdog but handing one piercing and one bashing weapon worked fine every time. <br />
<br />
&lt;3 Dogdog</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">deoesnt matter what class can use the weapon &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pet can use all  <br />
<br />
HOWEVER it must read race ALL  too!!!!<br />
<br />
Further it must be labeled Primary Secondary <br />
<br />
As far as i know  Primary only will NOT work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OK, if nodrop things always poof, why'd Goner only slash before I gave him the goranga thingy, and slash and crush after?<br />
<br />
I have yet to see Goner wield a 2hs weapon I've given him.  Only done so 3 times, (Velium 2hs) but he hasn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ah, the &quot;primary only&quot; thing would explain the 2hs prob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Smackish Smackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">try givin dogdog a dragonhorn YK and a serrated bone dirk, woo , both can be picked up cheap in bazaar usually.<br />
of course dogdog is kinda low and things resist a bit but works well  :D <br />
most time i just give em gnoll lariats tho easier to get and stun seems to land more for dogdog, than say engulfing dark proc on SBD.<br />
