<br />
After reading over the feedback from the previous threads as well as Emails and other messages boards we’ve come up with a number of improvements to PvP that we feel will greatly benefit the balance and enjoyment of PvP in EverQuest. If you get a chance, jump on test and check them out for your self. We welcome any feedback from both experienced PvP players and new PvP players alike. If you’d like to test the changes, please log into test and talk to the local Priest of Discord and he will explain how to become flagged for PvP. Once flagged you can /testbuff to 25 and combat anyone else who has a red name. You can view the stats window with CTRL + P. There will be a PvP merchant available in the Bazaar. <br />
Here’s a break down of the new additions: <br />
<br />
-Scoring System <br />
<br />
-Leader Board <br />
<br />
-Rewards for PvP points. <br />
<br />
-PvP specific Resist settings <br />
<br />
-Modified Death rules <br />
<br />
Scoring System <br />
<br />
The new scoring system will award points to any player who kills another player. The points awarded will be based on three things: <br />
<br />
1. Level of the killer <br />
<br />
2. Scoring Modifier <br />
<br />
a. Level Difference <br />
<br />
b. Infamy Difference <br />
<br />
c. Vitality score <br />
<br />
3. Time since the victim has last been killed by the same player. <br />
<br />
1. Level of the killer <br />
<br />
Each kill has a base point cost determined by the level of the killer. All subsequent modifiers apply to this base number. <br />
<br />
2. Scoring modifier <br />
<br />
The scoring modifier is based on three things. Each of these factors results in a score that is then applied in whole to the point value of the kill. <br />
<br />
a. Level Difference <br />
<br />
For each level the killer is above or below the victim, the scoring modifier increase by one point. If you kill some one who is higher level then you, you’ll gain more points then you will for a lower level character. You will also subtract points from your modifier for killing a player lower level then you. <br />
<br />
Higher level characters are more powerful, and should be worth more points. A victim must be at least level 20 to awards points. <br />
<br />
b. Infamy Difference <br />
<br />
Each time you kill another player, points are added to your infamy pool. At certain thresholds a player will gain an infamy level. When a player is killed, the infamy levels are compared and the killer gains a scoring modifier point for each infamy level his victim is above him. He can also lose scoring modifier points for killing someone who is of lower infamy. <br />
<br />
Players who regularly PvP are generally of higher skill level then those that do not. This encourages players to kill other players who are of more equivalent skill. <br />
<br />
c. Vitality <br />
<br />
When a player is killed their vitality is set to –5. For each 5 minutes they are alive, they will gain back a point of vitality. This vitality total is added directly to the scoring modifier. <br />
<br />
A player who dies very frequently is worth less points then one who stays alive longer. <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
Frizznik kills Rytan. Frizznik is level 60, while Rytan is level 62 for a level difference of 2. Frizznik has an infamy level of 5, while Rytan has an infamy level of 2, which results in infamy difference of –3. Rytan has not recently been killed, so his vitality is 0. Level Difference + Infamy Difference + Vitality = Scoring Point Modifier or 2 + (-3) + 0. <br />
<br />
Each scoring modifier point adds or subtracts 5% to the base score. Normally Frizznik would gain 100 points for killing Rytan, but because of the scoring point modifier he will gain 95 points instead. <br />
<br />
3. Time since the killer has killed the same victim <br />
<br />
Players that repeatedly kill the same player will see a steep decrease in the amount of points a player is worth. They will gain half the points for the kill they normally would for each time they kill that player in a 24 hour period. After the score has dropped below 1 point, they will begin to lose points for killing the same player. <br />
<br />
<br />
Leader Board <br />
<br />
The leader board tracks the players with the most total PvP. A number of other useful statistics will be available in the leader board. <br />
<br />
<br />
Point Rewards <br />
<br />
Players will be able to redeem their points for equipment via a Lost Dungeons of Norrath style adventure merchant interface. These rewards will span from level 20 on up to 65 and include some pieces that are of elemental quality and possibly beyond. <br />
<br />
A player’s total points is capped based on their level. They cannot gain more points once they hit that cap, although they can gain more infamy. There will be a number of consumable PvP items that will be focused on PvP combat, and will only function against other players. <br />
<br />
<br />
PvP Resist Settings <br />
<br />
Spells now have a specific PvP resist setting that only applies in PvP combat. This allows us to apply specific resist settings to certain spells that are either too effective, or not effective enough in PvP. <br />
<br />
In addition there are certain spells that only function against other players that should help balance PvP combat where appropriate. <br />
<br />
<br />
Modified Death System <br />
<br />
When players die in PvP they will respawn in Shadowrest with Resurrection effects on them. The resurrection effects will last 5 minutes + 5 minutes for each negative vitality point at the time of death. This is an effort to contain both bind camping and bind rushing. <br />
<br />
So there you have it, a break down of the initial changes to PvP. Many of the concerns about specific spells and classes have not been addressed directly yet, but the systems are in place to allow controlled tuning of PvP without effecting PvE combat. The changes will continue based on player feedback, and our own testing. We welcome any feedback you have on these changes. Jump on test and run through them if you have a chance. <br />
<br />

<br />
I forgot to mention that the insignias on Sullon Zek will be able to be turned in for points as well. <br />
<br />
The resist system adjustments are in no way final and are being actively reviewed. <br />
<br />
-Ryan <br />
<br />
Having trouble editing my previous post, or I'd put this up top. <br />
<br />
Safe zones are being removed other then the Bazaar and Shadowrest. <br />
<br />
Also, as I mentioned above. Specific class balance concerns will be addressed as well, but I don't have any specifics right now. We do have specific spell types that only effect players which will allow us to add spells specifically for PvP. Some of which are on test right now, although not available to players. <br />

Im told that pretty much all snare and all roots LAND.  Shaman spells Land.  Enc and Shaman are rocking in pvp.  It does not matter if you have 100MR or 450 MR spells are landing.<br />
<br />
Problem with Bard that yes you can root them but they can dispell and keep moving.  Still it should make it so you have a chance to hit one.<br />
<br />
Reports from VZ are the battles are fast, bloody and melee are Pi$$ed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the ideas for PvP changes, all except making PoK/PoT pvp zones, if i read that thread right.  I usually sit in PoK doing my tradeskilling since while im sitting there ressing a combine button i can also be in a central location to buff friends/noobs that ask for buffs.  If they make it a pvp zone i might as well give up on tradeskills cause i am not going to sit in Baz and click, and i hopefully wont see shadowrest very often :P  Other then that, i would love love LOVE to root a bard finally, that would be insane :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the new reisist changes are nice for shaman and chanters until you come up against a wizard, SoS now lands almost 100% of the time, mana burn is something only an idiot would use. nothing like eating nukes for 2k+ on a regular basis.<br />
the up? BoS now lands WITHOUT MALOS. of course disease root, the closest thing shaman have to an insta kill seems to land even less. I did land a root on a bard for about 1.5 seconds. of course the bard sucked but its something. melees being pissed about root is justified, but after eating over 1k from a single round of monk attacks I am not having a whole lotta sympathy. (ok more like after being one of the most gimped pvp classes for so long) resists are so usless right now it makes me wonder if dumping resist gear for hp gear doesnt make sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the fact that they are finally addressing pvp is great, I feel STRONGLY that they need a new server with preluclin and loy only (take out the drogmor vendor please)<br />
no flagged zones, no keys, no POK, no aa's, no insane gear/spells. pvp was far far more balanced without the latest expansions. and a new server with a fresh start for all would be very very nice.<br />
<br />
SZ style teams, all/all for race/class combos, you choose your team when you create a toon. <br />
<br />
my god it would be nice to have a fight some place that wasnt within 15' of a bluebie zone for a change.<br />
<br />
these changes are nice but they are radicaly altering the existing servers in ways that will piss off alot of players. removing pok/tranq/nexus from the game makes more sense to me than making them full pvp zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">bards have no way to cure Bane, and Bane lands now. Shaman &gt; bards!<br />
<br />
On a side note, I was testing resist changes on a warrior character(he has 295 MR unbuffed). I was not able to land any MR spells on him. After malo, root would still occasionally land, and bane never resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm, how about blind..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's an overhyped lie...while changes have been made yes, people are going overboard with their reports on success.  NO 100MR does not = 450MR AND NO 100PR does not = 450PR...stop lying...you are going to nerf us before the resist changes are even completed.<br />
<br />
Over the past two days I have been keeping a rough log of my experiences; <br />
<br />
My MR is approixmately 300. <br />
My DR is approixmately 200. <br />
<br />
Spells casted on me <br />
<br />
Sk / Necro Dark line of spells: Resisted 14 times; (Necro)Landed 1 time <br />
<br />
Ranger / Druid snare line of spells: Resisted 32 times; Landed NONE <br />
<br />
Pally Root spell: Resisted 18 Times; Landed NONE <br />
<br />
Other caster Root (cleric, shaman, wizzy, chanter, mage, druid, ranger, etc...): Resisted 34 Times; Landed 4 times (thing is, only 1 out of the 4 times it landed, did the root spell last more than one tick(6 seconds or less) <br />
<br />
SK Spear: Resisted 6 times; Landed 4 Times <br />
<br />
SK / Necro Life Taps: Resisted 0 Times; Landed 12 <br />
<br />
Druid, wizzy, chanter, ranger nukes: Resisted 2; Landed 14 <br />
<br />
Also, I was still resisting Root after malos or tash...altho I never had both tash and malos on me at the same time... <br />
<br />
<br />
Spells I casted <br />
<br />
Bane of Nife: Resisted 7 times; Landed 15 (funny the one with a DD component actual lands better than the one without) <br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn: Resisted 13 times; Landed 7 times <br />
<br />
Bane:  Resisted 5 times;  Landed NONE<br />
<br />
Spear of torment: Resisted 11 times ; Landed 32 times <br />
<br />
Greater Immobilize: Resisted 7 times; Landed 24 times (altho RARELY did the root last longer than 2 ticks, 12 seconds or less) <br />
<br />
Root: Resisted 6 times; Landed 12 times (altho RARELY did the root last longer than 1 ticks, 6 seconds or less)<br />
<br />
Blind:  Resisted 7 times;  Landed NONE</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was deemed too much to give ldon adventures elemental quality loot so why would it not be to powerful for PvP?  Either way I’m glad to here someone might get gear that equals the hard-core guilds.  Who knows now that hell has frozen over and pigs fly we will see the 3k HPs unbuffed difference in players in raiding guilds and family guilds close.</div></div><hr />

When players die in PvP they will respawn in Shadowrest with Resurrection effects on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
=========================================<br />
Do they respawn with gear - or do they still have to go back and loot their corpse naked?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Still have to loot corpse</div></div><hr />

<br />
using greater immobilize(clicky pants) I noticed same results posted above.<br />
<br />
I tried 5 banes on him when he was not maloed, none landed.<br />
I baned him 3 times when he was maloed, all landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This might make me actually try out pvp:)<br />
<br />
It sounds more realistic now.  I mean, pure melee can't just expect to solo everything.  Its the same in pve, and it should be the same in pvp.<br />
<br />
The thing about snare/root landing now.. melee are just going to have to buy potions/concentrate on finding cancel magic type items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>MrKnowItAll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Melle's can now know how it feels to be useless in pvp then. For the last 12 months or so since everyone has been getting uber resist gear from PoP and higher, any spell caster was useless in pvp.<br />
<br />
Even after I malos someone they would still resist 100% of spells, so it would come down to a pure melle fight. Which ofcourse a shaman aint gonna win.<br />
<br />
I say let em suffer for 12 months or so then have a look at how its going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wheeeeeeee! I am useful again! wootah! 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I might try out PvP again, as well. Too bad<br />
<br />
1) I suck at it <br />
and<br />
2) No idea what class i'd play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I simply LOVE the PVP-specific resist rates, those are long overdue.  Time to dust off (or perhaps finally purchase) Bane.<br />
<br />
Would be sorta nice to have a percentage based malo spell... but I suppose that would be overpowered in a lot of PvE situations, and perhaps cause some uproar among those who spent long time making it so they have resists that nullify the use of Malo spells.<br />
<br />
But what about tanks who don't have enough resist to be at 100 after a malos?  What if they change pvp specific resist rates on spells so that they are much harder to resist, and then less uber people get easily hit by them constantly?  This is why percentage might work better...<br />
<br />
Then again, any PvP server player worth his salt can get his resists pretty dang high by collecting statless resist gear, plenty of which is relatively easily attainable (assuming you can get the stuff without gettin pk'ed of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">bards have no way to cure Bane, and Bane lands now. Shaman &gt; bards!<br />
I do believe you are incorrect (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3681&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The reality at the sharp end of the PvP servers is that there are plenty, and I do mean plenty of melee classes that are running around with all resists at 300 or more, unbuffed, and some with significantly more than that.<br />
<br />
We have no lure type spells.<br />
All of our reasonable damage spells - i.e. DoTs are curable<br />
Our DD spells are so weak so as to be laughable<br />
<br />
But all of the above is utterly irrelevant if you cannot land a spell, period.<br />
<br />
So now I still dont have any lures, my DoTs are curable, my DD spells are laughable, but at least I have a viable chance of sticking a spell every now and then.<br />
<br />
I am happy (although you woldn't realise it from the above rant)...very happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">disease root is still just about usless :( I am 0 for 10 on the uber geared.</div></div><hr />

Spear and poison rain land as often as lure, but they are relatively weak compared to other classes' DD's. Still, you can easily damage a bard with 500 resists.</div></div><hr />

This is an outright lie!  You sir DO NOT PVP, it is obvious.<br />
<br />
<br />
going with what Asta pointed out, why is it that Malos/inia seeming more and more like a burden than an advantage?<br />
<br />
This is a simply one here...it's the fact that shaman are the slowest casting, slowest re-casting, least mana efficent caster in the game of Everquest.  Cut most all of our spell casting times by one third, and our recast time on malos down to one to one and a half seconds...then we would be in business...<br />
<br />
Also, malos shoulod be changed to a curse instead of just a regular magic based spell.  by the time we cast it, and are ready to cast again, the target has already removed the malos spell we just casted and wasted 7 seconds of pvp which can be crucile to  any caster pvp...</div></div><hr />

I don't know how it is on pvp servers but on blue servers it isn't a lie. Make a level one character on sol ro, send me a tell, and i'll prove it to your. Or ask any solro shaman on these boards who have duelled me (many have).</div></div><hr />
