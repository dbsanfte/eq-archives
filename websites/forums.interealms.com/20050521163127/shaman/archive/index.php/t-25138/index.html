<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just cancelled both my EQ accounts. Havent played EQ in months so dont think I will regret it. I am enjoying WoW much much more than I did EQ when I stopped playing. I think I enjoy it even more than I enjoyed EQ when I started playing 5 years ago.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite characters in WoW is a shaman so if The Shamans Crucible turns into a real multigame site (degrade EQ or promote WoW so that they are equal on this site) I will definately stick around.<br />
<br />
My shaman (orc) is named Morax and is on the Icecrown server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spiritblood, let me know if you are interested in potentially moderating the WoW section of the Crucible. I haven't had anyone volunteer for WoW yet!!<br />
<br />
So, I'm not going to say goodbye :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Glori, if I were you I'd put a sticky post in both the WoW section and the EQ 2 section asking for moderator volunteers. I would bet you get half a dozen or so to pick from after doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good bye and good luck spiritblood.  See you in wow (well ... not really as I don't play on that server, but you never know ;))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of my favorite characters in WoW is a shaman  <br />
<br />
Shaman in WoW kick a55.  Seriously powerful class with nukes, defensive totems a well-done storyline (esp Tauren), and nobody is kicking the Tauren out of their homes simply to market an expansion race.<br />
<br />
My 2nd favorite character during OB was said Tauren Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I understand that in the next expansion, the Tauren are being relocated to a tent city slum to make way for the new Frogman race ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for contributing so much here, Spiritblood.  I'm sure you'll have fun playing your obscenely powerful shaman in WoW! (Bitter warrior here :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I see you on Icecrown I'll wave after I kill you.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
/Salute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Take care.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
 Ummm. Dont the Tauren's already live in tent citys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i quite too, least playing eq, i still read these boards and reply from time to time. WoW will be my new home, but dam them for releasing it 2 months later or so in europe! still getting final beta for europe key soon hopefully so wont go without much:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/salute.<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy WoW or whatever you decide to do.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Later, I'm also gone, although I pretty much chose to do so in silence, I assume you're still playing European Beta?<br />
I for one won't start playing on the US servers, so I am just waiting for the Euro retail, and enjoying myself with lots of other stuff until then. You know stuff like friends, family etc. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Good luck. Shamans in WoW are indeed powerful and versatile, very different experience from EQ, but also very fun. I quite liked the way the shamans work there, and all those totems :)<br />
<br />
As I am in EU, the WoW is not released here yet, so just messing around in beta as well. Wish you all the best out there.</div></div><hr />
