<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benedrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been playing my main and only for a while.<br />
When I go to create a new character, the following happens:  Model spins around in the background; I select race/skill, fill in face, fill all abilities, get name, then . . . nothing.  No accept button appears.  Nothing more appears.  The only way to leave screen is to hit esc, which loses character.<br />
I briefly thought I saw a blank window appear then disappear in bottom right of screen, but might have been smoking some of Frodo's pipeweed.<br />
Seems like some screen or button with &quot;next&quot; on it should appear.<br />
At any rate, I can't get past this to for example, deity selection or city selection.<br />
I have asked for SOE help and got a reply after a week.  They asked some questions. Maybe they will reply again sometime.<br />
Meantime, I have main and that's it.<br />
Bet it's really newb easy.  Just some button I should be pressing.  But nothing appears on the screen.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed that with mine SARS it effects the character selection, and creation screens. It could be that the next box is off screen and so you can't see it.<br />
<br />
if you are using a customised UI log onto a char load the default one and then log out and try creating a char.</div></div><hr />
