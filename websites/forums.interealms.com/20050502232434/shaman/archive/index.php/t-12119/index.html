<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>XenoFire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K! I'm a 64 Druid, making my hydra (playing two characters with EQW) as a Shaman.. Dunno if any of you are against it, but I can ensure you I won't be the future cause of the death of a group =) Now..<br />
<br />
Race, I need some suggestions. I've been debating between a few.. Ogre, Troll, or possibly Iksar.<br />
<br />
Ogre - No stun from the front. I can come in handy every now and then I imagine.<br />
Troll - Regen.<br />
Iksar - Regen and the 1HB range item quest (Name isnt coming to my mind atm)<br />
<br />
I don't mind the exp penalty, I'll survive with whatever it is (10-20%) I am though, currently leaning towards Troll. Nicest stats next to Ogres (Of the races I chose anyway) and regen is always a nice bonus. Any other suggestions are welcome though.<br />
<br />
Also, I hope no one eats me alive for asking this but is powerleveing possible? I have played a shaman before and know to play them. Prickly would work I suppose but then I'd end up being a shaman that'd fizzle an entire manabar for a slow. <br />
<br />
Anyway thanks. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I chose Troll because<br />
a) they look neat (can't beat the belly)<br />
b) Regen is nice<br />
c) Can use JBB (Iksar can't)<br />
<br />
Downside I have noticed is xp penalty, but overall its not bad at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the regen of the trolls &amp; iksars is over-rated. At higher levels an extra 1hp every 6 seconds isnt gonna save your life. Between Ogres &amp; Iksars then.<br />
Ogres can use the JBB, but Iksars get the Cudgel Quests.<br />
<br />
If you're a die-hard quester &amp; want to get your 8th Cudgel (the uber end item) I'd go for iksar. JBB is nice but it's survivable without. Otherwise go for Ogre. The frontal stun immunity is a nice feature.<br />
<br />
Oh, and fyi, I play a Barby, we look cool &amp; cant beat the the kilt!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The regen on iksars and trolls is a lot more then 1 hp a tick at higher levels<br />
<br />
Hp regen chart (http://eq.crgaming.com/misc/pages/regen.asp)<br />
<br />
I know it's casters realm, but looking at my regen numbers it looks right.<br />
<br />
50+ is when iksar/troll regen really picks up and leaves other races behind. With stoicism now does regen matter that much though? <br />
<br />
back to the topic though<br />
<br />
If I would have done it again I would have gone with Troll. They aren't as sexy as an Iksar, but JBB would have helped quite a bit (im guessing =P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">regen is nothing to base your race around . As a barb i use Q/Torpor to regen and im not hurting a bit. Like i say in everyone of these threads , play whats most fun , the rest will fall in line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ogre for powergamer.<br />
after i got torpor i dont even bother casting regen on myself anymore<br />
front unstunnability is the win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ogre all the way imho ... I'm a strong advocate of ogres especially since I restarted my 50 barb shm and am now up to 62 with my Ogre shm (and just got canni V whoo hoo!!). I duo' box my Shm with my 63 Sk... unstunability is very nice, and extra hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I chose troll for various reasons... regen is nice, as are the JBB and non-frontal-stunnability.  One thing to note, however, is that often spell interrupts are caused by a mob hitting you and you moving ever so slightly - being an ogre won't help with this, and this is (guesstimate) 90% of spell interrupts.  With decent gear and our massive buffs you'll be hard pressed to not be at or near the stamina cap, so ogres and trolls don't really have much more hitpoints.  Trolls who worship Innoruuk can quest a necklace with a 6 second cast time, 48 second duration snare.  Any race shaman can quest the cudgels.  Non-iksars must first get to dubious by killing sarnaks, goblins, and outcast iksar; then either spend a good day or two killing explorers in LOIO and handing in their knives(this will ruin your FV faction) OR turn in 5-8 thousand bone chips to the crusader in FoB.<br />
<br />
None of the above is a big deal at all, so I would just go with whatever race you like to be.  I liked being fat, ugly, and mean-looking, with gnome blood dripping from my mouth :p   New troll models suck though, we look.. almost.. noble :(  respectable :(  Ah well<br />
<br />
As far as powerleveling, the prickly thing will work great.  A shaman should be more concerned with hitpoints and ac, rather than wisdom, anyway.. especially if 2boxing a druid.  The biggest mistake I see new shamans making is twinking with wisdom gear.  I wouldn't worry about your casting skills, a KEI and a few hours in the nexus casting low level, low mana cost spells will raise them pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I stripped my lvl 43 Barb shammy cause I had this little voice in the back of my head saying I should been an ogre.  I started an ogre and never regreted it.  Not being stunned is incredibly useful for someone like me who always solos and &quot;tanks it in teh face&quot;.  I love it.. (and I look really cool in plate :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Iks aslo get inate AC if I rember right it comes out to about +40ac. If I was to make a shm has anyother class I would go with oger. The stun that ogers are immune to is bash / kick. If a mob is hitting you and you move you still have a chance to channel throug. If it bash's you even for 1 points there is the 1/10th of a second (or what ever it is) stun, that will interupt your spell. Has for a JBB I think they lose thire effectiveness at the higher lvs. But I will let the plate shammies talk about that. Sinces I cant use one to judge for myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Myself, if I were to reroll, I would go Froglok. Why, you ask? Best character model in the game. Fluidly animated, doesn't eat RAM like the luclin models, and damn, if you haven't already, make a frog, go third-person, and emote. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ogre. Tried all but frog and ogre is what made my day. Ogre no frontal stuns is incredibly useful plus higher stamina then the other races.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind if you are soloing, you will have to tank about 80 percent of the mobs straight up til you get to the 63+ root/dot stage. So.. no frontal stuns = less interrupts(about 50 percent estimate) = less hassle/death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tristarss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ogre, and the reason why is frontal stun immunity. All the other benifits minus Forage and safe fall which arent so spiffy can be made up through items in end game.</div></div><hr />

Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>zimbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just want you all to understand something about the racial ability of ogres.  I've heard many quote it as being no stuns from the front.  I'm here to tell you that with mobs hitting me front, back and sides...if I'm not moving, I don't get stunned.  So to say no stuns from the front isn't the real deal....its just plain no stuns.  I've been playing an ogre shaman taking beats for 61 levels now and I can assure that if you don't move your feet, you aren't gonna get stunned no matter how many monsters are hitting and no matter which side of you they're standing on.<br />
<br />
Ogres &gt; all for any class they are allowed to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Um I play a troll shaman and guess what? Mobs beat on me from all sides and I don't get stunned.  Its the kicks and bashes that interupt you.  I have rarely been interupted by kicks/bashes through out my playing time, most of my interupts come from being pushed, which happens to all the shamans.<br />
Play what race you think looks the coolest and don't fall for the power gamer junk.  I see very few ogre shamans in the top guilds on my server and I am on a relatively new server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just play the race you want to have fun with..<br />
Troll / Cat / Frog / Barb /Ogre it's up to you.<br />
Fun is the 1st factor.<br />
And Iksar if you want to whine about JBB  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
(selling mine on bertoxx.. send me a tell  :D  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They all have their plus sides, even Vah Shir... Sneak is handy if you're into quests and don't want to do tons of faction work and nice for just gettin around in general.<br />
<br />
I chose Iksar because a friend who got me started in EQ was playing an Iksar.  The regen/ac are nice little bonuses but that's about it.  They're not game changing abilities.  Stun immunity is a nice bonus too, but it's not going to make you're shaman invincible any more than an extra 40ac and higher regen will.<br />
<br />
With all the gear choices out there in the bazaar, stats are a pretty minor issue.  At low-mid levels the stats don't give as much boost per point as high levels, then when you get to high levels you typically have the gear to push most important stats up near the 200-255 mark at which points you get a severely diminishing return anyway.<br />
<br />
In the end, race makes such a small difference it's hardly worth worrying about other than which race you think is the &quot;coolest&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Which ever race you play just be so kind not to dress you shaman like a Druid.<br />
<br />
I have yet to find a Druid that could properly equip a shaman.  They all end up with huge wis and mana pools and hardly any ac / hp.  I am sure you have a lot of hand-me-downs from you druid that you might think are apropriate for a shaman but you will be wrong.<br />
<br />
Try this....  put a lot of your starting points into wisdom and the when you pick your equipment make sure you don't go OVER 160 wis till you hit level 50.  Pick a max number and stay under it to forse yourself to pick gear that is better for a shaman then a druid.<br />
<br />
My Ogre shaman did not break 150 wis untill level 58.<br />
<br />
This is a great class, you will just need to learn to think like a shaman instead of a druid.<br />
<br />
With slow,  shaman is simply the best solo tanking class in the game.<br />
<br />
Druids kite and it is your trained reaction to run.  Shaman slow,  tank,  and root park.  We put are body between the mob and the chanter and tank adds untill we can get them placed in some quite little corner.  It is very hard for a druid to overcome the understandable flee reaction, but after you do,  playing a shaman will be a rush.<br />

It kind of cracks me up that non regen classes are always quick to point out how usless regen is at the upper levels. Fungi is so uber, but having more inate regen that one is worthless. Hp is so important, but having inate regen on top of replenishment is not worth anything.<br />
<br />
I liked regen at the lower levels, and I still like it at the upper levels, and it helps me while grouped, solo, raiding, and anything else I'm doing. Regen is worth the exp penalty to me, your milage may vary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The JBB is effectively a mana-free DoT that runs at about 1500 damage per minute.  Combine this with pet damage and blues melt in front of you.  If you're fighting in an outdoor static spawn zone the ability to do mana-less damage combined with a mount basically leaves you at 90% mana perpetually, occasionally dipping down to 70% when you get a bad pull and have to slow and root multiples.<br />
<br />
Since getting the JBB and my mount I've been getting a blue bubb and a half per hour at 54.  This is better than twice the rate I was getting before the two additions.</div></div><hr />

I got 3 times as much exp in that amount of time in 54- as an iksar, without a JBB crutch OR a horse.<br />

<br />
<br />
Nobody claims regen is ever worthless, but you do pay a pretty hefty exp penalty for it. Pre 50 the difference is 1 standing, 3 sitting. ... kinda nice but hardly life-changing. Especially if you have even an ikky BP for a bit of regen. <br />
<br />
Post 50, it just isn't all that much compared to the 30 pts from a fungi and chloro. Post 60, an extra 8 (?) points of standing regen is still nice (I'd love to have it) but hardly all that important when torpor does 300 per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yea i gotta back the JBB argument here.i did in a few weeks what other shaman in my guild took months to do with my jbb. at 45 that thing is freaking godly and even at 65 i still use it. Granted i dont use it like i did before, but i used it ALOT till 58-59ish when i moved to the planes.  Mana-free damage is not something easy to deny. hell when im in my cash grinding spots that thing is solidly clamped on my arm and being cast atleast 4 times or more each pull(high HP mobs). JBB &gt; all if you wanna level fast if you ask me so personaly i think its a huge consideration. But dont get me wrong , its not needed , especialy in the days of KEI being so easily obtainable so dont put out a iksar just cause they cant wear one. I still think iksar is one of the coolest races in the game , penalties or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Regen is overrated. Far overrated. hitpoint regeneration is a problem for so many classes. but not for the shaman. to a level 65, the 25 points of hitpoint regeneration per tick from replenishment isn't exactly a lot. 8 more isn't even going to be noticed. The fungi is a good tunic, but having worn it for a while and returned it to its original owner - ESPECIALLY as a shaman who can bust out regeneration on my own whenever I want from my spellboot - I just dont see why anyone would pay 17 grand for it. <br />
<br />
I admit I dont have much experience with frontal stun immunity, it might be useful, but I would not consider it a character defining trait.<br />
<br />
Ogre would probably be the best choice imo.</div></div><hr />

i also have a 55 katt shaman, and luv the sneak abiolity, however the ogre fights much better than she does-  its supriding how 200 to 300 hps makes a difference!<br />

Now that I don't (intentionally) tank for xp it isn't that much of a big deal.<br />
<br />
Do not underestimate the utility of sneak if you are into doing quests.<br />
<br />
JBB remains one of the most sickly overpowered items in the game at lvl 45-59.<br />
<br />
Regen is not that useful after you have torpor, but you won't have torpor from 1-59 (at least) and that is a long time.  Before that, regen is godly.  Fungi tunic is FT 7.5, btw.  Except the JBB, it is the most useful item for a pre-torpor shaman, period.<br />
<br />
Do not underestimate the snare necklace, which is quite useful [if you would ever solo the shaman without your druid] even in PoP [in fact it becomes relatively more useful because the VP spear becomes riskier to use in PoP solo situations].  So, if you go troll, go Innoruuk, unless you have strong feelings about RPing a Cazic follower or a strong desire to faction Cabalis.<br />
<br />
NONE of these advantages are so huge that they should change your decision if you just plain like one race a lot more than another.  You will be looking at that avatar a looong time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I honestly feel every single class in the games have their good points.<br />
<br />
Iksars- Regen never hurts. Kinda sucks they can't wear some plate armor, but almost every end game item will be wearable by them.<br />
<br />
Ogres- I have always wondered what it would be like if I had made an ogre. They have the great no stun from the front ability (doesn't mean spells aren't gonna get interrupted) and lots of sta. Only thing I have noticed, is that even with my Barb my sta is maxed at 65 (without planar power aa). <br />
<br />
Barb- I think barbs look great. Lots and lots of them, but they have decent sta and wis to start.<br />
<br />
Troll- I think just the roleplaying ability of a troll would be fun. Their regen and high sta makes for decent advantages.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir- This is the one class I have never really had a desire to play. Sneak would be fun at times, but I don't see it as life saving alot.<br />
<br />
Froglok- I have wanted to stay away from them because of the millions and millions we saw on the first day that had the names like Froggy, Froaker, Froggie, Frogggie, Froggiee (you get my point) and the countless number of /shout FROOAAK!!!! I just got easily turned off from them =P.<br />
<br />
JBB is really overrated IMO. I can see how it would be nice at lvl 45, and there are a few times that manafree dmg would be nice, but I don't see a reason for stopping gameplay to farm cash to get one. I have got to lvl 65 without one, and I don't feel I missed out not having one. Hell I wore ac6 boots and a Sarnak Emlazened Tabard till lvl 54, and I think I got along just fine =). <br />
<br />
Basically what I am getting at, is you should always chose the class that you like most. If you chose a Iksar because someone said they are the best, but you like Ogres, you are gonna regret it later on. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Go with whatever you like more. Regen is nice, no doubt, but also the ability to not get stunned from front aint bad at all. Then again, I play barb shaman (for 4+ years now) and have no issue either.<br />
<br />
Oh, and selecting the race based whether it can use JBB or not is stupid. Personally, never had it, never used it, never missed it. Was OK without it, still am and will be.</div></div><hr />
