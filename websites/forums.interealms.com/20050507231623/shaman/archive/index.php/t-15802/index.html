<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what weapons are you using for them?  <br />
<br />
Their selection kinda sucks heh. He is 25 right now and im having troublelocating some decent weaponry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zekhas katar is what I use. Off of vampires in Teneb.Mtns.<br />
<br />
Once you get the level, I hear a flint hilted steel dagger and whatever other procing weapon there is is a great dps combo if you pump your dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fist of rock, the 7/18 one, is usually cheap as hell.<br />
<br />
jade maces don't cost too much.<br />
<br />
*shrug* my twink of the month is a monk, I just use a tranq staff, I didn't look at the 1h weapons too hard.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Both my beasties have Bear Fanged Gloves for their primary. One has Master's Eitchatka for off-hand, the other uses Sack Full of Rocks.<br />
<br />
Also in the list is Patchwork Flotsam for 2hb, Slargilug spear for peircing, and of course a fighting baton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shakoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For 2hb, get the best DN brawl stick you can afford. They are dirt cheap. Adamantite Bo Stick is also great for training due to it's low delay, but once you can proc it, it becomes a pain (have to remember to back up, etc). <br />
For 1hb, I went for 2 Staves of Shielding. They're slow, but damn do they hit hard. Dirt cheap too. <br />
For h2h, bought a Zekhash but couldnt afford anything else so I usually put the Zekhas in prim and a SoS in secondary when I want to train h2h.<br />
Piercing I dont even bother with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My beast used Zekhas Katar and Fist of Iron.<br />
<br />
If you're rich, get a gold inlaid ulak and kasheks katar.  Both very nice weapons with no rec level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't have a beastlord yet  but considering it. One weapon I would have thought was good is Copper hammer of striking, entwood mace or Baton of Royal Stature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't count...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Used a black bladed ulak(9/18) and jade mace combo till 47 when I gathered 5 folks and did the epic one afternoon. The epic is crazy nice.. 125hps and 15sta +  40% haste 30atk.. all in just the offhand one(mainhand procs 50% slow/dot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used a number of weapons, I like to collect them it seems.  Currently using Waning Light Katar in primary and Secondary Epic in offhand (40% haste)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">is there a level limit on the epic ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">is there a level limit on the epic ?<br />
<br />
I think it's recommended level of 46, but I'm fairly certain you could do it earlier, at level 1 even if you have enough friends to help you. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can't remember exactly what hes using.  For 1hb I have Entwood mace and stave of shielding.  I have cresent blades of luclin and something else for peircing.  For hth I have the Zekhas Katar and something else)<br />
<br />
Wainting in bank I have arch lich claw and another one with a 55 required level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Kasheks Katar (procs at 50, but still nice) and Copper Hammer of Striking (procs from level 1). The copper hammer is 179dd... pretty badass for 10k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Waning Light Katar and Wicked Shank  (He's 56, those are both 55 required weapons though.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think it depends on how seriously you intend to play your beastlord.  If you just play him for fun, I would suggest some of the low-cost weapons mentioned above.  If you intend to play him to 65, consider Waning Light Katar (in primary) and Gold Inlaid Ulak (in secondary).  <br />
<br />
The beastlord epic is also very easy to do, if you have some patience (there are 5 fights that you basically need to wait, wait, wait for in order to do a turn in, followed by a quick fight).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i intend on playing him casualy with a friends mage, but i have the bankroll to make him as uber as i want, so i figure why not go high end or atleast dumb some good cash into them so we have a good shot at not dying ;)<br />
<br />
I think im going with fist of iron and katar. I think they both have no level restriction and very nice ratios<br />
<br />
thnx all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Mine had Zekhas Katar (12/23), Jade Mace, Seb Croaking Dirk and I purchased that Floatsam 2hblunt from Ykesha... cant remember it was pretty good and cheap... Tae Ew 2hblunts are also cheap.<br />
<br />
Oh and if you fall in love with the BST save up for one of these they were 12 or 14 k on Fennin for 30% haste.<br />

Here is my beasties Magelo:<br />

<br />
I find the hammer to be nasty.  I've maxed out hitting at around 36 with self buffs only.  My h2h weapons are in the last backpack.  Bear fanged gloves and masters eichatka.  They look great on an iksar due to them being claws.  I'm using the piercer to keep my skill up.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh and go Ogre... frontal stun helps BSTs even more than it helps shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>agrad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If I had my way again, I think I would have gone Ogre too for the frontal stun immunity.  With the sort of bankroll you are talking about, there are plenty of options available. 1hb/piercing/h2h/2hb should all be maintained, however it will not be till the mid 50's that you will see the strength of using h2h weapons over the others, because of the higher skill cap on h2h.  All of the weapons mentioned so far are good options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Don't forget piercing weapons.  Crystalline Spider Fang 10/22 good fro training and Narathius 13/22 is good once you get close to recommend level.</div></div><hr />
