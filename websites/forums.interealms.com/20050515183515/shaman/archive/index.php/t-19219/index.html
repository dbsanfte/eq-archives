<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I swear I have been playing for years (on a druid until about 3 months ago, so that's my excuse for being retarded) and I have seen the word lure tossed around alot in regards to spells, but in all my board surfing I have never read exactly what that means.  After flamming the ever loving !@#$ out of me (which I aptly deserve) could someone please tell me what it means when a spell is lure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some will say Lure = nearly unresistable while others will say 100% unresistable.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, lure type spells land much more frequently than non lure type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it has an enormous negate resist check.<br />
It means that it is really hard to resist it.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Lure of Ro (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3331&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenavyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lure spells have a very high resist adjustment, so they are far less likely to be resisted.  Primarily wizards get lure spells; for example, their 52 Lure of Frost, which has a -300 resist adjustment according to Lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cool.  I had assumed it was something like that, but I didn't know what the numbers were exactly.  So I take it that lure is still a somewhat vague term and can range from like -200 resist to unresistable?<br />
<br />
Again, sorry to waste board space with such a simple question, but I have been jumping over that word far too often to just sit contentedly ignorant.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenavyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think lures are unresistable.  On Lucy, for example, Tash* is listed as Resist Adjust: Unresistable.  All of the wizard lure spells are -300 resist adjustment, which is significant, but hardly unresistable.  I guess it's just a contextual thing, but the word comes from the wizard line of spells with the -300 resist mod, so that's what I would be inclined to say is intended by it.  Unresistable is unresistable.. Lure is a step down to nearly unresistable. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your safest best when thinking about lures is to consider them nearly unresistable.  They CAN be resisted, but the odds are so against that happening that its really, really, really unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A lot of the confusion comes from the history of the lure spells.<br />
<br />
At one point, the resist system was less comprehensive, and resists, particularly in velious for npcs were just insane.<br />
<br />
So, they gave some special, unresistable nukes to wizards called lures to keep from marginalizing their contribution.<br />
<br />
When they re-worked the resist system to reward heavier buffing and debuffing of resists, they made the lures very hard to resist, but no longer irresistable.<br />
<br />
This evolution is probably the source of confusion.</div></div><hr />
