<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to ask if a few people could assist me in obtaining an easy part of my epic.  Fallanthas/Falamil knows in detail what I need to do as well.  I need to make my way down to the Gnome Merchants in Sol A to deliver an invoice.  Then head out to Unrest go into the tunnel and hand a doll to a dead little girl.  Head back to South Karana with a note from the dead girl, hand it to the mellowdramatic bard.  Then a quick trip up to West Karana to an NPC named Maligar.  Once I give him the note he attacks as an enraged doppleganger.  I just need his head to turn in to the mellowdramatic bard in South Karana.  After that I have to go to West Karana to receive the bottom half of the first page of my epic.  The last part I can do on my own.  The only real assistance I need is help in killing the doppleganger and someone willing to port me from Lavastorm to BB then to the Karanas.  I know this is a bit to ask but it is going to take quite a while for me to get the other pieces as they are really hard to get.  And I figure I can do them with Fallanthas when he decides to do any parts that he hasn't already.  The biggies are Phagel in KK, and Trakanon.  Nagafen and Vox maybe a problem as well but I have plenty of time to get in on these trips.  I think maybe 2-3 people is all that are needed to kill the doppleganger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont know if it can be multied but I have something from all my trips to have tea with Mr. Autropos. If you know what I am talking about, send me a /tell in game and perhaps we can strike a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think I may have the bard piece from Phinny, I sure won't be needing it for a very long time if ever so you are welcome to it.  Let me know exactly what it is and I'll check to make sure I still have it in the bank.<br />
<br />
BTW Adel, you don't happen to have a Kedge Robe sitting in that bank rotting do ya?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, no Kedge robe but I have the backbone I have been sitting on forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The backbone is the piece I do need.  If nobody else wants it I would be glad to have it.  Would save a trip to KK.  That would knock out a really hard part to get for me, Thanks a ton :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Willow,<br />
