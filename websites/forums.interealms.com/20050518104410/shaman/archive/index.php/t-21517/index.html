<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats.  Time is fun.<br />
Word of advice:  Don't bother bidding very heavily (assuming you use an auction point system) on the Phase 1 loot, or even the phase 2 loot.  My guild has been in Time for about 2 months now, and we have phase 1 loot going to alts, and phase 2 loot will be going to alts very soon as well.  Don't get all excited and waste a bunch of points on this gear when phase 4+ gear is just around the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats!  Even though PoP is over a year old its still a huge accomplishment to get to Time.  Enjoy your success</div></div><hr />

Like a previous poster poster said, don't bother bidding on phase 1 loots..  assuming you raid time 2-3 raids a week all that stuff will be rotting and going to alts within 8 weeks.  <br />
<br />
I'd also say don't bother with bidding on the EP chain legs..  chain arms or boots from time, at least for my guild it only took about 2 months before those started to rot as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WOOT go go you! that is VERY cool!  i have  a question now because none of my guild (as far as i can tell) has found out yet....can you draft into PoEb?  only asking cause you just got into time so its prolly fresh in your mind. :)  <br />
<br />
GRATZ AGAIN! that is awesome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You HAVE to have flag/key from arbitor to get into PoEB. It goes on your keychain. You CAN be raided into PoEA itself and click into PoEB if you have the key and you are not flagged for elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">thank you litch. :) that is all i wanted to know....now i know that PoE will be my new raid home till we kill maoe again &gt;&lt; /mutters something about stupid soil ring...... :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We have a new guild member called rot, he is actually on our points page, man he is a greedy bastage! seriously tho, stuff rots very quickly in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hehe Wakonda, we have Rot on our roster too :p<br />
<br />
Wish that bastard would teach me how he manages to equip more than one lore item!<br />

By boots and arms I think smaaltz meant Temporal Chain Main Sleeves (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68197)  and Winged Storm Boots (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=26988)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We beat TRC about 2 weeks ago, fairly easily when compared to what we  put up with since then.<br />
<br />
We needed to win again to complete the flags for other members but every stinkin' time we went, the zone would crash, we'd have mass LDs, or we'd lose on the last or second to last council member.  It was horrible.<br />
<br />
Finally, last night, we were able to suffer through the LDs (fortunately no zone crashes or TPWs, although we had a few close calls).<br />
<br />
I think we have over 90 flagged for Time now, so we're happy.  And I think I speak for a lot of my guildmates when I say that I will hopefully never have to do that event again.</div></div><hr />
