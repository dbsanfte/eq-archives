<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what the range is on this spell to avoid forerunning cleric/purecaster self buffs.  I'm guessing you have to move melee away from cleric and caster types but wondered how far.<br />
<br />
Yer pal,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Salani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a pretty big range.  About 2/3 turgur range.. so pretty large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">100 feet. If they are in range for Torpor, Khura's will hit them as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I normally stay put and give a warning and those who don't want it have to get out of range, bit tricky in confined spaces. Or you can force groups on raids not to form with clerics/casters as leader so that they can drop - traditionally clerics lead so that can be a tricky habit to break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">however if you use MGB its down to 50ft no???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AE range on Khura's is 100 feet as well.<br />
<br />
Means people in a radius of 100 feet around you should get hit from what i understand. That's what the spdat reader says anyways. So basically 2 different people could be 200 feet away from each other and you would hit them ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Thinking about it, this seems huge...maybe its just 50 feet away from wherever you stand :confused:<br />
<br />
I don't care for the clerics usually.</div></div><hr />
