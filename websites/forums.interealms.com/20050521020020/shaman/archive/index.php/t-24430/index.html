<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, that's one way to be sure of quitting.  I've let friends use Loramin (errr, I mean, no, that would violate the EULA, I would never do that ;) ) to buff on Epic raids or such where they didn't have a guild shaman (and I couldn't play him myself) before, or just to get LDoNs or expeditions with.  But if some random person ever used him, then even if I could get him back I wouldn't, as I'd just be too damned embarrassed to return.  So bravo (or condolences, depending on your frame of reference I suppose) to you for making sure you quit for good.</div></div><hr />
