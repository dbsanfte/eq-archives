<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I keep getting mixed info about this raid concept.   Last night, we had 35 people in HoHB.  Those 35 people were already in a raid with non hohb flagged people.  When we tried to zone in a few unflagged, those people got the &quot;spread too thin message&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm confused here.  I thought that once you had 35 people with flags in the zone, then 15% more (of 35) Non flagged could get in? Right?<br />
<br />
If the #35 flagged=85% rule activated=add 15% unflagged is correct, then what do you guys think happened that we had 35 in zone, and no one else could log in?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">im not in charge of raids or drafting, but i have noticed that when we do drafts in my guild that the flagged people form the raid, zone in, then invite non flagged into raid (after all flagged are in zone) and attempt to zone them in.  <br />
<br />
Im not sure if there is an order to which drafting is activated, like getting flagged in zone first then /raidinvite non flagged and then zone them in, or if there is something else to it, i just know what i see :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One of the issues was, the 35 flagged people, were comprised of a few folks we didn't know.  So I can't say with 100% accuracy whether those 35 were all flagged.  But.. they'd have to be to zone in right?<br />
<br />
Its not a sliding scale correct? 34 flagged and 1 non flagged would never happen correct?  Because one person told me that it can bug out when a person goes LD.  Like, one of the 35 goes LD, just as a non flagged enters the zone.  Bam, now we have 34 flagged and 1 unflagged in zone, and it messes up the whole 85% rule.  No clue if that is true though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">here is how i understand it to be.<br />
<br />
you need 85% flagged ( i think the base number for flagged is 28 actually, not sure will check somewhere, 28 ppl would allow 4 drafts).  <br />
<br />
Get flagged in the zone and in the raid.<br />
<br />
Get unflagged outside waiting in the raid and zone them in base upon how ever many flagged you have.<br />
<br />
If the number drops below 85% flagged to the non-flagged then the non flagged will get a '3 min warning' before being kicked outta the zone.<br />
<br />
again, im not in charge of drafting so i only know what i see and am told.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There has been issues with this ever since the concept was introduced.  It's not intuitive, but here's my best understanding of how it works.<br />
<br />
Raid forms.  You must have a minimum of 32 flagged people in the target zone, to even attempt it.  To the extent you have more than 32, you will be allowed more &quot;85 flags&quot; per the 85/15 ratio.  However, the instant you put one non-flagged person in raid, the raid 85 ration is now set.  Increasing flagged people in the raid will NOT increase your ratio.  So, if you have 32 flagged in raid, and someone zones out to get the non-flagged, and invites 1, then you've set your cap (32*.15 = 4.8 = 4, I believe it rounds down.)  Even if 30 more flagged join your raid at this point, you will only be allowed 4 85 flags, unless you reform the raid to reset the 85 cap.<br />
<br />
The reason most people have the 85er's wait outside is because you have to be in the target zone.  That's why sometimes after a near wipe, etc., some 85er's get the 3 min warning clock, because all the flagged are outside the zone, waiting to get ressed.<br />
<br />
I think the cap is static to avoid abuses in 85ing.  That's my understanding of how it works, ymmv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Serepi is correct.  You need a minimum of 32 flagged people to get unflagged into a zone.  It will not work with keyed zones, only flag zones--thus you cannot use the 85% rule to get people down to lower CoD for bertoxx, or to get anyone into PoEb for Rathe.<br />
<br />
The base rate is raid x .15 for unflagged, once you hit the 32 flagged minimum.  I think numbers are actually rounded up for a maximum of 10 people unflagged in a full raid of 72, but I may be mistaken there.<br />
<br />
Getting everyone in is a real nightmare.  Have everyone zone in and make a raid in the appropriate zone.  Then, once you have all flagged people in a raid, zone out and invite NO MORE than the right number of unflagged.  If you get someone who tries to click in due to death (before rez box pops), or can click in because of a LD, etc., it becomes a real nightmare to track.<br />
<br />
God help you if you are using the 85% rule and corpse summoning to do a Xegony run.  Just don't even invite unflagged until you have summoned everyone else up and completely disbanded the raid and reformed it up top.  Then send a rogue with a key, or an evac class back down who doesn't mind eating 1 more death for a summon.<br />
<br />
When you change zones, don't be afraid to reform a raid.  It may speed things up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is also a bug in regards of groups formed outside the raid zone.  Best procedure is to zone in, form raid, send raid leader out and invite single people.  These people immediately zone in and do not, under no circumstances, invite other people. Inside they drop the raid and join their groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm pretty sure that the whole thing is just slow and buggy.<br />
<br />
As an officer I frequently handle this and it's universally a pain in the rear. I can also say with out a doubt that Serepi is wrong about the number of unflagged being &quot;set&quot; as soon as the unflagged person is in the raid. On numerous occations we've had unflagged in the raid before we even get 32 or had addition unflagged get in as more flagged show up.<br />
<br />
There seems to be 2 main issues that cause problems.<br />
<br />
1. Raids will flat out become bugged. Seems to be related to people leaving raid, possible only ld, while other people in the raid are zoning. The wrong combination just seems to bug out the raid.<br />
<br />
2. While the number allowed in is dynamic it seems to be a bit on the slow side in catching up. So adding 20 more flagged people isn't going to instantly allow 3 more unflagged in. It will often take up to a couple minutes before it lets them in.<br />
<br />
How you do things kinda depends on where your going. For HoHb we typically get everyone flagged to run in and form up raid and then send someone back to HoHa to start inviting people to thier group and sending them in and then moving them to thier group once they are in HoHb. Almost like doing a coh chain. This also helps to ensure that everyone is actually flaged for hohb.<br />
<br />
For things like Plane of earth, water, air. We typically just form up groups outside and zone in together.<br />
<br />
There are some reports of people leaving, dying gating what ever, and then zoning back in normally eatting up additional spots. I'm personally not sure if thats actually the case or just more related to the previous 2 problems. Raids getting bugged or just taking time to catch up can definitely seem like that.<br />
<br />
Another interesting fact. While your raid is in Plane of tranquility unflaged will be able to zone into zones they aren't flagged for. Not sure the exact dynamics but we've had numerous occations where an unflagged will acidentally zone into PoWater and be the only person in zone even tho they aren't flagged. It seems like they can zone into any zone that you would be able to support them in when the whole raid is in PoK.</div></div><hr />
