<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xabaras Soulsreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was told that the SCR aa will make last longer also Quiescence...is it true?<br />
<br />
And...will quick buff aa adds to a focus effect haste of greater one will &quot;overwrite&quot; smaller one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SCR3 will make it last 1 additional tic and SCRM an additional tic from what I know.. <br />
<br />
QB will add to your focus effect for a maximum of 50% haste..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SCRM increases Quin to a total of 7 ticks (+/- one tick pad for some creative timing) <br />
<br />
Quickbuff stacks with focus items to a max of 50% haste increase. So most people only spend points up to QB2 unless you have alot of AAs, or no access to a casting haste focus item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're already monitoring the server ticks for cannidancing, when would be the best time to cast Q?  So it lands just before a tick, I assume?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">on this you will need some one who cares alot more than I do about squeezing out every ounce from a cast....<br />
<br />
I believe (this may be totally off) that the duration of spell and &quot;tick time&quot; are 2 seperate items, so going off this assumption you would want to hit right before a &quot;server tick&quot;. I think the way it works is that the spell has a full duration of XX seconds, and how ever many ticks you squeeze into that is what you get. So SCR and SCRM dont technically increase the &quot;tick&quot; of a spell, but the duration of activity and some times you can squeeze out an extra tick if your borderline on overlapping another &quot;tick&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't it 6 ticks most of the time, with an extra tick if you time it right?<br />
<br />
4 ticks base +50% = 6 ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya I have an enterniostrum (sp) item so I get 7 +/- 1 for creative timing.... I always forget about the duration extension item. (supposedly there is no cap on duration extension)<br />
<br />
Which by the way, duration extension focus, will only work with Quin if if will effect a min duration of 24 sec. I think only PoTime stuff and that one VT item will do that.... could be wrong here to though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its worth noting that SCR1 and SCR2 will also get you that extra tick if its timed right. If you cast  randomly then SCR1 will get you the odd extra tick, SCR2 will get it quite a bit, and then SCR3 is guaranteed.<br />
<br />
SCRM and QB2 are both very, very nice AA skills to have. Well worth getting but its a hard call to say which is better, unless you don't have torpor/quiessence in which case QB2 is probably best.</div></div><hr />
