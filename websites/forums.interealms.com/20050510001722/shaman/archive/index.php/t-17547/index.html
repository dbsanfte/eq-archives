<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried the search, I really did &lt;-- ducks. Now on to my question right now I am lvl 57 and talked a friend who also is a shaman but while I have been concentrating on lvl he has been doing aa exp :(, alrdy has like 25 saved and is only 2 lvls below me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was thinking I would really like at the least get to 58 for cani 4 and THEN do aa's OR at the next wait till lvl 60 for alpha dog dog and some really nice buffs.  <br />
<br />
I am sorry if this seems an old topic But i could really use some advice on this one. There is sooo many ideas on this topic, one side might be that at this low of a lvl u could really ripp thru the aa's ALOT faster then at say lvl 65. Then there is the other side which is saying that lvl  is better than all you get better resists and better spells &lt;--- so I am VERY confused on which path to take.Any ideas would be appreciated<br />
:).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get 65 and you wont have to make the choice.<br />
<br />
At 65, the AAs come faster because of where you exp, and it is relatively easier to get groups.<br />
<br />
Dont stop at 60.  Dont stop at 61.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200, go straight to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree.<br />
<br />
I went straight to 65, and now I can get an AA in 90 minutes with a good group in BoT.  In 2 days I earned 6 AA points by marathon grinding one day and only grinding a couple of hours the next.<br />
<br />
And at 65, you can get 2-3 bubbles of AA out of an LDoN adventure on top of earning points.<br />
<br />
Getting to 65 is the way to go, IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have stopped at 62 to get Canni V, but thats it.<br />
<br />
Originally, many people would stop leveling at 60 because there were very few places for lvl 65 chars to get exp.  Since then the planes have been opened up, many zones have been revamped, and the level range on xp-giving mobs has been increased.  <br />
<br />
Now there's no reason to stop leveling unless you're bored, burnt out or waiting for other friends.<br />
<br />
Your friend who is lvl 55 with 25 AAs?  he could have been lvl 65 a LONG time ago.  You decide which one is more powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm lvl 58 now and since 53 I stopped every lvl and picked up 1 or 2 AA's. This is mainly because I solo and it's nice to see that exp. bar for AA go up nice and fast after grinding forever. If you don't sit there day after day watching your exp. bar slowly creep up I'd get to 60 before doing AA. But if you need some satisfaction, do some AA now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went to 65 and was really, really happy I did.  <br />
<br />
Any future characters of mine will only get Run3 before 65, if anything.  YMMV, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I feel one of the deciding factors of whether or not to level directly to 65 is whom you group with and where you play.  If you’d out level the people you like to group with then go ahead and earn some AAs while you wait for them.  If you don’t adventure in the planes where you have access to high XP mobs there’s no real hurry to level.  If there’s a specific AA ability you really want then earning it before you cap your level can be a very satisfying experience.  <br />
<br />
I’m a member of a small guild.  We don’t raid. We’ve occasionally gone to the planes, but nothing higher than Plane of Nightmare or Plane of Innovation.  And since I loath pickup groups its unlikely that I’ll be fighting any high-end mobs anytime soon.  So I never saw any reason to focus on leveling alone.  I switched to 100% AA experience at 51 to get run three.  Then I switched back to regular experience until I hit level 61 so I could get my new pet spell.  Then I returned to AA experience to get Cannibalize 5, which I just bought a few days ago.  Now I’ve returned to regular experience to reach level 62 to match the players I’m grouping with.  Once I do that I’ll have to decide whether to keep leveling or go back to AA experience and pick up a few more abilities that I like.<br />
<br />
I’ve read many many posts that have advocated leveling strait to 65, many of which talk about how quick and easy it is to reach that level.  And for many people that has worked out best for them.  That just doesn’t happen to be true for me.  It always takes me a long time to gain a level.  I like to work on trade skills, pursue quests and help out a number of young players I know.  And since I don’t fight in the higher end plane zones I gain experience rather slowly when I do focus on leveling.  For example, I switched to 100% regular experience about five days ago.  I’m about twenty percent into my level.  It’ll most likely be another three weeks or so before I manage to ding 62.  And once I do hit level 65 the only real difference is that there will be fewer mobs for me to fight in order to earn AA experience, since I still wont’ be fighting in the planes.  <br />
<br />
The one thing that has made any real difference to my game play is LDoN.  If I level to 65 I’ll most likely gain pore points per adventure.  And since I’ve been drooling over the armor that costs 1492 points per piece, the more points I get per adventure the sooner I’ll get that armor.  That may tip the scales for me and encourage me to spend a few months getting my last four levels. <br />
<br />
The best advice I can offer is to look at the way you play the game and decide how much of a difference being level 65 will make for you.  If you have the opportunity to hunt in the higher end planes then leveling to 65 could be a great move for you.  But if you’d rather have access to Cannibalize 5 while you gain those levels then you may want to pause long enough along the way to buy that ability.  The bottom line is we all play this game to have fun.  Listen to other people’s advice but in the end do what will be the most fun for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Medicine Cabinet -&gt; AA Thread -&gt; My post (I have several on that thread, find the one that applies)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">65 above all else. Levels give you less aggro, less resists and higher damage taking capability.<br />
<br />
Besides that its nice to be done with the boring stuff first and then reward yourself with the better funnier stuff.<br />
<br />
The only thing id take before lvl 65 is run3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got to 65 first, with only regen3.  The is very handy when you get canni4 and replenishment.  If you're hunting in the planes (PoP), most of them are outdoor (except for CoD), so just keep Bih'Li up for the SoW and ATK bonus and you're fine.  <br />
<br />
Vigdis is correct.  You get less resists and aggro at higher levels, and besides, all the nice group spells are available at level 60+ and penultimate spells to get are at level 65.  Not fogetting your better dogdog at 61.<br />
<br />
Like as Binter says, at 100% aaxp, you average 2% to 3% aaxp per mob in PoV and BoT.  That's 1 AA for about 50 mobs your group kills.  You'll have AA coming out of your ears in no time.  Higher level mobs = more xp = more aa.  :p <br />
<br />
The choice is clear, unless you have a need to hang around the same levels as your friends to continue grouping with them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Level 65 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AAs as far as performance goes. Primarily for spells and the inherent bonuses of being 65 (mentioned above by Vigdis and Finn). You should also be able to maintain mana without canniV. It's a bit more clicking of the canni key, but still quite manageable. :) Quiescence owns, as do the group buffs and group haste spells. And as stated above, grouping is easier at 65 in PoP than at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">65 &gt; all aa. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is true of ALL classes, ALL races, ALL aa points,no exceptions.<br />
<br />
I have an alt ranger and by far the stupidest thing I see is rangers going for endless quiver and AM3 at level 60 or 62. I took my straight to 65, and they always say &quot;*** did you do that for? AM3 is way better than 65&quot;.<br />
<br />
In some aspects, yes it is.<br />
<br />
But then again, I got to 65 in aboutt he time it took you to earn 6 aa points at level 60 in PODisease/Valor. And now that I'm 65, not only do I get better resists, do more damage, and have WAY better spells, but I tear through an AA every 70 minutes, while you take 3 hours to do one. Furthermore, 65 ranger will AWLAYs get a group before a 62 ranger. Always. I dont care if you say EQ/am3 in your /ooc, or put &quot;canni 5 able&quot; in your /ooc, anything less than a 65 is inferior to most people.<br />
<br />
Get 65, dont waste a second on AA until then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I stopped for canni5 at level 63, best thing i ever did.  Levels arent that great if you arent in a guild that raids, and they arent so great if you dont have access to spells.<br />
<br />
I would say stopping at 58 is a mistake though...get up to the 60-62 range and hunt mushrooms in FG if you want to stop and solo some points.  The exp isnt bad and they are all db at 61 (and levels after half go lt blue, all are lt blue at 65).<br />
<br />
On the whole subject of less resists at 65 ..i never noticed a difference from 63-65 on resists; i dont raid so that may be the issue (if its even true, there is no proof that i've seen :) ).<br />
<br />
On the ranger subject..i would take a 60 ranger with am3/eq and elemental bow over some 65 with no aa; maybe i'm the minority?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would say get run3 and Cannibalize AA before dinging 62 (I'd go to 61 so you get the pet).  Run 3 is just too cheap to pass up for the reward it gives, and Cannabalize, while not at all cheap, is still a screaming deal.  60 SHM with Cannibalize &gt; 65 SHM without, unless you're like the only shaman in a raiding guild, in which case 65 &gt;&gt; all else, for the resist-related reasons already stated.  <br />
<br />
And yeah, 60 RNG w/ AM3/EQ &gt; 65 RNG without.  It's not like his arrows are going to get resisted because he's 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The difference between level 60 and 65 (For a ranger) is about 250 atk, 12 points of average damage per hit due to damage tables and clvl versus moblevel checks when attacking, and most of all the upgrade from a 65dd proc spell to 150dd proc spell.<br />
<br />
Wrapping that up together, I would not at all be slightly suprised if a level 65 melee ranger outdamaged a 60 ranger with archery aa and a decent bow.<br />
<br />
Of course 65 also dramatically reduces harmony and snare resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thats right a Joke.<br />
<br />
Of course also I have tested it out. If you are a level 62 Fighting in a group of level 65 players you also get AA faster than the level 65.<br />
<br />
Sure slows will land easier at 65 but since 5 AA roughly equals a level of real xp (I said rougly) You could look at is as Am I 5 aa from something decent. Or should I get the next real level. <br />
<br />
I leveled up when the Light blue nerf was in effect and we couldnt get past trials as a guild. So Since Iw as stuck in teir one for a while I stayed level 62. Then I got a couple spectrals in Teir one Mobs and picked up a couple in the bazzar as prices started falling... And one day at like 180 AA We finally had enough level 60+ in the guild to get past trials. So I went to level 63.. Then got a couple aa. and realized I had the good ones so got 64 and 65.<br />
<br />
Now My situation is different than the place EQ is at now. So Do what you want. But at teh time it was good for me. But just ask if roughly 25 AA more is going to make as much differance as teh 5 real levels. And go from there.<br />
<br />
Or in otherwords Do what works for you. And don't be a cookie from the cookie cutter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My SK has 32 AA and is level 63 - and doesn't have what I think of as his defining 63 spell.  For him AA made sense - between the lack of desire to raid, lack of places to exp post 60 if you didn't, and laziness. At this point even if he paired with my shaman at 65, levels still don't make sense.  Maybe if I was in a giuld that flagged it would.  But I don't care to be packed in BoT with all the rest of the 62+ crowd that can't get flagged.<br />
<br />
My shaman is 63 as well (just passed the SK in real EXP while I finish off SCF3), and has never turned on AA.  Pet at 61, focus at 62, regen and malosinia at 63, group haste at 64 (OMG NOW PLEASE), all the 65 spells, never mind decreased resists, makes AA completely silly in my mind.<br />
<br />
Not sure what I'll do with a 65 SHM/ 63 SK combo, but I suspect I'll be able to scrape up exp somewhere - there's enough blue to a 65 places to hunt nowadays.<br />
<br />
Anyway, for a shaman, levels all the way - unless you have friends you need to stay with and aren't levelling.  I know a good friend of mine (65 war) can't hardly group with me any more, since exp for a trio plain sucks for anything you can do with a 65 war/63 shm/63 sk.  She pretty much needs a full group or is fighting light (or low) blues at a slow pace.  Shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you're a pick up group shaman, go to 65, do not stop.  If you are a guild or regular group shaman, stay at roughly the same level your friends play at.  That's worked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hmm i would agree that Level is better then AA.  My shaman is only level 56 and he has only one AA right now but as i look at it AA really are not a determining factor in most groups.  As a shaman Cann5 gives the fastest way to regen mana second only to mage canning pets, what does that bring to a group well if you are the only healer, slower and buffers alot because mana will be very important.  With my druid i didnt Aa at all till i hit 65.  As a druid having your 63 spells you are pretty much set besides the 64 nuke, but as a shaman there are some real nice 64 + 65 spells to have that will help you out alot( Breath of U, Blood of S, Malos, and Q.  I would say if you ahve any of these spell then bust it to 65 but if yo uhave none i might slow down at 662 or 63 and farm plat for atleast Q.  But of course nowdays there is not alot of 64 and 65 level spells in the bazaar.  LOL Malo 19K, topor 25K, Breath of U 18K, Blood of S never seen in bazaar, Fo7 65K, and Q 65K-105K, these are prices in bazaar on Inny when u can see them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">At 51 I split exp 50/50 untill I had run3 and regen3, then back to full Exp til 61.  I wanted the big dog.<br />
<br />
Once I got to 61 I had a choice.  Spells were expensive and I had (have) many holes in the spellbook.  Also most of my friends were still in the 53 to 56 level range.  So ... I went full AA intending to get Canni V while farming for plat in order to buy some of those missing spells.  I made it up to MC2 + a couple of AA when I finally came to my senses.  <br />
<br />
For one thing, my friends are up to 58 to 62 level range so I don't need to wait on them. The big point, however, was spell cost.  Why buy those obsenely expensive level 60 spells when they will be replaced anyway?  I often see Malos for sell CHEAPER than Malo.  I also decided that I could live without Torpor for 4 more levels and just get Q.  If I don't have Torpor, do I really need Canni V? No, not really.  Mana is not a problem in all honesty.  Sure, I have to Canni IV constantly but I have been doing that for so long it second nature by now.<br />
<br />
So my decision was eventually a financial one.  The longer I stayed 61-64 the more I would need those &quot;old class-defining&quot; spells.  But once I reached 65 with Q, I would never cast Torpor again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Get 62 ..<br />
Get to BoT ..<br />
2 days later you will be 65 ..<br />
100% AA end of story<br />
<br />
You wont in anyway shape of form hurt your friends or guild if you 65 ...<br />
<br />
Getting to 65 will take no time at all .. AA's are a time sink.  And dont use spells as an issue to lvling because a lvl 65 shaman with no 62+ spells is still better than a lvl 62 shaman with 50AA.  Your mana pool, resists and other 65 lvl abilities are way more useful than 62 shaman.  Plus between 62 and 65 I bet you will get a few spells and if not horde the parchments for your vendor.  I turn in for cleric spells because they sell the best I think.  Damm clerics and their phat bank accounts =)<br />
<br />
65 then AA ... EOS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It really depends on your playstyle. Main reason not to level straight to 65 is if you regularly group with lower level people. I stopped at 62 to wait for some friends to catch up, did some quests, got Cann5 and saved up enough money for Quiessence. Then I leveled to 65. ... never regreted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I will agree level is greater than AA...but...it's also the reason there are so many lousy toons out there who don't seem to have a clue how to play their character to full effect.<br />
<br />
If your not the least interested in testing your capabilities...then go ahead and zoom to 65...myself, I kinda like to try things out...try soloing in tuffer dungeons...going for the trophy kills at lower levels etc...<br />
<br />
And yes...when you stay at a level..AA do make a big difference.  Someone said a lvl 60 shammy with Canni 5 is greater than a lvl 65 shammy without...I agree...the mana regen is unmatchable...<br />
<br />
A lvl 60 shammy can easily do a fast paced chain pulling environment without even having KEI up or a horse and keep up with mana easily, if he has canni 5...<br />
<br />
HP, gear, etc...can be important.  Have seen some level 65 shammies with less than  2k hp when unbuffed and relatively lousy gear (druman's)...at level 60 with 2500 unbuffed hp and semi-decent gear..I am tuffer than they are<br />
<br />
About the only place that lvl 65 is really greater than lower level is the same for all casting classes....spells, resists, and aggro radius...if you dont have the spells sitting around waiting for you, the other two dont necessarily make enuff difference.<br />
<br />
However, once all is said and done...it just depends on your play style.<br />

Seeing as how I mostly do pickup groups/LDoN/farm for plat, I'll get more bang-for-the-buck being 65.</div></div><hr />
