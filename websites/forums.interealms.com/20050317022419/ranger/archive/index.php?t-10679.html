<br />
FORAGE SKILL - you don't have to stop the attack mode to use this skill ! Sure you won;t forage anything, but the skill check will work, and you will be able to raise the skill without bothering to press attack off, forage, attack on.<br />
<br />
Not only it makes raising the skill easier since you are often times in combat, it is also a good trick when you want to work the skill but dont want to bother dropping or storing the foraged item.. just press attack or sit, forage then attack off or sit off, quickly.<br />
<br />
CATCHING UP SOWED NPC's, BEFORE YOU HAVE SOW -- This tip is just for when your prey runs off at the end of a fight with a sow. Just run after  your prey with attack off and fire arrows ! Eventually your prey's health will be low enough that  it will slow down and  you will be able to catch it up and finish it :)<br />
<br />
RAISING SENSE HEADING -- put it say in the top left hotbutton. Go to options and add the Forward Cursor Key  as a secondary key for the hotbutton on which you put Sense Heading. Now everytime you press the run forward key you will de a Sense Heading Skill Check. You can forget about it and it will raise in no time :)<br />

Then go to your hide spot, use Hide and then do a /consider. If you are indifferent you are properly Hidden.<br />
<br />
Also note that  if you do Sneak you will always con infdifferent. So do NOT use sneak before you check you are Hidden. Once you know you are well Hidden then you can toggle sneak on and off, although at this point it would be to work the skill while you are Medding for example..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmace</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are some common pulling tips that I'm sure everyone already knows but hey, it's my dime.<br />
<br />
Pulling tips:<br />
<br />
1.  Archery builds very little agro.  So if you are pulling but not tanking, pulling with an arrow will let the tank get the mob off you quickly.<br />
<br />
2.  If you are pulling something that runs as fast as you (or faster!), pull with snare.  This may seem obvious, but hey.<br />
<br />
3.  If you are pulling indoors, and there are 2 mobs that you wont be able to split, root one.  Assuming the root sticks, you will have one rooted mob and the other one pulled.  This gives you a short period of time to either dispatch the first mob or get some crowd control lined up for the inevitable INC of the 2nd.<br />
<br />
4.  If you are pulling or running away from something that is as fast as you, run diagonally forward.  This seems to keep mobs of kilter enough as to where they can not beat on you.  Also, jump from hills.  This motion builds some distance between you and the mob.<br />
<br />
5.  If you are pulling mobs with SoW or DS's or other buffs, pull with cancel magic.  <br />
<br />
6.  If you are pulling something that summons, use a no damage spell like snare or cancel magic.  This prevents the (somewhat unlikely) chance of you getting summoned while pulling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and call out root off when you get the worn off message, so everybody's aware when it's coming.<br />
<br />
Tie a forage hot button to your left or right arrow key, eat/drink what you get right away, or throw it away, and never consume your stat food or drink.<br />
<br />
Include a group message with your assist hotkey, and use it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Panic Animal laste 18 seconds max (will break early sometimes, but dont worry, just channel through).<br />
<br />
Track Updates every 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
I leave track up while I fearkite and every 6th update I stop and re-panic.<br />
<br />
This keeps damage to a minimum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davnar</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">STAT FOOD.<br />
<br />
Put this in your first slot in bag in the #1 Inventory slot. Then every time you log on, and as you forage, eat regular food until you are about to explode. If you do this well, you can get the stats without actually eating the food at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faB</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RAISING TRACKING SKILL &amp; THE NEW UI<br />
<br />
I find the Track window quite annoying when I just want to raise the skill. What I used to do in the old UI is to quickly press the iventory key two times this would remove the track window, without the need to actually go and piint 'Cancel' with the mouse. You dont't want to do that hundred times..<br />
<br />
With the new UI, I set Normal Transparency of the Tracking window to about 75, and Faded Transparency anywhere between 0 and 50. This will bring the tracking window more opaque when you hit the TRACK hotkey, but after a few seconds the window will almost disappear (fade off) and only the text will remain so you can leave the window on and hit the TRACK key often times during fight or walks without  the need to Cancel it away and you keep a good view ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faB</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FRIENDS LIST<br />
<br />
Just found out that you can type a space after the name of your friend, and then additional characters up to I assume the lenght of name &amp; surname.<br />
<br />
When you type /who all friend they will show up as long as the  first name is correct, anything after the space is up to you.<br />
<br />
For example :<br />
<br />
/friend Ninaldiu theranger<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
/friend Enoni war54<br />
<br />
etc..<br />
<br />
In other words, you can change the surname to something to help you remember who is who, the /who command will only use the name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailbe</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When pulling long distances in out doors zones, use Tangling Weeds instead of snare.  Tangling Weeds is level 9 and lasts a very short time, so you won't have to baby sit the mob into the camp, but it gives you a chance to get a head start on the mob so its not beating on you on the way back.  Also its fast casting, so you can TW a mob just when it starts fleeing rather than having to cast snare or ensnare early on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LaoLi</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the new UI you can also click the little circle in the top left corner of the tracking window, to minimize the UI for practice. That way it'll never pop up and bug you, but if you need it you just maximize it (as opposed to not being able to see it at 0 alpha). Turning the alpha down may be preferable to some, though :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
ALTERNATE METHOD -- As soon as the mob flee's (and you dont have it snared) SIT DOWN. As soon as you sit the mob will come back to you. Stand and hit it a few times. Repeat until mob is rooted/snared/dead.</div></div><hr />

I was fighting large zelniaks in Dawnshroud Peaks. Maybe this tip only works with intelligent creatures (i.e. not animals), I havent tried that yet.<br />
<br />
Here's a classic:<br />
<br />
THE CLOUDS ALWAYS MOVE WESTWARD<br />
<br />
Yup. Of course you have to be in a zone where you can see the sky /clouds.<br />
<br />
Best example is the Karanas, if you follow the clouds you will go from EK, NK, WK eventually you will reach Qeynos Hills. Go Weeeeeeeest!</div></div><hr />

Fear Kiting tip:<br />
<br />
Panic Animal laste 18 seconds max (will break early sometimes, but dont worry, just channel through).<br />
<br />
Track Updates every 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
I leave track up while I fearkite and every 6th update I stop and re-panic.<br />

<br />
Also, KICK is on a 6 second timer (unless you're hasted).  So fear, kick, kick, kick, fear.  Repeat as necessary</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheRiov</div><div class="date">10-12-2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, panic Animal seems to last 3 tics, not 18 seconds.<br />
Depending on where Panic lands in those six seconds you have anywhere between 13 and 23 seconds to land again.  Given that the spell is only 15 mana with KEI or other mana regen you can cast every tick and still regain mana. <br />
<br />
Now, I dont' recomend chaincasting it, but the closer togeather you space your casts the less likelyhood you'll hit that tic timer. It also gives you a greater chance to recast if its resisted.<br />
<br />
<br />
I prefer to cast every 12 seconds-- I find I can solo for longer periods of time and take less damage this way.  and in the end I kill more mobs per unit time.</div></div><hr />

At least pick Forage Food/Water/None Eatable. Something like that.. When your hungry I would imagine one would look for food, rather then water. Just makes more sense that way. Perhaps it could be an ability you get when you reach 200 or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HIDE MESSAGE:<br />
Set up a hot key like this:<br />
/doability 2 (where 2 is your hide ability #, whatever that is)<br />
/target Anduyn (target yourself)<br />
<br />
When your hide is successful, you'll see this message:<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see anyone by that name around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if it's unsuccessful, you'll target yourself.  Works every time.</div></div><hr />

Only problem that I have seen is when I am in combat, a message appears that you cannot forage right now because you are in combat or something to that effect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pfoe</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SWIMMING SKILL<br />
<br />
Raise that swimming skill.  It is still one of the most important skills in the game.  Especially if you like KK.  There is a HUGE difference in swimming at skill level 1 vs 200.  At 200 and with a SOW, I can out swim someone running besides me without SOW.  Difficult to raise? Nah, are you waiting on a boat, standing by a pool, pond, river?  Jump right in a swim.  You'll get that skill up in no time.  Hell I got Swimming to 200 (with off and on swimming) about half way through Level 32 and prolly could have been sooner.  BUT SWIM!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vash</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you want to raise swimming<br />
<br />
bind in shadow haven and swim... gives you something to do while waiting to be rezzed... only 2 seconds away from the bazaar to check prices<br />
<br />
and your only a step away from the pal caverns... fun stuff to kill while naked... on long CR's you can nearly have a full set of armor collected... but the BP's are so damn rare =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drienne</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anduyn, that's a great trick :)<br />
<br />
One problem, though...  If you have see invis (for example, Truesight on the Helm of the Tracker) targeting yourself after hiding will work fine, since you can still see yourself.  Unfortunately, the only real way to do it is to con a mob you know is other than indifferent and doesn't see through hide.</div></div><hr />
