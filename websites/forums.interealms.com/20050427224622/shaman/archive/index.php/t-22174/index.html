<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is for elemental-flagged level 65's.<br />
<br />
First step, get VP3.  Seriously.  Join an aggro-kiting group until you grind out the AA, it doesn't take long.<br />
<br />
GETTING TO THE CAMP.  Zone in.  Lev, SOW, invis.  Head along the RIGHT zone edge until you get to the first castle.  Go as far up the mountside as you can, then run toward the castle - the idea is to run on top of the wall, where the mobs are (none of them see invis).  Some people have trouble getting on top of the wall, keep trying.<br />
<br />
Once on top of the wall, head down the stairs right in front of you, then along the first floor until you come to a staircase in the middle of the hall there, heading down to a courtyard.  Run straight ACROSS the courtyard and out the door on the other side.<br />
<br />
Once through the door, take a hard right and hug the wall.  (This is called the C1 camp on Rodcet, XP is not too bad here although not quite as good as where we're going.)  There may be two phoenixes up, they will not aggro if you follow directions.  Hug the right wall and run along.  You will pass a little gazebo thing with many mobs in it; keep running along the zone wall.  You then come to another big castle.  There's a rock directly in front of the doors to the castle that I always run to and pause.  There are a few see invis mobs on the plain in front of the castle, so be careful.  All the mobs guarding the castle see invis.<br />
<br />
Time your entry into the castle so that the see-invis wanderering guards do not see you.  Run through the middle of the door so the stationary guards do not aggro.<br />
<br />
Now you need to run all the way THROUGH this castle.  There's a big arena-like area, kind of like a boxing ring, straight in front as you enter with lots of mobs; you want to pass this on the left.  Aggro range is not that big, so SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE between this area and the buildings on your left.  If you do not, mobs in the buildings may aggro as you run by.  The mistake I made a few times was to try to stay too far away from the boxing ring, and I aggroed a couple of mobs from the left-hand side buildings instead.  Run STRAIGHT towards the boxing ring until you can split the difference between the ring and the houses on the left.<br />
<br />
Run all the way to the back and through the doorway into a courtyard with two buildings in it and some picnic tables.  Congratulations, you are at the tables camp (c3 on Rodcet).  It's a good idea to pause in the entrance to the tables area and check for aggro.  Die or gate if you have any, please don't train those inside.  If you don't train, have a good rep, and have an EE on you, a kind necro will often rez you in.  Don't worry if it's not a 96% rez, honestly, you will get it back in no time.<br />
<br />
PULLING. You will be pulling anything/everything in the tables area, plus Doomfire Soldiers from outside.  Stay away from the caster types solo unless you have no other choice, they will break VP frequently.<br />
<br />
Move to extreme range and pull with Malicious Decay.  Without running, hit VP as soon as MD has landed.  It WILL stick and WILL last to full duration, on the melee-only mobs, and the mob should not be able to get to you (use an extended range focus if you have to, they are player-made and purchaseable in bazaar).<br />
<br />
Now that the mob is rooted, hit it with malos and then malosinia (you can try just malosinia but it may take a few casts to stick).  Lay on Blood of Saryrn and Breath of Ultor, Epic, and your non-DD curse-based dots (Bane, Anathema, Odium).  Reapply as needed.<br />
<br />
Wait until your refresh button for VP is about 3-4 seconds from refreshing, then if you choose, hit it with a DD dot. This will break root about the same time VP comes up, so reroot.  If you'd rather not mess with that extra dot, just skip it and re-VP as soon as the button pops.  You have about a 6 second window after VP recycles before the old VP wears off.  The last VP break, I pretty much just load it up with fresh dots and let it chase me around so I don't use up my VP and have to wait to engage the next mob.<br />
<br />
14% solo AA per kill.  I get Burning Affliction IV from tribute and I have CA1; I have Bane and Odium but not Anathema.  With all that it takes me about 4:30 to solo one, average, with no downtime if I have KEI.  I could improve on that time a bit by getting CA3 and Anathema.   At that rate, I'll see an AA every 35-40 minutes.<br />
<br />
Oh, and regarding pulling...  all the mobs in the tables area come single very easily, even the ones inside the buildings.  There are a few tougher pulls outside the tables area.  I was under the impression for a long time that these mobs do not assist each other; they DO assist, but the range is very, very small.<br />
<br />
The only drawback: it's BORING, folks :-( but it will buy you those AA's you really need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry but I've been soloing in pofire and VP does not ALWAYS run for full duration.  Trust me, you want a second root up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i've never had a vp break early on a doomfire, as long as i pull with malicious decay.<br />
magmen, spiders and elementals are a different story, though.<br />
get ornate pants though for security :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same.  If I DR debuff the mobs at the tables, VP lasts the full duration.  Only time you could possibly die is either: 1) you are tired, 2) you are chatting with people and not paying attention [ it is comical to have a few doomfires chancing you as you run in circles praying to god that you can either VP or gate ], or 3) take your pick :P<br />
<br />
For the most part, you can solo the tables with hardly any buffs.<br />
<br />
My spell lineup is rather simple:<br />
<br />
Canni IV<br />
Bane<br />
BoS<br />
Malos<br />
Uthor<br />
DR Debuffer<br />
&lt;Util Slot&gt;  - I tried using Pox here, but you have to time things because it will break VP [ The curse before Bane would be nice if I had it ]<br />
Q<br />
<br />
The other night, I only had focus and sow on.  /shrugs  <br />
<br />
I usually take my time [ I kill a mob approx. 6 mins - only have the extended torment focus ] and get a few AA out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shrapnac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Been doing this recently since I got VP3.  Must say, really easy exp.<br />
<br />
Using Breath, Bane, BoS, and Epic I can keep the 5 outside spawns clear, never tried pulling the mobs inside the huts since I don't really have a reason to(playing on SZ does have it's advantages, exp bonus, I get 17% AA per mob, and I'm usually the only person in Fire when I'm soloing.)<br />
<br />
Pull with MD, instantly VP like everyone says, then stack the dots.  I usually switch out MD with a root just incase although I've never had a mob break VP early.<br />
<br />
The DD based DoT right before VP refreshes seems like an interesting idea, I might try that just for some extra DPS on the mob.<br />
<br />
Epic is nice to stick on the mob just make sure you're not doing it close to when VP breaks because you have to be so close~<br />
<br />
Never died doing it, but have had mobs occassionally warp to me(only happened twice I can recall, but it's not fun).<br />
<br />
I sit at about 4k hp unbuffed and usually do it with self buffs, drogmor, and KEI if I can find one.<br />
<br />
It's really trivial once you figure out how to do it, and it's good for about an AA an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">since mana was never really an issue with some enchanter buff, i tried to find some ways to speed up the kills.  just a couple random tips:<br />
<br />
anathema, while it's an ass ratio, is a nice dps boost.<br />
if you're using both anathema and bane, it's worthwhile to cast malosinia on top of malos (or just chain sinia's until it lands since it's lowish mana and has no recast time) to minimize the resists on the magic dots, which though infrequent are obnoxious when they occur.<br />
using nuke dots is a viable option on VP refreshes and the like, especially if you have a clicky root item and/or an ornate horse.<br />
<br />
but yeah i definitely did 100ish aa's at the fire tables either solo or duoing with random kiters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I pull at tables with mal decay, then VP, then spam sinia until it takes, then stack bane/blood/bou/anathema and epic.<br />
<br />
With crit affliction3/ba4 If I go at it like a bard I can get an aa in 45-50mins (4-5min kills depending on crits/resists, 1-2 min downtime).<br />
<br />
Nowadays I solo in among the huts or fight towards AMY/reparm for fun if people at table ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After a few thousand casts, I have never had VP3 drop early on doomfires if I use MD first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only times I have had VP drop early is when someone decided to &quot;help&quot; me, or when a ranger's arrow intended for another mob hit mine instead and procced a DD.<br />
<br />
Even so, I don't usually bother having another root up.  If that happens, I just kite the mob until VP comes back up.  Regular magic-based roots just do not last long enough.<br />
<br />
I do usually go ahead and land both Malos and Malosinia, pretty much because I am bored most of the fight and might as well make sure everything lands that can land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Virulent Paralysis is a very good AA.... but on the doomfire mobs in fire it has a very high resist rate.... Ornate chain pants save my ass everytime at the fire tables... they hardly ever resist root with Malos, Epic is also very good.... any shaman with his / her epic.... each bit of DPS counts, they almost NEVER resist epic click....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You guys must just have uber VP then, I have VP3 and always pull with Mal decay.  I have had VP break early 3 or 4 times so far out of maybe 15 casts.<br />
<br />
Moral to the story,  VP can break!  Be prepared for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've never had a resist on VP if I cast Malicious Decay first.  It's not like MD is a mana intensive spell, it's what 100 mana?<br />
<br />
Duration times on regular roots are too sporadic for them to be viable when the mobs are hitting for 1k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You guys must just have uber VP then, I have VP3 and always pull with Mal decay.  I have had VP break early 3 or 4 times so far out of maybe 15 casts.<br />

<br />
The only times I had VP break on me was in a kite group.  The reason for this was:  <br />
<br />
When the kiters were lom, I would root-rot one of the guards so that they can mana regen.  I usually get the mob down to 50% and VP would fade.  At this point, the mob was snared, I would kite the mob around while the melee poked it in the arse.  Now, the problem came when I accidently re-VP'ed a mob I was rotting, and the rogue was poking it in the back-side - VP broke because of the rogue's proc on his dagger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You know what I think is happening is that VP goes past the refresh timer, and before it actually breaks I cast VP again.  Then 10 seconds later it breaks.  Almost as if I had never cast it again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Possible.<br />
<br />
I know that the button refreshes before VP fades on a mob.  I usually have 6-10 seconds to re-apply VP [ I've had no problems with it fading after a few seconds, and I do this all the time ], or I better start running a safe distance :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I do recast VP before it breaks usually and have never had a problem, but I am not trying to cut it to the last possible second.  I let the button refresh on its own and then I push it.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying others don't have the problem, but I have never had a VP resisted and I have never had one end early if I pulled with malicious decay and made sure nobody else touched the mob.  I have probably soloed only about 20-30 doomfires since I tend to join up with whoever is aggro kiting because it's faster and it's hard to keep your soloing from interfering with their kiting.<br />
<br />
If you start pulling doomfire chaplains or the wizard/chanter mobs, yeah, VP doesn't last on those for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bumping this a bit.  I have now soloed over 100 doomfires and not had VP break early, ever, except when someone nuked or procced an arrow on my mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">VP does break early BUT I think it has to do with server style lag.  I solo tables a ton.  I have been there all by myself, early morning, and this has happened.  I also notice that if it happens once it happens a bunch more.  After I log out reboot etc and come back it doesn't beak the rest of my play session.  I think what people are seeing as VP breaking early is an illusion.  The button isn't refreshing OR the button is refreshing to soon.</div></div><hr />
