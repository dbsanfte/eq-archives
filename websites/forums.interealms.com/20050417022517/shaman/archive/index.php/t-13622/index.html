<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have posted on this before but now that I see that more shammies are using Dulak for exp and the lot, I'll ask again.  At 54 what is the best way to break into the caves?  I've tried trying to clear the entrance with the armory ogeress and the nightmare initiate but I keep on getting scout adds which are really annoying.  Would it be better to just invis all the way to the bridge and then set up camp there?  Oh and one more, what level can I solo the guy that drops the soulstripper? Last time I was there my group was overkill for the place and I was 47 so I couldn't accurately gage everything.  I'm really trying to like this place cause it's benefits are there to see, but I keep screwing up at the caves.  Boats still work for me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I also would like to know what lvl a shaman can solo soulstripper, and where does this soulstripper spawn. Is it in those underground caves, and if so what is mobs name. Also how rare is mob/drop.</div></div><hr />

Soulstripper drops from a mob named 'an enraged soulstealer'.  To get to the camp, from the dulak zone in, go thru the hidden wall place to the luggald caves.  You can fight all the way down to bridge area, where it will split off, take the right path, and the soulstealer, or PH will be in the middle of the hallway.  It's a static spawn, the soulstealer is lvl 51, conned blue to me at 62.  Just have disease/poison/magic resists up, and hes easy to kill.  If he has the soulstripper, you can visibly see him wielding it.  Also there is a wanderer that will add while fighting if you don't kill him first.  I just cleared my way straight to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tolby Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soulstealer's placeholder is named Servant of Hate.  Pops up near the wall on the left side as your looking in from the bridge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Invis up and go in.<br />
<br />
Soulstripper is located just as the above posts state.  You can set up by the PH safely with the potential for 1 roamer.  That 1 roamer is a PH for a palladin spell quest, an undead floater named 'Chester something'.  He conned indifferent to me so if he's up you are completely safe there.  I duo'd with a 60 cleric who tanked the PH till the named popped.  My shaman is lvl 49 and I think you should be able to solo that area at 54.  Named is a caster so have your resists up before taking him on.  It was an easy fight duo'ing with the cleric just tanking with his hammer of divinity.  I had very few resists on slow.  As long as that named roamer is up, you won't get any adds to mess things up.  just use root to keep him from running.<br />
<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is the soulstriper weapon pretty rare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I only got the named to pop once and he had it.  Based on the posts I've seen, it looks like he has it quite regularly.  Took me about 4 hours to get him to pop though, YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How to break in luggald caves:<br />
<br />
im a 51 shammy and the following been easy for me solo.<br />
I go in invis until i come to the bridge. 1 mob in the middle of the bridge, thats the part where i make pet. <br />
First off, root the mob and slow him. step back and make pet, buff up and kill the mob. Head doen the right part of the bridge there are 2 mobs as static spawn, can be pulled solo even as 51 shammy.<br />
<br />
Kill em and head in, the next mob on the left side is the Named spawn. Usually i pull the 2 mobs at bridge and the one in the middle of the bridge. they drop gems / jewelery. My best result was 4 soulstripper in 1 day, which is 16k plus gems and exp, prolly one of the best loy camps.<br />
The Soulstripper is lore so i use my everfrost stone, run to bazaar, hand soulstripper to mule and gate back to Dulak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Camped the named for 4 hours last night and he didn't show.  Maybe I will have better luck tonight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Camped the named for a little under 2 hours last night.  I pretty much just sat on his spawn point and pulled stuff to there.  Got 3 luggald fleshes for me, 6 for my boxed 55 druid, and right as I was going to gate out, named popped and donated his soulstripper to the cause.  The only thing he managed to stick on me was something lame like heat blood.  Fight wasn't even close.<br />
<br />
This spot is highly recommended.  A nice easy camp with quest drops and a chance for a good weapon.  What's not to like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tried again last night for another 4 hours and it didn't spawn.  Got loads of the flesh (is it posible to do both the evil and the good versions of the ring quest, using illusion potions ?) and a few blue diamonds.  Another shaman I talked to who was camping the spot hadn't had any luck in 3 days either.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this weekend will bring better luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kheldran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I tried the spawn with my 56 Beastlord. I fought to the spot and saw the PH. i killed him and next spawn was the enraged, however, he didn't wield the weapon. I ended up with the Cape of the Hatebringer.. figures a rare drop when I wanted the common.<br />
<br />
I went back with my 51 shaman and my bro's 51 monk. We killed 2 PH's and he spawned with the weapon. I got it, then we waited and next spawn he was up again with the soulstripper AGAIN! this time we got KS'd after engaging it and I died. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">15 hours so far spent on the camp and no sign of the named  :mad: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The Enraged Soulstealer's location is approximately p1434 n364 if you haven't found him yet. Some people think he is on an 8 hour spawn, others have seen him pop back to back, or 4 Enraged Soulstealers in less than 2.5 hours.<br />
<br />
I've camp'd him 3 times now, first time took just under 4 hours to get the Soulstealer 1hb, second time no sign of him (about 3 hours at camp), then third time took about less than 40 minutes. He is pretty easy at lvl 62, I only buff my resists with DR/PR/MR, and usually I just sick the 61 pet on him, malo/slow/epic/JBB. If pet has aggro, then I'll add a BoN for fun.</div></div><hr />
