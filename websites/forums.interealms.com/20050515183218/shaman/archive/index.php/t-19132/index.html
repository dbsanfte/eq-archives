<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a few ideas on simple things we can ask for that would not change the balance of the game and would make life easier for us.<br />
<br />
SoE/FoE is there any reason we should not get this spell? I love to lev and our &quot;upgraded&quot; lev is just the same short duration single target low level spell-just with the freedom from having to carry around bat wings. I always cast lev on myself if there is no other way to get it, then cast sow (sow boots of course not spell). Thats 2 buff slots being taken up by spells with short durations. And, I don't mind the bobbing part as much as some people, but the ability to get rid of it would be welcome.<br />
<br />
An upgrade to Bi'li. Its short duration, group only. I usually bug the druid/ranger for SoE then cast Bi'li for the melees. An upgraded group and single target version would be nice. Just scale the speed and attack up to match the level of the caster or give multiple versions that match the needs of a caster in that particular level range.<br />
<br />
An improved invis. I'd say one with see invis built in, and a more reliable duration. Maybe a group version to go along with it. <br />
<br />
I don't see how any of those would hurt the balance of the game (as if there is any real balance), would take some of the spell swapping tedium away, and would really help us do a better job of helping out on raids. There are some times when lev is necessary to get to your target, and there are some times when invis/see invis is necessary for the same reason. <br />
Oh, and just one thing that personaly annoys me-maybe we could have an option to toggle on/off the ability to receive mod rods? I hate having those things pop up on my cursur when I'm in the middle of doing something. We have the ultimate mod rod, Canni V, we don't need those annoying little things at all.</div></div><hr />
