<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently picked up a couple of new weapons at bargain basement prices (yeah bazaar!) and have seen one more possibiliy on sale fairly cheap.  I'm interested in some feeback on using 2hb and meleeing, in both solo and duo situations.  <br />
<br />
I have:<br />
<br />
barb spiritist hammer (Dmg 22, Dly 43. +13 Wis +13 Int, procs 260pt dd)<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
granite face grinder (Dmg 29, Dly 36. +10 Str +10 Wis)<br />
<br />
and I've seen these for cheap enough that I could buy em:<br />
<br />
Blight, hammer of scourge (Dmg 23, Dly 47. +9 Sta +9 Wis +9 Int +10 vsDis, procs 540 point slow dot)<br />
<br />
Poison Wind Censer  (Dmg 20, Dly 28. +5 Str -30 vsPos, procs 500 points of rain aoe)<br />
<br />
I have neither a JBB nor an Epic, though I'm getting close to getting both if that changes the answer to my question.  <br />
<br />
So which of these is the best 2hb to use in various situations?  <br />
<br />
The common wisdom among melees would make the GFG the obvious no brainer, but I don't seem to hit all that often despite maxed offense and nearly maxed 2hb skills, so procs are actually a fairly measurable portion of my damage.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
If the rest of my gear matters to the answer of this question, here it is:<br />

If you're bored and want to do yet another gear commentary, feel free.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id go with the barb spiritist hammer.  Procs are what matters in shaman combat unless you are using rabid bear. Poison Wind Censor is nice but cannot be used in certain situations, like when a chanter is mezzing for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For your level, I agree with the BSH.<br />
<br />
For a level 30, I think a blight is almost as awesome as a JBB is at 45.<br />
<br />
The weapon procs the level 34 dot at level 30.  Most exp mobs you might solo at 30 don't have much more than 500 hp. <br />
<br />
Fight, Proc, root, relax :)<br />
<br />
Im still considering trying to find out first hand how the AE proc works for soloing.... I just am trying to be good and save for the big spells and/or fungi.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is there any reason to think that starting out with a blight until it procs, then switching to a BSH would be better than just starting out with the BSH and swinging it the entire time?<br />
<br />
And based on these replies, I guess my 24 Sk has a new toy (face grinder).  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies,<br />
