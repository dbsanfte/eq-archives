<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">FYI - When I got through my trial on Christmas Eve, I found out something very cool.<br />
<br />
Our ds potion, 31 points for a level 60/61, stacks with the mage ds, 44 points for a grand whopping 75 point ds.<br />
<br />
I saw two non-melee damage messages every time I was hit - one for 31, one for 44. Take that, you stone things! I laugh as you beat me down.<br />
<br />
I made 3 shots - one for me, one for the necro, one for the main tank - the 3 people most likely to be beat upon. It's a little edge, but it was nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">very nice!<br />
<br />
a much needed improvement!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Old news - it has always stacked with Mage / Druid DS... However I dont think it stacks with the DS on the Chardok ring and the Coldain Ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the bard DS song stacks with mage and shaman DS's aswell<br />
<br />
Psalm of Veeshan does an added 13-14 per hit.<br />
<br />
that puts it at just under 90 HP's per hit...  there's a good tactic in there somewhere... wonder if all 3 stack with the necro/sk self only DS's..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok the shaman DS potions DO stack with the chardock ring....<br />
<br />
im play a pvp server and going into pvp with a self buffed 56 pt DS at lvl 61 rocks.... many rogues already fear it.<br />
<br />
i cannot try it with the druid shields since i am not on thier team.<br />
havent tried it with mage shields yet.... although i know either the ring or potion wont stack with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How about giving everyone a 10shot Stinging Wort beforehand too? Thats 3500hp of healing each in case the cleric is struggling for mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's a good idea.<br />
<br />
Ran through my notes... they say that the DS stacks.  /bonk self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zcul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Weee<br />
<br />
please inform if there are other damage shield items attainable that can solve!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I discussed this issue on a stragedy post and some kind people linked the explanation for stacking to lucy.  Bottome line is that you can have one dmg shield from each of folloing groups: <br />
<br />
A) druid, mage or chardok ring dmg shield<br />
B) shaman potion or coldain ring<br />
C) bard dmg song<br />
<br />
In class A mage&gt;druid&gt;chardok.<br />
In class B potion&gt;coldain.<br />
<br />
Bard is sweet since it stacks with all.   Mage, plus shaman potion plus bard dmg shield is good stragedy for trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tons of Ds stacks, not sure of what, but i know that our MT got like 242 DS once. (some druid aa, ds potion, ds spell, clicky DS, bard ds) not sure of what exactly, but it is awesome to reach such DS.  Will try to see what was used hehe.</div></div><hr />

3500? I thought that it was 300hp per charge.</div></div><hr />
