<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was chatting with a couple of friends of mine and we were discussing putting together a trials group to see if we could get a couple of us flagged so we could group together in places where the higher levels actually get decent xp.  I was hoping people could give me some advice about which trial to do and how to put the group together based on what we've got:<br />
<br />
Already flagged:<br />
65 Paladin (1500 ac, 7000 hp raid buffed, uses windblade)<br />
63 Wizard (4000 mana, lizard, epic, otherwise so-so gear)<br />
65 Magician (not sure of gear, but pretty good)<br />
<br />
Not Currently flagged:<br />
57 Ranger (1100 ac, avg gear, uses windblade)<br />
58 Shaman - me - (horse, jbb, fungi, no epic, no tigir's insects spell)<br />
<br />
We could either take the core of already flagged people, add in both myself and my ranger friend, and add a 6th person.  Or we could do one of us at a time.<br />
<br />
So the questions:<br />
<br />
* Which trial do we pick?  What tactics do we use?<br />
<br />
* Can we do it with the 5 people listed above + 1 person?  What class?<br />
<br />
* If we can't, then what do you add to 65pal+63wiz+65mag+58sham?<br />
<br />
* And what do you add to 65pal+63wiz+65mag+57rng?<br />
<br />
There was a thread a while ago which recommended one of the trials other than the executioner, but I couldn't find it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Add a cleric and a chanter, and do one at a time would be my recommendation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This link has a decent chart for tier access.  It says to plead the case of Mauvin for access to next tiere, hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">General consensus is Trial of execution is the easiest and most straightforward.    <br />
<br />
There's tons of tactics/ideas for execution so i won't go into details. however, the key thing for us was for the MT/MA to stay on the whatever he chose initially and to target efficiently as possible after each kill or slightly before.  Execution is  DPS intensive and every second counts.<br />
<br />
I agree with the previous poster.  Without a chanter/cleric you are losing out on some really nice buffs, Aego/Virtue, KEI and better haste for melees.  <br />
<br />
That being said, there is no perfect group. Level and equipment is just as important as what class.   Unless there is a long line for the trail, you can try, fail, med up and try again within minutes.  Exp is not bad for low 60s.  <br />
<br />
 Concentrate on getting the best DPS possible.  For our &quot;lets-flag-the-guild&quot; push, we stacked the deck by having other guild members buff the core group. Druids throwing on thorns, Shaman avatar'ing MT before entering etc.   We event lent better haste and weapons to the flagees in order to help out.<br />
<br />
It's definitely worth doing. For exp, it's hard to beat PoV/PoS.  And if you want to level past 62, it's almost required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm, no suggestions for trials other then executioner, so I guess we'll try executioner.  Assume we can obtain whatever buffs we need (like virtue and KEI) ahead of time.  Are chanter and cleric still your choices for who to add to the group for the trial itself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vexz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The target DPS for the group should be over 400.  In both cases I'd add Rogue, Cleric.  Paladin can hold a back, gain aggro on mobs that aggro the cleric and is tougher than my paladin so he should have no problem tanking all 4 at once.<br />
<br />
We recently did it with Pal, Rog, Rog, Cleric, 58 shm, lvl something deadweight druid with 40m (we got tired of waiting).  The key is having the paladin use spells to peel so the melees can stay on target.  Don't bother slowing til the boss mob.<br />
<br />
Get shaman, ranger, enchanter buffs prior to fighting if you can.  I'd skip the enchanter, but get a tank of a cleric that can stand gettin pounded by 2 mobs til the paladin can peel.  Enchanter will not increase dmg output only reduce dmg taken (for the most part).</div></div><hr />
