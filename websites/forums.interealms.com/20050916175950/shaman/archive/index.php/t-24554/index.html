<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is disturbing.  I'm not going to be playing a shaman in WoW (I'm looking at either Tauren warrior or Human paladin), but check out this description from the Class Roles thread (here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&amp;t=470726&amp;p=1&amp;#post470726)) on the WoW forums:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
The old phrase “jack of all trades, master of none” is an excellent way to describe the Shaman; they are the only real “hybrid” class in World of Warcraft. While they do not excel at any one aspect of their repertoire, they function passing well when performing most tasked called upon by a party. Need a support healer? Looking for a secondary tank? After another damage-dealer? Have an empty slot that needs someone to support the group in general? The Shaman can provide. They have a number of utility spells as well that help make life easier for any party. <br />

No thx u~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Eh?<br />
<br />
Sounds like a shaman to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most folks found their way to The Shamans' Crucible because this is exactly the type of character they chose to play in EQ.  It's not for everyone, but it is for the typical (and good) shaman.  At level 42, I get group invites all the time because I never waste a group slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vuulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eh?<br />
<br />

<br />
Idealistically yes, SOE's execution, no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In Sony's execution also yes; it's just that the game mechanics value specialists nowadays. But then, that wasn't strictly WoW discussion, so nevermind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vuulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would have agreed once upon a time about execution, however expansion after expansion has deminished this classes flexablity.  I have no idea about OoW, and probably never will.  I also will not find out in WoW how shamans play, I have seen how expansion favor specialist as you mention and will play one to save myself frustration down the road.  This may not be the case in WoW but I certainly am gun shy after EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That sounds alrite to me. Donno what you were looking for in a shaman class for WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's a great class, and you should NOT count on the &quot;Official Class Descriptions&quot; as any kind of a description for any class, ironically.<br />
<br />
Jack of all trades, master of none?  I would beg to differ.  And a lot of Shaman skills are unique to the shaman.  Totems, for example, and they do help a lot.<br />
<br />
And when they say master of none, they didn't add that we're pretty darned very close to being great at everything, unlike the EQ shaman. <br />
<br />
 I nuke very hard (with added special effects like snare, spell inturrupt), and can nuke harder with talants in that direction.  <br />
<br />
I can heal VERY well, and as a resser, i'm very valued in every group i've been in.  My heals may not be as varied as a priest's, but they are powerful enough to make a significant dent in my allies health.  And , with talants, I can get even better.  Talants I might add that the priests are jealous of.  Their &quot;Holy&quot; talant tree leaves a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
And melee?  I do more damage melee right now then I do with nukes.  Flurry - Every time I crit (which is a 12% chance, because of talants and agility) I get a 20% haste for the next 3 swings, and within those three swings, i USUALLY get another crit.<br />
<br />
Windfury Weapon:  Chance on hit of getting two additional hits with boosted power.  <br />
<br />
And with a slow, heavy staff I am taking brutal chunks out of any target, PVE or PVP.<br />
<br />
Jack of all trades?  Yes.<br />
Master of none?  Perhaps.<br />
Death on four hooves?  Definently. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what i have been reading after skimming thru the dozens of &quot;nerf shamans now&quot; threads the shaman in WOW is the most balanced class so far with all of its skills allowing it to be very versatile both in pvp and pve.<br />
<br />
Warlocks still need love and i wanna play a warlock in retail too.<br />

FOR THE HORDE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The shaman is the bard of WoW. I would say master of all trades, jack of none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sounds like how shaman where when i started playing a shaman in EQ.  Sonds ok to me, i just hope it snot so bard like that i break my wrists. Otherwise ill be playing another class. I stoppped my bard at 30 cause i could see possible damage to my wrists, im not down with that, not over a video game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's not that bad on your wrists.  Theres a lot you CAN do in a given fight, but you dont have to in order to dominate your opponents.  Even in PVP, shamans are great.  <br />
<br />
Most fights, I pull with a single spell, lay down two totems as the enemy is incoming (more if i'm fighting mobs over my level for whatever reason), then switch to melee.  An insta shock during the fight maybe (or not, depending on how much downtime I can tolerate) and it's basically over quick.  <br />
<br />
Thankfully, there is no real equilivant to the Bard in terms of how many things you have to do and pay attention to constantly like that. :)  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">FWIW in W3 Frozen Throne and W3, the Shaman hero(s) were tough - but the Druid and Blademasters were incredible.<br />
<br />
Apples and oranges, but both were fun to play.</div></div><hr />
