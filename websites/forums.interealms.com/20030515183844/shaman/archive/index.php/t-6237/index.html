<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kannibal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I turned in my 3 books to spirit in EJ tomight.. to my surprise it says I will not aid your kind.. i mean come on kindly faction does not get it. Anyone with some insight would be helpful please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't panic.<br />
<br />
It means you don't have enough faction, or that you missed a step beforehand.<br />
<br />
Another reason why you could not have enough faction is you killed something on truespirit faction by accident... (or design), such as the lesser spirits, or the wandering spirit.<br />
<br />
A good way to fix this is to redo woe&amp;envy&amp;marr's promise... try doing it once, then return in ghiosk's books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kannibal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have never killed anything on Truespirit faction I'm real careful... I have a 60 enchanter I completed epic for so I have raad about faction. I just can believe kindly is not enough thats stupid!!! Done every step right this makes second time I have turned in books and got same message. shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are you giving the books to the right Spirit? Ghiosks books go to the one in the Lake, not the one on dry land that you gave the combined reports to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, check the spirit.  I actually did the same thing ever so long ago, gave my first set of books to the wrong spirit.  (&quot;What, there's ANOTHER spirit??&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brakums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah sounds like you gave them to the wrong one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wouldn't that be &quot;I don't need these things, Bob, you can have them back&quot;  message if it went to the wrong spirit?<br />
<br />
Handing in more books until you've fixed the source of the problem won't help, by the way. If it is the right spirit, you need to fix your faction first, if it's the wrong spirit, he'll never take your books anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not all zones have &quot;I don't need these things...&quot; enabled.  I can still give critters in Qeynos noob zone loot and weaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what's this fire beetle eye doing on Fippy?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kannibal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I gave it to the dog floating/shrug oh well I started again.. this is getting to be a pain.. thanks for the replys all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lord Ghiosk's 3 books should be turned into the Spirit that is under the lake in Northern EJ (+3685, -640 ), not the one you got your Black Fur Boots from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;Dog floating&quot; - the dog in the lake?<br />
<br />
NOT the dog in the little ruins.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hey, what's this fire beetle eye doing on Fippy?&quot; <br />
<br />
From time to time I still sit in Newbie Zones buffing and SoW'ing and placing FS weapons on Bats and Fire Beetles and the like.  You can still give items to mob's just not NPC's.</div></div><hr />
