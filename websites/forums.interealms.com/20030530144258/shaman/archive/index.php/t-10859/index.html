<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K, I asked this before but my guild is telling me I'm wrong.  Here is the question:<br />
<br />
Is it a waste for me to get SCRM if I'm going to get the 8th shawl soon enough anyway?<br />
<br />
I have spoken with a few shaman and they all say that our buffs last the 70% duration but the enchanter in my guild and the cleric in my guild both swear that the benefits are capped at 50% on every spell reguardless of the shawl stacking with SCRM.  So they said get the shawl and screw the 8AA used on SCRM and throw them to something else.<br />
<br />
What do you guys say?  Go for the SCRM or use those AA somewhere else because it doesn't stack?  Anyone with SCRM and the 8th Shawl try testing the duration on spells with the shawl on and then with the shawl off and can confirm that the Shawl stacks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 8th shawl won't extend the length of torpor while SCRM will to 1800 hp consistently.  Do SCRM anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get the skill, it's not a waste.  AA's are retardedly(sp?) easy to come by now days so getting 8 wont take long and then getting more for other skills wont take long either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can remeber being told once that AA abilities stacked on EVERYTHING.  I agree with Geddar though, it is not a waste because the skill is good, and AA are easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think you can misspell (sp? :) ) retardedly as it is probably not a word. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What about on other spells?  Other than Torpor?  I thought all other buffs lasted 70% longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SCRM is nice, I cast haste or VoB and it actually lasts a while. Torpor is healing me for more than Canni V does in damage sometimes. Not sure if it depends on what portion of the &quot;tick&quot; you are casting it or not. <br />
<br />
Replenishment = 5250 heal over 21 minutes. Add 50% (no shawl here) and you get 7875 heal in 31.5 minutes. Dunno about you, but I used to be SICK of casting regen or group regen every 15 minutes back in the day. <br />
<br />
How many times do you cast buffs in your group? Let's assume there is no chanter, so you are on haste too. <br />
Focus<br />
Stamina<br />
Agiliy for the whiner who thinks he wil die if doesn't have a full buff box. <br />
Acumen for the blind human, erudite and barbarian and the halfling tank who thinks his sta going down will affect the outcome of the fight.<br />
Haste<br />
PE (glad I aint got it)<br />
Group sow/attk. <br />
Regen for you or group. <br />
Resists if needed (our MR and FR arent bad and our PR/DR own)<br />
<br />
Can't say enough positive stuff about the use of these 8aa points. Saves me headaches when buffs last a while. I would pay 50aa for 100% increased duration of beneficial spells.</div></div><hr />
