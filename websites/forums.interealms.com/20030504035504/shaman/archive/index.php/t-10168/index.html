<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I often fizzle this stupid spell like 4 times in a row before it finally starts casting.  Then, even with malosi in, the mobs almost always resist at least one wave.<br />
<br />
What level will this stupid spell become reliable?  It looks like an incredibly promising way to add DPS to my arsenal, but not if fizzles double its casting cost and resists half its effectiveness!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had evocation maxed when I hit level 55, it didn't fizzle much. Now at 59 it rarely fizzles at all. This is a great spell to use in places like PoD with one mob on the group...I like saying &quot;/g Nuked %T for 1620!&quot; if all three waves land of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Guess it's time for me to sit around and cast burst of flame for a few hours to max evocation (I'm sure it's not maxed right now).  That'll fix the fizzle part it sounds like.  <br />
<br />
But even with zero fizzles, the mana / damage ratio is terrible if only 1 wave hits.  It's about the same as ice strike if 2 waves hit.  It's really only good it if all 3 waves hit.  Then it's actually comparable to our DoTs and thus VERY nice.  I think out of about 15 casts of the thing so far, I've only stuck all three waves once. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">torrent is very nice if u have max evo., it rules for quick added  dmg in short  mob fights....i use it often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i still fizzle ToP occasional with a 210 evoc, but its much better after 200. If you were like me, and used your JBB too much early, and your evoc suffered as a result.<br />
<br />
I keep this spell memed in my exp groups, because mobs die too fast for dots to be effective, and is usually much more efficient than flat out dd-nuking. In fact, when i started casting this spell, we started killing mobs much faster. IMHO, this spell rules. After malo, 2 or 3 waves nearly always hit for me. It really depends on the mobs you are casting it on. Some mobs are much more susceptible to this spell than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't wanna hear any complaints until your evocation is 235.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You do need to max out evo and ToP is very situational.  In some spots it rocks, but you are always dealing with an extra resist check on wave spells.<br />
<br />
I was chain casting this on THO awhile back along with 2 other shammies on a raid and every frikkin wave hit, but for some reason frogloks in Innothule can resist at least one wave. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lvl60 ,evo maxed ,SCM2 ,i still fizzle some time ToP 2 time in row</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I feel ya, I was also hating life when I first got ToP. It does, however get better... much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">even it only 2 waves land, this is the most efficient nuke we get (... I think anyways, someone else can do the math).  I ALWAYS load this in xp groups, it does fizzle a lot, but now at 65 with  maxed evocation it isn't too bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With evocation at 197 I still see 5-6 fizzles in a row at times which is quite fursterating. I have tried while waiting to burst of flame myself, sometimes for over 15 mins, and I have never seen one skill up from it. I've only really seen skill ups from Ice Strike as I'll cast that in exp groups when I can't afford to fizzle all my mana away.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any suggestions on getting evocation up? I'm not really interested in spending 3 hours a night casting burst of flame on myself when I could be getting aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do your burst of flame practice when you're waiting for rez, looking for group, or just watching TV or something.  It does work.<br />
<br />
I set up a hotkey to stand up, cast BoF 3x, and sit down.  Then I can hit that one key to practice three times.  Works great while reading, surfing the web (with EQ in a window), or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Also, boost your wisdom - the higher your wis the faster you learn (most) skills. Maybe splash out on a KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Burst of flames while waiting on a rez or waiting for everyone else at a raid to finish buffing, I maxed out my evo that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I maxed everything out while waiting for those damn spires to go off.<br />
<br />
Even div.<br />
<br />
I am so glad for books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got evocation up to around 210 chaining burst of flame while reading a book.  Tried this spell again tonight.  Since I was pulling, I deliberately got 2.  Once ranger got agro, I backed off and cast this.  Bam!!  2160 damage - both waves hit both targets!  I'm now much less disgusted.  It still fizzles too much sometimes and it still has resist troubles, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Reading this thread yesterday inspired me to get evocation up since I been ignoring this spell.<br />
<br />
I started last night with 207 evocation skill.  Created a hotkey:<br />
<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 40<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 40<br />
/cast 5<br />
<br />
Loaded Frost Rift in spell gem slot 5 (was somehow conviced I got better skill raises with this than burst of flmae, which I tried for first 15 minutes)<br />
<br />
Then I hit my hotkey button every minute and a half or so as I watched a movie.  Skill raises went slow (around 220 Wis) but by the time the movie ended my Evocation was up to 224.  Oh, and got divination up to 210 from 201.<br />
<br />
/em shrugs<br />
<br />
I also used to cast spells while waiting at docks and spires...with the PoK books, you now need to dedicate special aside time for this.  I like to do it after big patches where I think game-play to unstable to hunt anything serious :)  Last night was perfect.<br />
