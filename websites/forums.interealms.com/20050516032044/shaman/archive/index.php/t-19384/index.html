Think this will drive up prices on chain on ornate (if / when this class gets that high)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually I'm hoping that now that they're adding in a 4th chain class maybe they'll increase the drop rates on ornate chain a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">chain makes sense, but now we will never see ornate stuff, and the ones that are for sale in the bazaar just quadrupled in price.<br />
<br />
WEEEEEE go shaman go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The odds of them retroactively changing drop rates on chain items in order to compensate for berserkers is very low.  Ornate and elemental chain will only get harder to get, but I doubt it will be a big issue.  It will be quite a long time before the number of high-level berserkers is on par with the other chain classes.  Just look at beastlords - I've been in two EP+ guilds, and both had a serious shortage of bsts.  I expect the same of berserkers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have to disagree, there will be a handful of 55+ bezerkers by the first weekend.  Those guys will be outfitted with ornate the second they hit 55.<br />
Really, did anyone not notice all the 50+ frogs the week after loy went live?</div></div><hr />

True, but how many do you see now? Just like any new class/race, there will be a ton of twink Beserkers running around and prices for gear like ornate will skyrocket. Then most folks will go back to their mains while a few will keep Berserker as their main and the numbers will stabilize back to be on par with everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Great news for my guild. I seriously doubt we will have many if not any Berzerkers in guild (we only have one Beastlord and one app). This coupled with 10+ Coirnav kills and 7+ Innoruuk kills that has only gives us one single chain BP, good news for us! More increased chain drops!</div></div><hr />
