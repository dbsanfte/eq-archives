<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got bane. I like it so much it's now permanently in slot 2. I love seeing my DoT wear off before the mob is actually killed, and furthermore knowing that it did 2500 damage.<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering however is if anyone has bought Anathema so that they could stack it with Bane. I know they do stack, but I'm wondering if it's efficient to do so and if it's really worth the mistmoore points that are charged.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has bought both please respond!<br />

This is my theory. Poison is just inferior. Aggro is way too high. So, I figure the best way to do damage for us shaman (In a raid scenario) is to first stack your 2 best disease dots. This gets a nice long term damage going. with a focus bracer or other BA4 item, Pox and Ultor stack for, on average, 275 per tick. These will last a long time, and just be your &quot;base damage&quot;. Then you start chaining Bane and Anathema. When all DoTs are active, assuming a BA4 item, you will do 1057 damage per tick. With the reset time of Bane and Anathema you cannot do what you once could with poison - which is time them and refresh right when they faded. However it is still theoretically possible to not miss a tick of the DoT if you cast quickly. Lets say that for every 12 ticks of anathema/bane (2 castings) you miss 1 tick.<br />
<br />
12 - 1 = 11<br />
11 ticks of Bane/Anathema + BA4 = 8602 damage<br />
66 seconds<br />
<br />
12 ticks of BoUltor and Pox + BA4 = 3300 damage<br />
66 seconds<br />
<br />
8602 + 3300 = 11902 damage in 66 seconds<br />
<br />
=<br />
<br />
180 DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually as it has been pointed out, the best way to do damage on a raid as a shaman is to chain tears of saryrn and a nuke. Instead of doing 8602 in 66 seconds you could be doing 12k or more easily even without crits/foci(and counting cast times, which you are not doing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rain spells are still severely screwed up. Not only are they unaffected by rizlonas and foci but they have a much higher resist rate. I dont give a rats ass what sony says, I've seen the difference, they resist way more than they should. FOr example, I can land 9 out of 10 Spear of Torment on dain for full damage, and get 1 partially resisted. Same with DOTs. Rains however get fully resisted 1 out of 3 and partially just as common.<br />
<br />
Theoretically  chaining the rains does more DPS. Then again, theoretically  Communism works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree wtih DoT stacking, lets not forget that you will use far less mana stacking those DoTs than just by chain nuking and raining (I know mana regen is not a problem, but while you're casting Q and Canni 5, you're not nuking, while with DoTs you can be doing other things)<br />
<br />
Heh if I had cast times and what not readily available without loading a website, I could do this better... however:<br />
<br />
For ease of illustration, I'll say each DoT takes 6 secs to cast, and disease lasts for 2 mins, and Bane and Anathema last for 30 secs. I'm gonna ignore assumed ticks and what not (or not... as the case may be)<br />
<br />
the whole imaginary senario will last 2 mins and 6 secs.<br />

<br />
So: <br />
142 DPS<br />
5.76 Damage/Mana<br />
<br />
Now what's not included are: 1 tick of Bane, 2 ticks of Anathema, and a few ticks of Ulthor.. I think Pox would have dropped on the last tick, or maybe a tick before.  Q would have finished healing you to full on that ammount of mana.  Were you casting C4 on the ticks where no casts happen, you could have recast Q a tick or two earlier, and you'd have more mana at the end.  There were no spec checks, no foci, no regen, and no mana regen, all of which would skew to make these numbers better.  Though I do feel this would generate HUGE agro heh, you don't need (in theory) more than 3K mana, or 2K hps to pull this off, hardly uber by any means.  I can't use rains on my server(RZ), so I don't know how cooldown/refresh is or how they would stack up in a similar model.  Can someone else do that? if not I might do it later, but prolly not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice tally Porgy!<br />
<br />
I also just noticed something. Thanks to the phantom tick all DoTs get, I was incorrect about timing your Bane/Anathema so that it is constantly going. In fact I couldn't be further from the truth - the reset time helps you time it. When your bane or anathema button pops back up, you know that you have 1 tick left on your bane. Begin casting then and you will continuously keep it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, I did that in the model.<br />
<br />
5 Cannibalize 4 casts could be thrown in. Which would have you recast Q earlier which would then have Q end at the 2 mins, and heal an additional 900 hps in the model, cost an additional 740 hps, and give you an additional 410 mana.  Pox does drop at t:114, losing you 111 damage off that total, which isn't super significant. It would also mean there isn't a 6 sec period of time in which you aren't casting something, which is kinda a lot of work, and definatly efficient.  hmmm... anyone know standing regen and mana regen at level 65? (with and without horse) we could add 20 ticks of that to the model, we could even assume different amounts of clarity (ie raid set-up) and regen, And don't for get this doesn't account for the DPS of our pet either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I chain cast BOTH my rains--torrent of poison and tears of saryrn.  They are low mana and very low aggro for fairly high damage, and remember you can get crits on them with spell casting fury.  If you're chaining both spells, you can get a fair number of crits in there considering you can get up to three crits per rain(no, that's not the kind of thing to happen often).  It adds up, and if the MT dies, you don't immediately get summoned like you can when you pile on DOT's that still have you high on the hate list and getting higher every tick times X number of DOTs that are still working.<br />
<br />
Even with my BA4 earring and higher level DOTs in the bag, I'm not that thrilled about buying those extra DOTs from LDON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blarg its hard to understand exactly what I'm talking about here until you have first hand Experience with bane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK... lets see if I can do this one too<br />
<br />
like above, no foci, no crits... the only trouble with this one is figuring out how to apply cann... we'll see what we can do. I'm not using Velium Strike as its longer than 6 sec cast time skews the ease of doing this (I'm not about to start figuring out partial ticks, and I didn't on the other one either).<br />
<br />
-06 Casting Tears of Saryn (-450 mana)<br />
** Damage: 0, Mana -450, HP: 0<br />
000 Tears deals 650 damage, Casting Torrent of Poison (-380 mana)<br />
** Damage: 650, Mana -830, HP: 0<br />
006 Tears deals 650 damage, Torrent deals 540 damage, Casting Spear of Torment (-380 mana) 675 damage<br />
** Damage: 1865, Mana -1210, HP: 0<br />
012 Tears deals 650 damage, Torrent deals 540 damage, Casting Tears of Saryn (-450 mana)<br />
**Damage: 3055, Mana -1670, HP: 0<br />
018 Tears deals 650 damage, Torrent deals 540 damage, Casting Torrent of Poison (-380 mana)<br />
**Damage: 4245, Mana -2210, HP: 0<br />
024 Tears deals 650 damage, Torrent deals 540 damage, Casting Spear of Torment (-380 mana) 675 damage<br />
...rinse repeat<br />
<br />
I'm not a nuker, I don't know when to stop to throw Cannibilization, or Q into the mix.  but that ad infinitum leads to this basic equasion:<br />
<br />
Damage = 675x/18 + 650x/6 + (540x-540)/6<br />
x = 1 second<br />
Mana = 450x/18 + (380x-380)/18 + (380x-740)/18<br />
x = 1 second<br />
<br />
so in 120 secs you would have done: <br />
28210 damage, for a total cost of <br />
8000 mana<br />
<br />
giving you<br />
~235 DPS at<br />
3.52 damage/mana<br />
<br />
this assumes an 8000 mana mana pool, but any HP requirement.  The best cannibalization could help would be to save you 2132 mana, at the cost of nearly 4K hps, which would also make you loose at best 1350 damage in that time, and if you throw Q into that, you're loosing another 2025 Damage, for a grand total of 3375 damage (assuming you're skipping Spear of Torment casts rather than Rain casts) this also saves an additional 775 mana.  but you'd still need a 6868 mana mana pool which seems very steep.  This doesn't account for crits, foci, or resists.  With the new numbers thrown in:<br />
<br />
Total Damage: 24836<br />
Total Mana cost: 6868<br />
<br />
giving you<br />
~207 DPS at<br />
3.61 damage/mana<br />
<br />
DoTs I think are more reliable damage, as it leaves you with more mana in a 2 min period in case something goes bad, but its obviously less DPS, but we knew that. However, nuking is only 62% as efficient damage/mana as DoTing.<br />
<br />
Barring any errors this should be acurate info.<br />
<br />
Heh, a combination of the two would be interesting to see... a model like<br />
<br />
Bane, Saryn, Torrent, Nuke, Saryn, Bane, Torrent, Saryn, Nuke, Torrent, Saryn, Bane, Nuke, Saryn, Nuke repeat at 1... though... that's less DPS, still high mana cost, and too much less than 200 DPS and you're at the highly efficient DoT model<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh... just so no one thinks I'm a Thott<br />
<br />
<br />
Neither senario can be CLOSE to kept up forever, the nuking senario would drop most people out of mana 30-45 secs in.  The DoT senario could go on for nearly 5 mins I think though on a 5K mana pool.  And 5.37 efficeny ratio is no where near Wizards, and 235 DPS doesn't really approach wizards either if they were just chain nuking.  I think the nuke senario would generate more agro as well. (oh yeah and with rain resists you wouldn't come CLOSE to that DPS, even with crits) These are both ideal mathmatical idyllic situations where no one fizzles or misses even a millisec of casting (especially on the rain one, the DoTs have a 4.5 sec cast time for the most part, meaning you could totally fit extra canni casts and stuff in every once and a while, but rains casting time is 6.0)<br />
<br />
Heh ok done with my disclaimer, Shaman don't need a nerf, and if you look at the 30 sec times on EITHER senario, its sadly highly inefficient.<br />

I get dual crits on Tears easy enough, and even with one crit and one resist, you are still doing full (non crit) damage.  I don't have bane yet, but will probably swap it for Pox when I do get it.  It's pretty satisfying when people say &quot;whoah nice crits&quot;, even though you aren't doing 6k.  People just aren't used to seeing a shaman crit nukes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got anathema.  It's got it's uses for sure, it's nice to drop on a mob you know is gonna live 30 seconds or more and be garunteed 1500 damage assuming it doesn't bounce.  That's a big assumption though.  My experience has been that anathema bounces more than Tears/Torrent, which would make sense since anathema seems to be magic based and the other two are poison based.  <br />
<br />
Another point to consider is that the rains do their damage in 18-24 seconds vs 30 seconds for the bane line.  Sometimes I have those 30 seconds.  Lots of times I don't, once Im done doing everything else I do.<br />
<br />
And Porgy, I don't know where you're getting your numbers from, but I can chain Tears/Torrent a lot longer than 45 seconds.  If I throw a cann4 in between each rain, I can keep going almost indefinitely.<br />
<br />
For opportunistic damage dealing (i.e., the mob is MR debuffed and has a life expectancy of &gt; 30 seconds) the bane line is nice.  Also nice in situations where you don't want to be hitting anything but the primary target.  For general purpose damage, though, like on boss mobs, or just big xp mobs, chain rains is where it's at for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is my theory. Poison is just inferior. Aggro is way too high. So, I figure the best way to do damage for us shaman (In a raid scenario)is to first stack your 2 best disease dots. This gets a nice long term damage going. with a focus bracer or other BA4 item, Pox and Ultor stack for, on average, 275 per tick. These will last a long time, and just be your &quot;base damage&quot;. Then you start chaining Bane and Anathema.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is incorrect, because as even your/porgy's numbers are showing dots do 180dps with full foci(or 142dps without) while the tried and true rains do 235dps without crits added in, while giving you much less aggro for the damage done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">rain must have some build in high resist, like 1 of 3 waves with super high resist<br />

long time ago I test my though pull 3 shroom and AE them with rain should yield more dps for same mana, but 1 of 3 wave alway resist half of time and end up less effeciency compare to DoT <br />

AE rains will hit my groupmates or raid buddies. that's something that verant has refused to fix. Aside from that, I have played around with AE rains while soloing some. And I have noticed that, even after malos, my rains are resisted about 70% of the time. I think this has to do with them being poison based, which seems to be resisted much more than fire(wizard ae's).

<br />
[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Numbers are just from math.  However, dropping a Cann4 between each rain lowers your DPS by quite a lot.  Also, I was dropping nukes.  But as you saw just 2 cannibilizations, and 3 Q's dropped the DPS by nearly 30.  Start cann4ing in there, and your numbers go down even further, and after that... why not use the safer DoT method?<br />
<br />
And just for reference, I'm not saying DoTs are *better* just more efficient.  Safer in certain environments.  Obviously its only effective to go 2 mins on super hard xp mobs, soloing, and bosses on a raid.<br />

And like the brilliant Meku has stated, on RZ (and other PVP servers?) I can't rain ever.  It hits my group and others groups.<br />

I once used rains in PoV one day when I was feeling froggy. Tribunal on all my groupmates and went to town with the 58(?) rain spell. It was great fun doing all that damage but Xeonio (cleric) was sure pissed about all the healing he had to do to all the melees.  :p <br />
<br />
I am sure rains are teh win, but unfortunately I picked the server where I cant use it. But rains are kick a$$ in pvp on a group of The Curse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why not use the safer DoT method?<br />
<br />
<br />
Safer in that they generate more aggro? <br />
<br />
What defines dots as being more safe compared to dd exactly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Aside from the obvious rain nerfs listed earlier, there are 3 other issues with rains (specifically in relation to group tactics as I am a group shaman).  1) They are DD and break root, so doing DPS while on CC duty becomes more of a challenge.  2) if you're like me and you like to get in the mob's face so that slow aggro doesn't ping pong mobs then the AE hits you too. Not much fun when you engage at 60% health due to canns and you also take a couple love taps from the mob. 3) mob positioning on adds, if the mob moves AE rain no longer seems to hit it, not a problem with anything the MA has a firm grasp of, but on adds it's a waste of mana.<br />
<br />
On raids, I agree.  With a properly debuffed mob on a blue server you're likely better off nuking from a distance with a ToS/ToP combo.  I don't like casting high aggro spells (other than slow) on raids unless we're beating on trash, which will be lucky to last more than 10-15 seconds anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, safety is generally why I do use the dots (or any dots) as they have the huge situational advantage of not waking up mezzed/lulled/pacified mobs.  Under those circumstances my options for doing damage are 1) dots, 2) 'instant' nukes, or 3) melee (/giggle).  Bane-type dots are the only remotely mana-efficient option then, since all my other dots take a minimum of 54 seconds to do full damage and the mobs rarely live that long, and our straight nukes are laughable.  In general though, the high bounce rate coupled with the long refresh time means I don't mem the Banes unless there is no other option and I know I wont need those spell slots for anything else for a while.<br />
<br />
As far as long term sustained dps as on boss mobs and the like, I've tried both the quick dots and rains, and I'd rather do rains at a projected 33% resist rate and low aggro than magic-based dots at what appears to be more like a 50% resist rate and medium aggro.  I'd have to parse some fights to see what the true real world resist rate is, though.  The resist rates I'm using here are guesstimates, not hard numbers.</div></div><hr />

shows a 69 sec recast, unless I'm just dumb about it.  Is that 69 ticks?<br />
<br />
Why are DoTs safer?  They don't break mez like a rain with, they don't take up your entire mana pool to keep going, you can stop DoTing to do other things with out killing your DPS, There are fewer casts against a mob which bumps you less on hate lists.  DoTs will generate more agro, but Taunt will take it back quicker and more safely than if you are continually dropping DDs.  DDs are safer for raids on a blubie server I guess, as long as you're killing one thing at a time... but if something goes down, you're gonna go down with it.  Unless you're sporting an 8K mana pool.<br />
<br />
Heh just for clarification, I was just putting numbers up, nothing else, I'm not level 65, I can't do any of that fancy stuff yet (only 56).  You wanna get DoT DPS up? stack poison on top of that as well, though I promise you'll get summoned.  Disease Agro is very low, MAgic Agro isn't bad either, I bet you'd get the same agro on those 4 DoTs as you would dropping Nife, and Blood.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">That Graffe thread cited above concludes after parsing that rains have a hard coded &quot;per wave&quot; minimum resist rate of 20% on a fully debuffed mob, i.e., that you will never do better that that on resists.  You can of course have a lot more than 20% resists if the mob is not debuffed, or is highly resistant to poison/magic as applicable, or if is high level relative to the caster.  This seems to match the gut level feeling I get that rains are resisted more, on average, than dots on a debuffed mob.  Subjectively, it seems like BoS is only rarely resisted after Malos, but seems like ToS waves are commonly resisted after Malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Mana pres works on rains too taraddar.<br />
<br />
I never said it didn't I just have a bracer of darkness which has a 30% dot only mana pres focus effect so Included 30% on dots since I was casting bane.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are DoTs safer? They don't break mez like a rain with,<br />
<br />
I'm gonna assume that your refering to multiple mob situations because a dot on a mob most definitely will break a mes on that mob.<br />
 they don't take up your entire mana pool to keep going, you can stop DoTing to do other things with out killing your DPS, There are fewer casts against a mob which bumps you less on hate lists. DoTs will generate more agro, but Taunt will take it back quicker and more safely than if you are continually dropping DDs. <br />
<br />
Not entirely true in my experience. A large potion of the aggro from our poison dots at least seems to be the poison counters and that aggro seems to be continous for the duration of the dot. Also the damage gerenated each tick is still generating aggro each tick. From personal experience I can chain cast velium strike or the poision rains potetially doing nearly double the dps of our poison dots and not get aggro. Stack both poison dots and i'll get aggro usually sooner rather than later and that with out average tank using an eb weapon and a second proccing aggro weapon (stuns or eb).<br />
<br />
DDs are safer for raids on a blubie server I guess, as long as you're killing one thing at a time... but if something goes down, you're gonna go down with it. Unless you're sporting an 8K mana pool.<br />
<br />
the major flaw in your numbers is ignoring mana savings effects and mana regen effects. From my own rough testing my ~6k mana pool is currently equivilent to about ~9k mana pool due to mana pres effects. I can cast the 1k mana imbue spells and it uses 10-12% of my mana pool. Combine that with the 100+ mana a tick i'm regening on raids not including cann v and mana for nuking is a non-issue. Heck mana in general is a non-issue. I can't remember the last time i went oom outside of mobs with a mana drain ae.<br />
<br />
<br />

So far I really like the new dots and have been using bane. Resist rate doesn't seem to be. Aggro is managable and it's a descent dps contribution. I can't wait to pick up a Burning affliction focus so I can improve it in addition to extending it, casting it faster and saving mana on it =)</div></div><hr />

Not sure what fantasy realm you live in where DoTs don't wake up mezzed mobs, but I wouldn't mind living there. Make a group with 2 nec, 3 shm, 1 enc, and dot/mez stuff to death with zero risk of any kind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think he's talking about the rain spells waking up the mezzed mobs around the non-mezzed target you're raining.  There are bosses who spawn mobs to protect them (e.g. Jiva, Degoruak Bloodwalker, Maareq the Prophet, RZtW, Xegony, Coirnav, etc).  Some of them you can still rain safely because their adds are usually mezzed far away from them, but with bosses like Jiva and Degoruak, they spawn pretty close to the boss and are mezzed quickly if your enchanters are on the ball.  Even though a nice rain spell would do a lot of damage on those multiple pulls during clearing in VT, I don't think the enchanters would like you much when they keep getting sent to their bind point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
their parse result are :<br />
-------------------------------<br />
160 Tears of Ro cast:<br />
3 waves resisted:  2<br />
2 waves resisted: 15<br />
1 wave  resisted: 67<br />
0 waves resisted: 76<br />
<br />
160 Tears of Ro cast = 3 x 160 waves = 480 total waves<br />
2x3 + 15x2 + 67x1 = 103 waves fully resisted<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting...<br />
<br />
So, to summarize quickly: <br />
Normal Rain (Ro) w/o debuffs:<br />
~22% full resist rate and some partial resists.<br />
Normal Rain (Ro) with debuffs:<br />
~22% full resist rate, no partial resists.<br />
Lure Rain (Arlyxir):<br />
~21.5% full resist rate, no partial resists.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
that is clear show hiden ~20% resist rate regardless of lure/debuff<br />
<br />
now look at new dps from rain after include ~20% resist rule :<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryrn  : <br />
damage : 650x3x80% = 1560<br />
mana : 450<br />
cast time : 6 <br />
recast :12<br />
cast time with 25% haste : 4.5 <br />
 <br />
Torrent of Poison : <br />
damage : 540x3x80% = 1296<br />
mana :380<br />
cast time :6<br />
Recast Time: 12 <br />
cast time with 25% haste : 4.5<br />
<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment : <br />
damage : 675 <br />
mana : 380<br />
cast time :4.2<br />
recast time : 2.25<br />
cast time with 25% haste : 4.5<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment with 20% damage focus :<br />
damage : 756 (average +12% damage as parse on wizard board)<br />
mana : 380<br />
cast time :4.2<br />
recast time : 2.25<br />
cast time with 25% haste : 3.15<br />
<br />
=============<br />
dps without focus:<br />
<br />
ToS + ToP : <br />
total time : 6 + 6 + 2.25 spell recast = 14.25 seconds per chain<br />
total damage : 1560 + 1296 = 2856 damage<br />
total mana : 450 + 380 = 830 mana<br />
ToS + ToP dps : 2856/14.25 = 200dps<br />
damage/mana ratio : 2856/830 = 3.44 damage/mana<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment :<br />
total time = 4.2+2.25 = 6.45s<br />
total damage = 675damage<br />
dps = 675/6.45 = 105dps<br />
damage/mana ratio = 1.77 damage/mana<br />
<br />
===================== <br />
dps with 25% haste(15% item, 10% buff) and 20% damage focus(20% damage = +12% damage average ) :<br />
<br />
ToS + ToP : <br />
total time : 4.5 + 4.5 + 2.25 spell recast = 11.25 = 12 second for 2nd spell pop up <br />
total damage : 1560 + 1296 = 2856 <br />
total mana : 450 + 380 = 830       <br />
ToS + ToP dps : 2856/12 = 238dps  <br />
damage/mana ratio : 2856/830 = 3.44 damage/mana<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment :<br />
total time = 3.15+2.25 = 5.4<br />
total damage = 756<br />
dps = 140dps<br />
damage/mana ratio = 1.99 damage/mana<br />
<br />
since mana saving focus effect both nuke or rain, so can ignore it for compare, now you have dps from fast damage, remember this fast damage can insert to your dot damage, eg :<br />
<br />
you cast Blood of Saryn and have 35 seconds free to do rain/nuke/canni, if you decide to do nuke then you can add extra 35x140dps = 4900damage(4900/1.99 = 2460mana), or 35x238dps = 8330 damage(8330/3.44 = 2420mana) for rain or just canni for mana</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
On our first real Fennin Ro attempt, we wanted to put out a lot of damage to get him down quickly.  So all the shamans whipped out their DoTs and cast away.  After our tank went down when FR was at 30%, who were the first summoned to him?  The 3 shamans on the raid.  He still died, but it sucked to get killed only after putting a couple DoTs on him.<br />
<br />
Shaman aggro is plain broken.  Any other caster-type class who can put out significant damage during raids gets a means of shaking the aggro.  Wizards get Spell Casting Subtlety and the Concussion spell.  Mages get Spell Casting Subtlety for their spells and their pets (i.e. their DPS) generate little aggro for their master.  Necromancers get Spell Casting Subtlety and can FD.  Enchanters get Spell Casting Subtlety and aggro reducing spells.  Not to mention melee classes: rogues can evade and escape and get weapons that reduce aggro, bards have Fading Memories, monks and SKs get FD.  Hell, even clerics get Atone and Pacify and druids get Harmony.  Paladins get Pacify and rangers get Harmony and their Jolt line of spells.<br />
<br />
The classes left over with no means of reducing/managing/removing aggro:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Beastlord<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
Which one seems out of place in that list?  There are those people who say &quot;But you get a lot of hit points and can wear chain!&quot;  Trust me, even with LR5, Fennin Ro and Xegony can still do a number on you.  Give Beastlords a semi-decent group HP/stat buff and you've basically made shamans an obsolete class.<br />
<br />
Clerics got a new line of useful spells in the LDoN expansion (damage mitigation ones) and we got a worthless indoor SoW and new DoTs.  When I heard that I had two thoughts &quot;1) Wow, I can solo PoFire mobs even faster now! 2) Wow, more spells I can't use on raids!&quot;<br />
<br />
What do shamans have to hang on to?  Our 75% slow (that's been around since level 51 and gets mitigated now) and Malos (unless one of the half dozen mages on the raid land a Malosinia before the 600 years it takes to cast Malos).<br />
<br />
Face it, shaman is a broken class and has fallen behind when compared to other classes.  Even though we can solo dragons and mobs in elemental planes, we're nothing but buff bots and debuffers on raids.  <br />
We're listed as priest class but are more like a caster class and we get the benefits of neither.  <br />
<br />
If you're in an end-game raiding guild, you may notice the only class with a lower number of members than shamans is beastlord (and maybe bards), and that's because beastlord (and bard) is still a relatively new class.  Four active shamans in a raid guild = closed recruiting for shamans.<br />

<br />
1. Give us aggro management.  I don't care how (AA, spells, a discipline).<br />
2. Cut the casting time of Tnarg's Mending in half or give us a faster casting moderate heal spell.<br />
3. Give us something that makes our pets worthwhile on raids.</div></div><hr />

Bard isnt new lol, but it is a lot of work being a good bard..and I'd hardly call beastlords new..been around a couple years now.

1) hard coded resist<br />
2) AE spells more likely to break mezz<br />
3) Moving mob doesn't take 2nd and 3rd round damage on rains<br />
4) Rain spells hit you too if you're too close<br />
5) AE rains are DD and can break root unlike Bane line.<br />
6) Rain spells hit group memebers on red servers.<br />
<br />
Most of this can be dealt with, especially in outdoor zones with proper positioning and aggro control, but still, even without the coded resists the best you're doing (AA factored out) is 640 a tick (you won't get DD and rain to land on the same tick).  With coded resists, that damage gets dropped.  Even without ancient scourge of nife I can beat 640 a tick easily with some canns tossed in (bane and BoN, but when I get BoS I'll beat it and not break root).  The advantage of the rains is the aggro control which is significant only on raids and in some PoP groups.</div></div><hr />
