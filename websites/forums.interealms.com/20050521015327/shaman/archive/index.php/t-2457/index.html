<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Narg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do you get upset when you're inspected in game? Have you posted your magelo profile?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Truthfully, it only annoys me when someone walks up and stands right in my face and does it, blocking my field of vision.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I could care less. Of course I am never obligated to stand there and let them complete their inspection. If I have to leave I just leave.<br />
<br />
Also, it annoys me when people inspect me and then try to buy the gear off me...if I was selling it, you'd be seeing an /auction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Inspections don't bother me.  Yes, I use Magelo to keep track of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=34738&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
Recently, I ported into GFay.  The very first line of text that I saw &quot;newb_dwarf is inspecting you&quot;.  Within 10 seconds he sent me a tell asking to buy my spear (Spear of Fate) because he needed a weapon really badly. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, it does not bother me to have someone inspect me without asking, as long as they do not became a bother. It is funny to watch some peeps get all upset because someone is inspecting them &quot;Without their permission&quot; hahahaha, it is part of the game, makes me want to walk over and inspect them &quot;Without their permission&quot; just to watch and listen to them freakout, hehehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't mind being inspected as long as it isn't during action or trying to solicit (sp) my gear. <br />
<br />
I do like to inspect other shammy for ideas for upgrades and alternate gear for raids etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya know what's funny...i've been doing this for a long time now and you'd be surprised at what happens.<br />
<br />
As soon as someone inspects you, inspect them.  99% of the time they run off out of range immediately.  It's weird...&quot;hey, what ya got there...no, you can't see mine&quot;<br />
<br />
But no, it doesn't bother me.  And I can't see why magelo is even related to this...when people inspect you do you just tell them the url to your profile instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It used to bother me before you could turn that message off. Now I never see it anyway so I dont care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bothers me.  Dunno why it just does.  I also have my stuff on a magelo profile, but the difference with that is I choose to put it there.  Bothers me in the same way it would bother me if someone in the street ran up to me and starting staring at everything I was wearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I honestly cant remember the last time I was inspected without being asked first - unless it was an accident.<br />
<br />
I love magelo because I can plan upgrades and be nosey :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Random thought: You could put your Magelo URL in the little inspection text window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What inspection text window? I assume I am missing something here (have inspect turned off as I get annoyed when I accidentally inspect other people when trying to con some mob etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&gt; What inspection text window?<br />
<br />
When you are being inspected, roughly in the area where the inventory panel would be there is a box where you can put in text that people inspecting you will see. I made some character backstory for mine back when I was level 10 or so...<br />
<br />
Since the servers are down I can't check how to set the text and it's over a year since I last checked mine.But if I had to guess it's something goofy like turning /inspect on, going into a third-person mode and inspecting yourself - in that case the inspect-text box is probably editable.<br />
<br />
As for being pissy over being inspected, why we had a rant about this on our server boards just a couple weeks ago. I couldn't give a rat's arse about being inspected except for the fact that the almost inevitable follow-up is &quot;can I have some plat&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of course with being bound in the firepot room now, I wind up in the newbie cities more and sometimes I manage to accumulate a beg tell before I even finish zoning. Given the timezone I play in (GMT+12) is pretty much dead, I dread to think what the density of beggars is like in US peak....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Correct, you inspect yourself and there is a little editable text box where your inventory slots would normally be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes it does bother me because i seem to have the luck most of the time i get asked to sell something and or the person has to stand right in my view to do it. If people would just stand out of veiw and quietly inspect i might not mind as much when they dont ask. Just yesterday was playing my newb monk and got inspected by another monk like 3 times in a row which followed with can i buy your cot's. I'll give ya some nec gear and 189 bonechips. Kinda left like from waynes world where his ex Girlfriend gave him a gun rack since i dont even have a necro. <br />
<br />
  Had another guy follow me around the zone because i kept moving on him each time he tried to inspect. He even went so far so to invis so i couldnt see him trying to catch up to me lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I turned the message off, so it no longer bothers me.<br />
<br />
From a RP perspective it probably SHOULDN'T bother you, because, hey, you're wearing the armor, they should be able to look at you and see it.  But it always did because the message made it seem like they were STARING at me, which is rude.  Without the message, I couldn't care less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It annoys me when someone inspects without asking.<br />
<br />
Probably for two reasons.  I have this 'personal space' hang-up in real life and when someone inspects me it feel like they are standing too close.  Second, they are skipping that small, pleasant ritual of courtesy that is exchanged when someone asks. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I never did care honestly. Inspect me, don't inspect me, whatever. Just don't make a nuisance of yourself by telling me how ghetto my gear is (I know that already), how your twink has better (I don't care) or that you really, really need item_x and that I should give it to you. <br />
<br />
I did turn off my ability to inspect others, though. It was annoying being ML during a raid and inspecting everyone instead of looting corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Inspect don't bother me. I hate inspecting others when I dont want to though, thus why I keep /inspect off at all times until I want to turn it back on spacifically to inspect somebody.<br />

As far as Magelo Profiles. Yup, always use them.<br />

A lot of times I hit /duel on them, and they run away.  Sometimes they think they're smart and run far away and accept the duel.<br />
<br />
Unlucky for them, I have a 45 druid on another account, heh.<br />

Keep em rooted for a while, then when they beg you not to kill em, pox em.<br />

Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a few nice items that I've picked up, but that doesn't mean I'm rich (ok..I'm a moron and have 160+ alchemy).  beggar_01 thinks that since I've worked hard for 54 levels that he should share in the lewt.<br />
<br />
I don't wear my gold watch in bad neighborhoods..and I go /anon and move around a lot in Gfay..it's all the same idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not bothered at all, unless its 40 messages/second and im trying to do something important (root incoming mobs, slow the current 8 in camp...) and i always have it off unless i specifically want it on. /inspect on and /inspect off are on Socials to accomodate me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I just ignore them,  if i'm sitting still someplace long enough for some newb to inspect me, there is probably some reason for it, so I just ignore whoever and go about my business.

See what I mean?  Handy feature :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I wouldn't mind people inspecting me without asking if it wasn't for the inevitable question, &quot;Got any items I can have or pp you can spare?&quot; Anyone who takes the time to ask me has never been turned down. I do occasionally ask myself, particularly of higher-level shamans, so that I can see what other shamans are wearing. I like having a magelo profile to play with too. It lets me see the effects of different gear combos. I like checking out other shamans' profiles as well. It's almost like window shopping. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">My text window says &quot;Nosey little f**ker, aren't you?&quot; minus the asterisks.  It's kind of amusing how offended rude people get when you're rude back to them.  <br />
<br />
People who ask are advised to ignore the text, and usually thanked for being polite enough to ask.  Just because our toons spend much of their time indiscriminantly killing and ransacking corpses for profit is no reason for them to be uncouth.  Yes, even the ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Lol, I do the same as a lot of you.<br />

1) Eqini (iirc) message set to FALSE.<br />
2) /duel<br />
3) Ignore them<br />
<br />
Course with Luclin out and me away from the game for two months, I feel behind. Inspected an Enchanter and didn't recognize 75% of her items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Half the fun for aquiring loot is to flant it, I see no reason to get angry over being drooled over.<br />
<br />
Just turn the inspection message off and say something witty when beggers send you a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I myself wish there was some way to flag please don't waste both our time asking to inspect, just look already!!<br />
<br />
I really find it hard to believe that there are that many people randomly inspecting you just for begging. 75% are accidental...15% like the look and are curious...8% looking for ideas for themselves...and maybe 1% will beg after inspecting another 1% want to buy something you are wearing. (you want to buy something I am wearing, sure, that will be going rate x 2 )<br />
Most of these beggers are alts in reality and have plenty of money...guess how they got half of it?<br />
<br />
Most beggers don't inspect, they just look at level and assume you have money...or look at your level and can tell without inspecting that you have money.<br />
<br />
Anyway, people who make a big deal of it piss me of, lol<br />
<br />
I like Flufy idea though...gona make mine say &quot;I hope you didn't waste our time asking permision to inspect!! &quot;</div></div><hr />

Geeze don't waste my time asking for permission.  Is it polite?  No.  It isn't like you can stop a person from TRYING to inspect you.  It is a feature and people can do it.  So do it already.<br />
<br />
Beggers don't look at my equipment and ask for stuff.  Beggers do a /who all 40 60 and then start giving tells.</div></div><hr />
