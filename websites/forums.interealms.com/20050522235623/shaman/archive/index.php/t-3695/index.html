<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just for a goof I made myself an Ogre Shammy alt last night, midly twinked. I get him to lvl 3 and run over to Innothule Swamp to bind in Grobb to do some barshing there (better newbie area IMO). I go to the Soulbinder and get squashed by some jackass NPC named Gargh. Seems he doesn't like Ogre Shammy's. Whatsupwitdat ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Troll beasties hate Ogre Shammies (similar to the fact that the Ogre in the arena in Neriak hates us) I found that out the hard way too. There is another on the other side of the clearing named Jargh or something like that who hates us as well. Invis works fine to get past em to the bank but its very iritating. (both red still at 37)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Blue at 55, runs at sow speed. I almost didnt make it out of there alive. Luckily nothing assists him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, found this sucker a while back just after I made 36. Was bound way up in Iceclad and figured on just using the bank real quick like before I loged for the night. Knocked me back to lvl 35. Lol, can you say one really, really unhappy Ogre. I don't mind being KOS in some of the out of the way areas of Neriak and Grobb, but come on, right next to the bank and the Soul Binder? These guys should have been placed inside the Shamy guild. I really feel sorry for the young Shaman who can no longer bank in one of the 3 non-KOS cities open to us. I have a lot of fond memories of the swamp and South Ro and it would have just sucked to have to run back to Oggok to bank. Oh, well; /rant off. Good huntin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grishnaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have been KOS in Grob for about a year now =)<br />
<br />
I got killed by Jocka one time when that damn skellie was spawned for the grobb cleaver quest.  Ever since then I have been killing the trolls when ever I can....Troll slayers...Zimbittle, Guards...you name it.<br />
<br />
I was trying to solo in there the other day, but the guards inside have some insane magic resist.<br />
<br />
Grishnaka will be happy when Grobb has been razed to the ground.<br />

<br />
Funny how the opposite is not true... Troll Shamans are dubious to Ogre Shamans.</div></div><hr />
