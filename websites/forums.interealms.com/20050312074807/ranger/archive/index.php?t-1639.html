<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howwl</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally got to ask a few questions, second from the last.  Was worried I wasn't going to get called...<br />
<br />
Scott Hartsman, one of the developers answered the AC question, and touched on others.  Baellish (I'm sure I didn't spell that right) was also there, and one other guy I can't remember the name of.<br />
<br />
Regarding AC Softcap:<br />
His answer was basically that AC is made up of four components internally (yes he said four).  He said there is no hard number entered anywhere for a softcap.  He said he could see where one or two of those components might not add much after a certain point, but it wasn't coded with a specific number.  He also made the comment that various components might be more or less effective against different mobs with different attack.<br />
<br />
He did specifically stress though that it did not work like Wis/Int where after a certain number you get reduced returns.<br />
<br />
This jives with the theory that the softcap is entirely relative to the mob you are fighting.  1100 AC might give diminishing returns vs. Fungus Mushrooms, 1000 against Sebilis frogs, but you might still not have enough at 1400 when you get hit by Tormax.<br />
<br />
Other questions:<br />
<br />
Will Rangers/hybrids receive some attention during caster rebalancing?<br />
Short answer: yes.  Longer answer... he phrased it in such a way that I got the feeling hybrids were low down the priority list, and wouldn't get a ton of attention, but he did say yes they would be looked at.  I specifically pointed out fizzle rates for level 60 hybrids, and they indicated they didn't know there was anything abnormal there, but they would keep it in mind.<br />
<br />
High-end weapon rebalancing (i.e. the Rogue/Warrior upgrade where Rangers weren't ugpraded):<br />
The short answer is: they didn't really know that some class might have been left out.  He did specifically write this one down though (Freem peeked at his sheet afterwards), so they may have a look to see if we were left out accidentally.<br />
<br />
Longer answer (this was touched upon for several questions): they have totally revamped how the developers interact with each other, and they are using a new method for communication and interaction for the Planes of Power expansion.  They hope by this to avoid things like Epics with totally different utility or power for different classes, or other things that totally don't match up.  He mentioned that this was something they were also doing for on-going development, and as such, he would pass this through the same system and see if somehow Rangers were neglected with the weapon buff.  The interaction/communication thing was also brought up with regard to caster balance.<br />
<br />
Archery auto-attack:<br />
Same answer as Dallas.  Yes they think it's a good idea.  Yes they'd love to do it.  But it falls lower on the priority list than lots of other stuff, so it's not going to happen right away.  He said it's probably three weeks worth of work, so it's not totally trivial to implement, and as such, won't be done in the near future.<br />
<br />
Hitting mobs in walls:<br />
Same answer as Dallas.  It's a core engine problem that can't easily be fixed, and won't be for some time.<br />
<br />
That's all I can remember at the moment.  An &quot;official&quot; transcript of all the questions will be posted on Caster's Realm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh...  How can it possibly take 3 to 4 weeks to fix archery auto-attack?  Wouldn't it be pretty much the same code as melee auto-attack?  They're trying to say that the two are so different that it will take them a month to do it?  Doubtful...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howwl</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah they also said that the code for archery elevation (above/below) was very messily hard-coded somewhere and would be difficult to change without some messy work.<br />
<br />
He made no excuses, he said that some of the code would really surprise you on how inflexible it can be, given some of the assumptions the original developers had made when the game was first written.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elwin</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm four components to AC. All I can think of are Avoidance, Mitigation, Level and Class.<br />
<br />
My guess is the supposed 'AC Softcap' is, as was always said, based on each individual mob you are fighting. No matter what your avoidance AC is, a moss snake can hit you. It certainly will miss a lot, but it can still hit you. This is because there is obviously a minimum chance to hit involved, and it can still hit you for max damage regardless of your mitigation. That's a pretty rough way to show the existance of diminishing returns past a certain AC rating and level vs. a certain creature's ATK rating and level, but that's really all the proof needed (for me at least).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information, Howwl. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great info, Howwl! And the fact that they actually jotted down the weapon balancing question is a good sign, to me, at least. That indicates that someone thought that item was sufficiently interesting that they better make note of it.<br />
<br />
Folks, after having worked in software development for over 20 years, you would be surprised at what some programmers do in code, especially when they are under stressful tight deadlines.<br />
<br />
I recently had a colleague that I respect put together two Java beans that are used for file transfers within this configuration management system that we work on. One bean is simply a wrapper around an XML document DOM tree to extract information about possible locations for this file, protocols allowed, and all sorts of other miscellaneous details. The second bean uses this data to actually perform the transfer. As it was originally written, it would have required me to write driver logic to connect the two beans. I asked why this was done this way and the response I got was a nice &quot;Duh! That was dumb, wasn't it?&quot; <br />
<br />
The person in question wrote a defect report against their own code and then fixed it in the very next development cycle. Now the XML descriptor bean is contained inside the file transfer bean and all I do is construct the bean with a minimum set of initialization data (URL to get the file transfer document) and then tell the bean to transfer the files described in that document. The only thing I get is either an exception if something went wrong or execution continues with the next statement.<br />
<br />
But that is an example of what programmers will do when facing short deadlines with seemingly difficult problems. It's very common in the industry and I am sure that every programmer here who has more than a few years of experience can think back to code they have written that, in hindsight, they realize should have been done differently.<br />
<br />
So cut the developers some slack. This is an industry-wide problem. It's affected by a large number of technical and human factors that go way beyond what is appropriate to discuss here.<br />
<br />
In my personal opinion, the EQ code base has held up quite well over time and performs pretty darn nicely. Yes, I get irritated too at things but let's not get upset at Scott Hartsman. He gave us an honest estimate and that helps explain why it's farther down the priority list.<br />
<br />
Personally, I greatly appreciate that candor. It also gives me a realistic assessment of our chances to get archery auto-attack implemented (small, but not impossible).<br />
<br />
I am really encouraged by the new lines of communication in the developer community there. Hopefully we won't have classes left out of weapons upgrades in the future, or more Frontier Mountain Moss Covered Twig fiascos.<br />
<br />
Professionally, I remain pretty impressed with the development team at Verant. I think they fail to fully utilize their test server players to assist them. And I also think that their customer service is pretty bad (but I've seen worse). But the dev team itself seems pretty knowledgeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muvandog</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some other responses from the Seattle Fan Faire:<br />
<br />
250 archery skill cap for rangers:<br />
<br />
The reply was something along the lines of, &quot;Rangers are the indisputable masters of archery, and Rangers are looking pretty damn good right now overall,&quot; implying to me that this change was not a very high priority, if it is on their list at all.<br />
<br />
Elemental damage on arrows:<br />
<br />
Something to the effect of, &quot;it's working, it's just really hard to see that elemental damage due to the way it works.&quot;  When pressed with &quot;but we have logs which show no max hit above the base arrow damage max hit,&quot; the reply was something like, &quot;Hrmm, yeah we've heard about that.&quot;   Doesn't sound like they believe this is a problem (or a priority).<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I've kinda thought the same thing actually. Just because archery is a class-defining ability (or semi class defining, at least. let's not turn this into a debate over what our class defining ability is, please :P) doesn't mean it should necesarilly cap at 252. A rogue's backstab skill only caps at 252 with the 12 percent mod on the Bloddbath (more on this later). The fact that warriors share our archery cap doesn't impress me much either. They don't get the most of the rest of our archery-related skills (Trueshot, AM3, EQ, Eagle Eye, etc.) so it's not really much of a comparison.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they could *partially* kill two birds with one stone (the other bird being the Luclin ranger weapon problem) by putting a 5 percent archery mod on the Light Woodsman's Blade and putting a reasonable proc on it (even giving it no proc at all would be preferable). Yes, I know I'll never see this weapon and neither will most of us so this won't put the vast majority of us at 252 archery. The vast majority of rogues will never have 252 backstab either so it seems somewhat analogous to me. We have bigger issues at hand with archery and even though this would be a much easier change for them to make than the more important stuff, our skill cap itself isn't an area where I'd consider us &quot;broken&quot; or whatever. Give those extra 12 points of archery to the uber kids who get a Light Woddsman's Blade as a little bonus. The rest of us do fine at 240 skill, especially if they get around to fixing the real problems.<br />
<br />
Edit: grammar</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilara</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never understood why archery was left capped at 240. I recall reading somewhere that warrior and ranger piercing was capped at 240 so there would be room for rogues to be better at it. Silly answer, but okay.<br />
<br />
By that same line of logic though, why wouldn't rangers go to 250?<br />
<br />
As for the archery elevation thing, I'm old enough to remember when there was no such restriction.  As I recall it was done to prevent someone from standing atop a wall or tower and shooting down on mobs who couldn't path up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vann</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">great post. I was also hoping they would add something in about our bows and the lack of after primal at the high end game. We are still stuck with 33/35 bows while weapons keep advancing bows have not. So maybe they will address that with lack of weapons. Another thing I am wondering about is the magical dmg portion on those acrylia tipped arrows. are they broken or working as intended.</div></div><hr />

Also I got a very different story from the guy actually doing the coding than the tradeskills guy about the arrows.<br />
<br />
They're recoding everything and will get around to fixing the Acrylia arrows eventually, they are flat out broken from what I was told from the guy recoding everything. Also, he'd love to put in Archery-Autoattack and a real minimum damage hit /calc on Archery.</div></div><hr />

Hmm four components to AC. All I can think of are Avoidance, Mitigation, Level and Class. <br />
<br />
check here:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/forum_flat.html?mess_num=16087&amp;page_num=3<br />
<br />
If the formulas in this thread are accurate, the 4 factors they're speaking of would most likely be agility, defense, AC from buffs and AC from equipment. Avoidance and mitigation are both derived figures.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oops, there would be a fifth factor using these formulas, whether or not you are a pure caster. Anyway, this still seems like the most likely explanation for what they were talking about. Unless they just have no clue what they're talking about, of course :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue of mobs with portions of their body in the wall is old and they knew about it long long ago.  It is hardly respectful of us players to have them saying that this is something that will take a long time to fix because it is so complex yet they won't/haven't given us any feedback as to whether they have actually begun work.<br />
<br />
Frankly I hate archery having to pluck arrows at mobs to do damage but if they are going to factor our balance of the game into this then they need to fix it and not with some open-ended future date because they don't want to get into the mukity muk of complexity here.<br />
<br />
My boss came back from Seattle fan faire and he also stated that these questions had been asked.  He stated that the developers said something about some spells not hitting mobs that are partially in the wall.<br />
<br />
He also indicated that someone asked about nerfing ranger archery due to the fact that one person on Vallon Zek was able to take out 5 darkie casters.  I'd say the darkies were stupid and played irresponsibly.  I gather that there were some comments about archery and melee being nerfed on pvp as pvps spells do something like 62 % of their damage casters felt it was reasonable to have melee do a similar amount.  I can see them changing archery to do a percentage of damage on pvp but not melee.<br />
<br />
There was some comment I gather about how cleric melee being ineffective after a certain skill level...meaning that their damage doesn't reflect their skill level after a certain skill level has been attained even though that level is higher.</div></div><hr />

Man you hit the nail on the head there.  So many times I've been pushed and rather then make things happen in the best most flexible way I hardcoded factors.<br />
<br />
There were also times when I told the powers that be to leave me alone and get away from me so I could get the job done and did it my way, the right way.<br />
<br />
As well, though, there aren't alot of excuses for putting so much effort into other areas that aren't of such import for fixes.  Prioritizing is important and Verant seems to fail in this department miserably.</div></div><hr />

I mean come on in the pure aspect of physics we should recieve a bonus to archery when we shoot from an elevated position. This fact is unarguable and is often taken into consideration when designing military strategy. In the same respect however, they would have to implement a penalty for shooting &quot;up hill&quot; again its a simple matter of physics. Do i ask for to much?</div></div><hr />

They're working as intended, it's just that the amount of damage they do is variable.  So maybe they'll get fixed if they are truly broken but they don't seem to realize they are, at least their tradeskills guy doesn't.<br />
<br />
Do not go to Absor for much information if you go to the Boston Fan Faire (I may go).  Not to knock his personality, he seems like a nice guy, but  he consistently gave the answer, &quot;I do not know&quot;.  I personally asked about Warder's protection stacking and got that answer and to send an e-mail to the spell guy (Lawrence Poe I think right?).  <br />
<br />
And then I asked if rangers could have a smoother transition in archery as you level and become more powerful until you get all those aaexp points and do melee damage numbers through archery.  I was hinting at adding a damage bonus that scales to archery as well as a lowering of trueshot by a minute or two every level past 55.  I got the same answer, &quot;I do not know but it should be possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
I should have headed to the developers and producers workshop in retrospect.  And also I had more questions that I forgot or could not get to at the Fan Faire (like archery autoattack).  But I was happy with the Fan Faire overall and it was a pleasure to meet all my guildmates and old friends from Mith Marr.</div></div><hr />

Since they dont have a systemto calculate higher skills then 252 I belive our new eye archery buff line spells whould become useless if they raised cap. If the theory that the eye buffs increase skill cap ( I have yet to see anyting that speaks against this) is true. So if u have 240 archery and eagle eye up ur skill is at 252 at least to my understanding is this how it works now.</div></div><hr />

I should SUE them for creating things in the game that causes pain in my hands from constantly pressing buttons. :)   2 things come to mind.<br />

I don't know their code and haven't seen it but how hard can it be?  You have a function that is called when a user hits the archery button to shoot an arrow.  Ok we have that routine.  It is done and functioning. <br />
<br />
Now just make a new sub routine that loops forever calling that same dam fucntion.  With a check on every cycle to see if it is clicked off and exit the loop.<br />
<br />
void ArcheryAutoAttack(void)<br />
{<br />
 while(1)<br />
  {<br />
   if(Check_For_Auto_Attack_Off_Click()) break; // Easy<br />
   Call_Archery_Attack_Function();      // This exists already<br />
   Call_Archery_Delay();  // This exists already<br />
  };<br />
}<br />
<br />
there is the code :)  all done.<br />
Took all of 15 seconds to code.<br />
<br />
Don't buy their line of crap about 3 weeks to code it..  Such a joke.  They just dont want to do it because it will make us Rangers life easier and maybe be considered over powering.  But hey they are the ones that gave us archery mastery and endless quiver.  If they didn't want us using a bow then why give us these skills.<br />
<br />
They need to STOP lying to people.</div></div><hr />

Lol. You oughta send that code fragment in to them, maybe they just haven't thought of it. Oh, and you ought to change it so that it doesn't just do archery autoattack. It'd be inconvenient to not be able to do anything else, including redraw the screen, while archery autoattack is in effect.</div></div><hr />

Are you saying I mis-quoted him, or what?  I'm quite certain that I paraphrased exactly what he said, because I made him repeat it to the point the guy behind me got annoyed and told me &quot;yes he already said that three times&quot;.<br />

[I recently had a colleague that I respect put together two Java beans that are used for file transfers within this configuration management system that we work on. One bean is simply a wrapper around an XML document DOM tree to extract information about possible locations for this file, protocols allowed, and all sorts of other miscellaneous details. The second bean uses this data to actually perform the transfer. As it was originally written, it would have required me to write driver logic to connect the two beans. I asked why this was done this way and the response I got was a nice &quot;Duh! That was dumb, wasn't it?&quot; <br />

Same answer as Dallas. It's a core engine problem that can't easily be fixed, and won't be for some time. <br />
<br />
Really?  I'll fix it right now for them.<br />
<br />
1) There is already a subroutine that detects whether or not you can hit a mob partially in the wall with melee.  We know this because we can still melee mobs that are partially in walls, yet if we have a mob targetted and it's sufficiently thru the wall that it's on the other side, we can't melee it.<br />
<br />
2)  We know EQ can calculate the range from you to the mob.  It has to do this every time you fire an arrow anyway to make sure you are within bow range.<br />
<br />
3)  We know EQ can tell when you have a clean line of sight to a mob for firing arrows.  i.e.  &quot;You can't hit them from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
So each time you fire an arrow, if you have a clean line of sight to the mob (use the same check they use in #3), instead of your character being at current range from the mob, the function internally would project your character forward to within melee range (via #2) and see if a melee hit would have landed on the mob partially in the wall (use the same check they use in #1).  <br />
<br />
So If you could have hit the mob with melee if you were in melee range even if it was partially in the wall, you have a clear line of sight to the mob, AND you make a successful archery check, then the arrow hits the mob.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should go work for Verant. =P</div></div><hr />

It's pretty easy to cast stones at programmer estimates, especially if you haven't done a lot of programming.  Once you begin to work on systems bigger than your senior design project you begin to develop an appreciation for just how expensive some of the hidden complexities in any code system can be.  The simplest things to the layman user can translate into unbelievable complexity for the developer.  Been there done that.<br />
<br />
Simple problems your simple solution fails to avoid:<br />
<br />
Did you want the user to be able to actually DO anything else, like turn, move, type, recieve tells, open inventory, etc, during your while() loop?<br />
<br />
What happens if the user clicks AutoArchery, but is already AutoAttacking?<br />
<br />
What if Call_Archery_Attack() doesn't exist as a routine now, but is instead all wrapped up in Call_Attack(), perhaps with some hideously creaky reliance on global data which has been worked on and debugged over the past 5 years to the point that it is working now, but will require a lot of time and testing to replicate and/or rewrite entirely to support the new function?<br />
<br />
What if someone opens the trade window?<br />
<br />
What if he runs out of ammo?<br />
<br />
What if he casts a spell?<br />
<br />
etc etc.  I could go on.<br />
<br />
My point - don't be too quick to jeer at programmer estimates.  Sometimes they actually do know what they are talking about, and the young, clueless hotshot with his first compiler really CAN'T do it faster, and the older but equally clueless management type really CAN'T make development easier with &quot;synergy, training, and focused resources&quot; or some other equally inane drivel.<br />
<br />
I personally think the VI developers do an amazing job.  I shudder to think what would happen to my own company if we had to push out a formally QA-ed, full tested version of a several million line software product every 2-3 weeks.<br />
<br />

Game coding is a f------ nightmare in many respects, from what I'm reading sounds like they're doing an ok job. <br />
<br />
Archery is the iconic ranger ability, wether it defines the class or not is a matter of balance. Arguably, anything that's clearly emblematic of a class should have a concurrent association with game play. If it does, it's a pretty sensible situation and wouldn't be exceptional. Not having it be that way is what's exceptional to the game framework.</div></div><hr />
