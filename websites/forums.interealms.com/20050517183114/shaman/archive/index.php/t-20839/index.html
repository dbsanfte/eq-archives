<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tikast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone.  I just recently returned to EQ after a long time out of game, left pre-POP, so I have a lot of catching up to do.  I've decieded to come back as the class I've always wanted to play, a Shaman.  Of course I just had to make a Frog shaman as the concept of playing a Sebalis-boy was just too much to pass up. =)<br />
<br />
I recently hit level 31, almost 32 now, and have a question regarding specialization.  What should I choose as my primary school of specialization?  I was thinking alteration, but just wanted to see what would be the best school for us shamans.  I plan on to solo when I can, once I get the pet, as well as group with some old friends, so really I'm going to be doing both.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help and advice, and I look forward to being a part of this community!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome! If you're planning on grouping and soloing, I reccomend Alteration as your specialization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alteration, no matter what path you go, this will be your most used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I jsut let my specs go up by how often I used them.  Alteration easily went over 50 before anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tikast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks everyone.  I figured Alteration would be the way to go, but just wanted to confirm it before I went over 50 with it.<br />
<br />
Look forward to chatting with everyone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">meh I went conjuration, I dont usually feel the need to save mana on buffs when killing stuff. (dots are conjuration right? been awhile since I had to care) yes you end up spending more mana over the long run but you spend far less when it really counts, in battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">conjuration does effect dots.  however alterations effects buffs heals and debuffs so overall alot more of what a shaman does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With mana cost for malos/turgurs and buffs, for shaman alteration is pretty much a slam dunk.</div></div><hr />
