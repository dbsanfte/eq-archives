<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daggoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about PLing a 3rd char to bot with myself &amp; the wife. What would be the best 3rd party member? We are both low 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">paladin for plate tanking , mid heals and good taunt ?  <br />
<br />
or mage for extra damage , DS's , nukes .....<br />
<br />
or druid for personal tp's , healing , nukes and Ds's ....<br />
<br />
Pal would be my choice , they combine well with shms for a good healing lvl and can tank/hold aggro well . past 55 you will probably go hunt in pop , and a monk will not be a sufficient tank anymore ....<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hm... hate to say this... but druid.<br />
<br />
Druid provides additional healing, snare, DoTs, buffs, teleporting ability, damage shields...  would compliment yer team well.<br />
<br />
Pally would be good choice too, if only for plate tank, stuns, and rez ability later on.  Good healers, too.<br />
<br />
Druid or pally, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I might suggest a chanter bot for ease of play, just use for haste, crack and mezes.  Before POP I would have suggested a porting bot, but it's a heck of a lot easier to get around these days.<br />
<br />
Purdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The key element isn't just who would be the &quot;best&quot; third person to add to your group - it also matters the &quot;ease of use&quot; if you are going to be two/three boxing. Some of the options presented (druid, enchanter, paladin) are all good - if you had someone playing them all the time. Trying to play a shaman and one of those other classes at the same time would result in a significant drop in their usefulness. Particularly in relation to playing a melee. <br />
<br />
I would suggest adding a mage. They are more limited than some of the other options, but all you have to do to play the mage is sic the pet on the mob, and occasionally nuke. That gives you more time to concentrate on your shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mage, Wizard, or Ranger, IMO.  Especially if you're going high end.  All 3 provide impressive damage, wiz/rng provides snare, wizard has ports, and mage pet provides an offtank if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shadowknight<br />
<br />
yes an SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Paladin.<br />
<br />
A good tank, and has buffs that stack with shaman buffs.  Plus when things go wrong you have your own rezzer.  90% rez on demand is nice.<br />
<br />
They actualy arent difficult to 2-box -as long as all you want them to do is tank.  attack on, cast a stun or two and swap back to your main character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I play a SHM, MNK and DRu as mentioned above. It's great. There are times I want a tank (SK/PAL) and that would be a decent choise too but I always have no trouble finding one...<br />
<br />
Paladin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The thing you would be looking for with that combo, is a healing type class that doesn't sacrifice DPS.  Two gimp healers, make for one good healing squad.  From best to worst for your setup imo.<br />
Druid: Buffs... more hit points for you Monk!  Pot9 manna/hp regen for later.  Two secondary healers is a good combo.<br />
Mage&gt;Necro: DPS... and heals for their own pet.  A mage/necro can effectively keep his own pet healed, leaving you to save your manna healing the monk.  A mage can cast malosini, as the shaman casts slow making for faster slows on pulls, and less aggro.  This would probably be better than the druid, if not for one thing.  Buffs.<br />
Paladin:  Similar to the mage option in that the Paladin can heal himself to a lesser degree.  You lose DPS, gain some mitigation, some buffs.  On the downside, you lose your monk tank possibilities.  If you are three of you pooling your funds together, you can probably get the monks gear to a point where he can tank similar to a gimp Paladin.  <br />
<br />
The downside is your monk will have a hard time staying up in Tier 2+ zones.  Hopefully, you can convince a tank class to join when you get to that point.  Tank, 2 adequate healers (shaman included), and a monk for dps makes for a good team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bah, I could have just wrote, what Sorell said :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll go with the flow here -- druid or paladin.  the auxiliary heals and buffs are good, DS is good.<br />
<br />
Monk will eventually regain agro from paladin unless you switch over and throw a stun in every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hybrid plate tank + shaman + dmg <br />
<br />
is a power trio , i love it.<br />
<br />
paladin + shaman + monk  ...would be my reccomendation</div></div><hr />
