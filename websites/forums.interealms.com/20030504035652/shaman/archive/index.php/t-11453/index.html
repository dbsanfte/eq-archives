<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Stoicism, Regrowth and Canni will get you from full hp/no mana to full hp/full mana in 7 1/2 minutes at L53.  This assuming 1571 hp and 2070 mana, which are approximately what I have at 53.<br />
<br />
Stoicism, Regrowth and Canni3 will lower the time required to 6 minutes and 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
Question I have is how this stacks up against the various Chanter buffs.  Anybody know how long it takes to go empty mana to full while sitting with KEI?  Clarity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So you completed the Stoicism quest?  Care to share the details of it?  I have the empty flask, but was told the turn-in was broken.   Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, I used a spreadsheet and templated out the sequences involved to come up with the numbers.  I added a 10% fudge factor to make sure that the projections weren't too optimistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well KEI is 14 mana regen per tick, so you do the maths :) <br />
<br />
Stoicism, Regrowth and Canni3 is way better, but your fudge factor may not be big enough as Canni3 fizzles so much.  Also you need to remember KEI works whether your fighting, running or whatever where as with the Canni route you need to be standing still and casting constantly to get the regen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">KEI would take 12:48 to regen mana fully from empty.<br />
<br />
So from this I take that Stoicism/Regrowth/Canni is actually substantially faster at the cost of more actual effort to achieve.<br />
<br />
Another way to look at it is that it takes 12:48 for KEI to produce 2060 mana, however there are no limitations on your actions during that time.<br />
<br />
Stoicism/Regrowth/Canni produces 2060 mana in 7:30, however your entire effort during that time is dedicated to producing this result.  Meaning that you are totally limited during that span of time.<br />
<br />
Interesting trade-off.<br />
<br />
And I appreciate the feedback on Canni3.  I haven't hit 54 yet and I'm guessing that I'll stick with Canni if Canni3 fizzles more than 10% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah why choose either or. Once the stoicism quest is working I fully plan to use kei, stoicism cani and regen. Heheh I will be a mana regening fiend and dang it I will LIKE it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dont get me wrong Canni3 is better than Canni, but does fizzle alot more compared to Canni.<br />
<br />
Also I agree with Kaid,,, You cant have to much mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, the level 54 spell fizzles more than the 24 spell?  ;)<br />
<br />
This is to be expected, when I was growing up I was worried that I would have to rely on Cann2 because of the &quot;horrible fizzle rate&quot; of Cann3.  I've been using it for a little while now, and it does fizzle more, but not to the extent I've heard about.  Plus, a fizzle takes less than a second if you're paying attention, and there is absolutely no mana cost... so a fizzle here and there doesn't bother me at all.  The positive (better cann) is much greater than the negative (slightly increased fizzle rate).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The models I'm using return 275 and 328 mana per minute using Canni and Canni 3 respectively.  They also fluctuate between 1500 and 1000 hp's during the process,  not dropping into levels that might trigger pain aggro from things the pet is fighting.<br />
<br />
I can post the chain patterns if people want, however this is likely to be a long post.</div></div><hr />
