<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juneau</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering if anyone can give me any info on which mobs to speak too to start trials in PoJ (Lashings and Execution to be specific).  Ive read a bit about Exe, but only seen Lashings mentioned in passing type thing.  Any info on where to start, and maybe what to expect would be helpfull.  Dont want walktrhoughs or strats, just starting points and where to begin with preparation.</div></div><hr />

When you get to their room, there are six of them standing around on a platform. Each one is named identically, The Tribunal. Target one, and say &quot;I am prepared&quot;. It will give you  a bit of text that tells you which trial that particular member is controlling. When ready, say &quot;I am ready to begin the trial of XXXX&quot; (at least I think that is the phrase) and it will port your party into the room to begin the trial.</div></div><hr />
