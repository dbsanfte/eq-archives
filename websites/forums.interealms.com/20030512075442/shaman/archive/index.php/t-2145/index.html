<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>F15E0476</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have info about the new armor that is out?  I have seen warrior (steel warrior armor) and paladins wearing new newbie quest armor i guess.  I don't know if this is really new or not haven't played in a month.  But i was wondering about if we had similar quest to i got a barb shaman on the PvP server i was thinking this would be good for since i don't have the money to get him stuff.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are the quest armors in twilight. And they would be ok if you didnt have Hate or SoV quest armor yet. But at the same time they are nothing to jump for joy over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Over a month ago, VI added new mobs and quests in a few newbie zones (true newbies, lv. 1-15---not the Luclin twilight armor).<br />
<br />
Examples--In Misty Thicket there are many new mobs (Drakelings, Fruit Bats, Undead Halflings, etc.) for Cleric, Ranger, Paladin, Rogue, and Warrior armor.  The stuff is class and race specific.  In Nektulos, new orc camps dropping pieces of stuff for newbie dark elf armor.  Same thing in East Commons, lots of new newbie drops.  Quests geared for lv. 1-15 or so.  Decent AC for those levels and has stats (str, wis, sta, etc).  These quests similar to the Vah Shir newbie armor quests that were released with Luclin.<br />
<br />
That said, they did NOT revamp all the newbie zones.  I have heard that Barbarians, trolls and ogres got nothing (future patch?).<br />
