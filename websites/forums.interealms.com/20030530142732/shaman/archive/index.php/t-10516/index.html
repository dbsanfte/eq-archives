<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
<br />
Have just spent about an hour looking at all the Shaman duo posts.<br />
<br />
Did not find one that mentioned the Shaman/Shaman duo possibility.<br />
<br />
Is this a crazy idea?<br />
<br />
Anyone have any exp playing with another shaman.<br />
<br />
Sure would appreciate any input.<br />
<br />
Plan on playing a froggie shaman with a friend.  We both want to play the shaman class.  <br />
<br />
So just wondering if there are any major drawbacks to this combo?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Foz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Now that DoTs from two players will stack with each other, I think it would probably be pretty efficient. I'd still rather duo with a class that has high DPS like a Mage, Ranger, or Monk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Diversity provides so much, you are actually limiting yourself in a lot of situations.<br />
<br />
For a real world example, imagine how much a groups perspective would increase if say...<br />
<br />
The Aryian Brotherhood had a couple Jewish members...it would probably become a skeet shooting club instead of shooting Americans. Or...<br />
<br />
The NAACP had a couple Mexican members...it would probably start sponsoring Festas instead of discriminating against whitie!<br />
<br />
But I digress...<br />
<br />
You could probably have alot of fun if you are creative and don't mine trial and error. However, you would probably end up limiting yourself on content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It will work but its not a very good duo.  It is better to have two people of different classes who compliment each other's abilities than two of the same class.  Shamans can do a lot of things very well, but one thing we suck at is damage.  Thus, we're better off partnering with a class who does a lot of damage, but is not very self-sufficient.  Hence, the traditional shaman + monk duo, as well as many others.</div></div><hr />
