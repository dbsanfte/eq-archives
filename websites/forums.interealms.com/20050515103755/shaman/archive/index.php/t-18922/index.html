<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well they made some more changes to the new GoD spells.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to make of the changes to the slow.<br />
<br />
It now looks like this:<br />

They reduced the slow % to 55%, reduced the cast time to 1.5, reduced the duraction to only 7 ticks, increased the recast time to 30 seconds, changed target type from unknown to single, decreased the mana to 150.<br />
<br />

<br />
No thank you. Increase the slow %, increase the duration, lower the recast down to something reasonable again and then maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Exactly.  Why would I use a Slow that if resisted I cant immediately (or almost) recast.  Im not suicidal enough to trust my groups welfare to the Random Number Generator vs. a mobs resist score.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, without the crazy recast time, that actually wouldn't be horrible for LDoN.  Well, hopefully it's still under development. :\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The BST version is also 55%. Either they just copied the BST spell over to ours and didn't up our slow % or they are smoking something.</div></div><hr />

Game Description: Sickens your target with a fever, causing #3 damage initially and #2 damage every six seconds for %z. <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also they changed the proc on the new Pet AA from a dot to a 75 DD.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can see what they are trying to accomplish with the new slow. They seem to be aiming for a LDoN slow. Quick cast, less resist but they don't want to see this as the slow of choice outside LDoN. Lower slow % and short duration would make it just a preslow for other encounters but in LDoN would likely be the primary slow. The 30 second recast has to go though. And 7 ticks a bit too short even for LDoN. I am glad to see the target type get listed as Single instead of Unknown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Frankly, turgur's is as high a % slow as anyone is ever going to get.  It is already extremely powerful, if even a small increase in percent slowed would make it exponentially more powerful (80% slow would be a 20% improvement).  That being said, I am not surprised that we are not getting an upgrade to it.<br />
<br />
This slow, imho, looks awesome and I can't wait for it.  How many times have you bounced one turgurs and then had to wait for it to refresh, then had trouble channeling it through an unslowed mob?  Happens to me all the time.  The vast majority of my deaths in exp and ldon groups come from the exact situation I just described, and this slow (in its present form) will help immensely.  If you bounce turgur's, just cast this.  55% is a good enough slow that you can easily survive (even on hard mode), and it slows it down enough that you can easily channel a turgur's, root, or tnargs.<br />
<br />
Looks to be a great spell, as far as I am concerned.  I would much rather have this than an upgraded dot or nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any lucy expert care to comment on the change on Talisman of Alacrity from Groupv1 to Groupv2?  I'm not sure what that means - your group only now, maybe?  I know a lot of people don't use that spell all that much, but it can be nice to haste a raid in a pinch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I don't think the resist mod is enough currently to fill that role. Sure the quick cast and resist mod would make it easier to get off but its far from unresistable and the refresh on it means it's a slot eater and you still have to have another slow also. If they want this to be the back up or lead off slow they need to put a bigger resist mod on it. Otherwise i don't think i'll be using the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with Jin, a super fast slow like this would be huge.  Are you guys nuts?  Can't you see what this would do?<br />
<br />
This would be a tremendous spell for us.  Man, I hope it goes live.<br />
<br />
I see Taraddar's point about a resist mod.  That would make it a much more viable recast slow if turgurs bounces, but I'd still use it as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lower the recast totally, i already dont have enough spell slots lol but other than that it looks cool, maybe little doggie may actually dent mobs now lol instead of it been 1% and me still having to finish it for him after 5mins  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wait a second...  you mean SOE is actually doing something different with our slows?<br />
<br />
BOUT BLOODY TIME!!!<br />
<br />
I have always said that abilites like slow should be more varied (much like heals are).  Fast casting low%, AOE (that actually lands on the targets), PBAOE (hey, a troll can dream can't he?),reduced % slows with increase resist modifyers.  Heck, maybe even some creative stuff like really fast casting 75% slows with a resist mod for 60+ mobs and a +500hate modifyer and looooong recast timer (Raid target slow.  Sure, you can slow that mob NOW, but you gonna die for it =P).<br />
<br />
Ok, some of these are just silly, but really... If our class is going to be geared around slow, then give us slowing options.  If my heals are sub-par because I am supposed to work around slow, then for the love of god, make the spell more flexible.<br />
<br />
Or, if they are hell bent on claiming that we are build around our mana regen (hence why our mana costs are so high), then give me options there.  Give me a self only passive mana regen that doesn't stack with canni.  I can regen a little mana while I am busy, or sacrafice the passive regen to canni for a while.  The penalty of switching too often is the time lost casting the spell.  <br />
<br />
Or give me a canni over time.  You could balance this several ways.  One way could be make it have a less effecient hp/mana conversion rate to make up for the extra time we get to cast other things.  Or, make it not stack with regular canni.  Or make it last pretty long (like 1 minute) but can't be canceled, and doesn't stack with Q.  Or heck, do what you did with Torpor and slow/snare my butt while I am passivly converting mana.<br />
<br />
Something.  If my class is manuvering around a single spell type, shouldn't we have options for said spell type?<br />
<br />
That's what they do with every other class.  Chanters get varieties of mez.  Clerics a HUGE varieties of heals.  Necros can dot on any resist line.  Wizards have many different ways to nuke (resists, speed, mana effeciency ratio etc.).<br />
<br />
If we can not get upgrades to our general abilites to at least be *decent* at the other things we do, fine.  Then make me good at the things I am supposed to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my heart is racing on that one. anyone want to bet that they are going to come out and say, &quot;hey guys, sorry for the wait but this was intended to be a 60% haste group spell&quot;??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hell no I don't see the benefit to this spell.  Unless you have a super anal bard or enchanter pulling (and WHY?!?) you're likely to get more than 1 in camp.  You think a 30 second recast is going to make up for the .2 seconds faster casting?  (I have spell haste for turgurs).  That leaves at least 1 mob unslowed for 30 seconds waiting on recast.  What about resists?  All I can say is . . . hell no.<br />
<br />
Some might argue for memming both turgurs and this piece of crap spell, but I'm already limited enough on spell slots, thank you very much.  Not to mention the duration--most of the time our fights are going to last more than 42 seconds if we're talking about a 2nd mob in camp (or more!).<br />
<br />
So far, I think our choices of spells are best described by the word . . . CRAPTACULAR!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah I like this definetly, the dot is still crap, but now we have a LDon friendly spell. The 30 Recast sucks if you got 2, so I guess turgurs will have to be up too. At least for our &quot; one trick&quot; we now have more ways of doing it. So in short this is very encouraging.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok, those changes have to be a big screw up.<br />
<br />
Otherwise they made changes so that the new  Beastlord and Shaman spells not only slow for the same percentage but that the only difference between them is that ours adds on more counters and theirs costs half the mana.<br />
<br />
And 30 sec recast? If ya get a resist It's quicker to get malos off and cast turgurs. Not worth it unless the add in a few extra spell gem slots.<br />
<br />
Bleh, I'm not even gonna bother looking at these AA's until beta is over.</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of the 1.5 second cast.  If *I* got to make up my perfect LDoN slow it would be:<br />
<br />
Lvl 65<br />
1.5 second cast<br />
300 mana<br />
Last 20 Ticks<br />
Slow 70%<br />
-30 MR<br />
Instant repop (2 second pops with all other spells)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Once again let's not get all pissy with SoE before the votes are all in.  Who knows they are probably giggling at SoE headquarters right now while they screw with all the false data going out.  They did it with LDoN and PoP if folks remember they were throwing out false spell info and what not up till the release.<br />
<br />
Said it before I'll say it again.  No point getting all worked up over what might at some point happen maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If this were an AA skill then yeah, not bad. As a spell: utter crap. My Tugur is already at 2.1 second cast time, AND if I get lucky I will have a backup right click. Just how is this crap better? I rather keep up Malos than this. I don't have the luxury for an extra spell gem.<br />
<br />
In the current game enviroment this sucks. I can't say about GoD, but in LDoN and PoP we doing fine with Tugur already and in LDoN Tigir is nice. Resists are not a big issue in LDoN, they are in pop. Recast on Tugur is. Speed of BST slow is.<br />
<br />
We need a slow that combines:<br />
(1) Speed of BST slow.<br />
(2) Efficiency of shaman slow, hell, I'd gladly trade 5% for neg50 MR adjust.<br />
(3) No recast time bullcrap.<br />
(4) negative resist adjust.<br />
<br />
Someone ring the clue phone at SOE and tell em to buy a clue, hell I'd pay for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously, I have no idea where they're going with this one.  But, with most buff spells, v2 usually denotes stackability.  Stacking haste perhaps?<br />
<br />
Imagine the group/raid spam:<br />
Haste dropping<br />
(half second later) haste dropping!!!<br />
no! chanter haste dropping<br />
now shaman haste dropping<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">v2 usually denotes stackability.  Stacking haste perhaps?<br />
<br />
I think it would cause an outrage followed by chaos an rioting if they changed toa to a v2 haste (different from group v2 btw. See the Bard's Ervaj haste line of songs).<br />
<br />
That would mean would could haste haste people as much as 100%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit.. just though i say i happy for beast to get this slows.. i just want shaman to get a better. a 75% slow with a fast cast and recast and low resist would be a nice u/g at 65. (or one that does 80%) or one that stacks with another slower for a total of 80% so ours does 75% then beast or enc or bard slow can add up to 80%, then you want both types in a group no? and only shaman have the slow that can be stacked with.</div></div><hr />

HAHAH you are out of your F'ing head. You honestly believe that Bane should have been a 2.1 second dot that costs 40mana with a 2.2 second recast?  That does make me giggle like a little school girl I admit.<br />
<br />
My point was that why start crying about changes before they happen?  Though I certainly agree with you Stygiana, they certainly should give us back our HEX!!!<br />
2.1 second<br />
2.2 second recast<br />
40 mana<br />
420 damage / tick for 7 ticks = 2940 damage total  (73.5 damage per mana)<br />
<br />
That does make a lot more sense... they need to quit nerfing shaman!  I so wish Stygiana were on the dev team to balance out shaman :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the giggles Stygiana :) much appreciated.</div></div><hr />
