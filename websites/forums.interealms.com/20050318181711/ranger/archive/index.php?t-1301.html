<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramas</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My friends and I are looking for some new stomping grounds.  We have been hunting in CoM since level 40 or so and need a new place to hunt.  Our group consists of a 52 Ranger, two 51 Paladins, 51 Druid, and a 52 Cleric.  Sometimes a 56 Enchanter or a 54 Shaman will group with us.<br />
Any suggestions on where we can go to grind out the next few levels.  Preferably someplace that has mobs nearby that I can solo as I am online more often than my friends.<br />
Been considering the Hole, but it is way out there at the end of the world.  Also has anyone hunted the Giant Fort in EW for xp.  I was running through there and they were all blue to me at 52, a friend said they were all 50 or 51.<br />
Any suggestions would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Both give decent exp if you are constantly pulling and killing.  Both are underutilized on my server.  Burning Woods has plenty of blues, your party could clean up at the giant fort there for several levels.  Skyfire has some good points to it as well.<br />
<br />
Velious - Kael has plenty to keep you busy, your group might be able to make the arena home for awhile.  Soloing is a lot tougher there than animal ridden zones.  Lots of competition for that camp usually.  EW is going to Light-Blue out on your party real soon.  You can solo there for another level with a few dark blues around.  The giant fort will keep you happy for a level or two, Max.  You might want to explore the Wakening Lands and further on.<br />
<br />
Luclin?  Scarlet Desert is good for your group for several more levels, you can solo to your hearts content there, scarlet cheetahs especially, search until you find a good camp spot, lots of roamers.  Your party can do the tribals to at least the mid 50s  Bind in Katta.  <br />
<br />
Old world?  Sol B, Bats and Bugs.  Permafrost, the bear pit and Ice giants.  Neriak guards.</div></div><hr />
