<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there is a nice how to find and disarm traps on Safehouse but what about a list of remedies for the traps that DO go off?  Could we get a thread with trap &quot;cures?&quot;<br />

Acid Spray   is cured by Nadox in one cast.<br />
<br />
Had one last night that I could not get rid of.  Sand Storm (iirc)  Cast RC1 twice and Nadox a few times.  Any one know what cures that dot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In general, go with the icon of the effect to find the cure.   If it has the same icon as your poison or disease DoTs, chances are good that Nadox cures it.   Otherwise work with RGC and RC first to attempt removal.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Excpect most things to require curse cures.  There are a ton in this game now.<br />
<br />
  If you don't want to run it by icons, remain in windowed mode with lucy.fnord.net up on a screen and you can type in the name of the effect.  Then just see what kind of/amount of counters it pops on you.<br />
<br />
  Sand storm is a DD, so I can't help you with the specific DoT you had last night atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://lucy.fnord.net/ check what kind of counters the dot have and the apply the correct cure, can't get any easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sand Blast is magic but RC1 did not take it out after 2 casts.  Is there just a percentage chance to have RC work on magic effect?  <br />
<br />
Lucy lists the duration as 30 mins.  It did not last that long, but it was not removed after the last cast of RC1.  I was under the impression that magic effects had a percentage change of being removed but did not have counters like other dots.<br />
<br />
Could someone explain how this works without being an ass.<br />
<br />
Why do some people feel they have to make themselves look cool by trying to make other posters look stupid?  Just answer the freaking question if you know the answer or add other information without the commentary.</div></div><hr />

cure doesn't wipe out the dot, it still takes the<br />

anyone confirm this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My understanding of Radiant Cure is just as you have said:<br />
RC 1 removes 9 each curse, poison, disease counters, and has a *chance* to remove one detrimental effect.<br />
<br />
RC2 removes 12 of each counter and has 3 chances to remove detrimental effects.<br />
<br />
RC3 removes 16 of each counter and has a 6 chances to remove detrimental effects.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the chance of removing detrimentals is, but for me with RC1, it *seems* around about 50%.<br />
<br />
Lucy is an invaluable resource when it comes to spell data, but it's not the be all and end all - sometimes it isn't the whole story, sometimes hearing from personal experience helps. And sometimes, people haven't yet learnt about it, we all have to start somewhere. But I didn't see the previous poster trying to make you look stupid. He was a little blunt, but was still informative.<br />
<br />
I think all dot's have counters, and all cures take<br />
off a set number of counters. Thus even with a<br />

cure doesn't wipe out the dot, it still takes the<br />
counters down, thus speeding recovery. Can <br />

<br />
A lesser cure can remove counters, and so cure a dot over several casts, but my understanding is that unless all counters are removed, the dot will go for full duration, there's no part-way thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lot of &quot;Acid Spray&quot; Traps in Mistmoore, Blood of Nadox clears it up in one cast.<br />
<br />
The way we'd do the traps is I'd start casting nadox, then the person working on the trap would do thier thing, and hopefully that would get it  quickly after we got hit by the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blood of Nadox = Group CURE Posion/Disease (removes two shots of 9 counters from each)<br />
<br />
Well I have used Blood of Nadox to cure Acid Spray after getting killed by it the first time I got hit.  And basicly use it for any Trap that goes off so far.  As it cures both Disease and Poison in one cast so no double guessing if you should try to cure disease or Poison.  It also helps to dispell those stupid slows the mobs cast every once in awhile.<br />
<br />
<br />
So far we have....<br />
<br />
Name             Icon               Cure             #Casts<br />
Acid Spray      Poison             Blood of Nadox       1<br />
(?Boil Blood?)  Boil Blood         Blood of Nadox       1<br />
<br />
<br />
(?Boil Blood?)  Spell I'm 90% sure I cured with Blood of Nadox as it was only up on us for one TICK as I cured it as soon as I saw it land.  I didnt even have time to look up to see the name of it.  Just saw the same icon that boil Blood uses.  It was not boil blood though as it was doing about 200ish damage that one tick it was up.  I probley would not have even tried to cure it if I had not already been set to cure Acid Spray if it landed.  We were just cleaning up the dungeoun at this point so figued I'ld burn the mana for the heck of it as it couldnt hurt.<br />
<br />
Anyone else know of any?  Oh as side note those chests have a HUGE Area of Effect.  Walls though seem to block the effect like Mob AoE's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Also got plague mites in mistmoore. Took 3 casts of Blood of Nadox to remove :( I feel bad for groups without shamans haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Boil Blood is magic based, with buff counters that can be dispelled, but not &quot;cured.&quot;  Almost every new DoT is either a curse or a poison/disease.  I haven't found any of them that can't be cured with PR/DR or RGC.  <br />
<br />
One thing about this new expansion that I am really looking forward to is the ability for people everywhere, with a little hard work, to get their hands on a copy of RGC!!!!  Before, this has been almost an unattainable dream.  The research drops are spotty and unpredictable, as well as being rare, and the spells themselves out of reach unless you happen to be in the one to three guilds raiding Rhag1/ArchLich at the time in your game when you need it.  <br />
<br />
I never got my copy, and frankly despaired of getting a copy.  Copies selling for 200kpp on my server, what kind of madness is that?  Meanwhile I get treated as a second class priest on raids where you NEED RGC?  It bugs me that I have a character with close to 200 AA points, decent gear, elemental flagged, and he can't even get a copy of a spell from a 2 year old expansion.  <br />
<br />
RGC was simply too rare.  And it won't be cheap in LDoN.  According to what I hear, it will cost about 800 points.  Today I did 5 successful missions on Normal (they go faster on normal, dont need as solid of people) and got 255 points for my efforts.  A couple more days of that and I can finally afford a spell I have been needing for quite some time. <br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Disinfecting aura works on most traps in MM too<br />
<br />
I found even RC2 has little effect on the traps... <br />
<br />
good news is words of apparition seems to drop frequently in MM.. Maybe I can finally get RGC without having to spend a boatload of points to get it<br />
<br />
Spell: Remove Greater Curse<br />
Level Needed: 54<br />
Components: a piece of parchment, a quill, part of yaeth's compendium pg. 73 (right), words of apparition</div></div><hr />
