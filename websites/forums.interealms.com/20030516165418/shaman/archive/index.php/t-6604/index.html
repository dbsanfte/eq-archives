<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TrollKrunsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After doing all the parts up to Rak, i got a 2nd opportunity to get Tear MQ, and it went smooth this time. <br />
Had to do alot of faction work to get to Max Ally since i didnt turn in tear myself and skipped hole part, but i did it. <br />
Took me (after doing all parts up to Rak in CoM) 2 Ghiosk books turn ins, and i think 10 'marr' and 'envy/woe' turn ins, and 10 Drunken Shaman turn ins, to reach Max ally. Gave doggy in water my scale..and TADAAAAA the long awaited Spear of Fate :)<br />
