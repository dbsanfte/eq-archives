<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...any good shaman quests been found yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There arent many quests at all.  Not what I was expecting.  Well, so far.  Maybe as we get flagged we can get more quests.  But their are no shaman specific ones yet other than handing in the planar barb armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I'm very disappointed with PoP. No Alchemy recepies, nothing really &quot;woo&quot; ish other than gnomish collapsable tradeskill items - and no gnomish collapsable alchemy bags or potion bags? Boooo. (Am I the only one who carries her around to combine things for guildmates?)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, a gnome just gave me a collapsable spit, just because he asked if I wanted and I told him I had just bought malo and couldn't afford it. Such a sweet person :) Sometimes, people surprise me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The whole expansion so far seems to have quite a few quests, but not many shaman specific quests.  You will prolly need to get flagged way beyond the initial 5 or so zones offered in the expansion before finding some of the better quests.  Just keep in mind no one thought Kael/SS had any quests either for months after SoV released. :)</div></div><hr />
