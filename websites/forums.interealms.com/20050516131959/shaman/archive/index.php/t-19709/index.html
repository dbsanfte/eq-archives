<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got the aa as soon as I logged on. What a disappointment and waste of 5aa's. The Elite Puppie Zerg Force, EPZF is no more. Only 2 dogs get summoned. Are they more powerful? Maybe marginally, but they got owned in 30 secs vs  the first green con mob that attacked me...and it was slowed. They aren't semi-transparent like the &quot;spirit&quot; call pets, they were opaque, looked like a couple of self buffed rangers attacking the mob, tanked like em too. Blah,blah, oh--and you can't circle a mob with 2 friggin dogs.<br />
I don't even want my 5 aa's back..I just want to be able to toggle the aa off so I can use the original aa-at least then I have some pushing power.<br />
Take my only 'fun' aa and jack it all up. Anyone know if the next rank is 5 pets or is it 2 dogs and a rabid chicken, just to piss us off?</div></div><hr />

The 2 pets did a total of 3000 damage (well, actually 2960something but I forget the exact number)<br />
I didn't know they proc at all.<br />
I went back and checked how much damage the old spirit call did when I parsed it.<br />
The old pets parsed out at about 750 damage each over the minute.<br />
The new pets parsed out at 1500 damage over the minute.<br />
The old spirit call from first impression looks to do MORE damage than this ****.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I brought Spirit Call IV earlier today, and tested it against a (fairly deep) green scout in Dulak. Normally, these are no problems for either plain vanilla dogdog or Spirit Call III. Indeed, with SC3, you can run around getting aggro and letting the wolves finish off a couple of mobs.<br />
<br />
With SC4, the (two) wolves died in a few hits, confirming that 250 HP theory. They did manage to hit for 135 or so, but the scout was still at 60% by the time the second went down.<br />
<br />
After gating back to PoK, I /petitioned, asking if I could have SC4 revoked even if it meant losing the 5 AAs, on account of the wolves only having 250 HPs.<br />
<br />
Within a minute, I got a reply back from a GM (on Venril Sathir), confirming it's a known bug and has already been reported to Sony.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, the wolves will be a fair bit more resiliant at the next patch!  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I just want to repeat, I am moderating this thread (or any thread where we are lucky enough to have a Dev comment on a shaman issue) very very heavily.<br />
<br />
A lot of us have wanted SOE representatives to stop by and chat about shaman issues for a long time. I want to ensure a very friendly, welcoming atmosphere for an SOE representative.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of different forums to complain, Crucible threads where SOE devs post are not those places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well, today I finished off ASC2 and used it a few times in both LDoN and soloing in Natimbi.<br />
<br />
The &quot;old&quot; Spirit Call used to have the old Burst of Flame graphics, which has gone - although the wolves still pop out in quick succession. They double for 135, although possibly more slowly than the normal wolf attacks, as they weren't constantly in their attack animation as True Spirit is.<br />
<br />
Before they poof, they seem to cast a spell, much like the wizard swords do. They don't /shield or enrage, unlike the previous Spirit Call pets (which were just clones of the normal pet). They proc (although I'm not sure for how much); the message is:<br />
<br />
[Thu Feb 12 15:51:32 2004] A mastruq warfiend staggers from a venomed claw.<br />
<br />
Unlike Beastlord pets, you don't get a &quot;soandso`s pet begins to cast a spell&quot; type message before they proc.<br />
<br />
I know that this has been bugged, but I'd offer two suggestions:<br />
<br />
* As well as fixing the HPs, I'd love to see the pets enrage and shield like their predecessors did. I've a strong feeling the coding of these pets is different to the previous Spirit Call pets, but the fact the old ones could enrage meant they brought precious extra seconds which (several times) saved my life.<br />
<br />
* Failing that, some sort of toggle would be great - so the user could choose either Spirit Call III (True Spirit clones, low DPS) or Sprit Call IV/V (new pets, much higher DPS, but weaker).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">cool, thank you for stopping<br />
damage and hp? does that mean they`ll proc more aswell or hit for higher? cool<br />
<br />
i realise it might not be possible to answer this but can you look at dot spell we get too? and if possible some feedback on our concerns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Since this is an entirely NEW aa... perhaps we could just get a new activation number and hotkey created from just this one and leave the old one intact?<br />
<br />
The old one had &quot;situational&quot; uses that will never be met by the new.  Dog-Dog push was an ugly thing if used incorrectly.  But, with a quick memming of invis and then firing off Dog-Dog x 5 while strafing... you could get instant mob push.  Surround him on 2 or 3 sides and let the dog team MUSH!   <br />
<br />
When you absolutely have to have it there RIGHT NOW, call a shaman!<br />
<br />
Between Dog-Dog push techniques and Virulent Paralysis we had a lock on being kings of placement in many situations where melee push just wasn't enough.<br />
<br />
As for the possible issue of Dog-Team tagteaming if we had both AA's with different hotkeys... place them on the same timer.  Its not like there are any shortage of general timers for shaman.  Or, just possibly throw us a bone and let us have our duel teaming.  <br />
<br />
It would make a lot of people happy to see that.  Very happy people.  I don't think ANYBODY would argue about us not getting a worth while AA in GoD for 10aa if we could duel dog team something.  (or barring game mechanics about having more than one swarm up... then make it so that we can chain the two but just not have both swarms up at the same time.  Like how LDoN handles awakened pets)<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for stopping by Rytan.  We've been missing interactions with SoE for a long time and I personally belive that is the cause of most of the discontent.   Just knowing that somebody is listening and taking an interest is a good feeling.</div></div><hr />

 Hey no problem we're used to expansions coming out incomplete, with all manner of bugs. I figure it must be pretty stressful for the developers working on a complicated piece of software with such a tight budget. Just to let you know I bought 2 extra copies of GoD to help out in any way I can, I'm hoping a little extra cash might help keep those developers paid and happy and keep the EQ servers up and running!

I am very happy that a SoE rep has taken the time to inform us of ongoing work.  I do hope the developers take the time to look over some of our discussions (with a grain on salt for the rants).  They will find very valuable resources for future adjustments. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I saw something unusual with Spirit Call yesterday, demonstrating it for a friend in Dulak. Not only did two of the three pets poof (as in Retron`s pet begins to cast a spell) a couple of ticks before the other one, but they showed a bite for 640 rather than the usual proc.<br />
<br />
http://www.medvale.fsnet.co.uk/sc.jpg<br />
<br />
This is a common and known bug with pets. It occurs when the last strike killing an NPC is a proc. The damage inflicted by the proc will be shown as a normal attack instead(a bite in this case).</div></div><hr />

Well? Nothing in patch message.Hope this is fixed as spending 15aa for a DOWNGRADE is pretty silly.Had hopes that this would be a fun and situationaly usefull AA.I know this isn't a big concern to most of you and we have more important issues but this really irked me for some reason.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Fresh after the patch, I put the wolves to the test again in Dulak, on a level 35 ish, unslowed scout.<br />
<br />
It's bad news, as nothing's changed. The wolves still only have 200 HPs - one died before I shuffled close enough to get the scout's attention on me). After 30 seconds, the scout was dead, so I clicked on a wolf to see what it's regen was; both remaining wolves were half dead by this stage.<br />
<br />
Annoyingly, on the next tick I saw:<br />
<br />
&quot;Retron`s pet begins to cast a spell&quot; and bam, they'd poofed.<br />
<br />
It seems that unless you have aggro on another mob, rather than just waiting around as the old wolves did, there's a good chance of them gating or whatever it is they do. Bah!</div></div><hr />

I went back to Dulak's Harbor, pitting the three wolves against an unslowed, high 30s mob that hit for 81 max. I'm not sure what level the wolves are, but they're DB so at least level 50 - no contest, so you'd think....<br />

The one remaining wolf was down to 44% health by the end - and it had obviously had enough, as (like so many times before) it gated away well before the minute was up. <br />
<br />
I know it won't do any good, but I've filed another bug report. Hopefully one of these days it will be fixed....<br />
<br />
(Edit: just noticed these pseudo-pets don't seem to bash or kick, unlike our normal wolf and the &quot;old&quot; Spirit Call. That and the poofing issue makes me wish I could just delete the AA and go back to good old Spirit Call 3 - I miss those tanking wolves  :( )</div></div><hr />

Hmm - well, if the swarm wolves are hanging around after a previous kill and a mob wanders by and aggros you, the whole pack will obviously go over and start thwacking away.<br />
<br />
If the normal pet is hasted and dual wielding, he'll usually draw aggro from what I've seen, although if one of the swarm wolves procs early on he'll usually take a drubbing for it. But, to be honest, by the time the wolves are chewing on that second mob, there's not much time left for them anyway (unless you're fighing orc pawns or something  :p)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It has been a month.<br />
<br />
It still isnt fixed.<br />
<br />
He has not had time to get it fixed.<br />
<br />
A month isnt enough time.<br />
<br />
So when will healing get fixed. Next expansion?<br />
<br />
2 expansions?<br />
<br />
Right about the time they really really want to get it fixed? Like when Wow comes out? Or when subscriptions are dropping?<br />
<br />
I do not understand it. We pay them for this. <br />
<br />
Oh by the way Rytan, and Brenlo if yall read this. You want to know why people are so up in arms and angry and pessamistic?<br />
<br />
This sort of thing has been going on for years. Way way back when we were promised something special for our disease dots when thier duration was nerfed to the 2.1 minute mark. We still have not seen it.  We were told Healers were getting balanced. Clerics got hammers and summoned hammers and bash. Druids got a Faster heal and a Incomplete heal. Shaman got a incomplete heal that almost no shaman uses. We were told we were still being looked at. We are still waiting. Meele have been waiting a long time too. SoE can seem to work on expansions. But never on the things they have already promised, because they are working on the next expansion.<br />
<br />
This is why people are angry. We are being treated like dirt. You will get to it eventually. Blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
To be honest I treat you and yours from SoE as equal to politicians. <br />
<br />
Or to parody an old joke. <br />
<br />
&quot;How can you tell when a SoE Developer is lying...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is talking or typing&quot;<br />
<br />
(Insert canned laugh track here)<br />
<br />
Some people still belive in you. So please don't blinking waste something as wonderful as thier trust. It is a new day. Fix the stuff that needs fixing. Let us know exactly what you feel doesnt need fixing. And let us discuss it with real timetables. Not the status Quo of only talking when you want to get at the purse strings.<br />
<br />
Stop jerking us around. And dropping the ball so many times it looks like you are dribbling.<br />
