<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jurais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started fighting in Veksar tonight and I can't seem to get any poison or disease dots to land...even after landing malosi/malady...I was working the sentry/crusader camp by the goblins at the enrance.  I ended up just using was slow/cripple...and meleeing where I could.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something? Or are the mobs farther in the zone less resistant?  Any help is greatly appc'd...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, no, only the goblins and most golems take to poison and disease DoTs, even after malo / Decay... It's like fighting in 90% of luclin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kraglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have to remember that they are kinda water-based so that's how their going to react ... sucks for shaman soloing, though ... I mostly just solo the ent mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most of the mobs in Veksar are undead, and as such have a high resistance to disease and poison.  Use alpha dog and your cold nuke to fight those guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't even try to dot the undead with disease or poison unless it's with your epic (or you're 65 and have malos and malosinia).  With the goblins I stick with plague and epic dot since poison doesn't stick on them either.  It's really all that's needed with dogdog biting him, but the longer dots mean more time spent healing your pet.  I'm about to hit 59 and I imagine Pox will help tons here, if they are still good exp.  I've been sticking bane of nife and epic on the golems, haven't tried plague cause I haven't had the need since I only go there in groups.  At the shop my group is 0 for 14 for the soulscream belt...I don't even get excited when the rotting shopkeeper pops anymore =(</div></div><hr />
