<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>beasty396</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know the new 65 cap and the new spells opened again the old debate who is a better Dotter - shm or nec.<br />
<br />
I just need the hard info - taking into account spells that stack together and the variety of spells for each class, which class can do more DoT damage in solo (at 65)?<br />
<br />
I left EQ along time ago and plan a return. having ~30 necro and ~40 SHM.<br />
I am not interested in resistance data please. lets assume all spells stick. Also I am not interested in root break factors.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this will not start a flame thread. I really want to resume some forgoten DoT knowledge that I once had.<br />
Thank you so much for the help !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Given that every DoTing class can stack every single DoT (assuming no effect other than the DoT) they have now (up to a limit of a total of 30 effects on the mob), the only real limitations in a solo situation are a)Mana, b)How long the mob survives (if it dies before you even get to cast DoT #4 on it, you obvously hit a limit in how much you will be able to land), c)how long the DoTs lasts, and d)How willing are you to swap spells in/out.<br />
<br />
Given that, a Necro is going to be able to stack more damage onto a mob with dots simply by virtue of having more lines of dots. That means they have more dots in a given level/damage range.<br />
<br />
Shaman :<br />
Blood of Saryrn : 320/tick, 7 ticks<br />
Breath of Ultor : 165/tick, 26 ticks<br />
Pox of Bert : 90/tick, 18 ticks<br />
Bane  of Nife : 214/tick 7 ticks<br />
Total / tick : 789<br />
Factoring in casting times, canny work, and either keeping the mob rooted away from yourself or healing yourself if tanking that is about all you might reasonably expect to do.<br />
<br />
Necro : <br />
Blood of Thule : 335/tick, 7 ticks<br />
Embracing Darkness : 70/tick, snare, 20 ticks<br />
Saryrn's Kiss : 200/tick, lifetap, 10 ticks<br />
Dark Plague : 132/tick, 20 ticks<br />
Pyrocruor : 111/tick, 18 ticks.<br />
Total / tick : 848/tick<br />
<br />
Necro doesn't need to spend time healing, since one of the DoTs is a lifetap, and doesn't have to canny, so it is reasonable to assume they will have time to stick at least one more DoT.<br />
<br />
Both of those presume that the caster is willing to take some time to swap spells in/out.<br />
<br />
The number are pretty close, but the necro has a slight lead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you toss in epic also so that you are runing 5 dots to 5 dots. Rather then 4 to5 it will be a lot closer. And also compairing total damage a tick. Dose not in and of its self mean more total damage once all dots have run thire corse. One agine they will problly be pretty close to that same. <br />
<br />
Compairing Shm and Necors is like compairing apples and ornges. Yes they both grow on tree's (or are EQ classes in this case) but that pretty much where the simularites end. If you are trying to decided which class you will play, by finding out which one has the higher DPS. I think you are makeing a mistake. Its problly better to play both and see which you like more. Which fits the way you like to play more. Take soloing for both classes. Lets just put it in a nut shell and keep it basic.<br />
Necro.. Snar mob, Fear mob, Send pet, dot sit med till fear breaks, rinse repeat.<br />
Shaman.. Slow mob (maybe root to give you a jump on casting) Dot mob, send pet, Heal dot has needed, rinse repeat.<br />
<br />
By all means resurch both classes. Lean thire strenghts and weakness. Then play both and see which you like. Like I said if you base it purely on DPS you will problly be disappointed in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm... not sure if Funeral Pryor of Kalador stacks with Blood of Thule. if it does thats another 2000+ dmg over 7/8 ticks.<br />
<br />
Also left out Splurt 1600dmg over 18 tick if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Definitely necros are the master of dots. But can they take a hit or two? :) I definitely love me shammy much more than me 61 necro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">your forgetting viable shaman dots on your list (ebold, plague, epic, bone of bertox, ancient bane...u can get all these in before other dots run if you stack them in the right order...), but besides that snuggle is right.  comparing necro vs shaman dps to decide what class you want to play is a bit on the goofy side.  necro and shaman dps suck in most game encounters anyway....i say suck, compared to rogues/wizards/mages ect...<br />
if you want to pick a class to play to end game try each class out and do some research on their capabilities.<br />
for example shaman can take hits and find groups easily, necros can snare and fd.....not sure how to compare the classes.  just look at what each can do and decide what you would like to do with your time in game /shrug.<br />
i have a lvl 16 necro but play a 65 shaman /snicker.<br />
<br />
btw if you want a simple answer to who can stack more dot damage you can just check castersrealm spell info...your prolly going to find it is a necro...not by much though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>beasty396</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I want to thank you all for your kind replies.<br />
<br />
You were so nice that I am tempted to ask a follow up question.<br />
As a back ground to my question let me share with you that I have left EQ a year ago for the lack of diversity between players within a certain class. Every druid resembles to the other druid.  Even the AA skills eventually allow every 1 in one class to master them all.<br />
I just wanted to become more unique. So I tried other games. But I most of all missed root-doting !!!<br />
<br />
So on to my followup question ... which is the better root-doter now days around level 65: shaman or necro? I mean I can pass any day on fear or bufs or any pet. plain simple root-dot thats what I am most missing.<br />
And thats most likely the reason for my colossal return :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Necros have a lot more variety of dots to work with. I've added FPK and splurt and the resist check to Zyphyr's list:<br />
<br />
Necro :<br />
Blood of Thule : 335/tick, 7 ticks (poison, -50adj)<br />
Embracing Darkness : 70/tick, snare, 20 ticks (magic)<br />
Saryrn's Kiss : 200/tick, lifetap, 10 ticks (magic, -200adj)<br />
Dark Plague : 132/tick, 20 ticks (disease, -50adj)<br />
Pyrocruor : 111/tick, 18 ticks. (fire, -100adj)<br />
Funeral Pyre: 261/tick, 9 ticks. (fire, -100adj)<br />
Splurt: 1600 damage, 16 ticks. (magic, -100adj)<br />
<br />
And they also have some miscellaneous 1k dots like plague, CoC and Ignite Blood and their 1k lifetap over time Vexing Mordinia.<br />
<br />
Necros have more variety, most of their dots don't have a DD component so they don't break root and most have a negative resist adjustment making them hard to resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>beasty396</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">THX, So it is the necro who is the better root-doter ?<br />
Any other opinions please ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Given that root frequently breaks (varies, of course, depending on the root and the DOT) on us shaman as our DoTs land, I'd go with necro if that's going to be your primary style of hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>beasty396</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I see one problem with going the Necro path ... should the root break and the mob reach my avatar, I dont think it could stand the chance of a second blow. Unlike Shaman I guess.<br />
<br />
So root-dot in close quarters is supposed to be impossible for the necro if I understand the mechanics ... right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Necros have a &quot;skin&quot; spell line that can take some damage for them, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, druids are the best rotters, snare, really nice roots, lure based dots w/o initial damage components to break root. Their dots are a bit on the weak side, but since they can stack all of them now, it isn't as big a deal as it used to be. <br />
<br />
Between a shaman and necro, not sure. Shaman has the advantage of malo but necros tend to have nicer dots. Also, some mobs (a lot of undead for example) that tend to be resistant to poison spells are also resistant to disease spells. Which means a shaman doesn't have any worthwhile dots against those. Necro has a wider range of resists to work against with his dots. <br />
<br />
If you count pets as a dot, necro pulls ahead more since their pets tend to be DPS machines compared to our puppies. That doesn't really matter when rotting though since neither one can take a hit all that well. Necro fear kites with dots to use a pet, shaman tanks for his pet. In a group, necros can stack dots easier since they can Feign to dump agro, shaman stands there and takes the hits. <br />
<br />
If I wanted to go rotting, I think I'd pick a necro but usually a necro is fearing mobs and chasing after them with his pet. Shaman soloing has always seemed more fun to me though, no need to bother with root, you slow, stack your dots, pull out a big old 2 hander and beat on the mob. No need to bother with root. <br />
<br />
Different styles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, I can toss an opinion in here for ya as my two highest level toons are a shaman(56) and a necro (53).<br />
<br />
I've been alternating these two for quite a while now and can't really settle on one or the other as my absolute favorite.  Both can solo almost anything they can stick a spell on without excessive difficulty.  Tactics are the big difference here, not dps, and as such, if you want to root dot, the necro is the toon of choice.<br />
<br />
Necros can snare, root, and pile on the dots.  Most of their dots DO NOT have a DD component so root breaks less.  If root breaks, they can feign death to avoid dying.  With Lich, ArchLich and the other mana spells they can regen mana at a steadier rate than a shaman (Archlich is better mana regen than even KEI), even while feigned.  They have life tap dots which offset the damage they do to themselves liching and can lifetap DD when needed for extra hp or a final kick to finish a tough mob.  A (and here's the catch) WELL-PLAYED Necro can out root-dot any other class, but they get into melee range of the mob and they die fast.  They have low hp and horrid damage mitigation.  Also if you get stunned as a necro or fail a feign death, start looking for a rez cause it's all over (feign has a bad recast time).  Over all, Necros are tougher to play cause you have a much smaller margin of error to work in.  Against PoP or equivalent mobs, you're walking a razors edge to live through the fight, and you'll find it easy to take a bad step and die.<br />
<br />
Shamans on the other hand have fewer lines of dots (only 2 plus epic) and most shaman dots have DD component causing them to break root.  On the upside, slow + higher ac + higher hp + better damage mitigation means that a shaman can take it when root breaks without being dropped like a dirty shirt and can heal themselves outside of combat.  They do take longer to root-dot a mob to death since they have fewer spell lines and therefore less dps, and so are less efficient as root dotters overall, but definitely stand a better chance of surviving if things go south (provided of course they can run for it, if that's not an option you stand a good chance of dying).<br />
<br />
At any rate, that's my analysis of the situation.  Personally I love my shaman and my necro, but I don't, strictly speaking, root-dot with either of them very often.</div></div><hr />
