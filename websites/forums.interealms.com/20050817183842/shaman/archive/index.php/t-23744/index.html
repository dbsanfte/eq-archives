<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's the group leader who is the problem, not SoE. You have a better slow, and if you have the GoD slow you should be slowing.  Why did you let the group leader dictate the slowing? Who cares if the beastlord landed slow first time?<br />
<br />
I have done several hours of grinding at the Wall of Slaughter and was casting pretty much as the first damage was done to the mob. We had a beastlord in the group and he was not slowing because there was no point. I was casting slow then casting bane, clicking pox off pants, and considering if I should rain or BoS... I didn't care if bane ran full course because I had alpha pup going, FA on the melee and was slowing things left, right, and center. My contributions were more than ample.<br />
<br />
Some moron decided to train Hulcror over our group and I slowed that with the God slow first time. Didn't stop us dying but at least he was slowed. :P<br />
<br />
All in all I am 100 times happier with this expansion than with GoD. It took me ages to get KodTaz flagged and I only got the new slow the day before OOW came out.<br />
<br />
I have had a blast messing around in OOW and will continue to. Maybe the whole BST&gt;SHM is server related. I don't see it on Rodcet so much. I am often in groups with chanters and/or beastlords. It might be that we are not as efficient as groups setup to rip through content, but it's fun and workable. <br />

I wish you luck changing the minds of those you play with.</div></div><hr />

meaning what Litgruv? That people who claim to have fun are retards that don't understand the game? There is NO reason at all for a shaman to feel bad in Walls of Slaughter. None, the zone is full of challenge if you look for it, and if you leave there feeling like you didn't add value to a group it's entirely your fault.<br />

<br />
God forbid a beastlord tells me 'no need to worry - I got slow...' best solution to that, especially if your healing, is to not heal them when they draw aggro off the main tank which most BLs inevitably do. When they ask you why your not healing them tell them you figured they didn;t need help - If they were ok with using their smaller slow they should be ok healing themselves with their smaller heal :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That's fine Sudedor, I was simply posting my experiences in the same zone that walknot was having troubles in. I found the opposite to be true. My opinion, while opposite to the rabid masses, is valid to me. :)<br />
<br />
I don't see it as a BL&gt;Shaman slowing issue. I find it to be a case of the new shaman god slow is ****ing awesome in Walls of Slaughter and gave me a metric ****ton more time per mob to add value than if I had to cast malos before turgurs because I was terrified of slow being resisted.<br />
<br />
My comments are not an argument of class vs class, but a comment on the same zone/issue posted above. Thats all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point Bethania, I am in exactly the same position you are in. I am the only shaman in my guild with the god slow. I presume that walknot does not have it. However.... and it's a real however..... the GoD slow is available through farming vexd/tipt and from the sewers for those without KodTaz access. I guess it's all about having the tools to do the job.<br />
<br />
I don't pretend to assume it would be easy to xp there with malos/turgurs, but I was putting forward the viewpoint that it is easy and I feel useful with nihli.<br />
<br />
My point is not to say that Shaman without Nihli suck, as much as to say that Shaman with Nihli will find themselves feeling good xp'ing in that particular zone.</div></div><hr />

Whether you subscribe to the theory that BL's are overpowered or &quot;the most balanced among the gimped&quot;, I would like to see them moved out of conflict with the (now very narrow) role of the shaman.<br />
<br />
But what actually happens?  They get melee skills bumped up to the highest levels, improved healing,  and the only thing Rytan has brewing for us is a mechanism for nerfing canni.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Back on topic: The group leader was a nit. Beastlords can slow faster, but we slow better. Yes, I know, with slow mitigation the difference lessens (I'd like to see some of the other classes have their primary contibutive spell/ability mitigated like ours and with the same level of frequency) but it's still there. Beastlord slows aren't competition, but complementary. Consider it a Pre-Slow. The beastlord is merely punching them in the throat, we're coming in with the Louisville Slugger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I also 2 box a Beastlord and a Shaman and there is no way in hell beastlord slows are better. They cast them in 1.9-ish sec because of hybrid spell haste and the difference stops there. That group leader has been misled or misinformed. IF a shaman has Balance of the Nihil there is no contest what so ever for obvious reasons. The only thing I can think of for why Sha's Revenge lands more is because its 65 spell vs a 51 spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got to agree with you Blazz, if I'm in a group, then I'm slowing, period.  BST can pre-slow, but he'll see it overwritten every time.  And when I get the GoD slow, then it will be a moot point.  More power to them, but if I were them, I'd save the mana for something more useful.</div></div><hr />

out of 10 Shamans in my guild only 3 have the GoD slow(estimated). This considered BST slow has the same chance to land as Shaman slow (or less because Turgurs is lower level. Yes, lower level &gt; higher level).  Us Shamans then use Malos and and slow a mob about 10 secs before it dies. (yeah, we rock (see Rytans opinion on this)). In the end, an average shaman does not have the GoD slow and so it is better to have a BST slow since he also has better chances to live through the resist aggro (similar gear levels assumed).<br />
<br />
And if you think it all depends on the stuff in brackets (), yes, it does. Not sure how &quot;If&quot;s should be considered, but if you do you probably have not ordered OoW anyways (like me).</div></div><hr />

That's why the Beastlord is the better slower. I'd pick a Beastlord over a Shaman for the slower slot(if that role even exists anymore) any day of the week. This is even more true for a zone where mobs mitigate slow.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, I know compared to many around here I'm a newb (only 27 aa's in 2 years of playing a shaman), but that's a pretty broad statement.  So you are telling me that there are no zones or mobs that have magic resists which make it difficult for a BST to land slow without a debuff such as Malos?  Gee, I go to a lot of zones now where Turgurs will bounce on occassion, sometimes more than once, and will only land after I've cast Malos.  And if I do pull aggro (which I rarely do unless I get a resist), I have some very nice HoTs, VP, root, etc. to keep me alive.  Granted, the BST may end up tanking the mob for a bit, and can certainly do that better than I can, but I don't see this as a good thing.  I'd rather the plate wearing tank, tank the mob, that's his job.  All the BST did was pull aggro due to spamming his slow, now the tank has to work harder to get aggro back and the healer has to heal the BST.  When I get beat on a bit by a mob due to pulling aggro, I just heal myself.<br />
<br />
But then again, to each their own.  Play anyway you like, as long as you are enjoying yourself.  Thank God that whenever my guild is looking for a slower, they send me a tell first.  :)</div></div><hr />

Probably your post about Litgruv. /shrug.<br />
<br />
<br />
my 2 cents:<br />
<br />
Shamans have a better slow.  It takes a while to get it on the mob unless you have Balance.  Beastlords can 'pre-slow' just fine, and they handle aggro better on *tough* mobs.  Their pet is a better off tank than I am.<br />
<br />
Just ask a group - if they have a Beastlord pre-slowing and a Shaman following up with our slow, which one will they miss the most if one of them logs off?  What if they are fighting 'mostly mitigating' mobs?<br />
<br />
I don't know the answer.</div></div><hr />

There will be no appreciable difference between a beastlord slow and a shaman slow in those situations, and if the beastlord slow landed first, the shaman is just wasting his mana.  <br />
<br />
It may feel good to overwrite the beastlord, but it's still a waste of mana.  This expansion is certainly better for shaman than GoD was, but it's better still for Beastlords.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I main healed a group just yesterday with a beastlord &quot;puller&quot; which means he pulls each mob with a &quot;pre-slow&quot;. Each and every mob that came to camp I promptly slowed, added dps and still had pleanty of manna to keep up with heals on him and the pally. Bout 15 minutes into the session the beastlord asks for a med break. I politely told him to save the manna, stop slowing and keep pulling; I have it covered. He argued that I couldn't main heal and slow. I said fine told him to sit down and take a med break. I then poped a cannV, Q'd myself and told the group 90manna. Paladin in my group just started pulling. Was funny as hell.<br />
<br />
65 Beastlords can be solid main slowers as can enchanters. But they shouldn't get confused: If I'm there, I'm the slower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is that experience Gart, or theory? Have you done a long grind with a beastlord in your group against white/yellow/red con mobs in OOW? I ask because of the way you worded the observation, not trying to be snippy. (there will be no..... etc). I did and the beastlord said he was getting a high percentage of first time slow issues. He was our puller for a while and was pulling with slow so they were coming in unslowed. My slow was landing first time, almost every time - this over a period of about 5 hours (1.5 hours with him as puller, the rest with him and I at the camp).<br />
<br />
Do you think its worthless having a shaman if a bard is pulling 50 percent slowed mobs?<br />
<br />
I am curious, that's all, because it doesn't sound like many others have had a similar experience to me in OOW. I am enjoying it. I'd hate to be alone in that, but will deal with it if I have to. :)</div></div><hr />

There are plently of classes who can debuff MR. You usually have an Enchanter, Mage or a Bard in your group especially in those very few zones where mobs have high MR and require a debuff.<br />

A Beastlord doesn't just tank a little better, but will instantly turn virtually immune to melee every 3 minutes, if he has to, and he can do so by pressing a single key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I agree, somebody is wasting mana.  Since my slow is better, I can land it more reliably, and I have a bigger mana pool and better mana regeneration, I think I'll keep slowing, and let the BST waste his mana if he wants.</div></div><hr />

OK, so now you're saying that with the right supporting PCs, the BST is a better slower.  And because he can use his disciplines to tank when he pulls aggro, he can deal with it better.  Understood.  I thought we were comparing BST to Shaman as slowers straight up, not with others to help them. <br />
<br />
Gee, with that logic, give me a Pally or SK worth his salt and I never pull aggro, even on resists.  And since I can Malos on inc., the difference in landing the slow is maybe a sec or 2, yet it lands more reliably and the debuff helps me and the other casters land our other spells also.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, &quot;in those very few zones where mobs have high MR and require a debuff&quot; I think I'll stick with having a shammy debuff and slow, I'll let the BST slow in places that are less challenging.  But don't get me wrong, if he wants to come along to do dps, hey, I'm all for that.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, that by definition, I think that makes me the better slower, not the BST.  Now, you may argue that the BST adds more value, that is an entirely different subject (and one I'll also happily debate), but when it comes to SLOWING, please don't try to tell me a BST is better than a Shaman.  Because he is not, period.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I have enjoyed my experiences in OOW so far.  It's clearly a much better expansion thus far than Gates was.  I don't know why you feel you are uniquely enjoying OOW.  Sounds to me like lots of folks feel it's good so far, but that doesn't mean there aren't valid criticisms or observations.  <br />
<br />
With regard to whether I'll overwrite a bard slow, much will depend on the tank and how the healer's mana is faring.  A cheal that heals 6k costs the same mana as a cheal that heals 3k.  It depends on the situation.  <br />
<br />
I haven't spent a lot of time grouped with a beastlord in OOW, although I've slowed a lot of different mobs, so I guess you can say it's &quot;theory&quot;.  It's obviously based on my experience in situations where mobs aren't resistant and they mitigate.  <br />
<br />
If the mobs aren't resistant, and these really haven't been from I've seen, and they mitigate, then if the 65% slow lands, it's not an appreciable benefit to land a 75% slow.  You'd be better off dropping another dot.  This isn't a universal truth, but rather a general rule.  YMMV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But If I am the main healer I have told them lots of times. Sure slow and Ill overwrite if i need to. <br />
<br />
I don't care if they slow first. Mine is better. Any other argument is like me telling them Don't worry about Dps I got it. <br />
<br />
It is a stupid argument. But one that happens alot now because of perception. <br />
<br />
I can take 5 tanks. With no mana and win. in lots of places. <br />
<br />
A beastlord cant. Sure if he has someone heal for him he can slow very effectivly and do Lots of damage. But you know what. I might do less damage, but groups flow better with me. A person leaves i pick up the slack. A person Linkdead.. No problem. What Chanter haste gone. here you go. <br />
<br />
I may not be the best but  I can do it all. <br />
<br />
Sure It wouldnt get me a pick up group with ubers but sorry. I make my groups and for those shaman is required. Cause that is what I am.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I have enjoyed my experiences in OOW so far.  It's clearly a much better expansion thus far than Gates was.  I don't know why you feel you are uniquely enjoying OOW.  Sounds to me like lots of folks feel it's good so far, but that doesn't mean there aren't valid criticisms or observations.  <br />
<br />
With regard to whether I'll overwrite a bard slow, much will depend on the tank and how the healer's mana is faring.  A cheal that heals 6k costs the same mana as a cheal that heals 3k.  It depends on the situation.  <br />
<br />
I haven't spent a lot of time grouped with a beastlord in OOW, although I've slowed a lot of different mobs, so I guess you can say it's &quot;theory&quot;.  It's obviously based on my experience in situations where mobs aren't resistant and they mitigate.  <br />
<br />
If the mobs aren't resistant, and these really haven't been from I've seen, and they mitigate, then if the 65% slow lands, it's not an appreciable benefit to land a 75% slow.  You'd be better off dropping another dot.  This isn't a universal truth, but rather a general rule.  YMMV.<br />
<br />
Gart, thanks for the response. I guess it's all down to perception and how people play their shaman, as much as how easy they get a group, and how much they feel their lack of grouping is based on the issues with the class.<br />
<br />
By the way, thanks to whoever for the other negative rep bump. I do chuckle at anonymous ones. So interesting. :)<br />
<br />
I'll continue to play my shaman and like it and go back to lurking for a while. It's fun to post, if you agree with the majority. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is <br />
1.To do with cast/recast time on bst slows.so if you both cast at same time both get resists bst is gonna be landing his 2nd slow before you so may look like hes not been resisted.<br />
2.Being Shaman we will always remember the times we get a bounced slow and then hearing beast say &quot;mob slowed&quot; and we dont know how many times the bst gets resisted as ours landed 1st time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Greyram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Ok old news, beast slow landed alot better than shaman slow and quiker too=advantange beast, NOw new sham spell cast time 1.5 sec with built in debuff lands on pretty much everything first cast without malos and is 75 percent slow Advantage Shaman.  I love my beast pals, many a time i am the main healer in hard ldons and it works out well when a cleric or druid iznt around.A bst can slow and add dps with his pet combind with shaman pet its better dps than having a cleric in the group.  Just dont die.  As far as slowing goes, shaman are FINALLY the best at a certain ability which is SLOWING, when its my roll to strictly slow i have both up so if, one does get resisted i have anothr ready to blast off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I found in the walls the other day if i slowed and crippled (was using it to see if it made any difference) then loaded up two dots with dogdog not even chain casting fear and snare on my sk could get the mob of my shamman.<br />
<br />
If i can handle agro i can usually manage to get bout 120 dps on my sham and heal at the same time, but my canni button gets a serious workout.<br />
<br />
At least the other day i parsed my sham at 80 odd dps from dots and ruppy puppy nearly 40 dps.<br />
<br />
I seems i have to drop dots down by half in order to keep agro off me. So i end up doing bout 80dps combined and healing at the same time.<br />
<br />
Although I must admit i like this new expansion, where the mobs have enough hit points for me to actually cast more than two spells before they die.<br />
<br />
Ive got my dot augs and a couple of levels of crit aa's though, so it seems to up the dps a bit.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
One of the things I find with groups is they dont understand shaman healing. Shaman healing is slow, cant handle the burst damage, but if the damage level is lower i can outheal a cleric unless they are pretty high end.<br />
<br />
Thats why im enjoying oow, seems that the mob dps is just low enough for me to keep up with the healing rate so i can heal, dot, slow, ruppy puppyficate and generally enjoy my sham more 8)<br />

<br />
While any slower will do (because of mitigation) shaman are heal contributing. In the longer fights, healing contributions will equal extra dps. So either a beast or a shaman can fill that spot. With the exception of buffs now, enchanters (non-charm groups) seem to be falling into the 3rd rated/needed category.<br />
<br />
Beast didn't lose anything in OoW. Shaman gained. Enchanters are were they were in high end GoD zones.<br />
<br />
Shaman may have made out even more since their heals can keep up in the long fight, thus leaving the druids to find other ways to fit into a cleric/shaman group. While I haven't seen it personally, druids as primary healer with shaman slowing/healing may be doable easily in OoW also.<br />
<br />
So far, while shaman were not upgraded much with spells, the zones themselves are tuned allowing them to perform well with greater diversity ... just the opposite of GoD.<br />

Of course this is way early to speculate on. SOE is bound to do some absurd tweeking of the zones over the course of the next month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">meaning what Litgruv? That people who claim to have fun are retards that don't understand the game? There is NO reason at all for a shaman to feel bad in Walls of Slaughter.

<br />
Now, Lit, I am not sure if you are on a playing week, or a quitting week, but if you want to say something at least state which side you are on, today.<br />
<br />
I think what Lit was saying is that we were about to rehash the whole BL vs Shaman slowing thing again.<br />

I'm taking the high road on that.<br />

The other night in WoSlaughter I was in pretty much the situation described here. (on my bard) We had a druid main healing, with the shaman slowing and backup healing, and it worked really well. Admittedly, we are all time equipped, and our warrior was pretty beefy, but, even when I tanked for a bit (warrior wasn't paying attention when mob was inc / afk / etc) the damage didn't seem anywhere above what a LDoN / Tier3 equipped warrior/pal/sk would have trouble handling. A shaman could easily main heal even on the easy named mobs (ie. no Shadowhunter with AE FD and 2k Ramp, haha... he's a fun one) and it would only get easier as you put better tanks in there.  <br />
<br />
With a group of Nec/Wiz/Dru/Shm/War/Brd mobs were dying in around 1-2 minutes, certainly enough time for a bane and a nuke or two. From an outside perspective, it seems like things are indeed looking up for the shaman class; longer xp fights, lower dps mobs, and spells don't seem too hard to get hold of if you fight in the right zones.</div></div><hr />

Like: Malos on sight -&gt; BL slows, so it lands directly after Malos -&gt; me reslowing with better slow. It's a bit mana consuming, but certainly one of the safest ways to go about it.<br />

And I did my usual malos/turgers for a little bit with no problems.  On the first 2 pull I decided to just blast a turgers in without malos and low and behold it stuck. So I blasted turgers in on the add and it stuck. I continued to slow without malos for the next 2 hours. I got one resist the whole time and never picked up agro.

<br />
I was miffed no doubt, and if I had lvl 70, Wulf, I would have disbanded and moved on.  However, al worked out and the BL was a really nice person and quite aware of the slow issues between Shm and BL's.  The leader that invited me wasn’t a bad guy either and did leave after 30 min or so and I took over and lead us to a slightly better pull area where I pulled with Malo an had mobs slowed before the first blow was thrown.<br />
<br />
We rocked for several hours after that without a hitch and the BL was welcomed to slow as she saw fit.  I don’t have the BoN, although I want it, I was having issues with running the game in GoD so I didn’t hunt there much.  Most of those issues are solved and I will be heading over to get it soon.<br />
<br />
This doesn’t mean I am ambivalent to the Slow issues we face.  I would still like to see Shaman at the undisputed, heavyweight champs of this skill.<br />
<br />
I would like to voice my complaint with SoW though.  We need it bumped to the same speed as SoE.  I dont like getting run down and crushed by a mob when our poor arse invis drops.</div></div><hr />

I dont know if this is a joke post or not, however it is totally wrong.<br />
<br />
Slows sticking are determined by slow %.  Shm 51 slow spell is 75%, highest in the game, ours over writes everything. If you cant stick a slow after a BL slow you are using the wrong slow spell.<br />
<br />
Turgur's is lvl 51 slow, 75%<br />
<br />
Even the lvl 39 slow spell, Togor's, is 70% at lvl 60, and should over write the lvl 65 BL slow, which is 65%.<br />
<br />
I dont understand how what you describe could ever happen.<br />

I kinda actually get offended when people say to me (as was said to me by 5 or 6 guild members that I complained when they were linking rotting spells in KT and by various group memebers complaining about slowing taking so long) that I SHOULD get the GoD slow, implying that I haven't tried to do so.<br />
<br />
My problem is (and yes, I'm in an 'uber' guild) no one that is flagged for KT+ wants to help people get flagged for it.  This leaves, well sorry, 'lesser quality' people to do these with.  Example, I made up a group, only one MT class available (this is also prime time, so ***), so I get him.  Turns out, I have more hp (7k) than he does and only a bit less ac (1350) than him.  We tried anyways (tried to be optimistic and didn't find out until after 4 mobs or so what the hp/ac case was) on sewers #3 (the last thing I need before KT now).<br />
<br />
Now if even just 3 of my guildmates (or other 'ubers' I know) would help on it, I could get this run done in like 15 minutes (very heavy dps).  Now why won't they help me . . .  The reason is why all people flagged for KT don't want to help is: 1. The whole flagging proceedure is a major timesink 2. The mobs you have to fight suck 3. You would be intruding on their prime XP/Gear/Spells (what few spells are left to be gotten by now) area.  The last one is the major reason, I believe.  Thus, with the 'lesser quality' /lfg people, I've gone 1-23 on tipt, 1-8 on vxed, completed sewers #1,2,4 with one group, and 0-10 on sewers #3.  If that's not trying, ***.  Basically boils down to they don't want BoT 4.0 to be KT (since WoS is BoT 3.0, Tables in Fire is now BoT 2.0) and ruin their fun.  But, I get the last laugh.  I hear all the time in guild chat /wtb healer/tank/slower/dps/whatever that day for KT group and they continue to look while I've gotten a whole aa of xp in PoE or PoF (or destroyed every mob in PoI solo =) ).<br />

<br />
Anyone seen recently (ie last month or two) a spell rune drop in any GoD zone &lt;KT?  I have not, my guildies that are still doing some of these zones (ie xp/item pharming tipt) have not.  My sample of lesser GoD is pretty damn large and I've killed probably over 50 named or so with not a single rune drop.  I think they changed the spell drop locations awhile back to make you get to KT and fubars you from getting any spells (IRC the HoT and Slow were the 2 runes that dropped in lesser GoD before hand - &lt;slaps head&gt; why didn't I do GoD then . . .).</div></div><hr />
