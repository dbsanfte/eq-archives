<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quests and Quest &quot;PC's&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes , we have quests i know heh. Im talking about mroe interactive quests.<br />
<br />
I think they need to put a interactive ongoing quest system in. Picture this ...<br />
<br />
<br />
 While sitting upon my horse doing my usualy time consuming tasks of baking or whatever , a wanderer walks by , a REAL person behind a toon and talks to another toon besides me. I hear them speak of a item that has been lost to king so and so. Then the wanderer asks his companion to come inside the pub. I follow them in wondering what thsi is all about as i walk to the bar and buy some beer. I hear the traveler speaking of a sceptor of some sort that has unknown power , but the king has been charged by his god to return it. The travelers friend is unintrested in helping , way to dangerous he says to his friend &quot; im just a simple farmer&quot; and off he goes out of the scene . I step up and talk to the wanderer and tell him i will join him/quest for the item.<br />
<br />
Make a long story short you go out and quest for this item that fairly difficult , but not borderline impossible. You quest for it and you bring the item back and give to king so and so. He then gives you a uber weapon from his god in reward for your deed.<br />
<br />
Now the idea behind this is that quests like this ARENT rare , and as you go through an travel you will occasionaly find people talking about things liek this. Then as you do more and more quests and you become known for doing these , perhaps a guide approaches you one day and asks if you wish to be part of the story. Then you are walking around  starting these quests and talking to people. You know some of you would LOVE this , while ofcourse others wouldnt im sure.<br />
<br />
Now once you reach this level you start moving to harder quests and following more in depth stories , the idea being that you end up making a name for yourself and if your luck , do quests that can only be completed 1 time. I mean there is only so many times you can cut down tree number 21 in section of the zone -200 + 345 to turn int he magical wood for the BoW of uberness right ?<br />
<br />
It would create unique items on the server that would be like trophies. It would neat so much fun to have your name as part of the quests too.<br />
<br />
Like  maybe when someone comes to that first town and another story realted to it taking place , the PC would say &quot; Litgruv , a great shaman took it upon himself to quest this item for king so and so and now is off helping others in need, however YOUR help wuld be greatly appreciated and needed&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dunno , just thinking ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They already have these. They're called &quot;GM events&quot; and are, for the most part, a big waste of time. Occasionally you'll hear of an event that went off as planned with no mishaps, but more often than not you'll hear many who attended belly ache about how lame it was.<br />
<br />
So far, to my knowledge, the only &quot;artifact&quot; items in game were introduced via GM events.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not a event where everyone rushes , to some zone and fights for it , im talkign about onging quests intigrated as stories  only 1 person can do it , not 50 people chasing GM frogloks around DL for weak weapons<br />
<br />
just like i described it above.  Travler comes to town , or you over hear something ...  to that effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't get me wrong. I agree with you that EQ would be a better game if things like this happened more often. <br />
<br />
Color me jaded though when you ask if I think it will ever come to pass. :)<br />
<br />
Maybe in EverQuest 4, or maybe 5, but I'll be playing World of Warcraft or one of its decendents by then. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well i didnt say anything about it actualy happening  ;)<br />
<br />
I guess more of a &quot; if i made EQ i would&quot;  kinda thing would make it so much more alive and engaging , who wouldnt find it fun to have their name become part of the the lore of the land ? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only way to have somthing like this work is to have players run the quests.<br />
<br />
No way your 0.43$ a day can pay people to put this kind of intereactive content into the game that is personalized to each individual.<br />
<br />
You are asking EQ GMs to be D&amp;D GMs and develope a storyline which you follow in character.  0.43 is not going to pay for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I personally feel many quests should result in a flag, and if you have the flag, you cant complete it a second time. Seriously, say you do the gholl slayer quest 5 times... How friggin irresponsible IS that parent? :P This would cut back on mudflation and farming.<br />
<br />
I have been to several gm sponsored events that went well, many of them not involving killing some big mob (although when fay popped in lake of ill manners and killed r00d d00ds that was great). Things like riddle contests and general story time (before the pok was introduced, so many stories werent readily available), as well as giant gnome attacks.  The return of firiona vie, the corruption of lesser fay good events, the event where brownies played pranks on people by (briefly) turniong their wepaons into rusties. I participated in the event where the dark elves captured the avatar fo fear and brought it to befallen when it was revamped, I enjoyed the halloween events of last year, and I was wacked at least a dozen times when the undead first came to kithkor.<br />
<br />
I have almost always had a blast at gm events, and when I didnt, it was due to obnoxious players and not the events themselves. I personally would love to see more of this sort of thing. Unfortunately, while I could spring for the 40 bucks a month to play on legends, losts of my friends/guildies wouldnt or couldnt.<br />
<br />
Player run quests would be very nice, I think they tried ot implement a similar thing in ao, but dont know if it ever got working properly. I have been to a number of fun player events, and would love to see a similar feature implemented. <br />
<br />
Litgruv, you may want to give neverwinter nights a try, it might be right up your alley.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">GM's who solely reward roleplaying.<br />
<br />
They basically make characters that for all purposes are other player characters, then they group in areas. When they see roleplaying they reward it.<br />
<br />
Also rewards outside normal item rewards would be fun. Things like massive faction bonus, illusion items, unusual keys, items that give unique handy abilities (like sneak or forage) or odd items that use some of the rare visual models in game.<br />
<br />
And yes I'd like to see more done with the old plot lines sitting around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would like to see some &quot;trials&quot; but for one character only and only doable once.In other words,can't complete it more than once(like someone suggested,maybe by adding a flag).<br />
<br />
The rewards could vary,based on level.It could be a cash reward,an item based on class,one AA point,permanent stats,.......the possibilities are great.<br />
<br />
Having such &quot;events&quot; for any levels would give the possibility to test your &quot;solo&quot; strenght and do something else than tradeskills,xp grinding,farm items or raids.<br />
<br />
Could be a solo encounter,ring type(waves of mob(s)),small dungeon (get to the boss by defeating all his guards),......<br />
<br />
PoP gives the possibility to do this as a group or few groups(Thelin's maze,trials,....) but it's more than often to get flags for other zones or ****ty rewards for the effort (like the event in PoS,which is VERY hard for 24 peeps,and the reward I know of really don't fit the troubles).<br />
<br />
Sure,the &quot;trials&quot; wouldn't be the same for a warrior or a shaman,we all know the shaman could kill a mob 5-6 times tougher.The trials would need to be class specific.<br />
<br />
Just an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">MUDs.  Rules were quite different.  You could only complete a quest once (they were flagged).  If you told someone how to do a quest you were banned - you were only allowed to tell who started a quest.  Many quests were listed in the adventurer's guildhall with a small description and whether you had completed the quest or not.  The NPCs involved in the adventurer's guild quests were always available.  The items you needed were always on the mobs you were sent to kill.  The mobs to kill always spawned in a reasonable amount of time with no placeholders.  At various times, the quests were changed so that spoilers would be useless.  The quests usually were involved in some kind of storyline about the area they took place in.<br />
<br />
Ah - the good old days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">again , not EVENTS .<br />
<br />
Integrated parts of the story . And it wouldnt even require paying people , i know alot of people would enjoy playing a part in a lil skit like the one i mentioned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Litgruv stop thinking outside the box. Go join your resident uberguild and zerg Tier-3 content for 50 hours a week.<br />
<br />
Sheesh - you think this is supposed to be fun or something? Like a game?<br />
<br />
While the potential for abuse (GM Events and their 'friends' and 'rewards') is there, I do like the idea of an event that is you ALONE. Even better would be variances in the quest wherein you're not sure WHO the current NPC is going to send you to see next. <br />
<br />
Sadly given SOE's track record it would involve mispelled keyed text, obscure phrases, crappy spawn rates, people killing MOBs because &quot;my mom pays my $12.95 a month&quot; etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think a fun addition would be arena events... <br />
<br />
Similar to the &quot;Ring&quot; events but a single ring per try.<br />
<br />
Go to any of the arenas and hail an NPC &quot;Event Master&quot;. He will ask for a &quot;ticket&quot;. Tickets are purchesed from a nearby ticket vendor.<br />
<br />
You would have single PC, single group and multi-group tickets. Say 6 tickets of each type. (iron, steel, copper, silver, electrum, gold, platinum).<br />
<br />
Each &quot;win&quot; flags you so you are no longer able to compete at that ticket level (no farming).<br />
<br />
Once you buy your ticket and hand it to the event master, you will have 15 seconds before the mob pops. For single events, it's a single mob that is based on your class and level. For a group event, either a single mob or multiple mobs, for a multi-group, a swarm of mobs with a &quot;boss&quot; or a single &quot;big nasty&quot;.  Summoned monsters would have all of their normal abilities/weaknesses.<br />
<br />
The event ends when the mob or all players are killed. Mobs would give XP and skill ups. Deaths would be real. Once the ticket is turned in, all participents (mobs and players) can not be targeted by anyone not in the fight. If you want/need buffs from those not involved in the fight, you must get them prior to the ticket turn in.<br />
<br />
The mob (or mobs) will drop a total number of no-drop, lore, no rent tokens equal to the number of people in the group. i.e. a single group kills a single mob, 6 tokens drop.<br />
<br />
You hand your token in to either the event master or a prize master and recive a class specific, no drop item. Items would be equivelent to mid to upper range loot for the PC level range.<br />
<br />
Having seating around the arena for spectators would be a fun place to hang out and watch people do their thing.<br />
<br />
Imagine going to the Arena in Lake Rathe and seeing an 18 man raid take down a dragon. Or a single group take down a swarm of what ever.<br />
<br />
During patches, fill the arena with water and fight mermaids, fish, sea dragons, what ever... Add lava pits, platforms, bridges, traps whatever... People would come to try just to see whats new. Change the mosters summoned each patch. One time it's mobs from Hate, next time it's Plane of Growth or Kael, Western Wastes... Anywhere. Hell, even make the event win flags reset on a patch.<br />
<br />
Since merchants can have 80 slots visible now, that's 80 different ticket types you could have. <br />
<br />
Even allowing people to do it multiple times, it would give people something to do if they only have a few hours to play or they're tired of wandering around doing whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bump for Xelot.<br />
<br />
WHOA.<br />
<br />
VERY, VERY good idea. Wow. I'm trying to shoot holes in it, playing devils advocate.  <br />
<br />
80 tickets: 14 classes = 5 different types of tickets:<br />
<br />
1) Single<br />
2) Duo<br />
3) 6 man Group<br />
4) 18 man x 3 group<br />
5) Zerg fest<br />
<br />
Prizes = 1 earring, 1 ring, 1 piece of armor which can be handed back for another slot (ala Benevolence), range item, and maybe a weapon. (Don't like last idea).<br />
<br />
MOB could be of say different varieties. Still thinking on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heh reminds me of the arena in Sanctus Seru.<br />
<br />
If you go down there you can buy a ticket from the Arena master guy and hand it back to him to do a gladiator fight.<br />
<br />
I did it and fought a tiger!  (easy tiger ...but the idea was cool, nonetheless)</div></div><hr />
