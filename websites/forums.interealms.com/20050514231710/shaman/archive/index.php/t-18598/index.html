<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DenonoMonono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know its been talked about but i cannot find that same thread.. <br />
<br />
I apologize for repeating what has already been said.. :(<br />
<br />
Hello everyone.. I play a shaman whois nearing level 60 but my gear is that of a 51 or actually I had it since level 35.. I started playing again a few months ago and twinked my shaman some.. then my pp funds went down to almost 1k now heh.. My g/f started playing a BL and now shes nearing 59.. <br />
<br />
We mostly duo and we have been up in PoP.. but now I do not know where we could go to make solid pp.. we both need upgrades and spells but we lack the funds..<br />
<br />
Since we been gone for awhile we have no clue where to make pp..<br />
<br />
I apologize again for repeating myself.. but was just curious where we both could go to make consistant pp..<br />
<br />
PS.. we tried seb but it seems all but crypt, and disco 2 are camped.. and only be a usual quadro of a shaman, cleric, monk, enchanter.... kinda sucks because i know you could make awesome pp there.. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seb would be a good place if you can find it uncamped... seems like that's not the case. Some other options would be PoN, Nightstalkers can drop gems you can vendor for decent amount, plus it's good experience.  I believe there are some Legacy of Ykesha places you can go for decent money, but I'm afraid I don't know the specifics. Droga/Nurga could be good, some decent drops coming out of there now.. not sure how hard/easy they'd be at your level, but something to look in to. Perhaps Veksar as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thx for quick response.. but out of curiosity.. when both of join groups we are usually nitpicked on and ppl comment on our gear.. like &quot;my level 30 shaman has this and this..&quot; or &quot;My twink BL has these weapons which are way better..&quot; It really trully sucks.. Both of us are old time players from 99.. but we took 1 1/2 years off as a break to try other things in RL and mmorpgs.. <br />
<br />
Well my question is.. how do you deal with ppl doing this to you.. or do you ever defend others in your group who have ****ty gear compared to most their level? I do not want to say something that pisses them off and gets me no groups.. but it just sucks to deal with that stuff..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Veksar = undead that have insane high PR and DR. Doesn't exactly sound like he's equipped to handle that by himself. Droga would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Acrylia Caverns.  First room on left has a named that drops a chest piece that sells for 12k-ish (and isn't a bad piece if you don't have Tae Ew or something similar) (left named has an alt drop that also sells but not as well)...first room on right has a named that drops the grimling skin mask (which you both might use til you have a nice +stat/+hp mask, it's got nice stats) that sells for 15k+ (I've never seen the right <br />
named drop anything but the uber mask).<br />
<br />
(keep in mind these are Xev prices and our economy is whacked in general)<br />
<br />
The place is often empty (on my server) and at your levels you can control both rooms and the hall between.  The whole time you're there you can get some xp (weak at your level but loot would be the focus and any xp is good on top of great loot) and boatloads of acrylia which usually sells decently too.  Not to mention that bucketloads of grimling currency (rune thingies) drop and stack and some cheesy vendor sellable weapons drop and sell for 150p+ each.  Bring lots of WR packs and lots of packspace.  You can thwap the grimling runner in the next zone over to get rallic packs (85% WR pack quest that's beyond cake at your level) and there's a bank in grimling forest for offloading the heavy acrylia.  I used to duo a lot in AC with my BL friend and we rocked the place, often root parking pulls of 3-5 with late adds for extra carnage.  Buff your resists as there are lots of casters and it's fun to resist all their spells.  My BL friend and I would usually make around 1k each in pure plats, + tons of acrylia, and often a bazaarable piece during each 2-4 hour run we did there (and got nice xps).<br />
<br />
At your level (and maybe even still) I haven't found anything as good for easy plats with easily reached drops (that sell fast for nice pp) as AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn didn't even read the post! You have the best spots for cash if you are 65 and don't need cash! but this guy is level 60 and his gf is level 59, even with access he's gonna die!!<br />
<br />
For you I'd say:<br />
<br />
IA - sell me the bricks pleeese. and the nameds drop really nice loot, weapons sell for 150plat (crap weapons) runes up to 8pp.,nameds hit for 400s so best to let the pet handle it. Light on resists. Good xp for you.<br />
<br />
Droga - same as IA, lots more nameds and camps, light on resists, low aggro range very little roamers. Light on resists. Good xp for you. plat drops 12+..<br />
<br />
Veksar - skip it. Great xp, high end of the resist spectrum. Good xp if you can cut it. Nameds drop nice loot if you can cut it. Also some things fear and in general a pita.<br />
<br />
I'm generally restating what has already been said in a condensed form. Check out the level 65 hunting grounds section I don't read the 60 ones but I prolly need to, some REALLY amazing guides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">CT zone. Farm tae ew blood. On Tunare they sell for in and around 1kpp. Even higher though I never pay more than 1k for mine. /shrug<br />
<br />
Even better if you work trade skills (one of the best ways of making plat if ya got a bazaar mule to sell your wares) you can use the blood to make shields and weapons. They sell for 3-4k on my server. That's how I made my money for all my spells and armour. ;)<br />
<br />
Since neither of ya have paci what you need to do is to root pull. Root one mob and leave him unscratched so he doesn't summon and kill the one mob that rushes ya first.<br />
<br />
May take a bit to get used to but easy once ya get the hang of it. And you have a zone right by ya if anything goes wrong. Thing is you can sometimes get lucky and loot 6-7 bloods in an hour and sometimes get only one or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you could try nurga for gear upgrades also and some cash does drop here (maybe 100-200pp an hour each if you get lucky).  The dungeon wouldn't be too hard for your level (droga probably would be), and the quests from the RARE drops are VERY nice rewards for the effort.<br />
<br />
After nurga becomes trivial (around mid 60s) you could head to droga and do the same thing as in nurga (mobs drop a considerable amount of cash..100-300pp an hour each isnt unreasonable to expect).  The other benefit is you both can get ally chardok faction and get regal bands of bathezid quite easily, and possibly spirit wracked cords.  Make sure you check out the droga quests also; the rewards are very, very nice.<br />
<br />
Veksar would be a nice spot too, but I would wait until you both are around 62 or add more people to your group.  I would say the same is true of inner acrylia, but of course you could try them to see :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;when both of join groups we are usually nitpicked on and ppl comment on our gear&quot;<br />
<br />
Kind of off topic, but that really sucks.  I wouldn't group with anyone that is so preoccupied with gear, especially for non-tank classes.<br />
<br />
Now, Droga and Veksar will probably be your best places to hunt.  They suck for xp at 65 but at least you get some xp while farming cash and usable loot.  Both zones have drops for numerous armor slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">LoY - Nadox Zone. Decent xp and nice cash/gem drops with the occasional decent gear drop. Shaman/Bst 59-60 combo would clean up and have some decent fun in most of the zone. Careful of the casters though - their gate and re-gate and gate-yet-again gets annoying.<br />
<br />
As for folks you are grouping with making fun of your gear - shame on them. I can't count the times I have taken someone I met in a group who needed gear upgrades (really needed them) and passed off something rotting on a twink that was an upgrade to this person's main. To actually make comparisons to their gear compared to a twink of their's is rude ... unthinkably so for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah I would say any of the following places would be good to hunt even with subpar so to say gear.  Hell I still have some really sorry equipment but it does not prevent me from being able to do what I do best slow and kick the snot out of my targets.  Its the person not the gear that makes the character.  I'd take a shaman or any class in cloth armour that knew thier class well over someone that didnt know thier class well. <br />
<br />
Ok now my thoughts on those hunting grounds.<br />
<br />
All these zones drop High end spell research componets (WATCH for rare components as some are worth several K platium) Most every named from these zones have two drops.  One being the common drop and the other being the rare drop.  As well I have found it quite often when you get the named to spawn about 50% of the time the named will spawn a second time the very next time.  So after the named spawns just do go walking off untill he or his PH spawns.<br />

<br />
This zone is SIMPLE as hell to get around in just keep close eye on your invise.  If you get in trouble your best bet is to root your targets and run around corner if the cast and camp out.  Running to the exit is really not much of an option with the number of casters on the way out.  They tend to nuke you dead before you can get that far LOL.  CR is quite easy though.  Lots of room to re do invise if starts to drop and nothing as of yet has seen though invise<br />

Back in the North West Corner what is known as the church is a very nice pull spot to get to 4 named with no worry of roamers and only couple extra mobs to pull to get to the named.  These named as well drop several items ussuable by both bst and shaman.  This zone really is quite simple if you have IVU potions and watch your invise closely.  Recovery is easy though getting cleric not already here is bit of a pain. Only mobs you can not Invis passed one way or another is the Highborns and they are pretty far in.  At your levels you probley dont want to mess with them yet any ways.  Use your Magic/Cold damage spells as poison and diease 99% time wont stick to the undead mobs.<br />

This is nice area though the margin for error is small if mess up your going have a hard time recovering much less getting a rez.  Your going eat a no rez death most likly.  Not had much luck yet with drops here.  Most mobs here go down pretty easy compared to some places but they will add up fast if not careful.<br />

Mobs here a spead out pretty good.  Most mobs will not see though invise except the undead ones though they are hard to tell if they are undead. (no undead in the temple area though)  CR are pretty simple though hard to get cleric there if they are not already there.  Here I got both my quest items for Blood of Nadox and couple of nice drops from couple named in the temple section of the zone.<br />

Be careful wondering this zone till you get use to it.  As there are couple of pit falls that are hiddne that will make your life a pain.  Exsplore with your gating person first and gate out if need be.  Personally I have not been here very much but my wife has and has got several nice drops.<br />
<br />
I like all these zones and most are not that camped now days with LDoN out.  I wish I had a list of named like I do for droga though that was a rare find I had there.  Only other list of named I have is for Dulak and Nurga.  Though there are some nice items there they are not near as good as these and are not really able to get any exp there.  If any are interested just let me know and I'll post that info as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just as a different way, have you done many LDoN adventures?  I saw where you like to duo and I think the spots named here are extraordinary, but if I were in your shoes and knowing what I know today, I would spend as much time in adventures saving points as I possibly could.<br />
<br />
The experience is decent, I usually end up with about 200 pp or better an adventure, the nameds can drop very nice gear, I get points to save for gear I truly want, and I can up my figurine after every 10 adventures in the same spot.  I find this pretty much a win-win situation.  AND since my rl son plays a beastlord, I know for a fact people love beastlords and shaman in the same group.<br />
<br />
For the days you feel like just duoing, all of the above is great.  I myself head to Rathe Mountains with my son's beastlord, camp the top of the hill in HG valley, and root/nuke, pet kill everything we can find.  We loot everything and usually end up with about 1Kpp every 1.5 hours.  The zone is almost totally empty and we can have as many as 9 hgs at a time, but it is extremely easy, a tad dead boring, but fills the bill for pp at a clipped pace.<br />
<br />
Another thing you MIGHT want to do is start farming shards for the VT key.  You two can easily do AC, DSP, Sanctus, ME, the Grey, Scarlet.  You would receive some experience, and get that dingle-farthing key quest out of your hair early.<br />
<br />
Then for both of you, start the 8th shawl quest.  The first 5 or 6 steps should be easy for both of you.  You will work your tradeskills, and the end shawl is something you will be proud to have at any level.<br />
<br />
I hate to do this to you, but as a shaman use ALL of your skills.  Work your alchemy up (and yes I hate it as much as the rest of you) and make potions.  Put them on your trader (name the trader &quot;The Potion Master&quot; or something silly) ... and make pp.  You will be amazed at the amount of money you can make with the right potions.  I don't know your server, so it may be hit and miss as to the potions that will work, but I do make a fair amount of pp that way, and I am sleeping while I do it  :D <br />
 <br />
Last, and I do profusely apologize for the length of this post, for any person that gives you a hard time about your gear, tell the culprits politely &quot;I know we are subpar at this moment, but we have been away and just now returned to enjoy the game again.  Thank you for your concern&quot;.  If that doesn't work, turn into bear form, look them square in the eye and tell them &quot;Bite me and choke on the fur!&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just as an added spot for farming cash drops, at lvl 60 you can single pull most mobs, and with a gate potion for the beastlord, you could consider doing pits in Velks.  The named mobs themselves don't drop much good loot (except lute of the howler, but given your situation, I'd suggest steering clear of Khelkar unless you have a cleric and possibly tank with you - he's hard to slow, and you need to be able to tank a mob that will be hitting you for around 200-250 a pop fairly fast - with the right AA and equipment he's a lot easier, of course) but 2 or 3 hours you can come out with around 1k each in cash (after selling paws etc)<br />
<br />
Another option with little competition is Dragon Necropolis.  You should be able to easily duo the entrance mobs, and there's a semi-rare chance for a phase spider carapace to drop - still sells around 10k on Tunare, I'd assume similar in other places, as it's a decent BP still. Also decent pp drops with occasional Velious Quest gems.  As you get more confident, you can move deeper and work on the rats for Velium weapons - the Priceless, Worn, etc still sell ok in bazaar, and sometimes you can get leather armour pieces that may (or may not) upgrade the BL. <br />
*note: not quest leather armour, just no drop stuff.</div></div><hr />
