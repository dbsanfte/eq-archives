<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i remember reading somewhere, that there is a command that will transfer damage done to me, onto my pet. How is this done? can it be done with a horse? <br />
<br />
do horses have HP? or do they just fade like a spell being dispelled? can i be dispelled off my horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, True Spirit pet will /shield you from time to time.  This is a warrior ability, and he uses it.  He decides when; we have no control over it.  Horses, being pacifists by nature, don't do this.<br />
<br />
Normally, targeting a horse will redirect the targeting to the horse's rider.  They do have HP, allegedly.  There are riderless horses popping up frequently in Plane o' Knowledge, but since you can't hurt anything there, it's hard to check.  I have yet to see one unmounted outside that zone (not counting stables in Bazaar.)<br />
<br />
I've sat on my horse through a barrage of annuls and dispells, it was the only &quot;buff&quot; I had when all was done.  Fighting the consorts in PoN, the paralyzing poison they have will knock you off your horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Horses are definitely not dispellable.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule dispells your first twelve buffs when she hits 50%, and horses don't go away regardless of where they are in your buff list.<br />
<br />
If it will remain through that, nothing is gonna dispell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm, imagine if they sold actual warhorses, with barding and such, that could take damage for you similar to /shield?  Of course, there would be a penalty if the horse dies, like you can't re-summon until you zone... so it's not just a free rune.<br />
<br />
A warrior should be able to get a suitable mount that will fight with him... that would be a great way to improve the warrior class in a unique fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, that would be awesome, but the knights would howl like a druid chased by unsnared mobs if they didn't get it, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The new lizard we keep seeing looks pretty mean.  Maybe it has some attack features.</div></div><hr />
