'Cept o course yu Testament of Vaneer Barbie dolls.  Anyways, me's dun wot every self-respectin troll wud do and used da spellbook ta help me cook sum gnome-kebabs.<br />
<br />
In its place me's called down me spirit guides ta hold me mojo fer wen me needs dem.  Me still buildin da frame and stuff ta contain dese spirits but methinx yu'll get da idea.  Each of da spirit-shields will hold one spell-mojo, which me also gonna be hammerin outta shape.  Me's put one of dem, da new Spirit of Wolf mojo, on da spirit-shield to da left of da Great Bear.<br />
<br />

<br />
Me not gonna be stoppin at the spellbook but it be all me's had time ta do so far.  Wen me dun (hopefully around da time it goes live), me will be sharin it wif all shaman so we can stop usin pansy books ta summon our bad juju.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;Cow&quot; eh?  Dat &quot;cow&quot; be an OX if troof be known:<br />
<br />
N00b_01 tells you, &quot;CoW plz kk thx&quot;<br />
You tell N00b_01, &quot;Dinna hava a cow man&quot;<br />
<br />
As fer replacin it wif an eagle, we dinna get no Spirit of Eagle mojo, dat be dr00d stuph.  Me woz kinda thinkin along da lines of:<br />
<br />
Bear (bear-form, con-buff)<br />
Wolf (SoW, pet)<br />
Ox (con-buff)<br />
Snake (cha-buff, poisons)<br />
Cat (agi-buff)<br />
<br />
Da spirits dat missed da cut were:<br />
<br />
Rhino<br />
Monkey/Brute<br />
<br />
Dat why no eagle in der, altho der is eagle.  Da spirit-shield directly abuv da snake be an eagle spirit shield.<br />
<br />
Glad yu peeps like it tho.  It gonna be nice ta hav a proper shaman interface.<br />

<br />
Me hasna totally decided wot me's gonna do wif da spell icons demselves, so da green glow around da wolf-paw be only a test.  Me agrees it duz kinda clash against da background but it probly gonna hafta.  If da icons blended in, it cud be hard ta see exactly wot spells are actually on da page.<br />
<br />
Me's havin a lotta fun makin it, and learnin PhotoShop at da same time.  Btw, me ain't an &amp;ltoutrageous french accent&amp;gtarteest&amp;lt/outrageous french accent&amp;gt so all da original artwork be pilfered frum all over da place.  Me just puttin it tagetha.

Btw, if you do an internet search, you might find some free-ware Clip-Art type stuff that you can use w/o worrying about Copyright issues.  Maybe the graphics won't be as nice, but you won't have to worry about the Tribunal coming after you. ;)<br />

<br />
Hot Buttons <br />
http://mywebpages.comcast.net/brek/EQ/NewUI/SmallHB/smallhb.JPG <br />
<br />
On the left, all the hot buttons are cut in half.  Figured how many time people actually click on them.  I pretty much use my keyboard.  <br />
<br />
On the right.  I have the primary weapon on the top.  I have the right bracer slot next (easy to change to left).  I have the necklass next.  Then I have the inventory 1 and 2 slot listed next.<br />
<br />
Hot Button Mod (Zip) (http://mywebpages.comcast.net/brek/EQ/NewUI/SmallHB/smallhb.zip)<br />
<br />
Additional mod I could think of ...<br />
Maybe add numbers next to the buttons?<br />
Cut the Inventory Items in half size.  Could get up to 15 additional buttons, but they would really be small.<br />
<br />
Spell Gems <br />

Hopefully I have enough bandwidth to pass this information out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Oooh are you saying you can have more than 10 hot buttons in a bank?<br />
<br />
If so, presumably you have to use the mouse to activate the ones higher than number 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">No one to my knowledge has been able to add buttons to a screen and get them to function.  Guess what I was trying to say is you could get up to 15 more inventory items (being items equiped or the 8 inventory slots) to be displayed.  But again they would be really small.<br />
<br />
Keeping the same design for the hot button.  I added the HP line to the right of the window... but kind of got lost on what I wanted next.  I know weight I want in the window, and was thinking of listing the resist numbers.  Maybe the name of the group memember and the percentage of HP the group members are at in it too, although they will need to do something about how to target a group member via a hot button?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">&lt;b&gt;FIXED!!!&lt;/b&gt;<br />

<br />
LOL, now we duz hav a sow!  Tanx Grippa! :D<br />
<br />
Gud work Brek :)  Me woz also plannin on puttin common clicky and main inventory slots onto da hotbutton panel.  Not bein able ta bind a hotkey to 'em limits its use but wot da hey.<br />
<br />
Okies, below be a real alternative to da cow.  Me's not had much time ta work on dis in last few daze but me has added da PageUp/PageDn buttons.<br />
<br />
Da main skin shud be ready in time fer wen da new UI goes live (patch on 24th), but more dan likely most of da spell icons will be da same (der a helluva lot of dem).  Me'd need access to a 60th shammy wif a full spellbook on Test ta match icons ta spells (not ta mention da headache of icons bein shared by multiple spells and classes, blech).  Dem gonna take sum time ta finish up gud an proper.<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;Instructions for loading skins/mods in game:<br />
1. make a directory under \everquest\uifiles Name it whatever you wish.<br />
<br />
2. Copy everything from \everquest\uifiles\default to  \everquest\uifiles\ (your new folder)<br />
<br />
3. Down load the file you want and un-zip it to \everquest\uifiles\(your new folder) Replace the file that is there with the new one.<br />
<br />
4. Log on to the test server<br />
<br />
5. use /loadskin (folder name)&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
When I got to the /loadskin foldername part after I typed it in I got kicked back to desktop....tried logging in again and got sent back to desktop after I tried to play my shaman.<br />

Am I doing something wrong...? <br />
It could be a cupla things.  Da new UI ain't workin fer everyone it seems.  Ta get bak in, open yer eqclient.ini file and change da line dat sez &quot;newUI=TRUE&quot; to &quot;newUI=FALSE&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, dat necro skin woz made a while ago ('bout three weeks).  Since den, VI has made lotsa changes to da interface which may hav broken da skin.<br />

Me shur it'll calm down in a few weeks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Actually, there's a new batch of files in your EQ directory - UI(character name).ini - these record the last skin you loaded.  Edit that file, and change UIskin=default (or one that works).  Chances are, there's an xml error in the skin you loaded, and you're reloading it every time you log on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I figured out how to get back on. Was trying out different skins and I stumbled on one which was completely red in design (looked pretty nice) but when I went to my inventory it said something like the following...<br />
<br />
Playername1234567<br />
HP : 9999/9999<br />
AC : 0<br />
ATK: 0<br />
<br />
and all my stats/resists were at 255.<br />
<br />
Wierd thing is my shaman went from being a 45 shaman to a 60 shadowknight who follows mithaniel marr.<br />

Might you be able to release the book itself as is, and then the icons as able?</div></div><hr />

mainly the old icons, with some identification added to a several of them.<br />
<br />

No one to my knowledge has been able to add buttons to a screen and get them to function.  Guess what I was trying to say is you could get up to 15 more inventory items (being items equiped or the 8 inventory slots) to be displayed.  But again they would be really small.<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of my UI, hotbuttons and inventory items are int he lower right<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">As fer replacin it wif an eagle, we dinna get no Spirit of Eagle mojo, dat be dr00d stuph. Me woz kinda thinkin along da lines of: <br />
<br />
Bear (bear-form, con-buff) <br />
Wolf (SoW, pet) <br />
Ox (con-buff) <br />
Snake (cha-buff, poisons) <br />
Cat (agi-buff) <br />
<br />
Da spirits dat missed da cut were: <br />
<br />
Rhino <br />
Monkey/Brute <br />
<br />
Dat why no eagle in der, altho der is eagle. Da spirit-shield directly abuv da snake be an eagle spirit shield. <br />

Shamanistic magic is supposed to work through totem animals - each with its own nature.  Unfortunately - Sony's limited imagination only gave us access to some of them and named even fewer in the spell titles.  Regeneration, for example, is attributed to the Stag.  Searched yahoo for totem - here's one list:<br />
