Rytan (the spell guy): <br />
<br />
Here’s a break down of the problem as we see it with the current live version of Sprit of the Panther. <br />
<br />
The base DPS for an application of panther is roughly 100 (counting crits from applicable Aas) for a focused duration of about 16 ticks or 1:36 seconds.  Theoretically with full focus and extended enhancement, perfect targeting, etc, one shaman can keep it up on 16 players.  I don’t really think that’s a reasonable balance point though, so lets call it 12 for the sake of argument.<br />
<br />
DPS/Target = ~100<br />
Target/Shaman = 12<br />
DPS/Shaman = 1,200<br />
<br />
It actually takes a while for this to get going as it’s being cast on several people, so really it ends up being about half that if you don’t reapply it to the first target.  So roughly 600 DPS for 7800 mana, which most shaman should be able to handle for at least those 12 applications, and in most cases longer.<br />
<br />
600 DPS is higher then even wizards in most situations depending on gear etc.  Given that shaman have never primarily been a DPS class, and have a number of other useful abilities to bring to the table 600 is just plain too high.  The spell needs to be reigned in. <br />
<br />
That being said I’m not dead set on (or even particularly fond of) the incantation that presently sits on test.  Other possible solutions I’ve seen that I think have merit are:<br />
 <br />
1: Lower the recast to 10-12 seconds, lower the damage/proc so that the spell will top out at about 300 DPS under relatively conducive circumstances. <br />
<br />
2: Make the spell group, triple the mana cost, add a 50-52 second recast, mark the spell as no MGB. <br />
<br />
I think either of those would be viable alternatives given minor tweaks to the actual values.<br />
 <br />
I’m open to any more feedback you have on the subject.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I will reply here and everyone who cares can use my argument over there, I don't really care:<br />
<br />
While this is a very reasonably calculation for 1 Shaman, Rytan, this does not apply to Shaman #3, let alone #4 on a raid. The spell is limited by the number of available recipients TOTAL.<br />
<br />
Second, this is damage dealt by, both, the Shaman AND the recipient. If one of the recipients goes afk or just doesn't pay attention, the DPS goes down significantly. I have only limited control over the damage you're are generously attributing to me in your calculation above.<br />
<br />
Third, no piece of gear, foci or AAs will increase this DPS figure we are assuming. Its function and damage output is static and remains mostly unvaried throughout a whole expansion(this is assuming we get a higher version of the spell every expansion, otherwise it would be even worse) independant of my progression and advancement in-game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, 300dps for casting it on 12 people.  Easier to dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow this is huge.  Rytan recognizes the limitations of casting time, efficiency, and build up.  <br />
<br />
I am glad to see that he is endeavoring to compare typical situation to typical situation; that's better than the max possible burst dps scenarios that I was worried about.<br />
<br />
He is not yet paying enough attention to the difference between cooperative damage (caused by buffs) and direct damage (caused by nukes / dots / melee).  <br />
<br />
600 DPS is higher then even wizards in most situations depending on gear etc.  Given that shaman have never primarily been a DPS class, and have a number of other useful abilities to bring to the table 600 is just plain too high.  The spell needs to be reigned in. This doesn't say enough.  Is 550 too high, also?  Is 400 too high?  Is 100 too high?  300 to 350 is certainly achievable with dots (and the damage continues even after you get summoned and killed).  So it would be good to see his sense of where the line is between &quot;too high&quot; and &quot;not too high.&quot;<br />
<br />
And he is considering various ways of reducing that achievable dps.  <br />
<br />
I'm heading over to the SOE board now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The way I read it, he was giving his target for the dps of the spell.<br />

&quot;1: Lower the recast to 10-12 seconds, lower the damage/proc so that the spell will top out at about 300 DPS under relatively conducive circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
The 300 dps is the only solid number he's giving.  I'm assuming thats his target for max dps of this spell.  Same as having a max of 3x targets to cast on via recast timer.<br />
It looks to me like 300dps is the spot he wants for max dps.  If the changes to dot aggro really happen, that a number already attainable and sustainable, without the hassle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree and that was my point.  If DPS is same as DoTs... I'll cast DoTs... heck, they even lowering the aggro on DoTs.  And then, I at least don't have to be consta-clicking to provide some equal DPS.<br />
<br />
Turn Panther into a 10/30/45/60 minute buff of some sort in my opinion.... of course, of varying proc damage depending on spell length.<br />
<br />
At least I am not forced to EITHER click a DoT &quot;OR&quot; Panther/Leopard.<br />
<br />
Both can be running concurrently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Panther: 650 mana, 3 second cast time, 2.5 second reset <br />
<br />
Base calculations are: 5.5 seconds per cast / 60 seconds = 10.9 casts per minute @ 7085 mana<br />
<br />
Then ... rinse and repeat the cycle.<br />
<br />
Theoretically with full focus and extended enhancement, perfect targeting, etc, one shaman can keep it up on 16 players. I don’t really think that’s a reasonable balance point though, so lets call it 12 for the sake of argument.  <br />
<br />
This is where SOE/Rytan slide in the misinformation. Theoretical is nice and, as we all know, has absolutely nothing to do with the reality of game play. We know this ... and we know, since SOE does NOT play the game, SOE does NOT know this. Yet, Rytan comes back with a &quot;calming quantifier&quot; by saying ... &quot;so lets call it 12 for the sake of argument.&quot;<br />
<br />
For the sake of argument, you are still way off base, Rytan. First you presume a shaman is keeping this up on 12 targets. This ONLY applies to a raid situation and if that were the case, even with a 30 second recast time, the trick would be to simply BOT buff raid tanks with using as many shaman as needed. Check your character logs. There are tons of shaman bots there. Check your player logs ... since L/Panth the shaman player base has actually increased.<br />
<br />
So, to the single group encounters. Those events where a shaman is debuffing, slowing, buffing, spot healing AND trying to keep up L/Panth ... changing the recast time does absolutely nothing but require that shaman to move it to the back of the spell book or delete it. Please file under AVATAR ... version 3 and 4. Given the lower duration it is even worse than AVATAR/FA. It is only usefull when engaged in combat yet a long duration recast prevents casting on group tanks/melee members during actual combat ... which doesn't last long enough.<br />
<br />
While it sounds good to claim shaman are now doing &quot;1200&quot; dps (based on your inaccurate assumption of maintain a 12 tank cycle) the real question is how much does the additional 100 dps add to the tank cast upon it and how does this dps compare to your max damage dealing wizard. <br />
<br />
Are these tanks now outdamaging wizards?<br />
<br />
Will they outdamage that wizard when he tosses in manaburn? (Don't even bother answering this one ... it is tossed in here to make you go &quot;Huh?&quot; ... because it has absolutely no relevance to the base question ... which, in terms of these spells, should have nothing to do with wizard damage comparisons.)<br />
<br />
Your &quot;assumption&quot; clumps the total potential damage added by these spells under ideal situations and then compares them to a class that has absolutely nothing to do with the point of these spells.<br />
<br />
My freakin' god - the obvious glitch in this whole episode was the over-effect these spells had on pets. That is where it should stop. It is where it must stop! Micro-managing because someone compared the theoritical overall DPS addition to a &quot;single wizard's output&quot; is beyond comprehension.<br />
<br />
Don't even follow this line of thought a step further. It is stupid ... wake up and get perspective!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xaas Boneweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">option 2 would allow you to dot/nuke still. So this would stack with current DPS, I don't think thats a bad idea at all.  But then I don't actually play anymore, I am not overly fond of the recast. Although an AA that let you mem a spell, with no recast would be nice to see added, course that would let you cast it 2 times pretty fast though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is what I posted in response to Rytan.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
1. Why didn't you realize this spell could be cast on 12-16 folks in quick succession when you release it?<br />
<br />
Thats exactly the first thing I thought of doing.<br />
<br />
2. How much dps does an enchanter give the raid by hasting them 70% for over an hour?<br />
<br />
Since shaman haste is never used on a raid, I had though of panther as our big dps contributer.<br />
<br />
3. Why are you considering that 600 dps as something a shaman provides? Do you count our other str/dex/etc. buffs as personal dps? Why is this different?<br />
<br />
We are a buffing class. We provide many things that add dps. Its unfair to compare this to a wizards personal dps. WIZARDS STACK !!! Shaman panthering a raid DO NOT STACK. Thats a completely unfair comparison.<br />
<br />
4. Recast times are... for lack of better words, unacceptable to 99% of the shaman's out there. We absolutely hate them. It greatly detracts from our ability to react to the game. Instead, we find ourselves reacting to artifical timers. There must be a better way.<br />
<br />
5. What is the purpose of this spell? Is the purpose of Panther to let a shaman add 300 dps at a raid? 200 dps at a raid? Why not just give us a low resist dot + an another hour long dps buff? Or any number of other combinations. There must be a way that 2-300 dps can be provided to a raid without timers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  <br />
<br />
The only functionality we'd lose is casting it on pets.  You could still use the spell in raids on pc's, you'd just need a cooperative raid leader.<br />
<br />
Think about it. They're nerfing it BECAUSE it's so easy to cast on so many people in a raid.  This would make that less so. But it would still be possible to get it on as many people as you need and it would be alot less annoying.  With a 30 minute duration you'd have time to pass through each melee group before you engaged.  Take pets out of the equation, but make it a fire and forget weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ArminiusCheruskii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The group buff option is not that bad, but I would like the duration increased to a bit more than 60 second base time. How about at least double duration, triple mana cost and group only? Can still be effective on raids, just spread out the shaman properly.<br />
edit: a 30 minute duration to allow you to move along all groups defeats the whole purpose of retuning the spell and achieves exactly what they do NOT want, perhaps even easier.<br />
However with a 3-4 minute recast it allows it to be used on more than half a mob in group situations.</div></div><hr />

Number 1 complaint I have seen on multiple threads/forums was we didn't like having a spell more annoying then Avatar line.<br />

Shame I have to make the point..... but still.... relying on a cooperative raid leader to make shaman useful is not the way we should be advocating our spells are set up... If you turn off TGB you need to have the shaman moved from group to group in order to cast it... why penalize us? For ****s sake people, every time you open your mouths you want to either make it harder for us to just play the game, or you want to add more work to the raid leader who I am fairly sure has more to do than say to him/herself &quot;Uh oh, shaman panther buffs are about to drop. I better sit here and move the shaman every 1 min for the next 8-12 minutes depending on how big the raid is&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Heck... 3-4 Shaman per raid.... just setup 3-4 melee groups w/ 1 Shaman in each group.  Put the Druids, Wizards, Necros, Mages, Enchanters, wetc in their own groups.<br />
<br />
I suppose you or your raid leader never worried about group make-ups when you raid?<br />
<br />
No reason to keep switching Shaman in and out of groups to be be effective.  Unless... you are expecting that you should be able to cast your spell on EVERY single melee person in the raid all by your self.<br />
<br />
Bottomline:  They aren't going to allow it in its current form.  They say it is too much DPS.  WE ALL don't want a spell more annoying then Avatar.  A group buff for 30 minutes is A. not annoying and B. can still provide DPS.  At some point you need to come up with some form of a compromise.... I am just trying to be open-minded.<br />
<br />
AND.... it allows them the ability to create single target spell versions with a re-cast time if they soooooo choose to.</div></div><hr />

With a group version, there's no reason you have to chain cast it, nor would it leave you OOM.  The effeciency is also much higher then any of the current DoTs.  Also, Two very large advantages it has over DoTs are that 1) it's practically unresistable and 2) it's aggro free for the shaman.<br />

Unless you make it automatically land on pets, I doubt any shaman will be able to cast it on their own pet.   I doubt many Shaman have Pet Affinity anywhere near the top of their must have AAs.  I will not get it until I have absolutely nothing else reasonably useful to buy.<br />

The pure joy of Leopard/Panther is the fact it generates nearly instant DPS when you want it, where you want it.  There is a certain amount of skill involved actually keeping the buff on several people while healing, curing, rolling out Champion etc, and not going OOM during raid events.  They need to at least keep the entertaining aspect of Leopard/Panther intact and still make it worthwhile to cast.<br />

Ohh, I understand.  I also understand alot more in regards to the differences for the spell in different forms in regards to solo/duo'ing, groups, and raids where there are 1-2 Shaman vs. 4-5 Shaman...<br />
<br />
... and when there are buff-bot Shamans with a hotkey set-up JUST to cast certain spells.</div></div><hr />

300dps. from casting it on everyone? that means absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
So roughly 600 DPS for 7800 mana, which most shaman should be able to handle for at least those 12 applications, and in most cases longer. <br />
<br />
7800 mana.....I'm a time-flagged raiding shaman. and that would bottom out my mana pool. canni5, pained memory, and a mod rod would only restore half of that mana, then I'm OOM for the recast of canni5.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure a majority of the EQ population ISN'T time flagged. and therefore, their manapool isn't remotely near this.<br />
<br />
this isn't a reasonable argument.<br />
<br />
in my mind, up the mana cost on the spell, leave damage, proc rate, and recast timers alone.</div></div><hr />

The pure joy of Leopard/Panther is the fact it generates nearly instant DPS when you want it, where you want it.  There is a certain amount of skill involved actually keeping the buff on several people while healing, curing, rolling out Champion etc, and not going OOM during raid events.

Stop offering wimpy compromises.<br />
<br />
Sure, any compromise is better than what's currently on test.  But dental surgery is better than that, too.  <br />
<br />
The key thing is:  Rytan has come out to play.<br />
<br />
He has offered a thoughtful, reasoned argument for the first time in I don't know how long.  It might be just a momentary abberation on his part, but we have a post from him that is endeavoring to say &quot;Here's what I am thinking about this spell, and why.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chutoi is usually as abrasive as hell, but he is managing to be acerbic rather than his usual foaming at the mouth self, and is endeavoring to engage with Rytan about this matter.  Go go Chutoi!<br />
<br />
So many people are concluding that we the best thing to do is  reckon that we should end up somewhere between where we are now and the ruination of this spell line currently on test, which almost went live.  But that's not our best move at all.  Our best move is to have Rytan offer further explanations.<br />
<br />
He has so far suggested that 600 dps from Panther is too powerful, compared to the 600 dps a wizard can produce by nuking.  <br />
<br />
And we need to have him explain why cooperative damage, produced by buffs, should be compared to direct damage, produced by nukes.  And why it shouldn't rather be compared to to coooperative damage, produced by other buffs.  Like haste.  <br />
<br />
We can actually come out of this encounter very well indeed.  If:  <br />
<br />
1.  you stop assuming that the spell must be nerfed, so let's offer suggestions about how to nerf it only partly as bad as what's on test.  Don't begin by assuming that it has to be nerfed at all.  Let Rytan speak for himself and show why it needs to be nerfed, instead.<br />
<br />
And if:<br />
<br />
2.  you ask Rytan to explain things.  Ask questions.  Lots of questions.  Not nasty questions, with lots of sarcastic rhetoric:  but real questions.  Since he has decided he wants to offer thoughtful explanations about what he is up to, ask questions to give him the opportunity to work through some of the very questions we have been working through.</div></div><hr />

To me this is requiring Shaman to &quot;stay the way they were&quot; prior to panther while other classes have gotten some VERY cool upgrades to spells with this expansion with NO nerf.  <br />
Also, if you decide to go the other way and spam panther all day long, you have become a bard without their new ability to twist and play songs without mashing.  Guess what?  They hated it and we will too.  <br />
So in effect, either we get carpal tunnel and like it, or play like we always have, UNLIKE OTHER CLASSES.<br />
Rytan, as profesors say to students, step back and see the forest through the trees.  Look at what your proposal is to the shaman at this point, then look at what other classes get and tell me what we are getting out of this deal?<br />

<br />
Thats great that one shaman can do alot of dps on a theoretical raid.  But the only way to get more dps from a shaman is to have more people to buff. So if we have 5 shaman and 5 wizards, who does more dps. the 5 shaman buffing that cant stack buffs or 5 wizards that can nuke.<br />

This past few weeks regarding this spell has been a big april fools joke to me.  My personal dps hasnt increased one damn bit, and shouldnt ever be put up against a wizards dps.<br />

<br />
/duck<br />
no flame, sorry, but it would require everyone to have pet affinity which is quite unrealistic I think. Also it would waste a buff slot for those that do not want it (annoyance level depending on the new duration). And lastly you have a stupid, greyed out gem sitting in your spell bar again, unfun.<br />
<br />
I do not think that the 600 dps a shaman can maybe reach in a raid, under almost ideal circumstances, with bad stacking of shamans too, are warranting a nerf at all. Fix the pet proc issue and thats it. Anything else will most likely destroy the spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you read that a little closer..referencing MGB would tend to say it's a &quot;group buff&quot; not a group ONLY buff.  and the recast is just shy of the duration.  So if they do THIS version they can take the scroll and shove it up their collective arses.<br />

We put bards in tank groups all the time for their group only spells.  This would be no different.  (Currently raiding RS king/queen, Inku'ta)<br />
<br />
I guess you must have different raid styles than my guild.  DPS groups are the standard, not the exception.  And 9/10 are healed only by a shaman now.  Even if your shaman groups could be 1 druid, 1 shaman, and 4 melee, a group cast spell would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the recast does nothing to solve the grouping situation of control of when the spell is cast .... for example, a puller has 3 mobs incoming and you want to Panther people as the pull is incoming ....<br />
<br />
With a recast, the recast dictates WHEN you cast the spell ....<br />
<br />
Without a recast, you could see the &quot;Incoming, uh oh, 3 mobs&quot; message, Panther the DPS as the pull is incoming, and get to slowing as soon as the mobs get there, then worry about backup healing (not having to watch a stupid icon to see if it's repoped yet) ...<br />
<br />
I am opposed to a recast time in any way shape or form, even if the Panther spell is changed to a Group spell, your group only, no MGB ... as soon as you have a recast time, you lose control of timing the cast ...<br />

<br />
<br />
Let me wait until my Raid Leader stops the hysterical laughter and I'll let you know.  <br />
<br />
In reality, moving shaman around for group shrink is a pita enough for the raid leaders.  If it's vital to the event, yea he'd swap us around.  If it's not, then it's extremely unlikely that he'd bother with it and at least we would only have to do it once at the beginning of the raid. <br />
<br />
Can you imagine the timing and positioning coordination (depending on the spell's range) during a large raid that would be required for the group changes, casting and refresh in order to make it worth a small portion of it's effectiveness?  /rolls eyes    I'm sure some raid leaders/shaman might try it once, but I highly doubt that it would be a common practice.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with single target group member spells like shrink.  I do have a problem if it is a group spell buff, especially for the level 61 version. How many level 61's have done AA so that they have pet affinity?  Why even bother with adjusting pets to proc like PCs if the spell is going to be a group spell (not single target group only)?  It would be more fair, in that case, to allow the pets to proc like mad again if you've dedicated that much of your time/exp to get AA pet affinity pre-69.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I'll be blunt.  I don't much care that the non-raiders are excited about group only spells.  The version that we have now is fine for groups.  Making this spell group only is a HUGE screwing for raiders.  Mobs now dictate group make-up.  Melee heavy groups are a thing of the past on current raid content.  YOU CANNOT EFFECTIVELY MAKE A MELEE HEAVY GROUP ON MOST CURRENT RAID MOBS.  Why?  Adds, offtanking, group heals, chains, etc.  It's too much for one cleric to handle.  The shaman is usually doing heals/cures and not full time panther.  Add another healer?  Fine, then you're down to 3 melee for a group spell.<br />
 <br />
The fact is, many raids, especially in anguish, you need 1-2 melee, 1-2 casters, and 1-2 healers per group.  Group-only Panther is a complete waste for that group.<br />
 <br />
How often do you have a shaman in the MT group?  (Hint, not real often).  A well designed MT group should be 2 clerics, a bard, 2 warriors, and either an enchanter, druid, or paladin.  You can't hit the one person who is going to be on the mob the full time of the encounter from outside the group.  It helps with agro.  Force people to switch in and out in the raid to use Panther?  That's total crap.<br />
 <br />
For that matter, I have yet to hear from Rytan why the potential shaman dps is such a huge issue.  Let's say we have 16 melee, 1 wizard and 1 shaman.  The wizard can do 600 dps, the shaman (for 1.5 minutes) can do 16000 dps, and then maybe 300ish.  Okay, sounds kinda insane, right?  What if we have 4 shaman?  We have a wizard doing 600 dps, the shaman doing an average of 400 dps each (because we can't DoT in high end raids--we can't land **SMURF** for dps.)<br />
 <br />
It's a BUFF. I'll put the next bit in caps so it's fully clear.<br />
 <br />
NO MATTER HOW MANY SHAMAN YOU GET ON RAIDS, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PANTHER DAMAGE IS CAPPED BY PEOPLE SWINGING.<br />
 <br />
Wizards stack.  2 wizards = 1200 dps.  3 wizards = 1800 dps.  4 wizards = 2400 dps.<br />
 <br />
1 shaman = 2 shaman = 3 shaman = 4shaman = same panthter dps.  It's more sustainable with more shaman casting it, but the damage caps to exactly the same amount.<br />
 <br />
So what are we nerfing here?  The ability of a shaman to drain their mana and create a spike of dps.  That is ALL you're nerfing, and I have yet to see a reasonable explanation of why.<br />
 <br />
And if you must nerf this spell (which I happen to think is total crap, but par for the course), I want to know why you have to do it by swinging the nerf bat.  You can adjust the duration and mana cost to do the EXACT same thing.  Limit the number of casts.  Let's use that situation I mentioned before.  5 minute buff (including focus extension) and 1000 mana.<br />
 <br />
Most shaman will be able to cast it 7 times in a row, and maybe 1 more time per minute with raid buffs.  Per minute, that would be:<br />
 <br />
700 dps<br />
800 dps<br />
900 dps<br />
1000 dps<br />
1100 dps<br />
400 dps<br />
400 dps <br />
400 dps.<br />
etc.<br />
 <br />
Too much?  Okay, go to 4 minute duration with 1k mana cost.<br />
 <br />
700 dps<br />
800 dps<br />
900 dps<br />
1000 dps<br />
300 dps<br />
300 dps<br />
300 dps<br />
 <br />
Why are you wedded to nerfing the spell?!?  You can actually reduce the irritation factor of using the spell by increasing duration and increasing mana cost.  Don't screw our ability to do what amounts to a mana burn.  Reduce the effectiveness of our mana burn by reducing the number of times we can afford to cast the spell.  Not an artificial limit on how many times we can cast it.<br />
 <br />
There's another reason attached therein.  What's the difference between a 70 shaman with 1500 AAs and 12,000 mana pool,and a shaman with no AAs, and a 4000 mana pool on the proposed 30 sec recast timer?  Absolutely NOTHING.  You can't get any more powerful no matter how much equipment or experience you get.  A shaman is a shaman--no reason to improve.  Recast is a BAD idea.  Limits need to be imposed in such a way that people who put in the time can do more.  A wizard with a larger mana pool can nuke more.  With the proposed model, a shaman with a larger mana pool . . . doesn't mean jack with Panther.  That's completely aside from the unbelievably annoying recast time and waiting on spell gem refresh after memming buffs, etc.<br />
 <br />
Group version spells are designed to frustrate raiders.<br />
 <br />
Bottom line, why do you have to screw either or both groups of people.  Adjust duration and mana cost to achieve the same ends.  Shaman will be happier to have to cast it less often, AND you accomplish your goal of limiting a single shaman raid dps.  I'd still like to know why this nerf has to go in at all, though.  BUFFS CANNOT STACK.  You already have a theoretical cap on dps from panther whether you have 2 shaman or 20 shaman.<br />

I think this is going to end up being the key point. I have yet to see Rytan respond to this, or the analogy of a Chanter hasting a raid. 1 Chanter hasting a while raid adds a BUTTLOAD of DPS. A second chanter adds ZERO on top of that. <br />
<br />
I honestly think we can get out of this with a slight mana increase, a slight damage decrease, and no recast. Macnair, Chu, Ar, keep hammering the stackibility issue. Rytan has no choice but to accept the fact of the matter. <br />
<br />
1 shaman = 1,000 dps<br />
1 chanter = 5,000 dps (with haste)<br />
1 wizard = 600 dps<br />
<br />
2 shamans = 1,000 dps (total)<br />
2 chanters = 5,000 dps (total)<br />
2 wizards = 1,200 dps (total)<br />
<br />
3 shaman = 1,000 dps<br />
3 chanters = 5,000 dps<br />
3 wizards = 1,800 dps<br />

Rytan intuitively thinks he should nerf them, because he thinks they are nukes that are as powerful as a wizard's nukes.  But he certainly hasn't demonstrated whythey should be considered as if they were nukes.  He hasn't responded to that question at all.  Maybe he is thinking about it.  Maybe he is ignoring it, and will end up saying &quot;Yah, 30 second recast, that's the easiest way to nerf this.&quot;  <br />
<br />
But.  If he will genuinely engage on this issue (that's a very big IF, I admit), then it is possible that he will try to answer the question, &quot;Why are you treating these buffs as if they were nukes, and comparing them to how a wizard nukes?&quot;  If he tries to answer that question, he will discover that it makes more sense to consider these buffs as buffs:  wherein he will discover that they provide significant burst dps (lots more than FA), yet still only a minor fraction of the sustained dps of haste.  <br />
<br />
I don't think we should do any more hypothesizing on what's the best way to nerf Panther, until Rytan demonstrates that the current version of Panther is a nuke.</div></div><hr />

Until Rytan demonstrates that Panther adds significant burst DPS to a raid, rather. 900 DPS, as per his numbers, divided among 54 people ain't significant at all.<br />
<br />
Panther needs to stay the way it is now and Shaman pets(and just them) need to keep their original proc rate!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">What Chutoi said about increasing the mana cost along with duration makes the most sense to me.  That is the fix that lowers max dps of 1 shaman and at the same time makes it a less annoying spell to cast.  No more recast timers.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Until Rytan demonstrates that Panther adds significant burst DPS to a raid, rather. 900 DPS, as per his numbers, divided among 54 people ain't significant at all.I don't mind your argument, Giac, although I think it could use some tweaking.  Rytan's number is 600 I believe.  I don't think it makes sense to divide that across all 54 people in a full raid; but it certainly does make sense to divide it across 13 people (me and the 12 melees I'm buffing).  <br />
<br />
600/13 = 46 dps<br />
<br />
I agree with you that 46 dps for these 13 relevant characters is hardly overwhelming.  Still, when you add it up, my buff and thirteen characters together adds as much cooperative damage as one wizard does with direct damage.  Takes 13 of us to make it happen, though, not just one.  <br />
<br />
If Panther is a nuke, then you can compare me and my 600 dps vs the wizard and his 600 dps.  That's what Rytan is doing right now.  But he is making the wrong comparison.  He needs to prove to me that Panther is a nuke.<br />
<br />
If Panther is a buff, then you can compare me and my team of 12 melees and our 600 burst dps for three minutes, vs the enchanter buffing 30 melees, adding 2400 dps on demand anytime in the next hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">It's not MY argument, it's Rytan's.<br />
<br />
Rytan's argument is that Panther adds too much DPS to the RAID, thuse you have to look at how much it adds to the whole raid, not just the people who are being buffed. <br />
Forget the 17 DPS per person at a raid(I just used this so people realized what 900 RAID DPS actually feel like), if that is confusing you and just think that it adds 900 DPS to a raid.<br />
<br />
900 DPS done by 3 Shamans, 36 targets, BUT tacked on a WHOLE RAID.<br />
<br />
If encounters are balanced around +/- 900 DPS per raid, I'll eat my hat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I'll be blunt.  I don't much care that the non-raiders are excited about group only spells.  The version that we have now is fine for groups.  Making this spell group only is a HUGE screwing for raiders.  Mobs now dictate group make-up.  Melee heavy groups are a thing of the past on current raid content.  YOU CANNOT EFFECTIVELY MAKE A MELEE HEAVY GROUP ON MOST CURRENT RAID MOBS.  Why?  Adds, offtanking, group heals, chains, etc.  It's too much for one cleric to handle.  The shaman is usually doing heals/cures and not full time panther.  Add another healer?  Fine, then you're down to 3 melee for a group spell.<br />
 <br />
The fact is, many raids, especially in anguish, you need 1-2 melee, 1-2 casters, and 1-2 healers per group.  Group-only Panther is a complete waste for that group.<br />
 <br />
How often do you have a shaman in the MT group?  (Hint, not real often).  A well designed MT group should be 2 clerics, a bard, 2 warriors, and either an enchanter, druid, or paladin.  You can't hit the one person who is going to be on the mob the full time of the encounter from outside the group.  It helps with agro.  Force people to switch in and out in the raid to use Panther?  That's total crap.<br />
 <br />
For that matter, I have yet to hear from Rytan why the potential shaman dps is such a huge issue.  Let's say we have 16 melee, 1 wizard and 1 shaman.  The wizard can do 600 dps, the shaman (for 1.5 minutes) can do 16000 dps, and then maybe 300ish.  Okay, sounds kinda insane, right?  What if we have 4 shaman?  We have a wizard doing 600 dps, the shaman doing an average of 400 dps each (because we can't DoT in high end raids--we can't land **SMURF** for dps.)<br />
 <br />
It's a BUFF. I'll put the next bit in caps so it's fully clear.<br />
 <br />
NO MATTER HOW MANY SHAMAN YOU GET ON RAIDS, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PANTHER DAMAGE IS CAPPED BY PEOPLE SWINGING.<br />
 <br />
Wizards stack.  2 wizards = 1200 dps.  3 wizards = 1800 dps.  4 wizards = 2400 dps.<br />
 <br />
1 shaman = 2 shaman = 3 shaman = 4shaman = same panthter dps.  It's more sustainable with more shaman casting it, but the damage caps to exactly the same amount.<br />
 <br />
So what are we nerfing here?  The ability of a shaman to drain their mana and create a spike of dps.  That is ALL you're nerfing, and I have yet to see a reasonable explanation of why.<br />
 <br />
And if you must nerf this spell (which I happen to think is total crap, but par for the course), I want to know why you have to do it by swinging the nerf bat.  You can adjust the duration and mana cost to do the EXACT same thing.  Limit the number of casts.  Let's use that situation I mentioned before.  5 minute buff (including focus extension) and 1000 mana.<br />
 <br />
Most shaman will be able to cast it 7 times in a row, and maybe 1 more time per minute with raid buffs.  Per minute, that would be:<br />
 <br />
700 dps<br />
800 dps<br />
900 dps<br />
1000 dps<br />
1100 dps<br />
400 dps<br />
400 dps <br />
400 dps.<br />
etc.<br />
 <br />
Too much?  Okay, go to 4 minute duration with 1k mana cost.<br />
 <br />
700 dps<br />
800 dps<br />
900 dps<br />
1000 dps<br />
300 dps<br />
300 dps<br />
300 dps<br />
 <br />
Why are you wedded to nerfing the spell?!?  You can actually reduce the irritation factor of using the spell by increasing duration and increasing mana cost.  Don't screw our ability to do what amounts to a mana burn.  Reduce the effectiveness of our mana burn by reducing the number of times we can afford to cast the spell.  Not an artificial limit on how many times we can cast it.<br />
 <br />
There's another reason attached therein.  What's the difference between a 70 shaman with 1500 AAs and 12,000 mana pool,and a shaman with no AAs, and a 4000 mana pool on the proposed 30 sec recast timer?  Absolutely NOTHING.  You can't get any more powerful no matter how much equipment or experience you get.  A shaman is a shaman--no reason to improve.  Recast is a BAD idea.  Limits need to be imposed in such a way that people who put in the time can do more.  A wizard with a larger mana pool can nuke more.  With the proposed model, a shaman with a larger mana pool . . . doesn't mean jack with Panther.  That's completely aside from the unbelievably annoying recast time and waiting on spell gem refresh after memming buffs, etc.<br />
 <br />
Group version spells are designed to frustrate raiders.<br />
 <br />
Bottom line, why do you have to screw either or both groups of people.  Adjust duration and mana cost to achieve the same ends.  Shaman will be happier to have to cast it less often, AND you accomplish your goal of limiting a single shaman raid dps.  I'd still like to know why this nerf has to go in at all, though.  BUFFS CANNOT STACK.  You already have a theoretical cap on dps from panther whether you have 2 shaman or 20 shaman.<br />
 <br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
this really hits the nail on the head. outside of nerfing the pet dps somewhat (i think it is needed) i totally agree with chutoi here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">It's not MY argument, it's Rytan's.Heh.  Bet it didn't feel quite right for me to attribute it to you, then. :) <br />
<br />
Rytan's argument is that Panther adds too much DPS to the RAIDThis may be the idea that is nurdling around in the back of his head, but I haven't seen him state this argument yet.  <br />
<br />
1.  His direct comparison was to the nukes of a wizard, and I think that's a bad comparison.  I think you can only make that comparison if you show me why Panther should be considered like a nuke.  <br />
<br />
2.  If his real (underlying) argument is that this buff adds too much DPS to the raid, then I'd like to see his own analysis of this.  Beastlords with their attack buffs add how much dps to the raid?  The enchanter's haste and mana buffs add how much dps to the raid?  The cleric's spell haste adds how much dps to the raid?  Ferine Avatar and Wunshi add how much dps to the raid?  And so we see that some buffs add negligible dps and some add huge amounts:  and the amount that is too much for any buff to add is x, and Panther exceeds that by how much?<br />
<br />
Overall, though, I don't want people to explain to me what Rytan means.  I want Rytan to explain to me what Rytan means.  <br />
<br />
If I'm right (case 1 above) then I want Rytan to explain why Panther should be considered a nuke and not a buff.  I think that's what his comparison has said so far:  so I want him to show me why that is.<br />
<br />
If you're right (case 2 above) then you are providing a strong counter-argument in advance:  the amount of additional raid dps provided by 3 shamans casting Panther doesn't seem that large.<br />
<br />
it adds 900 DPS to a raid.  900 DPS done by 3 Shamans, 36 targets, BUT tacked on a WHOLE RAID.  If encounters are balanced around +/- 900 DPS per raid, I'll eat my hat. But either way, I want Rytan to speak for himself.  Whether he is just making a straight comparison with wizard nukes or whether he is doing the more subtle analysis of overall raid dps, I want him to give us the benefit of explaining what he is thinking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems so simple to me.<br />
<br />
Why complicate the whole thing, people?  The exact problem has been identified by Rytan. <br />
<br />
Panther provides too much DPS.<br />
<br />
Alrighty then, let's fix that in the easiest way.  Let's not introduce a host of other programming variables that subtly and maliciously introduce other problems.<br />
<br />
Group only.  Duration timers.  Recast delays.  Bah.  These are insidious back-doors to other problems.  Several posts illustrate this, when we start to talk about raid vs group, theoretical non-stacking burst, distribution of DPS, players deleting accounts, etc., ad nauseam.<br />
<br />
Occam's razor, Rytan.<br />
<br />
If the problem is too much DPS, then lower the DPS reasonably.  Your first solution almost hit it, but you introduced recast delays once again, which only complicates and enrages the shaman.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION:  REDUCE the AMOUNT of PROC DAMAGE, just this and this alone.<br />
<br />
Bam, that's it.<br />
<br />
No complicated pet proc-rate re-coding, no introduction of other problems like raid/group/solo situations, no mass exodus, no back-of-the-spellbook knee-jerk reactions.....<br />
<br />
SOLUTION:  REDUCE the AMOUNT of PROC DAMAGE, just this and this alone.<br />
<br />
The spell, as it stands, is an excellent idea which increased shaman desirability, addressed aggro issues, made shaman DPS more apparent, and is set up in a way that is consistent with the quick, flexible, active shaman playstyle.<br />
<br />
Whoa..... SoE gave us a bit too much.  SIMPLE.  Reign it in by making Leopard/Panther proc 1/3rd less ( or whatever your ideal shaman DPS figure is ).<br />
<br />
It's a win/win solution.  SoE reduces the DPS dealt, the shaman EQ community get to keep the spell everyone loves.  <br />
<br />
Sure there will be a little bit of griping, but I believe shaman will still use the spell and eventually adapt to the adjusted PROC DAMAGE.</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't make it useless to me but it would make it highly situational.  Blazz's approach looks by far to be the most accepatble.

His connection with the reality of the game isn't real solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">The exact problem has been identified by Rytan. Panther provides too much DPS. ...  SIMPLE.  Reign it in by making Leopard/Panther proc 1/3rd less ( or whatever your ideal shaman DPS figure is ).Isn't that a key question, though?  What is your ideal shaman DPS figure?  (DPS via buffing others, not direct dps by nuking or dotting.)  <br />
<br />
You are talking as if it is obvious that a shaman, via buffing, should not be allowed to provide more than x amount of damage, in a raid setting.  And as if it is obvious what x ought to be.<br />
<br />
How do we know that Panther provides too much DPS?  We know it if we know how much x is:  but nobody has told me how much x is.  If we are supposed to reduce Panther, how much do we need to reduce it by?  We can't know that, until we know how much x is.<br />
<br />
Do we just pick a number out of midair?  Is that what makes it simple?<br />
<br />
The level 2 bard song provides a steady increase of about 1 dps via a buff.  The enchanter MGB 1 hour 70% haste provides a steady increase of about 2400 dps via a buff.  Panther provides a burst increase in dps rather than steady dps, so it's not as long lasting an effect as either of those, but suppose it ought to fall somewhere in the range between those two.  <br />
<br />
(That's not obvious of course; maybe it should be weaker than the bard song, or stronger than the enchanter haste.  I am supposing that it should not be weaker than the weakest available buff or stronger than the stronger available buff.)<br />
<br />
Rytan's analysis of this buff is that it provides 600 burst dps over 3 minutes.  Different people suggest that it should be higher or lower than this, but I'll work with his number.<br />
<br />
My question is this:  In the range between 1 and 2400, what should be the estimated burst dps of the re-envisioned shaman set-the-world-on-fire superbuff?<br />
<br />
If 600 is too high, why is it too high?  If 400 is right, why is it right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Posted by Rytan (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shaman&amp;message.id=4327&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=7):<br />
<br />
Based on the current feedback we’re planning on going with the group only version that’s been suggested.* In addition to the group only restriction the damage pre proc will also be lowered to bring the potential DPS down to a reasonable level.* The next test update should have the spells as:<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Panther:<br />
400 Damage/proc<br />
475 Mana<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Leopard:<br />
300 Damage/proc<br />
380 Mana<br />
<br />
Assuming a 16 tick duration the spells DPS and efficiency of a single cast of each spell should be approximately as follows:<br />
<br />
Panther:<br />
DPS: 73<br />
Eff: 14.8<br />
<br />
Leopard:<br />
DPS: 55<br />
Eff: 13.8<br />
<br />
Which is significantly higher efficiency then even a full duration disease DoT.* Additionally the spell is still very difficult to resist and draws very little aggro to the shaman.* We feel that these changes address the current concerns of the spells potential DPS being too high while still keeping the spell both useful and interesting.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your continuing feedback.<br />
