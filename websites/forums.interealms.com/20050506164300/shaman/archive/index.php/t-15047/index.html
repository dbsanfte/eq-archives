<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I looked and the best that I could find was that it was near the herbalist shack.  Where is the zone in Chardok?  <br />
<br />
Whenever Ive been in here I am always being CotHed to the royals and do not know the layout.<br />
<br />
Can I invis to get there?<br />
<br />
How do i get there from the entrance.<br />
<br />
Help me I researched Malo but I need torpor.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jump down from the bridge keeper and in front of the bank and go through the waterfall to your left.  There's a little cubby just past it that has a lever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">kk you are going to have to treat me like an idiot on this one cause when it comes to Chardok I am an idiot.<br />
<br />
What is the bridgekeeper?  and I have absolutely no idea where the bank is.<br />
<br />
I assume past the entrance there is a bridge that I jump off of but ewhich way?  Left right?<br />
<br />
And from there where is the waterfall?<br />
<br />
Sorry to be ignorant but I am going to move into that zone and not leave until I have torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is something thats been a bit of a problem with people in my guild. We have a few people who know Chardok well, and everyone else that know nothing at all, so explaining where to go can be difficult.<br />
<br />
Easiest way i've found, is lev and invis, run to the lev tunnel, follow it all the way down and to the right (you'll be at the betrayer camp) now we all know theres 2 bridges here, and yes you can jump off either. I've found its easiest to just jump off the platform turning to the right and running straight for the waterfall.<br />
<br />
Explaining it seems to be a lot harder than actually doing it, I'd suggest just follow someone else down there once, try to remember where you're going and you'll be fine =) And with the zone being fairly popular atm you shouldn't have trouble finding someone running down there at most times.<br />
<br />
note: the *easiest* way is to have a chardok mage CoH you down there =P but we all can't have life that good.</div></div><hr />
