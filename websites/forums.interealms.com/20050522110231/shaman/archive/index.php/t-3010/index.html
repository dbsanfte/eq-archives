<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Fungi Tunic drops from the Myconid Spore King in Sebilis. It his rare drop. I would suggest a shaman be level 55 before trying to camp the King (with a strong group). The Myconid Spore King himself is hard to slow, consider using Plague of Insects. <br />
<br />
part should read:<br />
<br />
It IS his rare drop.<br />
---------<br />
<br />
The Jaundiced Bone Bracer is a part of the shaman Kunark plate set of armor. All Jaundiced Bone armor drops in Karnors Castle and Sebilis. The Jaundiced Bone Bracer itself is AC 14 with the effect Winters Roar. That is a right clickable direct damage spell. It has an 8 second cast time and does 263dmg. It is not useable until a shaman is level 45 (uhhh, or was that 46? brainproblems here). <br />
<br />
tis level 45.<br />

just under that - <br />
I heard the Jaundiced Bone Bracer is a powerful item, how do I get one?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Funny compare the pluses and minuses of each race.<br />
<br />
Barbs have slam, can wear JBB, have good faction, have high starting wisdom, can wear large and medium armor types, have small xp penalty, and have good starting faction.<br />
<br />
Trolls have regeneration, slam, can wear JBB, have bad faction throughout most of the old world, have a larger xp penalty, and can get either the snare necklace, or get the fear undead/animal necklaces, and have lowest starting wisdom.<br />
<br />
Iksar have regen, have really bad faction in old world, have innate AC bonus, have best starting wisdom, have IMO best newbie hunting grounds, and I think they can get the fear animal/undead necklaces, but I'm not 100% positive on that.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir have sneak, safe fall, eat more, decent starting wis, can wear JBB, and have decent starting faction in the old world.<br />
<br />
Ogres have slam, can't be stunned from the front by normal attacks, can wear JBB, have bad faction with most of the old world, and have highest starting str and stamina, but 2nd lowest starting wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In Troll's advantage thing.<br />

I think you should mention that no other shaman get unlimited, clicky snare at low lvl.<br />
<br />
Also Im pretty sure that the highest of wisdom, intelligence, or strength affect blacksmithing skill-up... the thread's buried in the Crucible somewhere.<br />
<br />
Ya might want to add the Magelo thread to the &quot;what equipment should I get at lvl #?&quot; for a general idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Very nice FAQ you've got together here :)<br />
<br />
Found some stuff for you - sorry for the lenght and I know it looks like a lot... but it is really only small thingies ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 *** Exp penalty<br />
<br />
You have it look like barbarians and vah shirs have the same/smallest exp penalty - to my understanding vah shir have 0% and barbs 5%. Why not put the numbers in there under each race when you compare them<br />
<br />
Troll/Iksar 20%<br />
Ogre 15%(?)<br />
Barbarians 5%<br />
Vah shir 0%<br />
<br />
<br />
Iksars have forage as racial advatage too, no?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 *** Statbuffs<br />
<br />
For more information about stats and tradeskills, read this.  <br />
<br />
Linking to a specific board post that's not even on this board isn't recommendable (for instans right now when I can't read it ;)). Perhaps withdraw the information and clearly stating from where it comes? ...or explain where to go for the information. Minimum pointing should at least be For more information about stats and tradeskills, read this post on EQTraders messageboard.<br />
<br />
Same goes for all linking thoughout the document - most important though for the links that points to some other board than the Crucible.<br />
<br />
<br />
In general, HP, STA, AC, Regeneration and Haste buffs should be cast in that order.  <br />
<br />
Not sure I agree with the order since I think it's situational, but I know that when I was a very new shaman and highbie shaman ( he was almost 50!) told me in which order he thought they should be casted I did put a lot of work in casting them the 'right' order thinking there were only one way to go. Please, use a softer wording than 'should be' ;) Maybe even add a li'l line about that the order suggested is because it's a good thing to cast longer duration buffs first or something...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 *** Alchemy<br />
<br />
Why is alchemy so expensive? <br />
<br />
Max capped the skill is 180.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 *** Defense<br />
<br />
Better add Beastlords too when you suggest pets to fight with for raising def. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 *** Cannidance<br />
<br />
Add that the hp and mana ticks happen at exact same time, so if it's hard trying to see a raise while looking at the mana bar it's ok to go after the hp bar<br />
<br />
<br />
Most shamans stop cannidancing entirely when they receive Cannibalize IV.  <br />
<br />
Is this true? Heh... I can't stop that even when I play my twinks :p (Got it connected to a keyboardbutton so I had to rearrange the way I have my spells so no offensive or gate or anything is in the same spellslot I have canni)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 *** Class issues<br />
<br />
Initially, torpor couldn't be cast on someone that was slowed, because of the slow component of torpor. The resist buff spells (endure cold, etc) used to overwrite the malise spell line. There's many more examples, but many of the most common issues have been fixed.  <br />
<br />
Maybe be a bit more specific that this is no longer the case for those examples you gave<br />
<br />
<br />
//edit: <br />
Removed my alchemy misconception - now, at least, I know I couldn't have done it any better from start, myself ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;and Luclin factions are the same for all races.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't think this is true, but dont have exact details.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some shamans have spent upwards of 40,000 plat getting their skill to max (170).&quot;<br />
<br />
Maximum skill is 180.<br />
<br />
In the section explaining can dancing, it might be helpful to put in an example for a hotkey, like:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 24<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
&quot;The effects of strength have been tested over and over by members of the Shamans' Crucible quite extensively. The general consensus is that strength buffs aren't worth the mana for the small increase in averate damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd looooooooove to see those tests.  Haven't once seen one in my time at the crucible that showed strength isn't worth the mana.  Every single test i've seen and done showed the opposite.  I don't mean to rehash the same old arguement in this thread, but that statement might be out of place here.<br />
<br />
Besides that looks outstanding, nice work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I don't mean to rehash the same old arguement in this thread <br />
<br />
Oh lets.<br />
<br />
A 67 point strength buff returned a + 7% DPS (AT BEST).<br />
<br />
Compare that to a 50% haste buff. Hell compare it to a 15% haste buff.<br />
<br />
If you are prioritizing Shaman Buffs, I would say Strength falls behind, HP, Haste, Regen, AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;Oh lets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok!<br />
<br />
Maniacle Strength Costs 150 mana to Celerity's 185, and lasts 144 minutes to Celerity's 16.  Using your 7% figure, that makes the strength buff just over 50% more mana efficient at increasing damage then the haste buff!  Good point, definately not worth the mana :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Some additional info...<br />
<br />
   Ogres can use bearform to reduce size, and it works outdoors.  Though visibly very large bearform ogres can fit into places that ogres cannot, mostly negating the size penalty of ogres.   There is an early version of this spell in SoL I believe.<br />
<br />
   After having gotten 100+ aa points, I _strongly_ recommend that a shaman get quickbuff 3, spellcasting mastery 3 and spellcasting reinforcement (in addition to the skills listed in the faq) before working on other archtype or class skills.<br />
<br />
   Quickbuff 3 reduces cast time of buffs by 50percent, most notably Group Focus, from 26 to 13, CELERITY from 8 to 4 and TORPOR from 6 to 3.  I don't think I need to explain why this is good.<br />
<br />
   Spellcasting Mastery 3 in average reportedly reduces mana cost of spells by 15%.  That adds up.  It also should reduce fizzle rate.<br />
<br />
   Spellcasting reinforcement adds 50 percent to the endurance of any buff spell.  Most notably this includes avatar, primal avatar, and torpor.  Unfortunately it does not seem the effect group buff spells, at least not on people other than the caster.  This may have been fixed.   With SCRM, torpor lasts 6 ticks instead of 4.  The usefulness of this should be obvious.<br />
<br />
   These AA skills affect many other spells than listed above.<br />
<br />
   One thing missed was the effect wisdom has on fizzles.  Each point of wisdom reduces your fizzle rate by 1%, you can never have a fizzle rate higher than 95% or lower than 5%.  I used to know the formula for determining fizzle rates but that is long forgotten now.<br />
<br />
   Another subject: FOCUS ITEMS.<br />
<br />
   Improved Healing III:  This affects healing spells by adding an addition random 1 to 20 percent effect (drop fractions) to any heal spell.  AA skills do not increase this effect, but otherwise do stack.<br />
<br />
   Extended affliction III: Seems to add one tick to poison dots and four ticks to our disease dots.  It does NOT affect non-dot spells.  It is not know what it does to our epic dot, if anything.<br />
<br />
   Affliction haste III: Reduces dot cast time by 1/3.<br />
<br />
   Affliction efficiency III: Reduces mana cost of dots by 25%.<br />
<br />
   Spell haste III: Reduces cast time of ALL spells shaman cast by 10%.<br />
<br />
   Mana efficiency III: Reduces mana cost of ALL spells shaman cast by 10%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Luclin factions are not the same for all races. Some cities, like Shadowhaven, treat all newcomers the same, but others, like Seru and Katta, don't like evil races - as a troll I am KOS in Katta (until I get round to fixing that faction, hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ogres can use bearform to reduce size, and it works outdoors. Though visibly very large bearform ogres can fit into places that ogres cannot, mostly negating the size penalty of ogres. There is an early version of this spell in SoL I believe.  <br />
<br />
This also works for other races. As a barbarian, bear form helps me get inside the little huts in Kelethin for example, or to swim through the hole to the smuggler caves in highpass without ducking. I'm sure the same applies to trolls.<br />
<br />
There is a low level version (Form of the Bear) available in Shadowhaven from the vendor next to the shaman trainer (wis+5, regen +1/tick), available at level 29. Note that you loose the innate racial slam ability when in using this. There is no faction change associated with the spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I believe AA skills common advice is to get run3/regen3 pre-60 in order to help you level faster in the end...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">okay just finished a bunch of updates from this thread.  some comments...<br />
<br />
alminah,<br />
<br />
Why not put the numbers in there under each race when you compare them<br />
<br />
Are those numbers that Verant has published somewhere?  If they are, I will use them.  I don't want to pull numbers out of showEQ parsing, however accurate (or not) it may be.<br />
<br />
Linking to a specific board post that's not even on this board isn't recommendable<br />
<br />
Of course.  In fact, my preference isn't to have the posts from the Crucible linked because they could end up disappearing.  The ideal solution, and what I'll do when I find time, is to pull the text out of the other message boards / Crucible posts and put them into their own page that I can link to from the FAQ so they're all in the same place.<br />
<br />
I'm at 164 now, what if I had had still 19 points to put in at trainer *drool* <br />
<br />
You can't put points into alchemy after 20 skill, just as with any other tradeskill.<br />
<br />
Cannidance<br />
<br />
Added a clause about watching the hp bar or hp display in inventory screen.<br />
<br />
Stop cannidancing after Cann IV<br />
<br />
It was general consensus when the Cann IV spell was first found that people weren't cannidancing due to the recast time.  I did a test of it myself doing the same cannidancing as with Cann III and I regenerated mana slower doing the dance than just chain casting Cann IV.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
thanks mudcrush for the info on AA abilities, i updated that section.  focus items are a great idea but i'd like to add that later.<br />
<br />
i put in a few other updates, including large races with bear form in the race section.  i'm doing this while working so i don't remember all the updates i made... but most everything from this thread has been applied.</div></div><hr />

Depends on the spell. Most of them are dropped by various mobs. Some are available for sale from vendors. A very few are available by turning in other more commonly dropped spells to an NPC in Firiona Vie. <br />
<br />
The Firiona Vie isn't the only place, the evil's have a quest person of their own. I forget though, Outpost in Overthere and Tim deep?</div></div><hr />

I note some people wishing they had more is STA and less in WIS, now that they are reaching endgame and deciding that hp&gt;&gt;all    but I would still recommend putting points into WIs first then STA.  don't put any in to STR, no matter how much you think a troll should be strong, rather than wise.   and warn all ew shamans away from CHA, no matter what color the stat is on the screen!</div></div><hr />

1) Under the iksar pros, rather than &quot;Is usually considered better&quot; change to &quot;Is considerably better&quot;. I don't think there is anyone who could compare rune etched and scaled heirophant and say that rune etched is even remotely as good.<br />
<br />
2) Sontalak does not drop Malo and Torpor rarely. They are QUITE common off him, compared to any other source. My guild is in the process of mass-farming sontalak for ST keys, and in the last month we've gotten:<br />
<br />
Torpor x3<br />
Malo x1<br />
Pox of Bertoxxulous x5<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Other suggestions...<br />
<br />
The magelo link (if I do say so myself) would be really useful in answer to the &quot;what equipment should I use at level ##?&quot; question. People should learn to benchmark their gear against other shaman of comparable levels to get a sense of what the choices are.<br />
<br />
-- JBB prices range from 10k to 35k. It still sells for 30k now and then on my server.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer that you get more specific with the &quot;Why doesn't VI make a JBB for Iksar?&quot;... You should mention that the Iksar AC bonus is 40ac at level 60. You should mention this in the &quot;pros&quot; for iksar, as well.<br />
<br />
-- Iksar start with 75 forage. The skill is stuck at 75 permanently.<br />
<br />
-- Iksar START with 100 swimming but max out at 200 like everybody else.<br />
<br />
-- If you list &quot;good starting wis&quot; as a &quot;pro&quot; for barbarians, it should be listed for Iksar.<br />
<br />
-- &quot;Where do I hunt at level XX?&quot; is a good question to stick in there. Point to our &quot;hunting grounds&quot; forums as well as the comparable forums at the Druid, Mage, Monk and Wizard message boards. <br />
<br />
-- Your answer to &quot;What good is wisdom over 200&quot; assumes that the shaman asking the question doesn't have 1200AC and 3k unbuffed AC. Probably a safe assumption, but still a bias in the answer.<br />
<br />

&quot;In general, HP, STA, AC, Regeneration and Haste buffs should be cast in that order. After those, other stat buffs can be cast. Cleric AC buffs are superior to shaman and enchanter haste is superior as well. Druids have group regeneration, which is usually preferable, though shamans can have group regrowth at level 56. The order is situational, but recommended so longer duration buffs are cast first. &quot;<br />
<br />
This advice is a bit misleading in the ordinary exp group setting, because there is rarely enough mana (or enough patience on the part of the rest of the group) to buff all the melees with all of these buffs before the fight starts, or because you are joining a group already at work.  Buff order is normally by priority of usefulness, which is usually SOW(puller at least)&gt;haste(if no chanter)&gt;HP&gt;Sta&gt;other buffs per situation, IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">STA buffing - also might note under the stat buffs that buffing Stamina can help alleviate problems with fatigue(yellow bar, stamina bar, whatever ya wanna call it).  If STA &gt; 100, max fatigue means nothing more than you are unable to jump. If STA &lt; 100, max fatigue has a negative effect on combat ability (I believe less chance to hit and/or hitting for less when you do connect?) and IIRC mana regen rates (?)   If a melee character doesn't have 100+ stamina unbuffed then it's worthwhile to buff STA at any level, and a tank with under 100 stamina is most likely a low level tank anyway.  STA also increase time you can hold your breath, so when EB fades you don't start drowning so quickly if fighting underwater. ;)<br />
<br />
Buff Order stuff...<br />
<br />
Or you can just be a buff nazi and tell the tanks and whoever else to suck it up and you'll buff them as you get mana to spare and they'll like it or go without!  /ROAR<br />
<br />
I typically do a stat buff first(STA), then hp(Focus), then another stat buff a minute or 3 later (AGI).  At lower levels or when without a cleric I'd do AC after that followed by the other stat buffs.  If I'm hasting I'll do that first and immediately follow with STA and hp buffs.  Obviously SoW gets in first round too if outdoors.<br />
<br />
Why? you may be asking...  So they don't ALL wear off within a 5 minute interval!!!<br />
<br />
I buff everyone that needs that particular buff at once.  So, I chain cast the short term ones as needed (SoW, Haste, Regen) then chain cast through STA on everyone (group now that I have that available) and then the HP buffs as fast as they refresh.  Then I wait a couple minutes to cast the next round so that they don't ALL wear off at the same time.  It takes a few minutes extra to get everyone buffed, but during that time we can go ahead and start killing anyway.  I'm cannibalizing to regen mana during the fights for the next round, and when the buffs DO start fading, I've cast them on ME first so I have a warning and can immediately start rebuffing before the rest of the group even has a chance to bug me for them.  Since I've spread the buffs out, I refresh 1-2 buffs at any given time and am still left with mana to slow, thus the group can keep on killing and stay fully buffed.<br />
<br />
I know several shaman that do the same, but I also have seen plenty that just bufff everything all at once, then when the first buff starts fading everything else fades right after and the shaman is screaming OOM while s/he frantically tries to get everyone rebuffed as needed...  A wee bit of thought put into the buffing up front makes it a lot easier to keep them up all night without slowing the killing pace at any time! ;)</div></div><hr />

 Maniacle Strength Costs 150 mana to Celerity's 185, and lasts 144 minutes to Celerity's 16. Using your 7% figure, that makes the strength buff just over 50% more mana efficient at increasing damage then the haste buff! Good point, definately not worth the mana <br />
<br />
First - glad you're comparing a level 57 Shaman spell with a level 39 Enchanter spell. (Insert gikk eye rolling icon here)<br />
<br />
But that's besides the point.  <br />
<br />
For 150 mana you can get a +7% DPS for a 144 minutes.<br />
<br />
To equal the duration you would need to cast Celerity 9 times for 1665 mana. <br />
<br />
For 1665 mana you get + 50 % DPS for 144 minutes. <br />
<br />
Wow. Looks pretty bad for Haste here. Course one side benefit of doing 50% more damage is you take 50% LESS damage because the MOBs die faster.<br />
<br />
But it's all semantics.<br />
<br />

This advice on alchemy:<br />
&quot;- If you put your first point in at level 25, you get the skills starting at 25 and have to work your way up from there. If you put your first point in at level 35 you get the skill starting at 35 and have to work your way up from there - 10 points less to fail for.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Lumor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">What Are My Skills, When do I Get Them, and When are the Maxed? <br />
<br />
There are basically 2 different sets  of skills a Shaman will Posess.<br />
<br />
The First is his Melee Skills, they consist of:<br />
<br />
Piercing (one handed piercing only)<br />
One-Hand Blunt<br />
Two-Hand Blunt<br />
Hand to Hand<br />
Dodge (You do not recieve this skill until lvl 15 and need to put one point into it at the trainer to start using this skill)<br />
<br />
A Shaman can increase his skill in these (2) ways.  First by actively using them in the field(meaning attacking creatures).  You can only gain skill increases by attacking experience giving creatures(ie, light blue and above).  The second way to gain skills in these fields is by using the Shaman trainer, just beware it can get quite expensive when your skills are near their cap.<br />
<br />
The Formula for determining what is max skill for a given level is -<br />
   (lvl x 4)+ 4  and the Max skill you can attain in each is as follows:<br />
 Piercing - 200<br />
One-Hand Blunt - 200<br />
Two-Hand Blunt - 200<br />
Hand to Hand - 75<br />
Dodge - 75<br />
<br />
A Subset of Melee is your offense and defense skill.  You gain both of these at lvl one.  The only difference is that you cannot train these at a trainer, you need to actively attack and be attacked in order for these skills to go up.  Do not let these skills lag especially  Defense.  Since every point you gain in Defense will raise your AC lvl.  Offense and Defense skill raise by a different equation.  Your skills will raise by (lvl X 5) with a max skill of 200.<br />
<br />
Also at lvl 1 we recieve the skill Bind Wounds.  With this skill you can bandage yourself or others to help them heal up HP faster.  <br />
This skill has two different skill caps: The first being a skill of 200.  You can only raise your skill in Bind Wounds over a skill lvl of 200 once you have leveled your character up to lvl 51.  Once you have reached a lvl of 51 you can increase your Bind Wound Skill to a lvl of 201 and eventually to a skill of 210 by lvl 60.  The importance of this is that with a Bind Wound Skill of 200 and under, you can only Bind a person up to 50% of their Health.  But once you reach a skill of 201 you can Bind them up to 70% of their health.  <br />
The Formula for skill increases in Bind Wounds is (lvl X 5) +5 .<br />
<br />
The Second Set of Skills a Shaman must be concerned with is His/Her Casting Abilities.  There are 5 different casting abilities, and we recieve them all at lvl 1; they are :<br />
<br />
Abjuration(for casting our AC buffs, as well as our resistance buffs and our quickness line)<br />
Alteration(for casting our Stat Buffs and heals, as well as our SLOWS and our other debuffs)<br />
Conjuration(for casting our summoning spells, as well as our DOTs{damage over time} spells)<br />
Evocation(for casting our direct damage spells)<br />
Divination(for casting our Sight spells)<br />
<br />
The Formula for skill increase is as follows :  (lvl X 5)+5 and they all max out at 235.<br />
<br />
In order to cast any spells you need to have Mana, which is our magical energy.  Each spell takes a certain amount of mana to cast.  Once you have depleted all of your mana you must wait until it regenerates.  A skill that we recieve at lvl 8 helps this process to go faster.  At lvl 8 we recieve the skill Meditate.  What this skill does is while you are sitting you will regain your mana at a considerable amount faster then standing.  All you need to do to activate your Meditate skill is to sit.  This is another skill that you need to put one point into it at the trainer in order to start using.  Prior to lvl 8 and you obtaining your Meditate skill, it doesnt matter if you are standing or sitting to regain mana, you will regain it at the same speed.    The Formula for skill increases is as follows : (lvl X 5)+5.  This skill Maxes at 235 for people lvl 50 and under, and will max out totally at 252 between lvls 51 and 60.<br />
<br />
There are two other skills we also get to help us with our spell casting.  The first is Channelling.  This skill gives us a better chance of casting a spell with out interuption, or being physically attacked.  We first obtain this skill at lvl 4 and need to put one point into it at our trainer to start using the skill.  <br />
<br />
The Formula for our Channelling Skill is - (lvl X 5)+5 and it maxes at a skill of 200 for people lvl 50 and under and will totally cap at 220 between lvls 51-60.<br />
<br />
Also at lvl 30 we obtain a choice of Specializing in one of our Casting abilities.  Specializing helps reduce the mana cost on the spells in that casting ability.  You can choose any of the 5 casting abilities to Specialize in.  The 2 Most common are Alteration, for our heals, buffs and Slows; or Conjuration for our DOTs.  You play style should dictate which you choose.   Once you reach lvl 30 you must put a point into Specialization for each of the 5 Casting Abilites.  The first one to reach a skill lvl of 50 will be the one you have chosen to Specialize in.  That Casting ability will be able to reach a Specialization lvl of 235 while the other 4 will only reach a lvl of 50 Specialization.  If you know what Casting Ability that you want to Specialize in, your best bet to ensure that is to cast the lowest lvl spell in the casting ability over and over again on yourself until it reaches a skill lvl of 51, then just go about your business and it as well as the others will raise on their own.  If you are unsure which Casting Ability to choose, you should put one point into each and let your play style decide for you.  Whichever Spells you cast the most will cause that Casting Ability to raise faster and that will be the one that you Specialize in.<br />
<br />
The Formula for Specialization is - (lvl X 5)+5</div></div><hr />

OK, I guess I have to agree with you on that view, and sorry to say I have no idea if it's published anywhere from Verant or not.<br />

In the FAQ you state that Barbarians have the smallest exp-penalty and that Vah Shirs faction and exp-penalty is comparable to Barbarians. Maybe at least with the wording change that a bit? For example write that Barbarians have a very small exp-penalty and that Vah Shirs have none?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">* Rak's spawn point is where he spawns when his reaver dies, since he has a tendancy to gate back to his spawn point when nearly dead, it's a really really good idea to pull his REAVER where you want to fight the battle, gating/summoning Rak = bad <br />
* Don't fight in the temple. The risk of adds is too great and can lead to a mess. <br />
* Don't fight near water, if Rak falls in the water, it could be very bad. <br />
* Only the mage pets should engage Rak, this includes melee that like to &quot;helpfully&quot; shoot arrows. I personally witnessed a Rak fight that failed for this reason. (note: I'm sure a well equipped couple of groups could probably fight Rak without mage pets, but why risk it on your epic? go for what's safe). <br />
* My guild (which has never lost on Rak) always pulls Rak's reaver to the area we call the &quot;staging area.&quot; This is a small courtyard right before you go through the arch which leads to the pathway to the moat and temple. There are no roamers/spawns and there is a nice corner that the mage pets can push Rak into. <br />
* After you hand in the tear and Rak aggros, wait until the mage pets are engaged and Rak is on them, before you slowly step out of range. <br />
<br />
Each specific reaver either spawns a Lord (Ghiosk or Rak) or a ghost. Each lord has a specific reaver, you don't have to kill all the reavers to make Rak spawn, just Rak's reaver. The reason you might think this, is because Rak's reaver is the one farthest inside the temple and all the other reavers get pulled first before Rak. <br />
<br />
Generally it goes Ghiosk first (his reaver is closest), then either 3-4 (I can never remember if it's 3 or 4) reavers that spawn ghosts and then Rak's reaver (which according to a puller friend is &quot;up some kind of elevator&quot;. If a really good puller could get Rak's reaver out first, you could just kill Rak without having to fight the other reavers. I've never pulled it, so have no idea of the difficulty of getting Rak's reaver first. <br />
<br />
Hmmm, I just read over that, did that make sense? Each reaver is specific and will always spawn either a Lord or a ghost depending on which reaver it is. The order the reavers are pulled is dependent on their placement in the temple, which is why Ghiosk's reaver comes first and Rak's reaver comes last.<br />
<br />
So, to sum up. Each reaver is specific and will either spawn a Lord or a ghost (hence, Rak's reaver, Ghiosk's reaver). If a Lord is currently up, the corresponding reaver will not spawn an additional lord, nothing will happen. If you kill the Lord, then the Lord's reaver, the Lord will spawn. <br />
<br />
So, if you kill a reaver and nothing happened, you killed a Lord reaver, but the Lord must already be spawned someplace in CoM. <br />
<br />
The trick to the reaver fights is the fact that multiple reavers may spawn, over and over again. All the basic reaver fights are the same. They are completely MR and cast blind. They hit very hard. Reavers are primarly a tank fight, make sure you have sufficient healing power and well managed mana (what if you get 9 reavers?) So, you pull Neh's reaver. Kill it, another reaver spawns instantly in its place, kill it, another reaver spawns instantly in its place, kill it, another reaver...I've heard of 12 spawning, but I've only seen 7 as a max. <br />
<br />
Neh isn't that tough at all. She is very MR and is mostly a tank fight like a reaver. Rak, of course, is a whole different ball game and really needs level 49 page pets (immune to his fire AOE) to get the job done safely. <br />
<br />
Remember, both Lords (Neh and Rak) can gate when low on health, they gate back to their spawn point (ie where their reaver died and they appeared). This gives us a great deal of power, since WE decide the spawn point. Utilize this to your advantage. <br />
<br />
There was a time when MULTIPLE Lords could be spawned (ie, a raid group came in, farmed some reavers for Jade Reavers and left the Lords spawned (only Ghiosk spawns aggro). Previously, if Rak was spawned and his reaver was also up, you could pop him again. This no longer works. If Rak is up and his reaver is up, killing Rak's reaver will not spawn another Rak. (or Neh) <br />

<br />
I'm a tradeskill nut, and the consensus among the tradeskill community is that stats affect only the chance of a skill raise, not the chance of success.  Also, the way strength affects it is that if your strength is higher than your wis or int, EQ will use your strength instead to determine your chance of a skill-up.</div></div><hr />

One comment, though. <br />
Strength: Affects carrying capacity directly. Improves damage in some capacity. Strength does affect blacksmithing skill raises and successes to some degree. <br />
<br />
This is generally held to be untrue. In fact, you even link to the eqtraders post that states this:<br />
<br />
Stats have no impact on your chance of success or failure when practicing tradeskills. (Only your current skill is supposed to impact your chances of success or failure when creating an item.)<br />
--<br />
<br />
As with other skills, stats have an effect on the chance to skillup, but the chance for success, as shown by the formula you also note  (( 1.15 * Skill ) - ( Trivial - 70 )), is not affected by strength.<br />
<br />
Therefore, it'd be good to remove the misinformation about strength affecting success.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your hard work!</div></div><hr />

Iksars have forage as racial advatage too, no?<br />
<br />
Iksars have racial forage ability. The skill is stuck at 50 from the beginning and can't be raised.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir have racial Safe Fall skill of 50, and racial Sneak skill of 50. I think these can't be trained either.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you folks, but if the group decides to run, it's generally after I've tried to slow em all, and I'm the person absolutely least likely to get out alive.  Hell, I can't remember the last time I tried to run out of a dungeon.  Seems like doing runspeed is fairly redundant.<br />
<br />
Whereas, whatever your wisdom happens to be, you can ALWAYS dump some wis gear for better ac/hp.  Why not take the points in regen/wis to get to the 2nd tier AA?<br />
<br />
I guess since insta-click boots are so easy for us, I figured we'd be relatively immune to the RS3 fascination.<br />
<br />
<br />
But holy cow, what a nice FAQ.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Alrightie, here's my thoughts as I read thru your lovely piece of work.  Thanks again for taking the time!<br />
<br />
Might want to post that STR directly effects no only your melee damage, but also your ATK (to hit).... on a 1 for 1 basis, I believe, before cap of course... - which is a lot more important for some folks.  Your tank is going to be outdamaged by every other melee, in general, but all they need to do is hit reliably to maintain that aggro....<br />
<br />
Stamina<br />
The 1sta = 3hp ratio is, I'm guessing, right for shamans.  But I'm certain that warriors get more bang for the buck.  Sorry I can't tell you exactly how much tho.<br />
<br />
Dex<br />
If you're going to mention the Cha rumor, might as well list the rumor (or fact, I sure don't know) that higher dex increases your chances to channel through hits.<br />
<br />
Okay, I know why I should slow...<br />
Might be worth mentioning that one use for the malo line (pre-malo) is that you can pretty much chain-cast that without gaining aggro (can't do that with slow on big stuff).  Then slow.</div></div><hr />

Suggestion for addition:<br />
<br />
Playing a shaman on a Zek (pvp) server.<br />
<br />
PvP as a shaman is extremely fun. Especially if you are the tenacious kind of player who likes challenges. Our powercurve shifts rapidly up and down depending on your lvl, but overall a shaman can hold his own and put up a good fight against most other classes.<br />
<br />
A shaman is a formidable opponent, if played right. At lvl60 even more so.<br />
<br />
Yes, played right. Because pvp as a shaman is not easy. Just like in the PvE department, we are very versatile, but we also lack any solid and dependable means of damage output. Our dots might seem like a very good weapon, but they are unfortunately resisted rather easily. Already at 50pr/dr will an even con enemy resist your dots more than half the time.<br />
<br />
To our advantage we have the black fur boots (part of Spear of Fate epic quest). These are obtainable at pretty low levels if you get some help. The boots instacast sow, which means no other class except bard and those riding on fast horses will be able to catch you should you decide to flee... err do a strategic regrouping. Add in our heals, cures, resist buffs, hp and regen buffs and you have an extremely durable pvp class.  A shaman is a caster, but can wear armor and buff himself to become quite the tank. A shaman will not fold over like a house of cards if a melee starts beating on him. Being the most melee oriented of all casters classes, a shaman can rather easily tear apart other casters using his spear or twohand blunt. The slam ability is also extremely effective here.<br />
<br />
Part of becoming successful as a shaman in pvp is using all the spells we have. Never assume a spell is junk until you have thought about all of its direct and indirect uses. Some spells might seem useless in pve, but in pvp its a whole different deal. Spells like cripple can effectively snare low strength races. Cure poison (yes the low lvl spell) removes tashani very quickly. Flash of light and blinding luminance renders a player character totally blind for up to 24 seconds. This is a spell I still use every day in pvp even at lvl60.<br />
<br />
Acquiring right click items and procing weapons is also a good way to become sucessful in pvp. Due to our high buffed dexterity we can often proc weapons pretty early on. The Journeymans walking stick procs tashani, which coupled with our malise spell line totally reduces the opponents resists and opens up for attacks using root and blind. Alchemy potions like damage shield and resists are also extremely effective.<br />
<br />
There is no way to cover every aspect of pvp as a shaman or even go beyond just scratching the surface. I can promise you that should you decide to take the step and play as a pvp shaman, you will never turn back. If you have any questions, feel free to look me up on the Vallon Zek server under the name Asta.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and remember, races without shaman die the fastest.</div></div><hr />

Not if you're trying to follow a moving guild raid force all with run speed 3.</div></div><hr />
