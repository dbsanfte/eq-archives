<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am half way through lvl 41, just maxxed my Def last night, yay!<br />
<br />
Anyway, my offence is about 190, but my piercing is about 165, y is this? I have used a piercer as my only weap since lvl 3. It is annoying me as piercing is taking a long time to raise. I have been soloing in ds for a few lvls trying to get my def up, now that it is I am a little more inclined to group. It really isn't a big deal to me, I mainly just wanted the free ac(833 unbuffed if I recall correctly)<br />
<br />
Just want some light shed. Also, how long do you think it will take for me to start kicking myself for not training another weap? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will start kicking yourself when you either win a Granite Face Grinder (for 2hb), start soloing and feel you need a tash on your mobs too (journeyman's walking stick, 1hb) or your guild does ntov and you get some uber weapons there.<br />
<br />
I personally maxed piercing at 59. Mainly cause I was bored on raids, other shaman was slowing, I was buffing and we were more or less zerging things, so i would work on piercing. Also when factioning dwagons, tagging along on other guilds doing Kael, i'd equip[ my goblin parrying dagger/spear/whatever (4/19) and buff str/dex/haste then go to town. Remeber to keep str and dex buffed if you are working on weapons, and if you are serious about wanting them maxed, DO IT NOW. Post 50, it's a LOT slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't worry about it, our melee means jack. get to 60 then feck about with your skills as they wont be doing much anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OMG I FINALLY maxed defense yesterday at lv 46!  I melee all the time when I solo (and I mostly been soloing last 10 levels), but defense was only creeping up.  <br />
<br />
Then, yesterday, fighting Seafury Clops with a 52 druid guildie, BAM, I got my last 3 defense points within 2 hours meleeing clops.  <br />
<br />
When I solo, I mostly feed on a steady stream on dark blues that are lower-level dark blues......maybe the clops were closer to an even con and it made that much of a difference!<br />
<br />
Piercing still at 178 or so...and I have used a piercer almost exclusively since lv. 20.  /Shrug.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Weapon skills increase at lvl*4, 200 max .. you can't max weapon skills till lvl 50.<br />
<br />
Max skill at 46 is 184</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail Shabby,<br />
<br />
As you go up in Level Skill Raises can be painfully slow.  I try and keep up with my Melee, Spells, Swimming, Sense Heading and others each time I level.</div></div><hr />
