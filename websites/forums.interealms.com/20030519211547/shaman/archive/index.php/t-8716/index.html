<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got my epic yesterday, did Neh and Rak at same night.<br />
<br />
Fought Rak outside throne room in corridor. no problems what so ever. Only had one mage and he used lvl 49 fire pet on Rak. After some time our warrior got restless and walked in, with only Ring of season on him. Seems the AoE dmg hardly touched him, so our monk went in as well. No problem there either.<br />
<br />
We had about 7 to 10 adds under the fight that a rouge, ranger and monk killed of. Seemed almost to easy. Might be just that now when people have tons of AA and lvls around 61 to 65 the fight is too trivial. Well atleast I am happy :D<br />
<br />
After I made my final hand in I got my faction to True Spirit reset too indifferent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats!   It's a great day when you get your spear, after a long hard quest.  Later, you'll be driven completely mad by the damn rainbow halo that you see at the edge of your sight while running invis  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gratz Armak!<br />
<br />
I remember you from Ariadnes Clew guild on Terris Thule??<br />
<br />
Hopefully this is the same Armak ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hoho yes it is, I remember the easy days in AC!<br />
<br />
Hello to you too!!<br />
<br />
<br />
/Armak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, that rainbow drives me nuts some times!<br />
<br />
But oddly enough, I can follow my invised druid and mage epic'd friends without acumen by following their epic trails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">same with my bard friend<br />
<br />
He sucks at leading people in auto follow, doesnt seem to understand they lag, and need him to stop occasionally.  Soo, i just follow his epic trail if i lose sight of him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">grats Armak was a pleasure to help you get your epic finally :)<br />
<br />
btw the MT was 63 with good amount of aa's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Congrats Armak!  <br />
<br />
Tryg, I remember you from the old Silent Power days on the Rathe.  Long time no see!  Hope you're well  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Congratulations to you Amrak!  Quite a feeling to get that &quot;final&quot; weapon, with all its wisdom.<br />
<br />
BTW  <br />
Eriadoc on the rathe...as in the mage?  Seekers of Lore?  Back when I knew that name I played my ranger Hyppy more than the shammy.  Now its about even.  I see you've seen the light and worked a Shaman instead of others =)<br />
<br />
/wave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, yup, the same Doc (gnome wiz, HIE chanter, human monk Bannen).  Glad to see y'all still around.  Look me up in-game.  =)<br />
