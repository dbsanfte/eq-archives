Kedge, an underwater theme maybe...?<br />
<br />
For kunark:<br />
<br />
Sebilis, hands down.<br />
<br />
Cabilis would make an excellent setting, since half of the city is in ruins.<br />
<br />
Velious:<br />
<br />
Kael, Thurgadin, Skyshrine and ToV has to have ancient catacombs all over :)<br />
<br />
Maybe something on luclin?<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove, Netherbain, The Deep and Echo Caverns sure has hundreds of miles of unexplored caves...<br />

The place seems perma-camped anymore.  With all the velium farmers and 65's AAing I'm having a heck of a time finding a palce to hunt the silks I need and no one ever seems to want to group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, having instanced Seb and Chardok would be really great.  Those dungeons are made to crawl and would be a good test to clear the entire zones in a few hours for a group.  Make a hard setting and it would separate the men from the boys, lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There you've hit on something.<br />
<br />
A &quot;longer&quot; LDoN . . . something that might take up to 3 hours.  (Yes, I know, go do some GoD trials.  I will as soon as my gear is a bit better).<br />
<br />
Sebilis would be a great instanced zone.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't mind longer instanced dungeons as long as there were incremental rewards available instead of &quot;whoops you didn't finish, you suck no prize for 3 hours of wasted life&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about one or two incremental rewards either.  There need to be several named along the way that drop good loot if it's going to be over an hour and a half. <br />
<br />
Speaking from experience, losing those mountain trials over and over again with ABSOLUTELY nothing to show for it sucks. (I lost Tipt 10-12 times, with my Time+ guildies.. granted it was when GoD first came out)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd love to see Dalnir instanced and made higher level.  Loved that zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kedge, an underwater theme maybe...?<br />
o.. and underwater theme.. fantastic idea.. would get a way to get ur swimming skill up.. and u would be able to buy stuff to make u hold ur breathe longer.. it could start out in caves just so u dont die lol.. part of it can be in water.. this would also make more of a use for the waterbreathing spells ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ive long wondered why there were so few adventure camps.  With the number of zones in EQ, even just the original EQ, having only 5 adventure camps seems to be a bit silly.  Especially with 3 of the 5 camps clustered so close to Freeport.<br />
<br />
What happened to Odus?  With the Hole, the Warrens and the 2 Erudite's war there is PLENTY of lore to surrport a camp.  What about the Karanas?  Solusek?    What about a camp of  giants and cyclopses ala Rathe area?<br />
<br />
Kunark? Lots of great ideas already in this thread.  Velious gives pleanty of chances to adjust factions and or assist your favorite race.  Luclin?  What about those alien races up there?  The elemental areas in Twilight are fascinating, and ripe for instancing, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">maybe one in OoW that is a battleground or u fight Gods... but it would be a nice way to have fun and raise good faction (ex: Ur a dark elf.. u do ldons in a certain area and u can gain gfay faction).. and u wouldnt have to spend weeks to get it up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Luclin &quot;ldon&quot; 's would be incredible fun methinks. My main is a Vah shir though, so Im biased, but sebilis, chardok and luclin would make excellent ldon type trips if they could be instanced like Vigdis said. Just.. please, I'd druther have old froglok models for sebilis than the new guktan frogs... and please.. no more ice themes (i'm about to go bonkers if I do another EF adventure..).<br />
<br />
Other zones could be something based off of well.. Kunark! SO long as there's more lore behind it, and not cheesy lore. (Big iksar empire fan here, yet I play a vah shir,go figger). Not fond of the idea of Velious type ldons... suppose maybe some raid type ones here as alternatives to Vindi/AoW/Statue and NToV/HoT/ToV raids. Make them like god expeditions with the add/removal of people for the latecomers or early-to-bed types or emergency &quot;I gotta go&quot; things.<br />
<br />
Just my useless 2cp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">tidy thats a good idea.. with the add/removeall of people..</div></div><hr />

<br />
was velks upgraded? i cant imagine that zone competing with PoP exp if its the same exp as i remember it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">make LDoN's in place no one goes.<br />
<br />
Odus is awesome - Kerran stuff, heretics, Elementials from the ruins, Kobolds and -=BONUS=- a whole Panda dungeon (no really that would amuse me to no end).<br />
<br />
Or Make current underappreciated zone an instanced zone.  No time limit, ability to add/remove a limited # of people with randomed named/loot but tuned to the group/groups.  Dalnir is one I love that would be cool (have to move some greenmist stuff). Najena, Befallen.<br />
<br />
Would also have much better layout thancurrent bleh LDoN's.<br />
<br />
also a high end only separate instanced city zone wher you kill mobs of that city would be too fun - Deepest Kaladim? Felwith Prison? Hidden Caves of Halas? Would totally ruin your faction in that city (making zoning out a bit of an adventure) but would rock.<br />
<br />
Don't touch Seb, SG or Chardok though - I keel you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dont touch VT as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm not 65 so I can't say why they are there as opposed to somewhere else.  The XP sucks for me at 56  :rolleyes:   I would guess it's because they can slaughter the place with little risk.  Speed over quality?  Or maybe it's because they can get the velium too (although Crystal Caverns seems better for that).<br />
<br />
The place can't support more than 1 or 2 65s but there seems to be 4 or more in there sometimes, mostly rangers and wizards.<br />
<br />
With the groups camping the main floor too things don't live long there.  I've put off my shawl for a while in the hopes that they will move on eventually.<br />
<br />
Very unfriendly zone from my experience.  Dulak has a better atmosphere, better money and better experience.  I wouldn't go to Velks at all if I didn't need the silk for my shawl.  Might be different on other servers though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">All the above places, sound great however I however would like to see some vellious ones just want to crawl though a dungeon killing dragons.<br />
<br />
Also I would like to see a dungeons where you have to really crawl though, i.e. fight your way out of?<br />
<br />
So in short you start off deep in the dungeon and have to fight your way out with Mobs gradually getting harder as you progress. Could throw a big bad one just before the exit!</div></div><hr />

Its sad and pathetic, but people skip expansions all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really think this is valid, in this day and age. Try finding ruins of Kunark or Scars of Velious in the stores now a days. You won't. Instead you find the bundled version, Evolution which has the original game through LoY in one package. 2 years ago this would have been a valid point, and it is a valid point for expansions less than a year old.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hmm I personally think the concept of having entire dungeons like OS instanced would be a terrible idea, but I like the idea of Ssra instanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats the difference?  One's a dungeon the others a temple.  Is it related to raiding, or something different?<br />
<br />
Kror hit the nail on the head:<br />
<br />
Would also have much better layout thancurrent bleh LDoN's<br />
<br />
Give me a collect mission in Old Seb, gimme 51 pts at the end of it and I'd be happier.<br />
<br />
Now for a REAL pipe dream, give me an Assasination mission with no time limit where I have to find and kill a lvl 68 Reet Shaman somewhere in Seb for 105 pts.<br />
<br />
Currently, the LDON dungeons are cookie cutter layouts that people fly through as fast as possible.  The only original part of each one is a big boss area at the end...since most people do collects you never even see it...especially if its a dead end and youre not the puller.<br />
<br />
So give me the exact same LDON 'hard stuff' = points, missions, augments, no respawn, etc.  But put it in a dungeon that is truly a unique design.  Blackburrow/Najena/Sol AB(C)/Kaesora/Split Paw.<br />
<br />
Its almost like SOE said &quot;Hmmm...after the first 100 runs through the Sunken Library it will be boring, might as well make it boring from the start&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ultimately people wont be happy either way. The only way they would is with random dungeons that are truly interesting which is hard.<br />
<br />
Seb? People would get bored after 30 runs in it. Heck it would be advantage to have a fixed layout because you would know where big mob concentrations are, likely boss spots, etc. Personally I am having a lot of fun going back to finish my stone after pt capping (1492+) each theme. Far more fun now that I have seen every theme a couple of times and now I know which ones yield 3 bosses in 3 connected rooms (my favorite Tak mission).<br />
<br />
My 2cp after 293 wins :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I like the idea of Ssra instanced.<br />
<br />
OMG.  Not ANOTHER snake model!!!!  SSRA is probably designed by the laziest designer, and probably done in 20mins.  Just snakes and skellies in the zone.  How imaginative is that?<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I wouldn't mind longer instanced dungeons as long as there were incremental rewards available instead of &quot;whoops you didn't finish, you suck no prize for 3 hours of wasted life&quot;.<br />

<br />
A version of Karnors Castle like this would rock!  It could even be something like layered instances and at the end of each one (say ~45mins) you have the option of continuing in further for more points / more and better named or ending the adventure.  The first instance would be the bridge/moat area which you must clear all of, then the inner courtyards, then upstairs, then down into the center and finally basement.<br />
<br />
Think HeroQuest (is that the game?)  There were several tabletop games with peuter / plastic miniatures and floorplans you used to create the map, place furniture and monsters, and orient the players.<br />
<br />
/drool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Seblis , dalnir , chardok, velks , veks , some luclin zones ...oh and make all of them able to be accessed by one person.. i would love to solo seblis instance even if it took me all day.  Even the current ldons..i would love to do them solo even if i die a horrible death</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I very highly doubt you will ever see LDoN camps based on anything that isn't found in the old world for one simple reason.

<br />
They can simply make Kunark and Velious free downloads to everquest subscribers, which will net them more profit in the long run as they can then use expectation of the player having those expansion maps and models in future expansions.  That sounded a bit jumbled but trust me that underneath it is a thought that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Kaesora, Dalnir's, and Sebilis would all be good instanced zones for Kunark.<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns, Tower of Frozen Shadow, Velk's lab, and Dragon Necropolis would be good for Velious.<br />
<br />
Luclin could use instances for it's empty dumb zones. An Instanced Deep, Fungus Grove, and Ssra would be nifty. One can also make an argument for instanced versions of some of the cooler Luclin outdoor zones - Scarlet Desert and Twilight Sea, Umbral Plains, etc.<br />
<br />
PoP, could retrofit the PoJ trials, PoN hedge events, and HoH trials to be instanced.<br />
<br />
Legacy of Ykesha just needs a single Guktan zone where trolls can go take revenge. Build it like The Forgotten Halls.<br />
<br />
And as for original EQ, here's zome zones I would love to see instanced<br />
<br />
Crushbone or Blackburrow - Let newbies have some instancing fun!<br />
Splitpaw - GREAT zone, no reward worth going after, though.<br />
Gorge of King Xorbb - Nifty place, could use some help, though<br />
The Warrens - This tiny little pimple of a dungeon is just begging for instancing. it already has the ho-hum layout!</div></div><hr />
