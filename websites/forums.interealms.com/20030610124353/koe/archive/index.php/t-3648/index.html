<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm kinda hyped about finally getting my level 51 spell, scintillation, which unloads quite a bit of damage point blank.<br />
I was wondering if anyone had ever done an AE group in Seb?  I'd love to try my new spell out, if any other enc/mage/wiz/clerics would like to form an AE group in there and play around (I'll be there the next few days)!  Just wondering if this would really be a good idea - or not (too many mobs? or can you really have too many mobs with AE?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have not heard of AE groups in Seb and my inital thinking is it would be dangerous with the multi levels and structure of the zone along with the proximity of the camps. In addition, there are a lot of casters, which have a tendancy to stand off and cast spells, so it makes it hard to pack them all in. <br />
<br />
HS is a great place to AE, but you need a DA puller to avoid all the HTs..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, have been involved in some/seen them at Necro and the D1 tunnel.  Seb can be dangerous for AE, as you can (with Pillars) aggro mobs below you (i.e. juggies/shrooms) and cause MASSIVE carnage or get summoned to Gods know where, to a quick and painful death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AE in Seb is FUN!!<br />
<br />
At 51 i wouldn't try it though you'll get a hell of a beat down just due to level aggro unless you have a high level enchanter to do it with that can lock all the mobs down with stuns with little resists.<br />
<br />
D1 / D2 / Chef are all good places for it.<br />
<br />
However, HS is really great for AE, just need a competent group you can trust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know, it's dangerous, but is is fun, eh Moebeus :) I knew that people did it many times in there, so I know that it's doable, just high risk I guess.  But high risk high reward, eh?<br />
HS seems more of an ideal place I guess, but you can't go in there and shout &quot;Starting an AE group&quot; :p  I know I might die ( yes I know Moebeus :p ), but it is still fun, hehe.  If anyone is still interesting in dying *ermph* I mean having some fun in Seb just give me a tell!<br />
<br />
Also, Kly, never really thought of the caster mob factor.. that might provide some trouble, I dunno.  Thanks for replying everyone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AE in HS is probably one of the best times I've had. Please keep in mind that your puller MUST be a Cleric, Pally, or very high level warrior due to harm touches.  Having a cleric or pally DA pull is the best way since they can grab up to 10 mobs at a time for the rest to AE.<br />
<br />
Personally having a few mages, enchanter, cleric, and a wiz or 2 to fill in the spots is the perfect group.    Mage pets take care of tanking for 1 or 2 mob pulls, otherwise its MAJOR AE FUN!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL Nind<br />
I have yet to experience a Moebeus pull, but I can tell it would be quite a load... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mydain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did I ever tell you all how much I truly enjoy inside jokes?<br />
<br />
Just wondering.<br />
