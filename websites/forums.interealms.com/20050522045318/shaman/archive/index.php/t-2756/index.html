<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had a RL friend return to the game after bailing on me for Daoc. (50 bard). Got him some gear and modrod2 for his 57 mage and have been showing him luclin, exping here and there. Seems to be working fantastically. I tank most of the time, or his incarnation of Jabatik (earthpet) works just fine in a pinch as well. Torpor and modrods rock for him. Rain spells/malosini + pet that hits for 70 and doesnt ask for buffs.... nice =)<br />
<br />
Really enjoying it so far, doesnt seem to be a whole lot we cant kill together. I think we might try some cliffgolems this weekend to get him caught up on a few spells. <br />
<br />
Would like to camp a few nice items for him if possible. Did get him the mage earring out of ME the other day as a nice surprise. Anyone seen any other decent mage gear drop recently that we might go after?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My two 60 mage epic friends both just left the game, and it's a shame.  It's great duoing with a mage.<br />
<br />
Used to pull multiples and slow them all, then both me and mage would cast rain spells on them, and I'd torpor him up so he could madly rain away.  We got really good at it and it was pretty fun and quick.</div></div><hr />
