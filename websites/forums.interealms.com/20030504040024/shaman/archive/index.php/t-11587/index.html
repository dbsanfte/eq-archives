<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there is a stoicism thread in the spells section - yet there is confusion whether or not the quest is broken/fixed. I can honestly tell you, IT IS FIXED. I just got Stoicism for myself and a level 49 shaman. Here is how you do it.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE: Always hail the npc before doing a turn in! ALWAYS! Or else there is a possibility they eat the item.<br />
<br />
1) Go to Dulak's Harbor and kill drunken pirates till &quot;Empty Flask&quot; drops. It is no drop, and can either be a fast or slow camp. Took me 40 kills, took another 3.<br />
2) Go underwater to the &quot;an impassive sea spirit&quot; in Gulf of Gunthak at /loc 700, -300, -150 (underwater in a sunken boat). Have the flask in your inventory, target and hail him. Give him the empty flask. You should now have &quot;A Large Rock&quot; in your inventory. It is no drop, 26 pounds, and giant (doesn't fit in rallic pack even!). Hold on at this point.<br />
3) Make pet, buff up, make sure you have waterbreathing, etc. Mem a DOT or two, and make sure pet is hasted.<br />
4) Target and hail the sea spirit again. Give it the large rock. This should spawn two elemental NPCs near the opening of the sunken boat named Flotsum and Jetsam. They are Green to a level 60, Light Blue to 54, and I hear Dark Blue to 42.<br />
5) Pull with slow first, and kill both. Nothing a good DOT or two shouldn't fix! They only hit around 60 damage.<br />
6) Loot the &quot;Part of (elemental's name)&quot; from each of them. You should have two items.<br />
7) Target and HAIL the impassive sea spirit. Give him both items at the SAME TIME. Congrats, you have recieved Spell: Stoicism!!<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are the stats on the spell?  I don't have a link to Lucy handy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's 160hp per tick for 4 ticks,<br />
100% snare, 30% slow (same as torpor)<br />
180 mana cost<br />
6 seconds cast time<br />

All in all, very similar to torpor, and our best heal by *far* from 44 to 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Got mine last night without a hitch. Hooray!!! :)<br />
<br />
Flotsam and Jetsam are real pushovers. They were light blue to me at 52 and I think they're an over-con. Able to single pull, slow and let the dog do the rest. Once you've got the flask, this fight is a breeze.<br />
<br />
I found the easiest place to pull to when hunting Drunken Pirates was the SW corner. No aggro, no pops and drunks spawn regularly in the closest house. Pulled 5 drunks and got 2 flasks out of them, which made me and another shaman in zone very happy.<br />
<br />
And now I truly understand what the big deal is about Torpor.</div></div><hr />

VERY nice, I know this would have been a godsend at those levels for downtime tank heals and all caster heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Got mine last night and have since discovered that this spell makes mana regeneration a joke (at 51). I was able to go from &lt; 1 bub mana to full mana in about 1/4 the time it normally takes me.<br />
<br />
I killed 16 Drunken Pirates before the flask dropped. For those of you that can't handle more than one of these guys, here's how I did it:<br />
<br />
Go invisible before zoning into the Harbor ... this place is train central if its busy. Head past the scouts hugging the right wall. You will hit a row of buildings along the right wall as you enter the city. Each of these buildings (4 or 5 of em) contains a Drunken Pirate and some other riff-raff. Opposite this row of buildings is one large building. There are many patrols that wander between the row and the big building. Here's what I discovered: there is a dead spot.<br />
<br />
If you  stand near the large building across from the next to last house in the row (there are some barrels against the large building at this point), all the patrols will ignore you, even if you are fighting. Initially I was fighting in the middle of the row and rooting the patrols as they came by. I discovered the dead spot by accident. Don't stand too close to the building or you will add from inside the building. About half a Troll lenght from the building is fine.<br />
<br />
If you do get an add for some reason, just park it and zone when you are done with the pirate, then come back. Your parked add will have forgotten about you and wandered off by this time.<br />
<br />
At 51 all the Drunkards came out as singles even when they had to run by other mobs (everything was light blue to me). Not sure if this is a function of the Pirates AI or my level. <br />
<br />
Using the technique of walking into a building invisible, selecting the Drunken Pirate inside, then walking to the dead spot and pulling from there I was able to kill the last 12 of my Pirates as singles ... no adds at all. <br />
<br />
While there I heard one guy say he killed 30 before he got his and another said 7.<br />
<br />
Well anyway, hope this helps. Anyone who doesn't have Topor NEEDS this spell. Its that good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">now, the real question becomes, ... does stoicism have the same new cool spell effect look like topor does  ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Soticism has a bunch of floaty blue disks surrounding the caster and castee. Looks cool to me, not sure if its the same as Topor though. (never seen Topor cast)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>skwayb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Same spell effects as Torpor.  Not sure if it is the same as Quienesence.<br />
<br />
A fellow shaman and I were chain casting this lastnight in PoK and some friends thought I finally got Torpor (Killed emp 40 times and close to 60 GWs and still nada).  I laughed and told them the need to read their spell messages (if they have them on). <br />
<br />
It is still a very nice spell and helps out in the mana regen rather nicely for us torpor/quienesence less shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would suggest that when you hand in the large rock you should stand as far back to the closed end of the boat (so you are looking out towards the open end) as possible.  This will prevent the both of the two spawns (Flotsam and Jetsam) from auto-agroing as soon as they spawn.  You should be able to single pull with slow.  Or just invite a single 50ish melee and they will drop in about 1 minute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also wanted to say I got 2/5 a blue of regular exp. at 54 for the final battle/turn ins.  This took about 15 mins, if I ever happen to loot another flask, I'll do the quest again just for the exp.</div></div><hr />

No.  It does not cancel Sow.  In fact, with Sow and this on you cannot move backwards but still move forward at about regular walk speed.  Sweetest Spell in my inventory, especially with a Mana Pres item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>harowen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've noticed that it's not too difficult to get 5 ticks worth of healing out of stoicism instead of the 4 that you're supposed to.  Just like with torpor, if the spell lands right as a tick is happening then you'll get 5 pulses of healing.<br />
<br />
6.0 cast time, with spell haste 2 it's 5.1 cast time.  If I start to cast it immediately upon or just before a tick it finishes casting 0.9 secs or so before the tick.   When the spell wears off the buff goes away but the tick happens and you get the benefit anyways.  <br />
<br />
I was using this for healing all last night and a good portion of the time I'd get 800hps out of it instead of 640.</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm 62, and I'll admit it was not quite the end all be all experience I was kind of hoping, but then again, it's just a baby Torpor.<br />
I just got it last night, so I can only comment so far on its usefulness.<br />
That being said, it seems like it will hold me over until I can get the real thing (if I can get the real thing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey, no problem ;) I just thought the threads over in the Spells forums were too cluttered..it just confuses people. Anyways, I hear ya brother! This spell rocks for torpor-less shamans, even if you consider it a novelty. The graphics are great, the joy of snaring my ranger friends is great, slowing melee clerics...ah yes, fun indeed. /smile</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err, I strongly recommend you hail before turn in. The 49 shaman I was with had his quest pieces eaten twice because he didn't hail. He turned in the two items from elementals without hailing - bam eaten. How long does it take to hail anyway? 0.5 seconds. Better safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
Edit: The reason I say this is because I heard/read that in LoY, when you hail a Quest NPC they analyze to see if you have all the correct items, then you hand them in. I believe this was to prevent MQing</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got tired of endless killing of lt blue mobs, and began moving up and down the first row of houses on the right.  I first killed all drunken pirates that I could find, and then began pulling brigands, mercenaries, and exhausted pirates out of the houses.  The Drunken Pirates respawned before I cold clear the row of houses.  I used the Drunken Pirate that spawns outside the second house as my timer.  The occasional wandering Dock Guard or Guardian (dark blue) spiced things up a bit.  I looted my Empty Flask after 10 -15 pirates.  I made about 400pp in cash loot and vendor trash.<br />
<br />
The turn-in worked fine, and Flotsam and Jetsam were ridiculously easy for a 53 shaman.  I did talk to a shaman that (apparently) turned the pieces in to his pet.  He warned me about it, so I dismissed my pet before handing in the pieces, and got it without problems.  I have yet to use it though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you just pulled a tough one with high resists... The quest is most definitely not out of reach for a solo 52 Shaman. I could take one drunk without slowing him, just root and pet and ebolt him, dead in about 30 seconds. I got resists on a slow about 5 percent of the time. <br />
 Don't give up, because they really are very easy to kill. What server are you on?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play on Tallon Zek. Maybe I just had a bad night but it was actually more than one that I had difficulty with. I stayed and pulled a few more, probably 4 or 5 total and they were all just about the same as the first. I'll go back and try again but I think I'll bring my druid friend with me next time, he needs a couple items for his 44 heal spell in that zone anyway.</div></div><hr />

Drop rate on empty flask must be wildly variable, because I had one drop from the first drunken pirate I ever killed.  Then another off the second pirate I killed.  I couldnt believe it.  Pirates easy to solo with just slow, pet and JBB at 61.  Same with the two elementals who spawn near the impassive sea spirit; trivial to solo at 61.  Started and finished the Stocism quest on my first visit to Dulak within 30 min, but I am sure I got lucky on the drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
regarding the resists, i had some (green at 60) drunken resisting first slow or root, but neither on 2nd attempt. they hit pretty fast and can take out some HP before you reslow, but don't panic and you should be able to make it.<br />
<br />
as for the level, while i was after my empty flask , there was a 52 shaman beside me doing exp on the mobs and she didn't seems to complained. (had a eye on her just in case.. but she did pretty well)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not as efficient as kraggs is for canning down, but its faster and safer, so deffinately worth using instead.  It's great for soloing where the mobs dont hit too hard too, but doesnt do much against your average mob in pop.  In a place like katta you can keep up your hp no problem.</div></div><hr />

I finally got safe into 56...man am I tired of gnolls.  So I decided I would head over to try this quest out.  Made it to Dulak and as suggested heaeded for the third hut.  There was one drunk inside, so I backed out and got my puppy ready.  (slight delay due to green wandering agro)  Well I head back into the third hut only to see a drunk standing on the platform in front of the door.  He's green so I pull him with Bane, sick puppy, and he's gone in seconds.  I was just figuring to settle in for a long camp when I looted and found an empty flask!!!  As stated by everyone the turn in fight is extremely easy (btw Flotsam and Jetsam both con green at 56), and I am now the proud owner of Stoicism.  And yes this spell is great!  I only have one serious complaint about it.  I have a hard time hitting the can button fast enough to keep up between Stoicism, Regrowth, and natural regen (yes I'm a lizard).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Finished this quest over the weekend and thought I'd post my summary:<br />
<br />
My information during the quest:<br />
Level 47 Troll Shaman on Terris Thule<br />
900 AC, 915 ATK, 1750 hp<br />
Buffs:  Tali of Altuna, Guardian, Fury, Alaricity, Chloroplast, Spirit of Bihli<br />
<br />
Dulak's Harbor:<br />
Took me about 20 drunks before I got my flask, plus about 400 pp in vendor loot (gems, bracelets, etc...)  I zoned it, invised and ran along the right wall to the harbor.  I set up along the barn wall opposite the drunk houses, right next to the pile of boxes &amp; barrels in the corner.  I didn't have any aggro in this spot from wanderers, even while fighting.  If I stayed along the barn wall and moved farther inland, I would aggro an Engineer's assistant through the barn wall.  Dark blue, not too hard a fight but wastes time.<br />
<br />
Fight strategy was:  slow (Togors), Venom of Snake, &amp; melee (I have a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang plus Silver Chitin Hand Wraps).  They conned dark blue/light blue at about a 50/50 ratio.  By the time VoS wore off, they were at 20% so I just melee'd them down.  The never ran when low on hp and dropped easily.  Also, I have very, very few resists on the drunks, either to slow, root, VoS, Scourge or Blast of Poison.<br />
<br />
I pulled the following drunks:<br />
Hut closest to water:  Drunk inside door on the left.  Invis, open door, target drunk, run to fight spot, pull with slow.  Single pull with a full spawn in the hut, no adds.<br />
<br />
2nd hut:  I think I pulled from this hut.  Same strategy as above.<br />
<br />
3rd hut:  Sleeping drunk on cot to the left of door.  Same strategy with pull, single pull with no adds with a full spawn in the room (even though they were ~10 feet away and staring right at the sleeping drunk).<br />
<br />
4th hut:  Drunk standing outside, single pull with slow, no adds.<br />
<br />
5th hut (last in row away from water):  I never pulled from or checked to see if there are any drunk spawns inside.<br />
<br />
All the fights were single pulls with no adds if I stayed next to boxes/barrels along the barn wall.  If I moved inland along the barn wall, I would aggro passing guards and some through the barn wall.  A couple of times I screwed up (pulled while guards were walking by) and got 3-4 adds.  I hoofed it to the zone line easily with SoW, bringing a fairly large train but zoned with no problems.  <br />
<br />
Empty flask graphic is purple, not broken, no-drop, SHM only.<br />
The rest of my loot was Shiv's, broken bottles, some words/runes, and gems.<br />
<br />
Gulf of Gunthak:<br />
Once I got my empty flask, I gated back to the lighthouse and buffed up for the final fight.  I summoned a pet and dropped everything I had on me and dogdog.   Note:  Dogdog was not Alphatized.<br />
<br />
Buffs:  <br />
Tali of Altuna, Guardian, Fury, Alaricity, Chloroplast, STR, DEX, STA, AGI, CHA, Spirit of Bihli, Enduring Breath (IMPORTANT since you go underwater).  NO BEARFORM!!!  Dogdog had everything but Enduring Breath.<br />
<br />
Swam underwater to Impassive Sea Spirit (+700, -300), hailed him and gave him the empty flask.  I had 1 open inventory spot, but the Large Rock ended up on my cursor.  I moved behind him (facing the open end of the boat), hailed him again and gave him the Large Rock.  Flotsam and Jetsam immediately spawned at the open end of the boat.  Both were Dark blue and scowling, but did not aggro.  Pulled left one with slow, single pull.  Dropped VoS, sent dogdog and melee'd.  They do run when low on health so be sure to root.  The fight was amazingly simple and lasted less than 30 sec (VoS didn't have a chance to wear off).  Looted the piece and pulled the second one with the same strategy.  Same fight, looted the second piece.  No resists on either of them.<br />
<br />
Went back to the impassive spirit, hailed again and turned in the 2 pieces.  I had an open inventory slot again, but the spell scroll ended up on my cursor.  Memmed it right there and it rocks!  :)  And yes, a few times I've gotten an extra healing tick if you cast it at the right time.<br />
<br />
I got good experience for the quest, don't remember exactly but I think about a bub and a half (blue) xp.  <br />
<br />
Happy hunting to all you Stoicism questers!<br />
<br />
One last note:  Dulak's Harbor seemed a decent place to xp grind.  Lotta dark blues, easy to single pull and good loot (fire opals, star rubies, mithril armlets, etc...) plus weapons and 1-7pp per mob (on average).  My only problem is running LoY with 8 mb of video memory...  eep!!!  I had to fight the drunks while staring at their feet, otherwise I'd crash to desktop.  Hehe, dance drunk dance!!  Stab, stab, stab.  Dance drunk dance!!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Had to do this quest twice because the first time I did it I HANDED THE TURN-IN TO MY STUPID DOG!<br />
<br />
Anway, it took me about an hour to get the flask by myself. I camped the SW corner between last hut and harbor. Then I went and screwed up the turn-in (dumb dog) so I had to go back. I stayed for about another hour till some friends came and joined me. We pulled everything we saw, and eventually the zone crashed when the captain popped. After getting back on, finally got the flask to drop after another couple of hours. <br />
<br />
This time I parked the dog at entrance to sunken boat, and made absolutely sure I handed in the flask to the tiny water elemental. Worked that time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Oh also, with the quest I spent about 2 hours a day there for like 6 days, and got no flask. Then the next day I came in, and the first pirate I pulled of the steps outside the 2nd building dropped it for me. Probably killed 80 or so pirates prior to that. <br />
 Then a couple days later I helped a friend, and it dropped after about 45 minutes, 10 pirates or so.<br />

<br />
I never had a pet while fighting the drunks - didn't feel I needed one.  The spot I fought in rarely had any adds or other aggro...  no aggro during fights, no aggro while just standing/sitting.  I would invis to be safe, then use it to target the next drunk.<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo (if I copied the link correctly).  It lists my AC at 860 unbuffed, which I think is about right.  Guardian and Fury should push me over the 900 AC range.  I use an ikky bp, but have a barbed ringmail to swap out on occasions and currently have a fungi on loan from a friend for the next month or so.<br />

The spell effect is not a root (i.e. 100% snare).  It's about the same as regular Torpor if you don't have sow on.  Mind you, I have run 3 so that may make a difference.  <br />
<br />
Quiescence has zero snare/slow component to it and is targettable outside your group, unlike the other two.<br />

There was no other shaman in the zone, so I figured I would repeat the quest for the exp.  My first stoicism spell was memmed so I went through the quest and killed the 2 elementals.  Guess what?  Absolutely NO EXP for the turn ins if you have the spell already.  I guess SOE didn't want anyone using the quest to get exp.

Same with mobs gobbling up turn ins.  (Pretty sure of this, anyway.)<br />
<br />
Btw... spent two 5 hour sessions in Dulak camping those pirates before the darn thing dropped.  (Lucky me, huh?)  During that time I discovered some stuff I thought I'd share.<br />
<br />
I camped the houses as per the guide above, and out of sheer boredom, discovered that the houses along the docks have drunken pirates as well.  (So do the houses behind the warehouse (opposite side of where the guide says to pull to), but those are almost impossible to pull as there's nowhere to pull them to without adds.)  Pulling the ones along the dock became easy once I found out that if you stand inbetween the door frame, while the door is open, you can click the door to close it and find a few hidden drunks behind the door(s).  This worked on the houses described in the guide above as well.  This makes it easy to pull, as you target, reopen the door, get to a safe distance, and cast slow to pull without aggro'ing a single add.  Then walk them back to the area with the barrels and boxes, as per the guide, and have your pet kill the sorry thing.<br />
<br />
Anyway... once I got the drop, I headed into Gunthak to finish the quest.  To keep you guys from looking around for that elusive Impassive Sea Spirit, it's in the wreckage of a boat that is half way between the lighthouse and the shore.  (Sorry, didn't get a loc.)  It's all the way in the back of the wreck, and it's a really small mob.  If you are running around with your clip plane turned down, you might miss it like I did.<br />
<br />
Turn in, get rock, buff pet, turn in rock...  Flotsam and Jetsam spawned behind me at the entrance to the boat that was surrounding me.  They didn't aggro.  Really easy kills.   It took one Envenomed bolt plus the pet kicking it's ass and they dropped quickly.  EB didn't even finish.  Single pulled them w/ slow.  Loot, turn in, scribe and happy cann'ing shammies.<br />

Pirate is an easy fight - slow and blast with Blast of Poison a few times. Might want to root him as tracking is funny and he sometimes runs out of the zone on Xegony.<br />

Had good luck with Empty Bottle drop - got quickly.<br />
<br />
After doing the proper handins to the spirit I hasted pet and the blinded one elemental sicked doggy on the other slowed him - hit with Blast of Poison a few times and repeated on the other one. Took very little damage. Went down to 2 bubbles of mana - had KEI though.<br />

Anyway then I brought my 61 wizard and started killing the drunken pirates in the 4 or 5 houses between Gunthak zone in and SW corner, had to clear the drunken pirate spawns (only the pirate spawns) 2 times to get the flask. I think it was 12 pirates, anyway after I had the flask drop I just logged in shaman to loot it, got a 60 ranger friend to help kill the elementals. (Though I believe I could have killed them solo, but he was heading to Dulak anyway.)<br />
<br />
Hailed the spirit and went through the text, then handed in the flask. Hailed him again and handed in the rock, killed the elementals and looted the pieces. Hailed the spirit again and handed in the items and got Stocism. BTW if anyone is wondering, at level 41 you get almost 3 blue bubs of exp for the 2 elemental kills and for final hand in (while grouped with a level 60).</div></div><hr />

I did follow the directions and headed right once in Dulak.  The first bank of houses were being camped by another group.  So my lvl42 Paladin buddy and I set up in the corner by the the dock that doesn't have a ship you can board (it's just a dead end).<br />
<br />
Anyway, after about 2 hours of pulling and getting decent exp, the group that was pulling the first ank of houses told me an Empty Bottle had just dropped off one of their drunks.<br />
<br />
I thanked them and looted it, then the paladin and I ran to Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Flotsam and Jetsam were CAKE!  Paladin attacks, slow, VoS, Blizzard Blast and it would be at 30-35% hp.  Loot, repeat.<br />
<br />
Had to cast it a few times before I logged, I LOVE IT!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raid group with someone, ANYONE, they don't even have to be in the same zone (but make sure YOU at least have looting rights).  This negates the TLC.  Ok, a cheap work around, maybe even a cheat, but really I think the TLC goes too far sometimes.  And yes, the items DO TLC, a friend of mine did this quest the other day and forgot about the code.</div></div><hr />

That &quot;no aggro&quot; spot at the end of the large building beside the crates (closest to the dock) is an excellent spot to set up camp. If you set up in front of the crates you'll draw aggro from the patrols even if you're just standing/sitting there.</div></div><hr />
