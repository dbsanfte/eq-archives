It depends on how far ahead of the game you want to be. If you want a computer for gaming and you got the money I say go all out. Now I was to build a PC for my friends with a high cash limit i would do this. The following prices are from www.webuildpcs.com<br />
<br />
Case - I don't care what my case looks like i just like fuctionality..so i would go with:<br />
<br />
(300W) Mid USB TM-369 ATX Case price   $40.88<br />
<br />
now I would want a bigger powersupply so add another 25 bucks if you want a bigger supply, but you don't need it.<br />
<br />
Motherboard - I really really like the Soyo Dragon motherboards. They have awsome built in sound (better then sound blaster live or audigy) and built in ethernet to save a PCI slot<br />
<br />
SOYO K7V DRAGON Plus price $139.99<br />
<br />
Now we need 1gig of DDR ram. I would do this in 2 512meg chips<br />
<br />
512MB DDR PC-2400 266mhz price  $139.99 each<br />
<br />
Now you need a Hard drive...I think 40 gigs would be enough you could always expand later. <br />
<br />
I prefer western digital 40 gigs price $89.99<br />
<br />
Now for the big stuff a video card. You have 3 major choices here. You could get a Geforce 4 and pay out your butt, or get a GeForce 3 128meg or what i use a ATI RADEON 8500<br />
<br />
ATI RADEON 8500 price  $157.30 or <br />
Cardex - GEFORCE3 TI200 128MB DDR W/TV - ( Limited Edition ) price $199.99<br />
<br />
Now for the big one..the processor I wouldn't go anything less then a XP 1600 but the price differnece between a 1600 and a 1900 is only 62 bucks so go with the 1900 (XP 2000's are still way too expensive) <br />
<br />
AMD Athlon XP 1900 266fsb Socket A Cpu price $162.15 or you could shoot for the stars and get a <br />
AMD Athlon XP 2100 266fsb Socket A Cpu price $277.73<br />
<br />
Ok as of right now you got about 870.29 spent and no keyboard, mouse or monitor. This machine is better then what you need to play EQ or any other MMRPG's comming out soon and prob for a year or so. If you need a keyboard and mouse, I suggest best buy or someplace like that (why pay shipping when it costs more then the product.) And you are looking at around 200 dallors for a 19inch monitor or 300 for a 21 inch and about 150 dallors for a legit copy of windows (if poeple actually use those). Now this all depends on the fact you know how to put a computer together which is not hard at all.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">$750-$900, if you build it yourself, or know someone who does, shouldget you a machine that will take you all the way through 2003 without need to upgrade :)<br />
<br />
I just made my final round of upgrading for 2002.  Ill get a new machine 1st/2nd QTR of 2003...but now, Im looking at:<br />
<br />
P3 933<br />
512 MB PC133 SDRAM<br />
20GIG HD<br />
SB LIVE<br />
GeForce 2 500 ULTRA w/64MB DDR RAM<br />
<br />
I scream in performance right now with SoL with all models on in 800X600...until it gets crowded.  If I were to build a machine (on a budget) to take me through 2003, then I would buy:<br />
<br />
AMD 1900<br />
40 gig 7200 RPM HD<br />
512 MB DDR PC2100<br />
Geforce 3 Ti500 <br />
<br />
Then, Id prolly add an extra 512 ram if I needed it.  Shouldnt need over 512mb for any application in the next 18 months of gaming.  :)<br />
<br />
Have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BrahmaDaShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you havent already check out PCmech forums (www.pcmech.com)  and Pricewatch (www.pricewatch.com)  for the best prices. Be careful on pricewatch though, i usually skip the first few that are the cheapest because sometimes they may have less than desierable customer service. I built my computer around christmas time and went from knowing nothing to considering myself 'not so n00b' anymore thanks to the folks at PCmech. They arent afraid to answer questions they hear over and over again, and are also a good crowd. The site also has a complete guide to putting together a computer as well as numerous hardware reviews.<br />
<br />
About the Soyo K7 Dragon. I had this motherboard, but mine was defective. It for some reason wouldnt allow me to play everquest, operation flashpoint, counterstrike, UO, the sims etc..any games pretty much. I dont know why but when my mobo became the suspect i took it back and got the EPoX KHA+ motherboard. It has worked like a charm and for $60 less than the soyo dragon. The sound doesnt really matter for me, if you are going for just everquest i didnt notice a differnce. I believe EPoX came out with a newer version of a motherboard, but it was after i was finished with my computer, so i didn't really pay attention.<br />
<br />
Maybe my Soyo K7 Dragon Plus! was defective, but that is just an experience I thought you might like to know.<br />
<br />
Good luck, PM me or email me if you have any questions, id be glad to give you any advice you desire :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Doh, thats what i get for not totally reading the thread. Thought you needed help with building one. Sorry *goes back to his hole in the ground*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive built many computers over the past few months.<br />
<br />
1) get your pc2100 ram from crucial, i would say 512<br />
<br />
2) get yourself an athlon xp with a half decent motherboard,<br />
<br />
3) get a geforce3 ti200, an ati radeon 7500 or 8500, or a geforce 4 ti4200 (as they are now just coming out)<br />
<br />
4)get a 300W power supply and make sure your case has at least one fan<br />
<br />
Oh, get all of this from newegg.com. Nowhere cheaper, that is on the up and up.<br />
<br />
If you have some questions or problems, ask around on the anandtech.com forums or email me @ sylvershard@hotmail.com.<br />
I would build you a sample system, just let me know your budget, and your wants need as far as things other than everquest, etc.<br />
Tonight Im lazy and tired.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groggog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I see all these people saying how they got 1 gig RAM, etc, thinking it will make EQ run better.... I am sure it doesn't hurt, but if your whole system is high end, and recent equipment, you don't need that much just for EQ.<br />
<br />
When I built my new comp last fall, I got an Athlon xp1600+, 64 meg GEForce2, and 256 megs RAM... planned on upgrading more RAM when SoL came out, but found out it runs flawlessly in raid situations with models on... I run in 1024x768 on a 21&quot; monitor.  If I get no video lag with 256 on a raid, why would I need 4 times that amount?<br />
<br />
I would suggest getting a single 512 for now, and if for some reason that lags on a raid with the vid card/cpu you listed, then get more... but in no way should it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love the Dragon Plus, the sound does indead rock, and there is also a built in Ethernet port. Thus your freeing up 2 PCI slots (possibly less conflicts), and svaing money on additional cards.</div></div><hr />
