<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zarlore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As most everyone knows, a couple parts of the Ranger Epic Quest can be MQed. I want to let everyone know, that if you mess up on the PoA MQ, it can be fixed. Messed up, i mean by turning in Your piece before the other person (with the PoA stone) you can continue with the quest and still get Swiftwind. Trust me, I did this and still have Swiftwind. I can also still get Earthcaller. The Ranger I did the MQ with was very understanding and Traveled with me to complete the Swiftwind part of my quest. He is also holding the Mithril Sword in his bank for me till I can get my PoH stone. Then, we will MQ (more carefully on my part) so i can get my Earthcaller.<br />
