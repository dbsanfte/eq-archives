Blizzard is my favorite game company, and I didn't even know about them until about 4 months ago. :) I've played warcraft 3, starcraft and diablo 1,2,2 LoD and I love them all. I plan to play a troll. Don't care about the class, just as long as I can be a troll. And yes, they just HAVE to put Trolls in, they're too good to not put in. I will also have a night elf archer type alt, as well as maybe a human paladin and orc warrior and...well, you get the point, LOL.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Game is supposed to be casual player friendly w/ encounters balanced around 5 person groups.  If this holds true and there is no bs like the malo/torpor droprate, the inability for a casual player to equip outside of raiding and the bazaar, etc... I am all over it.  I love Blizzard and pretty much hate SOE at this point despite still liking EQ- a change would be good.<br />

<br />
oh ya d1 and d2 both had huge problems with duping and crazy exploits,  even with the chars on d2 all being server side. i sure hope they learn to fix this before wow comes out</div></div><hr />

OMG that's exactly what i was gonna say i wanna be unless night elves can be shamans also.<br />
They also better implement regular elves I mean u can't have a fantasy game with no elves. (i know the they got night elves but I want the &quot;whiteboy&quot; elves :))<br />

<br />
Blizzard are truely at the top of their industry. It never ceases to amaze me just how brilliant their vision is. If the game is even remotely like the trailer, it's going to knock the competition flat on it's face.<br />
<br />
Is that footage in game or prerendered?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like how they outline the quest and the REWARD ahead of time. How many people would bother with 90% of the quests in EQ if they showed the reward compared to the work needed at the start?</div></div><hr />

There's a scantily clad woman, and a dwarf amongst other characters there. They've managed to get the dwarf looking directly at her cleavage!<br />

One of the (few) perks of being that tall I suppose!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">WoW also has the great potential to suck ass...<br />
<br />
Given that Blizzard hasn't seem to care at all when people hack, and cheat their games... it's gonna suck to go into WOW and see a buncha hacked god-mode asshats running around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Rokkeb, people cheat on b.net cause the games are hosted clientside and can be easily manipulated..  When the vital information is on blizzard's side it will be much harder to hack.  I'm sure WoW will be just as secure as any other MMORPG on the market</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Im still not impressed with WoW yet, atleast not to the point of really looking foward to it. There is so much for this game to prove and 80% of the hype its drawing are from a combo of past WC players and a bunch of screenies and videos that show nothing of the UI, the controls, how the game plays, just alot of eye candy.<br />
<br />
There is some intresting stuff though, like how its aimed for smaller groups of people and quests will be designed with less time for completion in mind. But what about the high end content ? Will there much there ? Will it fall flat like DAoC ? Will they get caught up in the rat race with people like furor in EQ, pushing them for bigger and better loot and encounters?<br />
<br />
Indeed i can see myself buying it and trying it based on what i have seen and read, but faith in my continued playing still waivers and has yet to come even close to solidifying.<br />
<br />
Ive moved form &quot;who cares&quot; to &quot;might have potential&quot; in the last week or so though.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that interests me would be how the power gamers will fare.  Those level 65, 4 hours a day everyday sort.  Seems like the cap is going to be set pretty low.  I'm cool with that, being a casual gamer and all.  Just wondering how these folks will fit into the Blizzard scheme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Litgruv is right, they haven't shown us anything other than eye candy. No words on game balance, how combat will work, game mechanics, UI, etc. We've seen the graphics engine, now let's have a look at the actual game. They are making a lot of claims with WoW, I hope they don't pull something like what Artifact did, of course Blizzard does have an unsullied reputation, so it may just live up to the hype. I seriously hope that it does appeal to the casual gamer because that's what we need in the MMORPG market right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. Game play killed AC &amp; Non first person view killed it as well.<br />
<br />
3rd person will never be immersive in my view. <br />
<br />
How can you be suprised by that mob that attacks you from behind if you see it attacking you from behind?<br />
<br />
We will see if WoW has a good first person interface, as well as good game play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Gameplay killed AC2. First person view is accessable in the game but it is irrelevant because of the radar. Which IMO is a huge asset for finding monsters and players.</div></div><hr />

As far as i know the diablo 2 community is quite strong atm.<br />
Yes servers were choked in the beginning yes there are CLIENT side hacks but closed bnet is a lot more secure and hacker free.<br />
<br />
Also do keep in mind that nobody pays for bnet so cranking out security patches is a lot harder and costs money, money they will have while running wow.<br />
<br />
They got the ingredients to suceed. And if you look at their history they are very likely to deliver. FAR more likely then SOE and I definetly believe their words more than i believe and sony bs. So owns eq now. Great so what? Their experience means nothign when ppl hate them as a company for what they do. Sure it's the first mmorpg blizzard will make but they are learning from the mistakes fo other companies they are takign their time and will get this right. Sony has lied to us many times and hidden many things from us. Stealth nerfs and other bs. bleh now i am just ranting :)<br />

Closed B.net is no way more secure and hack free.  I hated playing on B.Net for that reason.  I still dont think they have been able to stop the various methods of duping that went on. You got so many stupid griefers with huge egos it just wasn't fun to play the game.  However, it was a free service which was nice, but I would rather pay for my games now and at least get some better service or patches.  I think they let a patch out once every 6 months lol.<br />

<br />
<br />
How are they far more likely to succed though?  Yes, they have a good reputation but they have no where near the experience in the MMORPG market like SOE does.  I have a feeling the game will fall short of many peoples very high expectations that they have for it.<br />
<br />
However, once the game comes out, and if they reviews are good, I will definitley give the game a look.  Everquest is just getting too old to compete with all these next generation MMORPG's. I mean it's a great game, but with 4 year old coding and all this stretched out content, its going to be hard to keep it competing with games like WoW. I myself am looking forward to EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all this has me excited and by far as soon as WoW comes out im going to go make a newbie's day and give him all my stuff...or sell my account whichever is more fullfilling.<br />
<br />
However one thing we need to do is make sure we Cockblock Furor on WoW, I don't want people like him ruining others play time with whining and lootwhoring.<br />
<br />
EQ2 looks alright I am sure I will give that a try, Along with Lords of Everquest...maybe.</div></div><hr />

This is a bit different. There is hacking done in EQ as well in case you didn't notice. When you deal in the MMORPG market that's something you have to deal with, ocassionally something will get hacked. My friend was banned from EQ for giving himself the GM ability to teleport to any zone. (D'oh)  However, hacking is not nearly as rampant as it is in B.net. You have to remember that battle.net isn't even moderated except for tech support and half the time that is just regular players being helpful.</div></div><hr />
