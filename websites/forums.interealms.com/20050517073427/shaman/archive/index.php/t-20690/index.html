I have been workong on it for almost 5 months and I finally got it finished. Anyways, its a great resource and I hope you stop by sometime. www.uberquest.net</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are going to expect people to come and check your site out you might want to amend the spelling error in your sig.... Unless Sun Tzu was a flooring specialist in his spare time.<br />
<br />
It's the attention people pay to the minor details that sway me when it comes to shelling out money to read their reviews.<br />
<br />
Other than that, best of luck in your endeavors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, subtile is an adjective meaning subtle; unless there is another error that was either fixed or I am missing somewhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looking like a decent site.  Good luck in the coming months.<br />

Here's one for you to check out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KhunDawg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, now I am not sure the one to use =o)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So let me get this straight, you're posting on the shaman boards about a website that where you sell ($29/yr) guides for online games including everquest?<br />
<br />
Crucible Admins: Can we get this crap taken off the board?</div></div><hr />

 Nope, 19.95 a year.  All I wanted to do is let people know it is there.  I am not spamming, just like the title says, I am inviteing ya over, if you dont want to come, thats ok.  if you do great!  No reason to deny someon who might be interested just because you are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I put up with the banner advertisements on this site because they pay for it's existence. Your advertisement (not so cleverly disguised as a helpful post to information), does not pay. I disagree with it being allowed on the board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KhunDawg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What banner?  Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ruatonim, <br />

&quot;subtile&quot; is Olde English I believe, and rarely used. It could be a valid form of the word subtle even now I guess but would be likely to be questioned.<br />
<br />
I was just bored and thought I would point it out because all the translations I have seen of this quote (both of them) have used &quot;Subtle&quot; as the word.<br />
<br />
So, you are correct. I still think I was amusing and nobody died as a result of my post so I will sleep ok.<br />
