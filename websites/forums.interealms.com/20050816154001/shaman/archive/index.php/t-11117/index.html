The trolls of Clan Broken Skull do not doubt their own power, believing themselves to be in control of all that happens on their island and in the seas as far as their ships range. Their shamans have gleaned powerful knowledge from the luggalds and have combined that knowledge with their own ancient traditions. And so it is that on Broken Skull Rock, a troll never ceases to be a productive member of society. Even after their lives have been given in service to their clan, unless their bodies are claimed by the sea itself, their corpses continue to make the clan strong. <br />
<br />
Any chance of necromancy spells coming to shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shadow Knights already have many &quot;necro&quot; spells.<br />
<br />
But this does sound like more than the ability to summon a troll-skeleton for a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">More like animating the dead.  Perhaps in line with a voodo witch doctor creating a zombie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmm .. making pets out of corpses ..  .. don't necros already have that ability ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes but it says shaman learn a new ability</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Any bone is a good bone methinks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't get your hopes up. Though it may be a new ability of the Broken Skull Rock shamans, I doubt it will make it in the general (non-NPC) population. SOE distribution of goodies to shamans has so far been seriously tempered by the fact they're scared stiff of the class becoming as powerful as it originally was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, most likely these abilities will be restricted to NPC's, and are just a reason to include undead mobs or an undead dungeon.  You've always gotta have some undead in every expansion, or else clerics and pallies get mad.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rez potions *Evil gleam*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Five bucks says any rez potion they may create requires one of those necro sacrifice emeralds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Guys this has nothign to do with new spells.<br />
Has to do with the story of why they have undead trolls roaming the land. Those that die are brought back by the clan to serve them. Blah Blah Blah.<br />
I think u all saw the logic that wasn't there :)<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is somethign REALLY cool but &quot;too hard to code&quot;<br />
Make it so if any PC dies on land their corpses are &quot;Wake the dead&quot;-ed and now roam.<br />
say 50 max<br />
<br />
so as new ppl die the old walkign corpses despawn and are replaced by the newly dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh imagine a level 60+ raid wipeout :P<br />
Heh they will have a &quot;Can't touch this&quot; sign up cause nobody is going thru that many undead :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Far more likely that this will be an ability of the trolls here, making hunting their grounds much more difficult.  <br />
Kinda like in VT where if you kill a four-arm, a hooded thing spawns in its place.  If you kill a troll NPC of Brokenskull, an undead troll spawns. <br />
<br />
At least that's the way I interpret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Soulstorm - what a neat idea - having to fight the corpses of people who had died in a zone before you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, this isn't that new thing - in DAoC is some mob, who sends those whom it killed against it's attackers. Don't know the details (i.e. how long these corpses remain under control and such), but fun still. One raid wipes, another moves in in hopes of getting easy kill on now damage mob and.. sees the corpses of the previous raid party charge them. Already done, not in EQ tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh they will have a &quot;Can't touch this&quot; sign up cause nobody is going thru that many undead <br />
<br />
Get a couple clerics with Turn Undead 3, and no problem at all.</div></div><hr />
