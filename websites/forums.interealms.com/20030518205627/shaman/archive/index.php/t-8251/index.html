<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It would be nice to know if either:<br />
<br />
1.  some nice raiders left broodlings up and wandering around<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2.  the golems (fright or terror) you need to kill are up<br />
<br />
before dragging a large collection of people up to Fear.  Are there any commonly used tricks for knowing ahead of time whether the stuff you need is up?<br />
<br />
Can I send a ranger in there solo with a gate potion to check tracking to see if mobs are up or will he get shredded instantly?  Would maxxed tracking be able to see the mobs from the zone in?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  This may all be theoretical of course, since it may be difficult to gather the forces I need even if the things are up.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that going up there myself invis'd and wandering around would be beyond stupid.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A friend of mine sent a 46 level ranger in to check on the Spirit of the Shisskar. There are things that can see invis up there, and he died a lot, but he could see a great deal from the west wall.<br />
<br />
Gate potion is a must, invis is a must (some don't see invis), expect a few deaths for the ranger, and I doubt the broodling will ever be up by itself.... people usually snag it for a mq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We went on a PoF spree last night to help with epic drops.<br />
<br />
After a wipe after killing one of the demi's (LOL, got a bit overconfident and had about 15 adds with 3 groups) the iksar broodling was up.<br />
<br />
Iksar broodling despawned (pretty sure no-one killed him but may be wrong).<br />
<br />
3rd demi spawned a broodling, 2nd one didn't.<br />
<br />
So, not 100% sure but looks like iksar broodling may despawn after a set amount of time. Real pity as we had 2 shammies wanted the tear :(. Ah well, up to PoF again soon.......aargh I'm really starting to hate PoF and PoH :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, the broodlings despawn, you won't find them wandering about.<br />
<br />
Get a ranger and a wizard to zone in invis, check track, get out. Ranger should indeed be able to see if the golems are up from the portal. This isnt 100% risk free to the checkers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">go to EQmaps and find one of them that points out North Camp.   nothing wanders by there, and I can make it up to the camp without being seen by anything easily with proper patience.  Move up, kill all the see invis between you and gate, then you can invis and move in a tracker and leave him there for as long as you need.  For ranger, max skill and he can see the golems (pretty sure) for a druid, just use bind sight on mobs till you get close enough to visually verify the golem spawn.</div></div><hr />
