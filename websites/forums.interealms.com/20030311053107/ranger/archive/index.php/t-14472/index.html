<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hunnas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
Will be collecting my level 30 spells this week, and was curious as to which spells most of you had on your list of 8 spells most of the time at level 30.  Granted, different situations would call for different ones but generally, which ones did u have up at 30?  Thanks again for all your help!<br />
<br />
Hunnas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looking at the current spell list I would probably have the following<br />
<br />
Flame Lick<br />
Flaming Arrow<br />
Stinging Swarm (you have been practicing your Conj right)<br />
Snare<br />
Light Healing<br />
Harmony<br />
BUFF Swap Normally SoW<br />
Buff Swap</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hunnas: This is a really good question. We have some outstanding members here with huge experience. Could they expand their answers for us?<br />
<br />
Latem: Thank you for sharing your list. What is your strategy behind this line-up? What do you mean by Buff Swap?<br />
<br />
Mrchiss: Thank you for showing that you use different line-ups for different roles. Could you explain your strategy on each.<br />
<br />
Thank you both so much for sharing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Philby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always keep snare and root memed. <br />
<br />
Tangling weeds is also good as it is a quick taunt and can be used if your snare gets resisted. You can use Tangling weeds if you get a quick add and want to run away a bit. <br />
<br />
Flame lick is a nice taunt as well and can be used if a mob is snared by a higher level druid or if SK/necro is using their snare. <br />
<br />
Always nice to keep heal memed although your present heal is starting to show its age. You can cast it and sit down to get the benefit of ncreased mana regeneration from sitting if you time it right. <br />
<br />
The only buff spell I ever memed was SoW as if it dropped on somebody and you got a bad pull, death could occur. Plus if you go LD while in wolfform, having SoW available to cast quickly is handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I can't remember my lvl 30 spell line up, and besides the spell list has changed a bit since I was level 30...  But here's some basic suggestions:<br />
<br />
Always keep memed:<br />
Snare<br />
Root<br />
Heal<br />
<br />
I then normally allocate 2 slots for nukes/dots.  Depending on the level, target, and what I needed practice in (i.e. conjuration).<br />
<br />
2 more slots I allocated for buff slots.   Swap in and out depending on what buff you need to recast.  Keeping SoW memed in this slot when possible is a good idea.  You never know when you need to reSoW really fast with a mob on your tail and you don't have time to sit down and mem SoW.<br />
<br />
The last slot I swap out for Fear if I'm fear kiting, or I used to keep the short duration DS spell in it.  Now I also use that slot for Jolt/Cinder Jolt.  <br />
<br />
Time your buffs so you can rebuff stuff at the same time.  I.e. Feet like Cat and SoW have the same duration.  Buff with both of those at the same time, buffing with FLC first.   Then when FLC starts to flash you know your SoW is going to go soon as well.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah about the Heal spell.  From mid 30s to 39, casting Skin like Rock to heal yourself is actually more mana efficient than the healing spell.  Oh and don't discount using bind wound.   Once you skill it up, it's actually as fast or faster than meding for mana to heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Solo:<br />
1. DoT - Usually Second spell cast when Im kiting<br />
2. Nuke - Use these when Im trying to slow with swarmy<br />
3. Snare - First spell cast (normally)<br />
4. Root - In case of trouble<br />
5. Panic animal - In case of trouble, also handy when fearkiting<br />
6. Heal<br />
7. Buff - Normally I keep SoW up here when solo, but may have the next buff due to drop ready.<br />
8. Buff - Normally call of sky since I need to refresh it so often<br />
<br />
Group: (assuming group has a rooter since most do)<br />
1. Flame Lick - for taunt<br />
2. Nuke - can come in handy<br />
3. Tangling weeds - taunt and pulling multiples<br />
4. Snare or Root - depending on the makeup of the group and how much I trust them.<br />
5. Heal - in groups Ill usually top up my heals myself to save others mana<br />
6. Buff - next one to drop<br />
7. Buff - Next one to drop<br />
8 Buff - call of sky<br />
<br />
*also if I am really unsure of the group I will mem TW, snare and root and use one less buff box.<br />
*if the group is doing tough stuff and I am not trying to keep aggro then I will sometimes add in a DoT to my lineup and use one less buff box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My 2cp, better late than never<br />
<br />
1.  SLR/Light Healing (I use SLR as a heal unless a Cleric is overwriting SLR)<br />
2.  SoW -- Don't ever leave home without it.<br />
3.  Swappable Buff Slot<br />
4.  Swappable Buff Slot, or<br />
      Flamelick/Tangling Weeds, if I need agro, or<br />
      Burning (?) Arrow, if I'm fearkiting<br />
5.  Panic Animal, or<br />
     Burning (?) Arrow, if I'm not fearkiting<br />
6.  Stinging Swarm (Took me until level 35 or so to max     conjuration--fearkiting in Stonebrunt with KEI is a big help)<br />
7.  Snare<br />
8.  Root<br />
<br />
Self Buffed is SLR, SoW, SoE, Riftwind's, Barbcoat, although I find myself not refreshing Barbcoat and Riftwind's when I'm fearkiting, because I'm not getting hit much.<br />
<br />
If I've got the mana I'll leave Firefist up in the 3rd slot and keep it going.<br />
<br />
If I'm melee soloing (kobolds in stonebrunt anyone?), Slot 4 is Shield of Thistles if mana permits.<br />
<br />
Burning arrow I only got a couple of weeks ago, but it's a great addition to the lineup.  I was in a group in Droga (27 Cleric, 31 Enchanter, 31 Warrior, me--a 37 Ranger) and I put Wurmy mainhand, piercer offhand for skillups, and would 80 pt. nuke two or three times a fight.  <br />
<br />
Hope that helps,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hope it's OK to dig up old threads rather than start new ones. Just hit 30, trying to figure out which spells to use.  Currently, I do this:<br />
<br />
1) Light Healing, but I guess I'll go with SLR for a while<br />
2) Snare<br />
3) Situational slot: Buff/Camo/Firefist/Harmo/Hawkeye -maybe put Shield of Thistles here?  SoW?<br />
4) Root<br />
5) Flamelick - <br />
6) Situational slot: Panic Animal/Harmo, depending on solo/group/MOb<br />
7) Burning Arrow, usually<br />
8) Tangling Weeds<br />
<br />
I didn't realize how short the duration on Shield of Thistles is. I don't know that I'll be keeping it up all the time. <br />
<br />
I like having all three snare/root spells memmed, even if fear-kiting animals. In EF, sometimes, a root would get me pounded on, but would prevent the mammie from getting to close to another and giving me an add.<br />
<br />
My problem is that on Sullon Zek, I sort of want to have Cancel Magic up all the time, and can't figure out where to put it.  Maybe in the DD spot, and switch them out, depending on the circumstance?  Not like my DD is going to kill a PC, in any case (but it might be good for a killing blow).  Hm....<br />
<br />
I suppose I could also switch out Flamelick, depending on the situation. It's probably not that useful for soloing.<br />
<br />
Thanks, just thinking out loud before I go back to actually do some work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Digwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1. burning arrow (good dmg, mana doesnt hurt w/ KEI)<br />
2. stinging swarm (conj is bad, but its still nice when it doesnt fizzle to much)<br />
3. situational (fear, harmony, flame lick, whatever)<br />
4. snare (always)<br />
5. root (always)<br />
6. shield of thistles (would be a pain to mem this everytime it wears off, and stacked with brambles and riftwinds we have 10 total DS points)<br />
7. firefist (again, wears off fast)<br />
8. light healing</div></div><hr />
