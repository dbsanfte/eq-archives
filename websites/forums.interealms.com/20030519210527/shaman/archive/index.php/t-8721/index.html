<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>laedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi<br />
Im thinking of starting a kitty shaman and im wondering what are some good items to twink him with for 1k?I already have totemic arms for him.What are some other suggestions?Thanks<br />
Also are there any decent cheap weapons i could buy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">groaning mace is probably about 100p for 2hb.<br />
there are several decent low level piercers for 200 and under<br />
artic wyvern mask was 15p-25p the other day<br />
banded is 1 to 2p per ac if you can find it<br />
<br />
I'd suggest going into bazaar pick kitty, pick shaman, and pick a slot you want to buy and then sort it by price so you can find something quickly! :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My sugestion would be Slime Coated Harpoon and Ry'Gorr armor.<br />
<br />

<br />
PS This would be for a melee Shaman which I played from lvl 1 to 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree with bazaar suggestion.   Just head there and see what you can get for the pp.<br />
<br />
My guess is also that Rygorr best price/ac available.  Many Totemic pieces (except BP and helm) often in the bazaar, but they cost more pp.<br />
<br />
There is quest armor available in Shadeweavers/Shar Vahl, I forget stats, but know I got it when I was a kitty.  Rygorr better and so dirt cheap tis worth buying.<br />
<br />
On a side note, if you enjoy doing quests, save some of that 1K for tradeskilling.  Many quests for young Vah Shirs (including Shaman) that involve brewing and pottery.<br />
<br />
Finally, save some of that pp for your lv. 1-14 spells!!! Unless they have changed it from when I was a kitten, so many of the drops in the Shar Vahl pit and in Shadeweavers were quest related  (and no-drop---vendors would not buy them) there was not as much sellable loot, hence hard to earn pp as a young cat.  You'll need some pp for spells!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe I started out twinking my new kitty shaman because I was bored with my paladin. One thing to get is a pair of Opal Encrusted Steins, they are crucial with +50 cha between 2 they really make a huge difference and you can get them for as low as 30pp each if you try hard enough.<br />
<br />
As far as actual gear, I would recommend a Spine Chill Spear you can get one for only about 100pp probibly. Arctic Wyvern Mask for sure (its a cheapie), if you can get a charred guardian shield for 200pp or less grab it with 9 WIS its great. (later on upgrade to crystal chitin shield with 20ac, 9 wis and 40 mana they rock). If you can find Sabertooth Forged Armor especially legs and chest grab it its great stuff and it commonly sold for not too bad as it has no stats, but AWESOME ac. My kitty has Sabertooth Forged Leggings (17 ac) and Chest (24 ac) great items. Sometimes you can get Jaundiced bone vambraces for under 300pp if so grab them good ac and looks decent.<br />
<br />
And save money for spells!<br />
And working on brewing/pottery</div></div><hr />
