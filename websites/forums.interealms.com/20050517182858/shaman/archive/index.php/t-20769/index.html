<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Only thing the devchats at the fan faire made me relize is that nothing is going to change and I have absolutely nothing left too look forward to in this game. I was strongly considering retiring before, but now its official. Time to bust my ass on my master's and beat that stack of old games I haven't touched lately. <br />
<br />
Many thanks to the crucible for helping me greatly in my shamanly career, I hope I have provided some help in return. Ever since my first time here in my early 40's when I read about the uber JBB (and promptly got one) I have been turning here for anything I ever wanted to know about being a shaman. <br />
<br />
Later all, been nice<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congrats!  With any luck, they won't fix this before our turn in the VT rotation is over, and I'll quit in rage.  Honestly I can't wait to rip this monkey off my back and burn it alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Haven't seen you in a while but will miss ya. Is Anna going too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Welcome to the other side!, the grass is greener this side..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anna retired a few weeks ago so its been kinda lonely for me which really contributed to my decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can I have your stuff?<br />
<br />
(Actually, wouldn't make me a better shaman...oh well. :) )<br />
<br />
Good luck in your RL adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How much of your stuff is Bst usable? sure as hell wont ask for it for my shaman, since as SOE is proving is a dead end street.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hugs, Hobbez!  Though shaman chat is lonely for me now, I wish you all the best, hon.  <br />
<br />
I'll keep many memories of you...endless BoT raids, even more endless NToV raids, those nights when we wiped a beelion times learning strats as we progressed.  Our talks kept me sane many, many nights as frustrations built, tempers climbed and my eyes crossed from lack of sleep.<br />
<br />
/salute, shaman, I'll miss you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">GL and happy retirement.  I know for me it's meant more productivity at work, I've done more professional development, my home life has improved, I'm doing projects around the house more, I'm more alert when I spend time with my kid, I generally enjoy life more (although there are a few moments of boredom at night, usually before I go to sleep).  I've kept in touch with my EQ friends through the bulletin boards and it's worked out pretty well for me.  Hope your experience is similarly good.</div></div><hr />

Quitting eq I think is one of the best things you can do, the game is just too involved and takes over yourlife. I wish you luck!!! After a few months you will probably enjoy everything more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>circuits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Adios to the retiring Shaman<br />
<br />
Glaani Love the name of the guild I guess?<br />
<br />
There is a typo though the third letter from the end should be a U not I<br />
<br />
Otherwise cool name../salute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for your posts on the Crucible. I have enjoyed them. Best of luck.</div></div><hr />
