<br />
I find myself needing to start on gathering keys for Mexl, my level 42 warrior. Currently, he needs 3 of the 4 parts for the howling stones and Sebilis keys.  I am hoping to put together a time of both experience hunting as well as key component gathering for any who need them.<br />
<br />
I was thinking we need to hit Trakanon's Teeth first and can work with a rotating group until everyone gets the two medallions they need. We will need at least one tracker to help us locate the forager/hunter spawns. After this, we can head to Kaesora and smack around Xalgoz and get some of his fangs.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in doing this, please respond and we can set something up. I am in the Pacific time zone so whenever we schedule it, I will not be able to show up until around 7PM Pacific. However, it can start sooner than that if enough people are interested.</div></div><hr />
