<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking of taking down this beast because I heard he drops gems worth 200pp+ Has anyone taken him down before? He conned dark blue to me at 51 but I dont know if I can solo him...I heard he has tons of hps so I am asking here first. I dont have my JBB :(  yet so dont even say to use it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont bother. It is possible but it will be very hard and very slow. If you want gems then get a group in Seb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lv 50 dino with i think 15k HP. doesnt summon  and doesnt hit hard. drops JC gems INCLUDING blue diamonds. 5 minute timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tackled the dino when I was lv. 51 with a level 54 druid guildmate.  He did not resist or hit that hard and conned dk. blue to me.  But let me tell you, that Dino has a TON of hitpoints.  We only killed him 4 times before I had to log.  Not sure it is worth the effort.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Killed him 3 times in a row at lvl 54, no epic, no horse but did have JBB.  Fight took forever because all the HPs he had &amp; had to kite it towards the end a bit.   Lost pet partially thru fight so I had to root &amp; med/regen/bind wounds to keep it up.   AC in the 870-ish range while I fought it.  Tried to keep EB on it whenever I could, JBB tanked as long as possible then rooted &amp; healed.<br />
<br />
Never dropped anything other than snake scales all 3 times.   Oh and a rune for my wizzy alt :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">agreeing with all the others, not really worth doing, other than once for bragging rights.   Long fight, lotsa hp, he hits for 170ish as I recall but he hits pretty slow. <br />
<br />
I've killed him twice,  3x snake scales and a word once, 3x snake scales and nothing once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, it was neat bragging rights, I did appreciate that part<br />
<br />
/gu Hey guys, think I can kill the Allizeswaur?<br />
guild01:  I doubt it<br />
guild02:  Not worth it<br />
guild03:  drops crap<br />
guild17:  too many hps, you'll never live<br />
etc<br />
<br />
I gave a running commentary in guild chat and it was an interesting 5+ minute conversation :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you ever need to gather a lot of snake scales, this is the MOB. Gems drops are nice too but not too frequent. But solo, that place's a pain.<br />
<br />
With no tracking but ghetto-track, you may have to run quite a bit each time the PH spawn before you can kill him. Then, when the lizard spawn, it spawns randomly anywhere on the island. Island isn't that big, but again... lot of running around involved. Plus, you may have to kill anywhere between one to a dozen PHs before dino shows up. And then, only to have it drops a bunch of snake scales.<br />
<br />
Maybe fun to solo once, but a haul of loot it ain't unless you are unaccountably lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">my 52 chanter friend solo'd him. but decided it was probably the worst way to get BD's ever. So stopped.</div></div><hr />
