<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know any guides to this trial? I've had a look and not found any that are complete, last night effort went well till we got to the blue crystal room and although the druid had what we thought otbe the named on track we could not fnid him anywhere in the room (or small chamber off to the side) tried hailing/killing the ghostly essences etc and killing as many mobs as we could but no named.<br />
<br />
We are quite sure we got there well within 30 mins....any ideas what we did wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">kay. easiest way to do it is with a rogue. i'll tell you that right now. adjust as you see fit.<br />
<br />
go into crematorium, kill your way to the very end (not blue crystal room, the furnace) otw, you should find 4 skulls as loot. have the rogue loot these.<br />
<br />
go to the furnace room, stand in the middle, 4 named will spawn. kill em, 4 glowy little wisps will go back to the furnace room. 10 mins later or so a hand in mob will spawn. rog SoSes to furnace room, hands in everything, runs away, escapes. you win.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This trial is really buggy, in my experience. I've had the turnin mob spawn under the world. I've had the named in the furnace pop under the world, too. I've had the turnin mob despawn very rapidly (was up for about 5 min. total, I brought along a ranger to verify). I really hated this trial.<br />
<br />
Trying to fight to the turnin mob after evac was pretty dicey, too. You'll need massive DPS if you want to kill everything and make it there in time - I recommend against trying. If you are fortunate with the placement of see invis mobs and have someone who is really good with lulls, I can see getting there that way.<br />
<br />
The SoS rogue trick is by far the best way to do this trial, in my experience. By the time I managed to get a rogue to come along, I had become extremely paranoid about failing, not to mention sick of the drudgery of doing the trial. We actually killed only 3 of the ghosts, then sent the rogue on her way. Once I knew she was safely in position, the 4th ghost was killed. That worked like a charm and we all got our flags.<br />
<br />
Another tactic I was going to try was to leave myself and a ranger (or anyone who can tank the mob, really) back at the furnace room with one ghost remaining. The rest of the group would evac to the ZI and make their way to the crystal room. Once they made it there, we would kill the last ghost - you get the idea.<br />
<br />
SoS rogues with Escape (since there are some see-SoS mobs, apparently) are a real blessing for the sewer trials.</div></div><hr />
