I tried clicking on the links on the EQLive page but OoW wasnt on the list. Did they disable digital downloads while the patching is in progress?</div></div><hr />

well, no cookie Bart. He was asking to buy OoW, not patch the files.<br />
<br />
The shop has not been updated yet, Spirit. The is always a gap between Preorder and the regular order.</div></div><hr />

At the server select screen, on the left near the bottom, there should be an &quot;order Omens&quot; (may be &quot;purchase Omens&quot;) button. If you pay your monthly fee by credit card, it will bill your account for buying Omens and enable your account to access those zones.<br />

Worked for me last night.</div></div><hr />

They did, it popped up as a select box when you bring up the patcher. If you selected no then you dont see it again and have to do the advanced thing (didnt know how till today, 1hr20min left on bband, but it is a laptop...)<br />
