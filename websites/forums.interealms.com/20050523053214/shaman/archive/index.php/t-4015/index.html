<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok.  I specilized in Alteration.  Put in one point to it at level 30 and went on my merry way. <br />
<br />
Now...at 48 and the new UI, I can check all my skill levels.<br />
<br />
My specialization is at 50.  Thats ALL.  Now...if I understand everything correctly, it should be MUCH higher.   I am buffing all the time, slowing all the time, and doing all the things that SHOULD raise the specialization.  But it hasnt moved for a long time.<br />
<br />
Its now bugging me, because buffs are geting mana expensive, and a little kick in from the spec would be nice from time to time.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what might be wrong?  I dont really want to have to reset it.  But that might be my only option.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need to put one point into each of the other specialisations as well.  Once you have done this Alteration spec will be able to go above 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have this same prob...but i havent checked to see if imissed a skill...it would make sense though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I gave up on specialization. After trying everything possible, putting points into all of them, I have ended up with 57 skill in 3 of my specializations at level 60, even though the first to 51 was alterations. I have contacted GM's but its &quot;working as intended&quot;...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can't believe a GM would tell you it was working as intended if you have multiple specializations OVER 50.  Only one spec should go over 50, and after it has reached 50, or I think actually 51, all others cap at 50.  If a GM says it is working properly you need to raise a stink, and get it looked into.<br />
<br />
As for the original poster...The first response was correct.  You have to put at least one point into each spec area before any of them will go above 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kronenbourg is exactly right, you need to put 1 point in all specializations, then your highest one will go over 50. That confused me for a good while too, but promise it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can also reset all specialisations to 49 through a quest in temple of Sol Ro (in lavastorm near solA/B). <br />
<br />
You need a ruby to do this though, but once you have done it just buff a few times to get alteration&gt;51 first, then it will go to 200 fast on it's own</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go up to your trainer<br />
<br />
Put one training point in each specialization.  Train through trainer alteration to 51.<br />
<br />
You are set.<br />
<br />
I was playing for 10 levels with Alteration at 50, and finally got fed up and tried combos... thats what worked for me.</div></div><hr />
