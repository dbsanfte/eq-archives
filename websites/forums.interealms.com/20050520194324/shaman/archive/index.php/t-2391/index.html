<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am searching to make the &quot;Lazy Bastard&quot; macro for Funless Grove.  Would be nice to line up 6 blasts outta my JBB on one macro, but I am not sure it can be done or how to do it.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can't be done without an outside program... though there is a 2% chance i am wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drydon - Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's been asked for, and Alan said once in a post basically &quot;no way&quot;.   Some BS about not wanting to make iit able for us to automate everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only thing you can do is put the slot the JBB is in on your hotbar and then just click/press that number per cast.<br />
<br />
Don't know of anyway to reference a hotkey spot for a macro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have heard of macro programs that could do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Macro programs as well as some game pad devices.  Both bannable in VI/Sony's eyes.  Doesn't stop people from using them, but just be aware of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You wouldn't want this anyway.  Once a kbd macro is running there is no way to terminate it.  6 JBB blasts takes at least 48 seconds, you going to commit to that long without being able to fully control your character?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I sure would - I could watch my favorite ball game or whatever much easier with jbb blasting all by itself - glad you not have to hit attack for every blow of your weapon!<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would use these because I'm almost always playing 2 accounts at once. slow/epic/jbb/canni repeat jbb/canni until dead. not much else I do with the shaman other than buff.. Duo with a 60 rogue and it sure would be nice :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yup Weiss, I wud commit to 48 seconds of no control in FG.  Heck, I have gotten outta my chair to use the head and then checked out the fridge mid-fight with a shroom.  Came back to find shroom near dead and I was missing a whopping half-bub of health.<br />
<br />
Can't say that is something I would try in HS or my favorite Chardok spot tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Exactly why I left Asheron's Crack.  You could camp your character in diffferent corners of a dungeon &amp; let them earn exp while you were at work.  One guy would go home at lunch time to run his toon back to town, buy more supplies (spells have components they burn) and restart his macro.  Heck, there's all sorts of statistical programs out there that measure average component burn (and calculates how much $ / hour it costs to run the macro), average exp / hour, etc.   I had a lvl 40 character that had never left town, he sat in the guild meeting hall, there was a pool that would help you regain mana faster while you were standing in it.  I would start him up, go to work.  Come home from work, take him to buy supplies, log him out &amp; log in a different character to play.   When I went to bed I would start the other guy back up.   Wake up in the morning, buy supplies, restart macro &amp; go to work.   Did it just to prove how stupid it was.<br />
