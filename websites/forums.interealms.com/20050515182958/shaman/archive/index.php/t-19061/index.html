<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been sitting at work thinking what spells I would like in the expansion, here is my list.. <br />
<br />
<br />
1) We need a downgrade to our cannibalization line. We could call it Chaotic Pain and lower it's efficiency a bit, but increase the return 8 more mana for 19 more hitpoints. <br />
<br />
This downgrade will help the newer player base in delaying the development of tunnel carpal syndrome on an average of about 1.2 hours. <br />
<br />
2) We can also use another Disease Dot to our line up, we can never have enough DOTs. <br />
Spear Dot, Elemental Legging Dot, LDON Dots, Short Tick duration Dots, Long Tick duration Dots.  For god sakes We do have 8 Spell slots to load up dots in and they all STACK of course we will need to DOT mobs near the zone in, so we can zone out and back in to clear agro to prevent summoning after the first one lands at 40% after 3 resists. Perhaps we can even call it something cool sounding like Plague of Daluda.   <br />
<br />
3) Since we all know Bards are the King of slows, true ae, neg Magic resist modifiers, high slow percent slows, true slow versatility. We need something to put us back on top. Maybe we can copy the level 62 bard song and make a level 65 shaman spell. Increase its duration an extra 2 ticks (So its better then bards and shamans will be the king of slows again) Then we can toss in some disease counters to the effect so the shaman draws aggro and we can increase the mana cost to say around 175 and up the effectiveness like 15% which is really 3% with slow mitigation. Since this spell main intent is to give shamans something bards have already we can call it Balance of the NihIl which would help equal out shamans and bard slowing. <br />
<br />
4) I was also thinking we can use and upgrade to &quot;Q&quot;, since it still heals the same amount it healed when it was called &quot;torpor&quot;. Shamans never got a &quot;healing Upgrade&quot; with when mobs started hitting for 600-800 on average and the introduction of slow mitigation. We really need a new &quot;Q&quot; style upgrade.  Lets see Maybe we can make the &quot;HOT&quot; heal an additional 10 dps a sec to compensate for the mobs 400 dps a second increase they got in the POP expansion.. We can give it a really powerful name like  Ancient Chaos Breath  for its powerful addition of 10 dps healing a tick it grants us. <br />
  <br />
<br />
Now that were done with spells, I'm thinking of some aa's that would be useful for us. <br />
<br />
<br />
1) Since melee's get a revamp, new skills that do just about everything. We can have shamans restore there endurance at a faster rate. This will be a cool effect at first, and then later we can add the effect to melee weapons and armor in the new expansion like all shaman spells.  Lets call it Call of the Ancients for now. <br />
<br />
2) Now we can really use an upgrade Rabid bear and Hastened Rabidity, since these are the most sought after &quot;AA's&quot; in the shaman arsenal. Shamans become amazing with this skill, for instance We can get a rare drop Sharkspine Club after about 280 hours of camping it in the plane of water, which isn't a big deal since we all know how easy it is to convince guild members to grind in water. Then we can use its wicked ratio and amazing proc and attack raid mobs with it, after begging for beastlord and ranger attack buffs and pissing off the melee in your guild by looting a 41% haste belt to do around 56dps for five minutes. All that for a mere 17 AA. I know it might not seem like much, we can't all be rangers have a discipline that does 1000dps. But its 56 DPS with the best shaman club in game, it really is amazing!!!  What's our alternative, chain nuke with our kunark bracer and do around the same DPS?  We can enhance this ability, so we can use it more often like our kunark bracer.. Perhaps we can call it enhanced rapidity<br />
<br />
3) Now we need a &quot;bug fix&quot; I mean an AA that will allow our pets to be buffed by group buffs. We can make it cost, umm lets say 20 aa's. Since shamans are truly a pet class we should get this ability, We get all the other pet &quot;AA's&quot; .. We really are the best pet class. Just think about those poor mages, necro, and beastlord. They have to get rare drop items and do ldon adventures to focus their pets.  All we have to do is cast &quot;Focus and Q&quot; continually on our pets to have the same effect as these items do for mages,necros, and beastlords. Maybe we can call this AA Pet Affinity</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly, that is probably the genuine thought process of whichever gibbon at SoE thought these up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're not bitter are you?<br />
<br />
That was some pretty funny stuff.  Especially about the bard/shaman stuff.<br />
<br />
Rofl.!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hilarious  :D . The bitterness is strong with that one.<br />
<br />
Shameless bump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Call of the Ancient in its current form is a piece of crap.  <br />
<br />
The warder doesn't move with your group, it only lasts five minutes and you can't summon it again for 30 minutes.  The warder then spams its restoration spell which at the moment is only a 60 foot AE.  Considering how much people move around in LDoN raids and adventures, and how that is supposedly the paradigm for new dungeons I see this one being only used for CRs and inbetween big raid fights.<br />
<br />
Good work eqlive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I felt a great bitterness in the Force, as if thousands of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I mean ignored. Yeah, ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rofl Alyna, just don't take my loot and gimme your dkp I'll grind your crappy aa's you want! :p<br />
<br />
Want some cheese with that whine? har har :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not even lvl 50 and I'm laughing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The new spell for shamans in GoD<br />
<br />
 Chaotic Pain <br />
<br />
The name says all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pretty funny stuff, but bashing Rangers for their DPS is kinda harsh.  Ranjas took it dry for the first few years before SOE finally gave them a reason to level :D<br />
