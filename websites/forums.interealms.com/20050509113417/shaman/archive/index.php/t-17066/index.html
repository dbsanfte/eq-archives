<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to post something real quick so that at least WE know what is going on as shammies :)<br />
<br />
   Every single slow spell in the game that players cast EXCEPT Cload of Grummus and Plague of Insects is resisted by MAGIC.<br />
<br />
  Seems almost like I need to ask an Admin GM to spam the serverwide announcements with this one somedays :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Ever since they added disease counters to the spells so that you can cure slow without dispelling buffs, I get pestered by people for disease buffs cause &quot;I keep getting slowed.&quot;   I used to think it was just other classes not knowing the game mechanics that WE are kings of.  No problem there IMO, I don't mind covering for them.<br />
<br />
  But lately I have noticed that a lot of shaman who were lowbies when the change happened grew up listening to those people and believed them :*(.   So, for the record, DISEASE COUNTERS are not the same as disease RESISTED.  They are something to let you cure a spell, not to let you resist it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  So, cure disease, Blood of Nadox and other such disease curing spells will remove slow, however disease resist buffs will not help you to resist slows any more than Malicious/Insidious Decay will help you land them.<br />
<br />
  If you see someone who isn't clear on this in game, please try to take the time to inform them before they confuse another beginning shammie :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, ok, but how does Charisma come into play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This can actually be an issue. I remember when my bard joined a PoJ trials group to help push them through. One of their big problems was that their melees kept getting slowed (with an MR-based shaman slow spell, I forget which one exactly)- and their L 61+ shaman had buffed DR to help them resist it. Doh!</div></div><hr />

Except cloud of Grummus and Plague of Insects.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ive seen this quite a bit as well, especially in the trials, feel like Ive explained it 100 times and still get people saying the wrong thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the mobs in the trials use tagar's, iirc.</div></div><hr />
