<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's up with Lucy today?   Shm1 along with what looks like all other classes were removed from Class and some Planer AA's.   Cann V for example had Shm1 removed from class list.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SoE does not use the Lucy system for spells, Lucy merely reads it the way shes programmed. Im sure its some change in their system and not a change in the actual spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They removed shadowknight from harm touch also :P<br />
It doesn't mean anything.<br />
Think about how long donl's dementia was live as a shammy spell then they removed shammy from classes. How much did that affect any of us?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SOE has also said something along the lines of they don't like Lucy and that we shouldn't be able to know exact spell effects, yadda yadda.. could just be an attempt to throw a wrench in the gears.  I highly doubt they're changing canni5 in any way.  And if they are, we'll just all march over to San Diego and kill them &gt;:-)  No, seriously...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is at least one reason they started doing this :<br />
<br />
/testbuff.<br />
<br />
For at least 1 class, they were given one of their Class AAs as a scribed spell after issuing that command - Wizards were able to scribe Mana Burn and cast it (since it was only a level 1 spell). These changes are nothing but a fix to prevent such things from happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mages were also able to do the whole Call of Ro thing, whip up four pets that each procced a 350dd... Well, that got messy.</div></div><hr />
