<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Neetero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am about a week away from getting AM3 and I want to start trying to get my flag for PoV/PoS.  Since I have not yet done any of the trials, I would appreciate some advice as to whether or not I should use archery or melee.  For primary I only have LSoEE, so pretty gimp.<br />
<br />
Group will most likely include the following guildies:<br />
<br />
L60 Chanter (DC pet AAs)<br />
L61 Warrior (decent taunt weapons, 6kHP buffed)<br />
L60 Cleric (epic)<br />
L60 Ranger (swifty/nightmare bow/EQ/AM3)<br />
L60 Monk (epic)<br />
L62 Druid (epic)<br />
<br />
The chanter and warrior are the only ones without epics.  We are not very well equipped, but want to try anyway.  Hardest Mob we have succeeded on as a guild is Chardok Queen to give you some perspective on our limited abilities thus far.<br />
<br />
So, can Executioner trial be done with this group in our gear?  We are all pretty much the most skilled players in the guild and work well together.  So for those of you who have managed to squeak by the trial on ability rather than levels/gear, any advice?  I might be able to call on a L60 wizzie or L62 Rogue friend if necessary.  We also have a 60 SK and another L60 epic monk available in the guild.  We're short on high level rogues and wizzies, which would explain why we have not done much harder mobs than Queen. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keltaras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That is a perfectly acceptable group with the exception of the chanter.<br />
<br />
Having a chanter in your group (as a ranger) will decrease your damage output from the bow. I guarantee he's gonna mez in your LoS.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend replacing the chanter with a Shaman for AE slow instead and you should be set.<br />
<br />
If your group is limited to the chanter, you're just gonna have to melee most likely.<br />
<br />
Dont wait for the Tank to call assist, just assist and start swingin. Make sure he targets the rocks first (the rocks can be banished by the druid, he will get resists though). Once the executioner gets to the steps, nuke the piss out of the target mob, if he's not already dead. Make sure the druid doesn't over nuke and you should be good =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neetero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We have a 58 shammy, but not sure if he has AE slow spell yet.  Will have to check.  Wouldn't mezzed mobs be better than slowed ones?  Chanter could also slow after mez...shammy AE slow is only 50% anyway.  Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Passed trials plenty of times with straight melee.With a chanter in group always.You need a cleric tank and banisher.Everything after that is just flavor.<br />
<br />
If your group works well together you will have no problems figuring out a strat that works for you.Just keep trying and after a failure discuss what could have been done better.You will get it done =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Akelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trials are all about DPS. Slows just are not needed, the mobs go down  at the same rate slowed or not, and a good cleric will keep the MT healed well enough.<br />
<br />
Forget the DC pet. If you take more than 2 - 3 seconds to break the DC and start killing it, you have lost.  Have the chanter do AE Stuns rather than mez, the shaman buff the tanks to the 9's and haste everyone that swings a blade.  Use a heal-over-time on the MA immediately before engaging, and between every round ; Pre-heal the damage that will be inflicted on the MA and you get less aggro.<br />
<br />
If you have to chase a mob, you've failed.  If you have to peel aggro off a caster, you've failed.  If you focus on the mobs, lock them down with the stuns and assist the tank, you are there.<br />
<br />
Save the Disc for the High Executioner,  you'll need WS for him if the MT goes down or the cleric goes OOM. Shaman spam healing anyone besides the MA will make the biggest difference here; and slowing the executioner might help but I have not see it done; he is the only mob that you fight like &quot;normal&quot;; everything else is &quot;yard trash&quot; level but needs to be killed FAST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I found that anti summoned spell we get at 61 to be of use in trials, might want to make 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">also, as crazy as it seems : keep ALL including the casters tightly packed in melee range. It lessens the ping pong and with a good cleric, you gonna be ok anyway. I did that whilst botting a cleric and playing myself on exe, worked like a breeze. No ping pong at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Neetero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OK, so I take it archery is not really an option here?  Seems like everyone is saying stay close to the mobs and waiting even a second to assist, position, etc. means failure...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sabine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can use archery but a few things to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
If the cleric/chanter/druid are going to be on a horse, make sure they are shrunk and you are not shrunk.  If you lose line of sight, nuke then move to melee.  I find that in each wave of exe, it is easier to melee the first of the wave then use arrows on the 2/3/4 of the wave.  <br />
<br />
Exile Summoned is grand for extra damage on the rock critters.  <br />
<br />
Getting a druid through the trials will be hard.  Chances are the druid will be oom by the third wave just from chain healing the enchanter and cleric.  The warrior will probably never see aggro til the prime executioner.<br />
<br />
I would make sure the druid has First of Karana, and gets in at least 1 blast per wave.  It is a targettable ae that hits 4 but if all 4 mobs are close, it is very efficient compared to upheaval/catastrophe (mana pigs).  If the cleric is not going oom from healing the chanter, try having the druid blast twice each wave. <br />
<br />
Make sure no one sits, if the casters want to med, have em get the cheapest horse from bazaar and shrink em.<br />
<br />
Timing is everything.  With the dps of that group, it will be down to the wire on each mob unless you are nailing good bow shots every time.<br />
<br />
If you get to the pe, be ready to kite it since the casters will almost certainly be oom, just run the silly pe around the platform in front til folks have mana and make sure folks have their health topped off before engaging.   No sense going in with folks at 60% and then the cleric drawing low health aggro after 20 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KaabaCloudberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did trials group with 63 warrior, me (63 ranger), 60 ranger, 60 necro, 62 cleric and 65 enchanter.  65 enchanter was the key really, plus the necro to pump.  We had plenty of dps, in fact we got to the executioner like 3 times with this setup before winning.  Important to have defensive vs. executioner, we got to executioner with a 60 SK instead of the warrior and we all got mowed down.  Necro has some great group spells for this encounter and their pet is no slouch dps-wise.  I always gave the warrior my DS and call of the rathe and didn't really worry about slowing the mobs so I didn't use earthcaller, if the mobs are unslowed you just get that much more damage from the DS.<br />
<br />
Also, I used trueshot against the executioner, this also was key, I did a lot of damage against him he has low AC, got like 5 hits for 500+ in a row, he is also not very magic resistant so I threw in some calefactions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Isen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here is what i did, but it was really icing on the cake. I had a shaman in the group too.   Melee all the way down to the 3rd or 4th round. In the middle of the 3rd round i cranked out trueshot just to make sure that the 2 that did need the flags got one. The mobs dropped so fast through out the 3rd and 4th rounds i even had about 30 to 40 seconds left for the Final boss.  <br />
  Lsoee is acually a good weapon for the trials as most mobs wont save against the extra magic. So at a ratio of 1.38 most the time, that is about as good as ratio as a 14 19 weapon. Make sure you have good haste.<br />
  Like people have said before if the mobs are mezzed, stick with melee. The battles will be closely bunched and u dont wanna   waste time trying to find the &quot;perfect&quot; bow postion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah, I wouldn't TS either until the mob boss, just assist like crazy and have the MT target using f8. And it's not crazy, sharidann, it's KEY to have all the mobs in one place, ponging equals losing in the trials, so the closer everyone is to the squashed up pack, the better.<br />
<br />
One strat that worked pretty well was to pack everyone in the back right corner and push the mobs into the corner to reduce pong. <br />
<br />
Oh, and if you can get a mod rod before hand, it helps. Seems to work well casting after the first round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Leiker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've done the Exe alot of times successfully with Archery. As usual in PooP archery is so much better DPS than melee unless you're in the top level of equipment really and the circumstances allows for it - which is does here.<br />
<br />
Levi up, stand on the platform (Where the prisoner is) from there, you can move around (And leave platform too and still keep altitude for better LoS)<br />
<br />
Keep TS for boss (Or to have WS ready in case the brown stuff hits the big windy thing) - just remember, don't panic! (In big friendly letters) When you get to the Executioner himself, you have all the time in the world - kite him abit if needed, tell druid / shammy to go off damage and just make sure everyone stays alive with patch heals as needed.<br />
<br />
Have MT attack asap, no delay in targetting. Assist asap. Make him go something along the line of  Rock Named / Alien Named / Rock / Alien. But it's vitally important he NEVER switch target - whatever he targets first, be it intentional or by accident, tell him to stay on it until it is either dead or banished.<br />
<br />
CrowdControl is nice - but can be substituted with an extra backup healer - they don't hit all that hard. Just make sure it's a good equipped cleric and/shammies who can take the beating. You shouldn't bother peeling of them, you'll loose too much DPS - if they can't take the beating they need to be more careful. If they can't figure out either solution, they have no business in tier 2+ planes.<br />
<br />
Never PingPong. Tell everyone to stay within 5 feets of eachother - running to a mob is a waste of good dps (And you can still get a good shot with bow - it's not like it's a 40+ member raid)<br />
<br />
Banish is good. Not needed though.<br />
<br />
DPS and Levels are key - everyone 62+ makes a world of difference.<br />
<br />
Be a good puppy and heal in the breaks - also mem that cure poison to remove any tashes that landed during the wave.<br />
<br />
You will know after wave 1 if your group can make it.<br />
<br />
You can nuke if you have to, I personally never do it. Sure our summoned nuke is nice, but I don't use it. Calefaction - forget it really, in the time it casts you have the potential of doing 4 x the potential calefaction damage (Granted, archery can make you do 0 damage too in that time :) but more often than not, am3 outdamages it)<br />
<br />
Nothing is more stressing than seeing one of those unlucky 10 misses in a row in a fight on these mobs :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Pay attention - it's just 15 mins, you can focus for that long :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: About Charm - well no Dire Charm. Normal charm can be a big boost and a big help.... Just be careful, we failed once cause our enchanter didn't realize he was fully buffed. So when he tried to invis himself to break it, guess what ? :D   the 4 secs for him to pick a buff and recast invis made us loose :p<br />
The clear advantage of charm is of course, one less mob to CC or patch heal from, and it adds damage on the first three mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Neetero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Very helpful posts so far...thanks a lot.  As far as MOBs in executioner, what are we talking about as far as HPs on the wave mobs and the final boss?  What normal mobs would you equate them to outside of the trials?<br />
<br />
How much time do you have from the time a wave pops till the prisoner gets the axe?  How fast does each wave mob have to die?  If you fail, how long does it take to try it again assuming no lines for the trial?  What buffs are recommended other than damage sheilds, haste and normal HP &amp; atk buffs?  Would two monks be better than one monk and a Druid?  Should chanter be nuking?<br />
<br />
I'd like to develop a plan before we go in so each member knows their role and the general strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ojuillean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had GREAT luck with a Bard in the group vs. an Enchanter. <br />
<br />
Melody of Mischief (62 bard AE slow) draws all agro away from the casters and leaves the agro on the bard who, despite what some might think, can tank a slowed mob if needed - or at least take more of a beating than an enchie. :eek:<br />
<br />
Passed it 5x in a row with a Bard for AE slow and just shuffled guildmates thru in various combos - always leaving me, cleric, bard and wizzy as the &quot;base&quot; folks to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snakeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">TS is an option but it depends on how your group is doing.  If  your cleric is using a lot of mana keeping the warrior up, I would save your Disc for WS in case you need it.  <br />
<br />
I have won the trial a dozen times or so all with melee heavy groups.  Generally I use TS on the mobs and our dps is fast enough to make it viable for a wave and a half.  My current make up for getting clerics/chanters flagged are 65 Warrior with emperor weapons, 2 Rogues (65 and 64), myself and the cleric and chanter we need to get flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I use trueshot during the 4th wave to save mana for the casters, then kite the boss around while they med to full.  It means a guaranteed boss pop (because I burn through the 4th wave so fast), and I don't need trueshot for the boss because we have plenty of mana for nukes, slows and heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Merieltha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If I'm helping a guildmate through the exe trial, I bring a grow potion with me then stand on top of the guillotine (on the platform, other side from the prisoner) - goodbye LoS problems ;-)<br />
<br />
We've found that chain-stunning works really well for that trial, also the shammy AE slow is great.  Some of the mobs are rootable but not mezzable, and some are mezzable but not rootable if I remember.<br />
<br />
The mobs will aggro on the closest person, usually the one in the centre, so put your tank in the middle of the room and have everyone else stand around the walls when you're waiting for a wave.<br />
<br />
Druid + monk is better IMO than 2 monks.   A backup healer is really good here, and druids have some nice nukes / AEs.<br />
<br />
Try to make sure all your casters and healers have a mod rod.  Losing halfway through wave 4 because somebody went oom really sucks (been there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dlaritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You dont need a banisher, or a cleric =p<br />
<br />
clerics are nice to rez people if anyone dies tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sdaasiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I did the trial of execution last night 2 boxxing my 61 enchanter for crowd control.<br />
<br />
I used my archery almost the whole time, assisting the MA with my ranger on auto-archery, and mezzing all the razorfiend mobs.<br />
<br />
We beat the living hell out of the trial, usually waiting up to 1 minute in between waves for the script to catch up to us... heh.<br />
<br />
EQ/AM3/CF3 here. I saved Trueshot for the Prime Executioner. It wore off 30 seconds after he died...<br />
<br />
Its all about being level 65 in the trials, my chanter was the only one there that wasn't flagged and 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Keil_Oda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">L60 Chanter (DC pet AAs) <br />
L61 Warrior (decent taunt weapons, 6kHP buffed) <br />
L60 Cleric (epic) <br />
L60 Ranger (swifty/nightmare bow/EQ/AM3) <br />
L60 Monk (epic) <br />
L62 Druid (epic) <br />
<br />
...<br />
1st suggestion is everyone should be 61 it's not that hard to accomplish from lvl 60 as the lvl 61 spells are very nice for the trials.<br />
<br />
Everymob in each wave most die.  Charming possible but not a good idea for a lvl 60 enchanter to try in trials.  I suggest you get that chanter to lvl 61 and buy arcane rune so the cleric don't have to heal him.  Try to get somone to cast Vallon as well (speed buff).  The new mez at lvl 61 (boughten) is very nice for very quickly controlling the mobs.  Can't mez the rocks, you can mez anything else. after done mezzing saddle up.<br />
<br />
As for your warrior get some outside buffs to up his dmg shield here the fire element illusion wouldnt' be so bad along with the druid's ds stacking.  If another chanter is in area ask him/her to cast that illusion on him.  <br />
<br />
The cleric needs a mod rod.  Hopefully he has about 4k mana pool since he will need it due to the lvl of your main tank taking pretty good dmg.  If he/she manages the pool they got you should be alright there. Saddle up too.<br />
<br />
The ranger.  Provide the best dps you can.  figure out what works for you, but remember consistant dmg is key.<br />
<br />
The monk. no opinion here.  He can mend so make sure he does it so the cleric don't have to and the ranger or druid can tap off.<br />
<br />
The druid.  Keep that ds on the warrior! monitor health of mob and when the exe starts yapping if the mob isn't 40% or below nuke away.  Being prepared for resists.  I don't play a druid so I'll treat what he should do on theory.  make sure regen is on everyone.  Make sure everyone has mr(enchanter) and to mem the spells to get rid of tash and slows (disease and poison).<br />
<br />
Now the set up.  <br />
Buff all hp/atk/speed/regen buffs .  Rune everyone (suggest doing this on your 3rd or 4th run since you need to get the feel of things before you make it even close to the 3rd and 4th wave) as this will save healing mana pool.<br />
<br />
Run to the upper right/left area with mt in front and the rest behind him/her.  Tank engages  the closest mob rock or not dont' matter, rest do there thing remembering to stay as close to the tank as possible.  The cleric will get timing down to cast celestial elixir on MT (being lvl 62 here helps with upgraded version).  The enchanter should have been buff to have about 3500 in dmg absorption and should try to maintain arcane rune up at all times.  The MT will have to get the timming down to know when to break off before the first mobs dies to start the attack on the next mob.  The druid makes sure it dies in time.  <br />
<br />
Looking at what you are bringing to the trial with your current lvl and setup, i'd say you have 3% chance to make it.<br />
<br />
We get members through with lvl 65 tank and 2 rogues and any cleric we have available att.  exe is dps that is all there is to it.  DPS is good when you don't have to chase mobs around the room to engage so mez them all in one spot, and pack into the area like 10clowns in a yugo.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shar Nightwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Originally posted by Neetero <br />
OK, so I take it archery is not really an option here?  Seems like everyone is saying stay close to the mobs and waiting even a second to assist, position, etc. means failure... <br />
<br />
Nothing could be further from the truth.  ;)  Our guild always had at least 1 or 2 AM3 archers for the Trials of Execution.  Having an enchanter isn't that important - frequently, you'll get one or two mobs per wave that won't mezz.   The mobs have very low hit points and really didn't hit all that hard, though you do need someone to slow.  The other 2 key classes were a good cleric and a warrior with AOE taunt.  Worked out really well for us.  2 archers (or sometimes just one) would stand on the platform while the rest of the group engaged the mobs in the middle of the room.  Made it very easy to hit with archery.<br />
<br />
We usually filled out the rest of the group with a Rogue or Wizard, and the last spot with a class that really wasn't needed, but needed the flag anyway.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tanas Moorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Last night,  Me  using AM3 / EQ, 65 rogue, 61 wizard, batle cleric, chanter, 61 Warrior.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Elindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">He runs when no one is fighting anything, so your MT should be hitting F8 and attack as soon as something drops.<br />

I found killing the rocks first was a waste if you were light on DPS, kill a fungusbeast first since you get the most time on the first mob.</div></div><hr />
