<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I found a couple good spots to level, and decided I want to make a bit of cash to make up for what I didn't make at PC. I'm almost at 19, and don't mind some slow xp grinding, if I can make up with heavy loot. I got up in level quick, and armor is quite lacking. Any ideas on where a Vah Shir Shaman at 18-22 could go for some decent solo xp grinding for good plat? Even if it were bad xp, if it gave great loot I'd be happy. And yes, all expansions are enabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know that Mistmoore and Sol A are good around that level although I cannot remember whats the lowest you can solo there.  I always went with a group so it might be in the upper 20s rather than lower.  With pop nowadays it is so easy to get around it might not be too hard to zone in, con a mob, and zone out if its too tough.<br />
<br />
The loot in Sol A is ok, Fine steel mainly here and there and plat.</div></div><hr />
