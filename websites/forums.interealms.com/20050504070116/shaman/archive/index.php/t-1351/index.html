This is a company that for well over 6 months now has done nothing but piss off their player base on a variety of issues, and now this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey at least they get something for thier money heh... i dont care really.. the first beta tests are usually the picky pikcy ones anyways and i dont see anything wrong with selecting from your usebase that is &quot;uber&quot; heh ;) (aka pays for extras)<br />
<br />
Edit:  At least we have a few stormhammer people here that can give unofficial reports that of course will not break the large NDA it will likely entail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think long time users of the Test server should have the first chance to beta test it. Afterwards the longest term subscribers, or people that have actually sent in bug reports and helped out. Letting the 40dollar crowd at it first just seems a pure money opportunity to me.</div></div><hr />

Its good business... <br />
<br />
1) it should fill up the last slots that Stormhammer has available.<br />
<br />
2) server is loaded with 60s from the reports I read.  now not everyone one of these people could have gotten to 60 without learning about game dynamics and such.<br />
<br />
3) they can do as they please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm happy they're letting anyone beta test due to experience in the original.  Most beta tests are signup / random or some other selection method.<br />
Just because people who pay more get first shot at a beta shouldn't really make any difference to you at all.  Beta tests are a bonus, and a way to help out a company get a great product out, they're not an entitlement to players.  I definitely don't think it's another reason to hate a company, if you really need to take some anger out on them, there's plenty of other reasons you could do so =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The most obvious first group for EQ2 beta should be the players on Test with the longest tenure. That would kinda make sense wouldn't it? Instead the beta goes to those players that pay Verant the most money. This tells me that Verant is more interested in making money than in having a quality beta test for EQ2.<br />

<br />
Would if Test server was actually a test server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mairi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keep in mind as well that the first stage of Beta Testing usually requires player wipes almost every week. When you combine that with a less than fleshed-out world, it makes me wonder who is getting the short end of the stick. I'm more than happy for someone else to be in the first stage of Beta, and let me have my turn later on. Long term players will get our chance, but we will actually have the best of the bargain, we will(hopefully) have more content to play with, and less chance of being wiped on a regular, recurring basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't forget, everyone...<br />
<br />
Stormhammer is nothing but a test server anyway ;-)<br />
<br />
40 bucks to try out new content, just before everyone else gets it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What an insult,  I was at compusa on day of release to buy this game and been playing ever since<br />
<br />
**** you verant for giving priority to those with bigger wallets</div></div><hr />
