<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Years ago I was grouped with some guys who were killing VhanHagarLeeRoth or whatever his name is in SK while we were kiling other critters.  I did not have a real strangle hold on the faction thing at the time and did not realize that it would become the source of some real danger for me in my middle age and just a pain in my old age.<br />
<br />
I would kind of just like to walk around in the old towns without having to play Bard Hockey with my VP.  I had tried the MM route and that just did not work.  <br />
<br />
Recently I read a year old post on AllaKaz's about a Bard in Grogg in East Freeport whom I could give 2gp to at a time to raise my faction but if I was KOS to LoABs I had to invis to do it.  Well, I tried it and it did not work.  I bearform to get short, invis, get up behind him because he is standing on a table (rude lout) get my gold ready, try to hand it to him and he starts to hit me with a wet noodle.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if there is a way to do this.  I know this is a specific question, but it speaks to a larger game mechanics question.  Could a Chanter buddy of mine Mez or Pacify or what ever it is that those folks do so I could give this loser a total of 30pp at 2gp a shot and a make-believe wedgie?  Knowing how this sort of thing works may be helpful to know in other situations and that is why I am asking it here instead of on the quest forum.<br />
<br />
I know &quot;with the books it doesn't really matter&quot; but I kind of like the idea of being able to walk into the bank in my hometown and not have to watch that I don't get too close to the bar so that I don't have to root Martin Numbstring while I step out of town to clear agro.  Yeah Yeah I could just kill him but my luck GoD will make getting our Canni4 upgrade dependent on good Bard faction.  So I like to play nice with as many NPCs as possible for fear I might need them someday.  Still trying to get Tunare's phone#<br />
<br />
Thank ye</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that killing mobs in Mistmore castle will help raise your faction with the League of Antonican Bards.  I'm pretty much kos to these guys now myself after having spent a few levels killing the bards in HHK.  I'm pretty sure that invising up to anyone and trying to hand them something will ever work, cause the sec that the trade window is opened, you lose invis.  I don't know about charm working, although I do know that it's been used for other quests.  Might be just as easy to run around Mistmore Castle and smoke whatever you see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for he effort guys but the MM I refer to as not working in my original post is Mistmoore.  I have read many posts by others who say that killing in Mistmoore did not seem to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If it's an old world quest mob you might try getting wolfform and see if that works. The invis trick was fixed a while back so that avenue isn't available. You might try an illusion potion to see if it will get faction up enough to do the hand ins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd recommend just blowing up Mistmoore whenever you're bored and have nothing better to do.  At least that way you'll be making money instead of losing it slowly while getting carpal tunnel.<br />
<br />
Anybody know how big of a faction gain you get from killing a Kunark dragon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">faction is never easy to get back once you destroyed it.  There are always somethings that work better than others, some mobs that give you huge hits and some that only give 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A long time a go when I still played my wizard, and he was in his 40's or so, I ruined my bard faction, but if you're fast and know the key phrases I was able to do the mail quest from felwithe to kelethin with him to fix faction.. even KoS, you just have to get him to give you the mail bag, or you have to hand him the mail bag, BEFORE he attacks you<br />
<br />
Not sure how this would work now for my 65 iksar shaman, but it is worth a try if you ask me.<br />
<br />
EDIT: This was 2+ years a go, not sure if it still works :-(<br />
<br />
(the bards are like level 20 so they don't tend to agro.. or they were)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did this a long time ago on my Iksar shaman. You need to get wolf form for the hand ins and if I remember right it took more than 30pp, but maybe i'm exagerating because 30+pp was a fortune to me back when I did it. Anyway, I seem to remember them changing the way wolf form affected factions a while ago... but maybe I'm just delusional /shrug. So dunno if it will still work, but worth a try.</div></div><hr />
