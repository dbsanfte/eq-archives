<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, all. I've been looking for a good range slot item to last me through 65 and beyond and came across a Valorian Insignia for the MP4 on it. With Canni5 I'm assuming mana won't be that much of an issue, but that 10% mana saved on all spells and some of our heals is very tempting. I was also looking at some of the ceramic items - Ceramic Shackles of Torment, Ceramic Shield of Valor (I can justify this purchase to switch it out for buffing) and a Wicked Bone Atlatl. Which would you recommend picking up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of the ceramic stuff is pretty sweet.  I picked up the ceramic rod of storms for the +23% dmg on our cold based DD's.  Unfortunately I don't nuke to much so this was kinda wasted.  I normally have the wicked bone atl equiped and love it.  It all comes down to what you're looking for, I enjoy the spell haste, and already have MP3 from and ODS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use Ceramic Shield of Valor most of the time for extended buff duration and decent hit points.   I also have a Sharp Claw Ahlspiess from Untel'Dak in PoN.  If you do any soloing the Affliction Efficiency IV is verry nice.</div></div><hr />
