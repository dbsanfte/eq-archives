<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greets,<br />
<br />
I just started playing again recently and I noticed that Blood of Sarynn (65 dot) now state that it only does 100 damage every six seconds for 42 seconds and is selling for less than $4,000.<br />
<br />
I could have sworn this spell was selling 7 months ago for $30,000 and was doing 310 damage every six seconds.<br />
<br />
Is the current spell description a misprint or did SOE nerf it so peeps would buy LDoN to get Bane?<br />
<br />
