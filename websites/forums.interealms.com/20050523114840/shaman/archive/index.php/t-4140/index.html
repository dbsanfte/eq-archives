<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i realize we arent melee calss . i dont expect to out melee a warrior . so dont go * delte and make another class* :p<br />
<br />
<br />
im just wondering if there is somehting i missed . a stat , something ...<br />
<br />
i have the average base stats on wisdom and str and sta . <br />
<br />
i have noticed since i was in the teens. my melee is pretty sad , or maybe it just seems that way in my head . wiht my warriors when they cap at 60 a hit or whatever the battle goes like this<br />

<br />
is this just a misconeption in my mind ? im not asking to out melee anyone . i dotn ever wanna out damage the war the rng  and whoever elese . its not my job to melee. but i feel pretty gimp missing for 5-8 to land 1 blow that isnt even near my damage cap .  obviously i have the ability to land good hits . im hitting sometimes for 70+ . but its  so infrequent :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We stink at melee, get used to it. Our offense and weapon skills are capped lower and we are on a different offensive rable then melee plus we don't get a damage bonus or double attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No double attack +<br />
No dual wield +<br />
Lower weapon / offense skill caps +<br />
Different damage table + <br />
No main hand damage bonus = <br />
CASTER, BABY<br />
<br />
Up to around 40 you can still trick yourself into thinking our melee is okay by grabbing a nice ratio weapon (REIF, one of the new near 1/1 ratio two handers, etc.), a haste item, and a haste spell... but once you hit the 40's you can't keep the charade up any longer.<br />
<br />
You just have to realize that melee, while still fun, is not going to generally be your most efficient way to do damage.  There are still situations when it can come in handy (swings between JBB blasts, weapons with giant procs, etc.) but it's not our strong point.<br />
<br />
And yes... we've all been there when the mob if shuffling away at death-walk speed and we're behind it, furiously whiffing while the puller is pulling the next one.  After a little while (maybe the puller has returned already) the other group members start noticing &quot;Sheesh, that thing still isn't DEAD- it had one pixel of life and that silly shaman has been poking it for like a full minute !!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ahh well . just seemed with the same stats of a warrior in str and sta and with some really high damage weapons . thought i was doing something wrong heh<br />
<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
<br />
still luv the shammy . life rolls on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even when soloing, any damage I do in melee is so trivial compared to my pet.  I'm only there (in melee range) to take damage, not put it out.<br />
<br />
I'm currently using REIF with 187 piercing...with Alacrity I'm a swinging fool!  <br />
<br />
note:  I said swinging, not hitting. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Snap<br />
Any damage I do in melee is nothing compared to my pet, I DoT and Slow the crap out of them to keep aggro, but Cujo easily outdamages my melee. I think when I finally get a REIF (and I WILL be getting a REIF) my pet will still outdamage me in melee. My job is to take damage and keep Cujo alive.....as long as your pet is alive, he/she is an unlimited DoT. <br />
<br />
We suck at melee ! Period !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's not all bad.  I do decent melee--enough to make for a weak DoT anyway.  When I solo, I usually drop a couple of BoN on mobs, an epic, and then the pet and I spend the rest of the time in melee.  Helps if you have a haste item.  With focus and VoB I have no trouble getting to 255 str and dex, so if you have a decent proccing weapon, it works pretty well.  Right now, with celerity and Gauntlets of Dragonslaying, I do reasonable melee damage each fight.  After I epic DoT, I usually switch to a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang for the low delay.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">what is  REIF ?<br />
<br />
and yes its true we can add well . wiht ym ice gringer im hitting for 70 when i land a good one . 30 DD proc . im not horrible addition when i run out of mana or get bored . just times i am amazed how often i swing and dont hit =(</div></div><hr />

well i been checking the bazaar , my server forum . nothing . infact , i finaly broke down and bought a spine chill spear last night cause with how oftne i hit , i have decided i need a proc weapon to be of ANY use when my mana runs out<br />
<br />
also got a frost giant femur ( looks like a axe , can you say no more asking for SOW while sitting ? :) ) and staff of the living sands . onna try them out tonite in KC or might even be hading to seb with my guild</div></div><hr />

It is big and mean looking. It is fast 28 delay. It can hit decent. 86 I belive.<br />

And An AE proc as well. What is not to like. <br />

Of course the neg 30 to poisen resist. Does kinda stink. But I can still have a 120 to poisen with no necro around while using it.<br />

Oh for the lower levels if you can find one. A blight, or If a barbarian, barbarian spiritist hammer are the next best thing to sliced bread. I use the BSH all the time when I want to put out damage. (Spell casting fury can be fun boys and girls)<br />

Start day trading :) Its fairly easy with the new bazaar system.  I started with 50pp, and if you count the items I have for sale I am at approximately 5kish.  It takes time to do, but it certainly is faster than farming...  You can make some good coin off those puke druids ;)  Relieve them of their items and tell em to get back to qauding :)</div></div><hr />

Had a REIF as guild loan.  Loved poking with it between JBB blasts and against MR resistant mobs. :)<br />
<br />
Then I bought a horse.  Outdoor soloing on horseback means no more poking in battle to retain maximum mana regen.  Nevertheless I hung on to it.  Was fun to actually do a bit (ok, a tiny bit) of damage against Black Reavers on guild raids for our rangers &amp; druids.<br />
<br />
Returned REIF to guild bank soon after receiving my Spear of Fate.<br />
Epic takes longer to swing, but I just couldn't see keeping the REIF for the amount of damage I usually inflicted with it.  Warriors we are NOT.<br />
<br />
Hopefully a younger shaman in my guild will enjoy it until he/she receives their own Spear of Fate.<br />
<br />
The Bone of Bertoxx is sweet, but I don't see one coming into my hands any time soon.  I'm not overly concerned with my lack of melee damage.  Neither should you. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I play both, you will outdamage the warrior, just not at pokin'.<br />
<br />
Hehe, my warrior just turned from 49 to 50-51 over the weekend and can use his OT gate hammer, well usually I ask someone to duel after a raid to gate back to OT and with my Shaman it was a couple of 6's, misses and boom gate.<br />
<br />
Tonight I used my warriors gate hammer for the first time on a Ogre SK and I wasn't killin him but it was more like 12, 26, 18, miss, 22, 26, 21 and so on. I was knocking down his hp bar slowly but surely. I stopped, I couldn't stand it and let a wizzie port me to EJ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Basic BattleShaman techniques:<br />
<br />
<br />
*****************************************<br />
<br />
Remember, Cripple is your friend--Cripple every mob you intend on meleeing.  If you don't have Cripple, Incapacitate works just fine.<br />
<br />
Get a good Haste item (Sash of the Dragonborn, Silvery Belt of Contention, etc.).   Keep your Haste spell up at all times.<br />
<br />
Maximize your ATK rating (try to get it over 1000).  This usually means keeping Rage up at all times.<br />
<br />
Use a good dmg/dly weapon, or a good proccing weapon, or a combination of both.  Grab an REIF or a Club of the Ice Ocean in the bazaar for 3-6K, or a GFG for 3K.  <br />
<br />
If you're going to use a proccing weapon, get your DEX over 200.<br />
<br />
When possible, always attack from the REAR.<br />
<br />
******************************************<br />
<br />
I've never parsed my results, but a lot of my guildies are amazed at the amount of damage I can output using a GFG or a proccing weapon.  Can I come anywhere close to their damage output?  Hell, no, but I don't *whiff* that much anymore, either.  <br />
<br />
I just wish we got the same damage bonus for using 2Handers as melee types did.   THEN this would be some serious fun.<br />
<br />
(On a side note, when duoing with a lvl 60 monk in my guild, I don't even bother to do this stuff....Monk damage is sooooooo insane.  I just rack and stack mobs, and let him kill them.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some of you younger shaman discouraged by your eroding melee skills.  Remember, we can melee, it just takes the right equipment and using every spell in our inventory.</div></div><hr />

Just wondering how you get a 1200 ATK?  My ATK is around 993, with offense maxed, weapon skill maxed and STR at 255, at lvl 51. This is also with Rage and Spirit of Bih'Li on. Figured my ATK must be maxed too.<br />

Using several items with Aura of Battle (14atk each) and a gobby earring also helps. Ive seen screenshots of shaman with 1350ish atk.
