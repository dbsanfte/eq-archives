I fear it's just a matter of time before this finds its way into MMOG's.</div></div><hr />

What other people do in game and what other people choose to spend their money on doesn't affect me in the slightest.<br />
I hunt where I wanna hunt.<br />
I quest where I want to quest.<br />
My quest rewards are there no matter how much cash someone else pays for a character or item in game.<br />
How many times does **** like this need to be said?</div></div><hr />

Your quest rewards are Soulbound, and thus not affected by what people buy and sell in/out of the game.  But if you ever use the Auction House, you are affected.  Whether you realize it or not, you are.</div></div><hr />

Until that gold farmer is hogging all the spawns you want.  Then you'll go somewhere else but tell yourself that you made the decision where to hunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats like crime isnt bad because its not bad in youe neighborhood. So lets not be proactive because it doesnt affect me! sure<br />
<br />
Wait for it to effect you and see how bad it is than.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe i shouldn't say baffles me. More like it would make more sense if you just said it doesn't effect me and i dont care. Instead you say i dont see a problem therefore there isnt a problem.</div></div><hr />
