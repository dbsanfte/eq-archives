<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">after several discusions on the topic with other players I get the impression that I have the basics of a solid pvp server...something that verant and soe both failed to do.<br />
<br />
weather this even gets to anyone who can or will take a serious look at it its pretty irrelivant. I just want to put it down in text someplace more permanent than the SZ trade channel.<br />
<br />
basic server rules the same as SZ, hard coded teams. full pvp from 6-whatever. <br />
<br />
teams should be ALL/ALL. this is the real  serious thing that SoE and Verant both screwed the pooch on. on SZ it started in test and continues to this day, on TZ/VZ it also started on test and is still in effect today. what am I talking about? <br />
Team Balance. everquest is the only team based pvp game I have ever played where there was 0 interest in making the teams balanced. instead of taking the simplest route and just making all/all teams you took the complex route of making this involved and twisted server with weird coding and unique code/rules for a ton of things. <br />
SZ has the only Tunare worshiping Cats in everquest, as a result my cat rogue uses a blessed faydark thunderbolt. also as a result when beast lords were indroduced they were messed up because of the unique code, the same for zerkers.<br />
the &quot;retrievers&quot; so that goods and noots could have access to summon corpse<br />
<br />
skip all that nonsense, you guys coming up with these pvp servers dont have a clue (sorry but its obvious) when it comes to pvp, you ideas show alot of imagination but its pointless to make 4 servers with the most unique and pain in the ass code imaginable when you could just make servers where we get to kill each other...that is after all the idea behind pvp.<br />
<br />
hard coded teams ala SZ<br />
all/all teams. this just makes your lives as simple as possible, no unique code required.<br />
Antonica/Kunark/Velious/LoY (for the raid features and bank features)<br />
those 3 or 4 expansions only, this eliminates 95% of the safe zones and prevents any serious issues with one team gaining total control of the server endgame. <br />
<br />
I know for a simple fact that eq would have a much higher pvp player base if you had a server where there was no rediculous endgame to pursue, no endless flagging/keying/gearing/exping. a server with a visible and atainable endgame, a server without broken aa's insane resists, (NOTE without VT+ resists you could stop rewriting the code for resists, with velious gear you just dont get players with 500 in all resists unbuffed). I play on a zek because I like the challenge of killing other players, I dont play on a blue server because spending 10000 hours flagging/back flagging/grinding through each expansion that comes out just to stay competitive. its also activly discouraging to new players on pvp servers. when you compare the gear of a new player on a zek vrs an old time high lvl the game just breaks down. theres no way to balance that.<br />
if velious is the endgame it significantly lowers the endless pit that is the current gear gap between new players and the old ones.<br />
really I would rather fight than get my 87th flag<br />
I would rather fight than wonder if I have the dkp for that drop.<br />
I just want to fight, against a player that I can at least hurt even if they are better geared, instead of emptying my entire mana bar and not inflicting a single point of damage or even inconveinence the guy on the other end.<br />
<br />
<br />
one issue for the gm's to address.<br />
Ghosting, (for those who dont know, ghosting is when you disconect your pc from the net, run around wherever you want to in a zone full of mobs/players who cant see or interact with you in anyway. then before you lose cnnection plug back in.) the current stance on ghosting is unacceptable. &quot;ghosting is leagal because we have no way of knowing if its a lag spike or a deliberate attempt&quot; thats a crock of ****. when a player lag spikes its random, when a player ghosts while training/pvping time after time after time its painfully obvious what they are doing. put out a warning in the motd and the next week start the bans. cheating to win isnt pvp and the fact that you actually STATE THAT IT'S LEAGAL encourages the behavior.<br />
<br />
res box training needs to be a bannable offence. Training with 0 risk to you while harrasing dozens of players in a pvp environment is simply broken, 2 players being able to shut down 50 players activities with no risk to themselves is wrong on countless lvls in a pvp environment.<br />
<br />
for the existing servers and the bluebie zone issue.<br />
make the 4 bluebie zones nonspell casting zones. no clickies, no songs, no spells. theres no reason at all to have a place to safely buff and heal on a Zek.<br />
remove all bind points and get rid of the soulbinder, there is no reason to allow safe bind points on a Zek, you play here to fight not talk smack you cant back up while sitting in pok medding up from the last guy to gank you.<br />
<br />
those 2 changes would address most of the blue zone issues with the current zeks.<br />
<br />
while I realise that the odds of a new pvp server are slim there is eq2 to look at and keep in mind.<br />
<br />
after thinking about this for awhile and talking to players who left and players who are new to the pvp game most agree. a simple server with simple rules is what they want.<br />
no silly point system, with questionable rewards. no elaborate death with gear in SH and res effects. skip all that.<br />
I want cash loot.<br />
I want to see my name followed by my victims on a web page.<br />
thats it. my team is all/all. I have a necro friend to summon my corpse. my team is all/all so there are clerics AND druids to help with heals.<br />
<br />
seriously 90% of my problems with this game come from the 5 expansions in the pvp world.<br />
<br />
 luclin, the introduction of the MB/Instagate wizzy who just pops in, ganks one person and poof! they are sitting in nexus all snuggly warm and safe. also the introduction of the LB necro and DT sk...like sk's arent already overpowered in pvp.<br />
<br />
Ldon, safe zones are a no no on a zek, if you dont want to fight go back to the carebear server that spawned you.<br />
<br />
PoP, the ability for one guild to cockblock the entire server from higher tier access while giving themselves safe zones to exp in is a no no.<br />
<br />
GoD, more safe zones, more cockblocking more brokenly overpowered loot.<br />
<br />
OoW, MORE broken loot, MORE safe zones, MORE cockblocking HOORAY!<br />
<br />
yes I would restart on a new server with those rules and expansions...in a second. even if I had to delete my 65 shaman 65 chanter, and soon to be 63 with SoS rogue. <br />
<br />
why?<br />
<br />
because...<br />
<br />
I just want to fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
(edit) I have toons on Rallos, TZ, and 3 high lvls on SZ. I started in 99 and never played Blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Never really wanted to try pvp.  The vast majority of EQ players are probably like me in that respect.  Along those same lines, PVP in EQ was an afterthought, not an up front decision.  I'm taking a guess here, but I think PVP is always going to be poor in EQ, because the game isn't designed from the ground up with PVP in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EQ is a difficult game to adjust into PvP for many reasons. Personally, I wish they would stop putting too many resources into the PvP aspect of the game. Its obvious that a MASSIVE percentage of people who play this game prefer PvE over PvP. Those kinds of numbers dont lie. <br />
. . .safe zones are a no no on a zek, if you dont want to fight go back to the carebear server that spawned you.<br />
You make some legitimate points, but they all went into the crapper for me the minute you used the term &quot;carebear&quot;. Attempting to insult 95% of the EQ players who prefer not to worry about some 16 year old snot-nose coming up behind them while they are actually trying to PLAY the GAME by using derogatory terms like &quot;carebear&quot; only turns people off from any REAL point your trying to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Carebear,<br />
a player who comes to a zek, rolls up a toon and expects to be able to exp in total peace and quiet, unmolested. <br />
one who crys after getting spanked in /ooc because he got killed while fighting a mob. one who in general has no clue whatsoever of the concept of pvp (or usually pve) but insists they know the game because they have a lvl 25 wizard on some random blue server.<br />
<br />
<br />
dont come to a zek and act like a total dink and I wont call you a carebear. run to pok the second my little greenine attacks you without ever even casting a spell or taking a swing and then bitch about it in public channels and you have just defined yourself as a carebear.<br />
<br />
playing on a blue server doesnt make you a carebear. being a dumbass does. <br />
I wasnt attempting to insult anyone, you can take it however you want but if the word carebear offends you I can hardly be blamed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually Dia it is not the server rules that makes PVP not possible on EQ1 its the game design.<br />
<br />
Class balance is issue number 1.<br />
Item balance is number 2<br />
Team balance number 3.<br />
Population balance 4<br />
Exploitable code 5<br />
<br />
EQ 2 makes for a nice platform to setup PVP.<br />
<br />
Class balance. any race and class combo. <br />
Item as long as they dont introduce the diety crap and learned anything from EQ1.<br />
Team balance. Two cities = two teams Period.<br />
Population. Each city should have a population count. Have it expand if needed by adding Towns of 50 so no team is outnumbered more then 50.<br />
Single City allowed per account.<br />
then commit to fixing any exploits then they have a decent start to PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play on Vallon Zek. I have done since the day I started. Never played on any other server, haven't ever even been tempted to. Its been well over 4 years now. I think that gives me some credential to speak, and to disagree with Diabalein<br />
<br />
Diabalein has some good points. But I don't think that his outlook necessarily represents all of the PvP server community.<br />
<br />
Me; I like to PvP. But I also like to PvE as well. And sometimes, I like to just like to chill with my friends. I don't generally go out actively hunting for PvP, but PvP does tend to find me. And if I want to go looking for PvP, I know where to look.<br />
<br />
My point is that for me, and I suspect for many other people, PvP is an aspect of the game that we really enjoy, but it is not the sole reason for playing. I enjoy, for example, working through LDoNs with a couple of friends, knowing that for the next 45 minutes I don't have to be looking over my shoulder.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMHO the biggest problem with PvP at the moment is that resists are rediculously overpowered. I am pretty ghetto, and my resists are pretty cr@ppy, but some of my friends have unbuffed MR over 450 and other resists around 400. That basically renders them immune to death by shaman! Even after debuffing I might stick a spell on them 1 in 20 attempts...occasionally, they have concentrated too much on MR FR CR and I can blindside them by stacking Insid decay and Disease Dots, and then spamming Insid decay to prevent curing. But thats a damn risky tactic.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am rambling now...I'll stop here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am a vet from Tallon Zek.  Started back in 2000 and have leveled many a chrecter on 3 different accounts there.  And i will have to say that i agree with almost all that Diabalein was saying.  But i will also have to agree with Blazz that calling it people &quot;carebear&quot; is not gonna get you far.  If you use the term bluebie, or blue, you might get a little farther with people from a CS point of view, since those terms have been around ever since the servers were created.  <br />
<br />
That being said, i would gladly transfer my shaman, let him be delelved to Velious era, lose all his AA's, and yes lose all of my gear since it would be post Velious, to play on a server that was all/all with a chance of killing people again.  As it is now, i am in the same boat as 90pct of the Zek population.  I am a catch-up player.  Tallon is a server that is locked down by Pandemonium, the only guild on the server to have PoFire+ gear.  Any time any other guild tries to flag up they (Pande) zone in, wipe the falgging guilds raid, and corpse camp that guild until the defeated guild logs out for the night.  Its just a known fact not to mess with Pande.  But if there was a server that he talked about, all the guilds would be even in gear/content, then we could actualy have some fun.  But i dont see that happening ever.  I mean, look how long it took Sony to even give us time for the recent updates they made to the Zeks.  And after all the testing, they managed to mess it up even worse imo.  Anyway, im rambling now too....have a nice day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">phatteydump shares my point of veiw pretty much exactly.<br />
<br />
basicly this step would be the only possible way soe could keep my interest at all. <br />
<br />
on SZ one single player through the power of hacks, exploits, and inaction by gm's locked the other 2 teams out of the endgame for easily 2 years, its far to late to catch up now.  that is just broken, it kills me that a lvl 5 bard Leagaly training giants in oasis manages to set a new rule for the entire server by his actions when a 65 bard who locks down a good dozen  zones and locks out all competition doesnt even draw a second glance from the gm's.<br />
<br />
I was just really curios what others thought about the matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
(edit) and disagree with class balance being a major issue, in a team vrs team environment classes are irrelivant so long as all teams have equal access. the fact that a cleric cant kill a shaman in pvp doesnt mean anything. <br />
<br />
team balance, #1<br />
team balance, #2<br />
team balance, #3<br />
team balance, #4<br />
team balance, #5<br />
everything else. <br />
<br />
on TZ/VZ the lack of hard coding destroyed the original RP aspect of the game.<br />
on rallos item loot vastly overpowered casters who could pvp naked. unless melees were given the ability to steal spells from books item loot will never be viable<br />
on SZ the massive team imbalance combined with what could only be seen as gm favoritism by many meant that the sever never really had a chance once luclin was released. when I made the move fromrallos to SZ I rolled up good because they were about 10% of the server pop. I like my pvp hard, I dont particularly like pvping with an evil shaman whos trash loot that was rotting was given to him beats my best pieces by a factor of 10. its pretty much God mode for the evil team and they have all the dt sk's and lb necros as well.<br />
<br />
I have been talking to friends in Wow beta and things are looking good for that game, <br />
<br />
I have been watching my room mate play eq2 and all I can say is &quot;WOW whos dick did the guy who did luclin models suck to keep his job and do the ones for eq2?&quot;   seriously guys, its pathetic that you cant even duplicate the old school models realistic lvls or improve on them and you still have luclin type faces where the designer seems to have a &quot;thing&quot; for chicks with downsyndrome.<br />
<br />
eq2 reminds me ALOT of linneage2 the class trees are close to identical, the spell effects are very similar. graphicly the games appear almost interchangeable...the water in eq2 is amazing as hell though. beautiful.<br />
<br />
<br />
(edit edit) sorry for typing strangeness or errors, muscle relaxers make typing a whole new challenge</div></div><hr />

Comments like this really undermine anything you have said, to me at least. I just forget everything on topic when I read this. I think you might have more of an impact if you tone down the aggressive and rude comments and focus on what you want changed.<br />
<br />
You might just tell me to f-off, and you probably will, but I am not the one requesting changes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">have you seen the eq2 models? and the way they run? they look like cats from eq1 in the way they move...the old models in eq 1 were fudly but at least they looked like they had a normal skeletal/muscular system going and werent suffering from some bizaar  nervous system disorder.<br />
<br />
sorry if its to offensive. I tend to be pretty blunt. moreso when I am all drugged out. but  I cant seriously say anything nice about the new models, they had years to code and to get it right and they move worse than the og eq ones did and show no improvment over the old models other than some new features to customise your toon. if they cant get that right what CAN they get right?</div></div><hr />
