<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">By request, I've taken the time today to clean up my scoring system to bring it into accord with the PoP age and have begun the process of creating a list of tradeable items, sorted by score, as a guide for shaman.  I am including only tradeable items, those that are the result of popular quests (e.g. Earring of the Solstice) or popular sets of armor (e.g. Velious quest, Ornate armor), and a very few select no drop pieces that would be obtainable with the same degree of difficulty as the other items here.  Generally speaking, only items that rate about 50.0 or more are listed, although I have made a few exceptions.<br />
<br />
In the interests of open knowledge, this scoring system is as follows:<br />
AC*0.5 + HP*1.2 + MP*1.0 + STA*3.0 + AGI*0.5 + WIS*2.5 + (PR+MR+FR+DR+CR)*0.25.  Additionally, an item earns 3 points per point of HP regen/tick and 10 points per point of mana regen/tick (usually FT).  Clickable or focus effects that have a major impact on the value of the item are figured under a seperate system and added to the value of the item - if people are interested, I will later post that here (with the number of foci in game, the discussion is lengthy).<br />
<br />
EDIT: First 3 slots are completely done, working to fill in the rest.  I'll be going back when I can to fill in missing spots, especially on the 3 sets of Ogre Cultural.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wow,  great work!  Any links to your old posts and formula?  I still like to emphasize my hp over mana.  1.2hp to 1.0mana seems too close for my tastes.  Something like 1.0AC, 2.0hp, 1.0mana, 3.0sta, 3.0wis are multipliers I still keep in my head.  Old school pre PoP thinking?  Thanks for compiling all this stuff  Shab!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Nice work!  Can we get this stickied?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Very nice!  :) This should help a lot of people with their future gear decisions.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree with Crash on the hp/mana/ac values though.  I definetly value having hp's I'm not so sure about putting such a high value on them.<br />
<br />
With your formula you have a Black Sapphire Velium Necklace (65hp/65mana) rated at 143, however, the Tracking Wolf Collar (10AC, 5Wis, 5Int, 40hp, 40mana, 10SvC) is a much lower rated 109.  To put that into prospective a 46hp/46hp Necklace would be rated higher than the Tracking Wolf Collar.  I don't really think I would give up 10AC, 5Wis, and 10SvC for 6 hp's and 6 mana though.  Personally, I'd go with a value system similar to what is on the Ranger's Glade but with less of an emphasis on AC as they have.  Not saying which is better but would like to understand why you came up with the values that you did.  Also, going by Crash's values it'd seem even further off from what I would get.  Are the values that you two are coming up with for more of the highend gear where you don't really ever worry about ac or anything?  Personally I still try to keep a decent amount of AC.  If I didn't, I'd feel like I should be wearing a robe instead of chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually Miyn, I'm giving AC twice the value that Shab is currently using.  I'm giving AC a full 1x multiplier rather than 0.5x for Shab.  I'm with you on the tracking wolf collar &gt;&gt; velium BS neck.  I also weight hp more than mana (i.e. 2:1 rather than 1.2:1).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm with yall. Great list but it needs a little work. For one thing, one hp is worth very little compared to 1 wisdom. I noticed that the Fearsome Skyiron Mask is rated lower than the Crystal Spider Eyes, which seems weird to me:<br />
<br />
FSM: 10ac, 5wis, 30mana/hp<br />
CSE: 8ac, 3wis,3int, 35mana/hp<br />
<br />
are hp/mana so valuable that 5 of each makes something 5 points higher than 2 ac and 2 wis? Definately not IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Awesome, thank you for taking the time to do this.  I have always wondered when upgrading, how much mana do I sacrifice for HP.  If I gain, lets say 15 HP but loose 30 is that worth it?  At what ratio do you go ahead and upgrade loosing mana to HP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I would also weigh wisdom higher than sta. For the sole reason that we can buff sta. With infusion of spirit and righteous health and my base sta of 100, I only need 65sta on gear to max out. With Wisdom I need 190 to max out. This would even be more so if I was an ogre, barb, or troll. <br />
<br />
Tox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This list works fairly well for me :)   In choosing gear I tend to look bottom line at Hp ONLY.   However, if it is completely WITHOUT a stat I value (STA or AC) then I tend to knock it down a bit in ranking.  Maybe a neg penalty to items with no AC at all could be put in, hardly worth the effort though :)<br />
<br />
<br />
     Also, certain slots are harder to fill with certain stats, so the effects should be of increased value on those.    Like in the arms/wrists  Hp gear is incredibly hard to come by, yet with ornate you can get Improved heal 4 on arms, and with a couple quests you can get some nice focus effects on wrists.  Again it'd be hard to factor that in though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   This list would have definately made a nice reference for me as I geared up.  Now it just makes me feel tingly inside to see most of my gear at the top end of the list :)<br />
<br />
<br />
  And for those wondering, don't try looking too hard for the elemental tradeskill gear for a while, still far too rare on components and far too common on failures.   Needs a raid force to farm the drops for some of it last I heard (like Farwater).<br />
<br />

You don't really need to know how to code to do what you want, you can make an excel spreadsheet that would do the same, the only problem would be you would need to manaully enter everything. You could set it up so that you enter every item in the game and then change your weighting scale per stat but it would be incredibly time intensive. If some one wanted to do the preliminary gear lists I could code the weighting scales such that everything could be adjusted. <br />
Once the preliminary lists are done it would be simple to add a few items at a time after that, so i could maintain that if someone was willing to do the lists, or even a group of someones. As far as making a simple program where you change the scales and then enter an item manually to see how it stacks up that wouldn't be to terribly difficult to do. Anyone interested in possibly working on this feel free to send me an email at Roknrodney@yahoo.com. I'm sure shab already has done this though so maybe he can just share the file with anyone interested.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Malosaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">First of all, great job Shabura.  Doing the work and then taking time to share it with the community is to be commended.  I wanted to offer my thought on a few of the relative weights.  I'll also say that my perspective is, to some degree, shaped by my time as a monk (my main).  That said, here is my take on some of these:<br />
<br />
1) I would give resists a higher value.  In the current formula, one hp is worth almost five times the value of one resist point.  If I had to choose between five hps or 20 - 25 points of any resist, I would absolutely take the resists so that ratio should be tweaked to make the resists more valuable.  I probably wouldn't include agility in the formula, but if I did, I would make resists at least as valuable.<br />
<br />
2) I would give FT a higher value.  One point of FT currently has about eight times the value of one hp.  If I had to choose between FT 15 or about 130 hps, then I would take the FT 15.  Now, admittedly my shaman is only lvl 55, and things like torpor/quiescence and cann4/cann5 are still to be experienced, but I have to believe that basically wearing kei has value at least somewhat above 125 - 130 hps.  I think I would sacrifice at least 200 hps to have FT 15, probably more.  Along those lines, I'm absolutely sure that I would give up way more than 150 mana to have FT 15.  I could easily see giving up 300 mana, very likely more.<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks for posting your work.  What I've written here is not to take away from it, just to provide more input in shaping it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Nice!<br />
One thing i see is 1wis=10 mana or 6 mana if over 200, so 1 wis should weight same as 6 mana. Maybe if you have Wis capped it could weight 0, but even that way i would give it a weight like 4-5 mana.<br />
I am lvl 40 with WIS not capped, so maybe i am a bit subjective :)</div></div><hr />

On the beastlord forums there's an amazingly good spreadsheet which works out rankings like you have done, with the added benefit that people can put in their own weightings for the different stats. Thus it only takes a matter of seconds to re-order everything with different weightings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Drahcirior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Great job on the chart Shabura :)<br />
<br />
Here are my suggested fixes ;)<br />
Stamina being capped at 305 (say, 245 for us with ToB, or even lower with the IoS+talisman combos), it should be lower than wisdom which is capped at 355. (considering all AAs and at 65th level).<br />
HPs and MP values dont need to be lowered at all. Sure, 1 Wis gives you like 6.5 MP, but in the high end, everyone will agree that HP/Mana own stamina and wisdom for that simple reason: no cap. Sure, there are exceptions, but if we're trying to set up a weight, we should be using the most common thinking.<br />
Cannibalize 4 ratio is 0.6 mana for 1 hp or so I think, so I think 1.2 might be a bit low. (~1.67hp = 1 mana... but we need a ton for Can5, and we are usually more than likely to get aggro now and then).<br />
<br />
AC on an item is multiplied by 1.6 when added to our stats, and Agi is divided by like 5-10 (been a while I didnt check, but once you're over 150 it doesnt do much). Even tho agility also affects dodging frequency, I think AC is worth slightly more cause Agi can be capped (VoTB/FA+Wrulan), and that it seems to be more efficient overall.<br />
<br />
I think 12AC is better than 5HPs too hehe. HPs sure help the pool, but we have to keep in mind that everytime a mob is trying to wack us, he's &quot;draining&quot; potential mana. (reducing a 600dmg hit to 500 or so = 100hps saved, ~60mana. 180mana per triple attack, adds up quickly on a resisted slow...)<br />
<br />
I also think that regeneration is worth more than 3 points... After all, fungi owns any 19ac 15sta BP hehe. I'd put it around the range of 6-7 points, to be similar to FT's value. <br />
<br />
AC*1.0 + HP*1.5 + MP*1.0 + STA*2.2 + AGI*0.5 + WIS*2.4 + (PR+MR+FR+DR+CR)*0.25<br />
regen*6.5<br />
FT*10.0<br />
<br />
Depends on situations of course. A soloing shaman might want more FT/HP regen, or a grouping shaman more HPs for early slows... and shaman in uber guild could just throw the whole formulae out if wisdom and stamina are capped ;p<br />
<br />
At lower level, HPs and MP are worth a lot more too. (wisdom and stamina are affected by level)<br />
<br />
Quite a chore to try to make an accurate weighting. GJ so far, and good luck with RZ hehe :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Ahem -- first off not getting hit for points is often better than having a few extra points because they are easier to heal...  This mitigates against the fact that AC doesnt help you for spells... Hence I think it is fairly balanced -- IE if you take x% less damage vs the hp amount...<br />
<br />
It has been shown that 100 shown ac ~= 4.5% damage reduction.  <br />
<br />
As an iksar with 200 defense I get about 1.6AC per shown ac...  Hence 62.5 raw ac ~= 4.5% damage reduction.<br />
<br />
Lets figure 5000 buffed hit points(I have more as do some people and some have less) for the first run through on these numbers.<br />
<br />
4.5% of 5000 is 225.<br />
<br />
62.5 raw ac = 225 hp<br />
<br />
ac = 3.6hp<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Using ac = 0.5hp is very very foolish imho for choosing equipment...  I have ~1320-1350 buffed ac and am trying to get it to 1400 for the next jump and I certainly see a *BIG* difference between me and the 1000ac people out there.</div></div><hr />

The Obulus Death Shroud is a huge example. Saving 5.5% (on average) mana to every spell you cast (including canni) blows the doors off of something with 15 more hp.<br />

I say you don't even TRY to quantify focus effects, just pure stats and leave the focus effecting up to the individual.</div></div><hr />
