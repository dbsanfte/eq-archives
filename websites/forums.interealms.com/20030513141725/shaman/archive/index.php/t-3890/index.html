<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taoison</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tis really quite simple, I donno if anyone elce has posted or even done this before me. I'm posative its not a new tatic just becouse its not such a new Game However hopefuly its slightly unknown and I can help a few people out.  First off this is gonna cut off alot of people but you have to be a Troll Shaman worshoping Inny for this to work as Effectivly as most would deem it useful. If you are then Goto Neriak and get your &quot;Regant Symbol of Innoruk&quot; The Clinging darkness necklace.  If you cant do this quest cus of your diety its still possable but not as easy. <br />
<br />
 Now to actualy do this its basicly just like a druid's kiteing cept with a pet. Summon your pet haste and Offenceive buffs if you wish then turn OFF his taunting. start combat with a root on your mob then Malise (if resists are to high) Clinging darkness it with your necklace then stack the dots and kite it once it breaks root send in your pet by this time the dots/root/snare and if you casted it malise should For SURE keep you agroed simply kite form there on out like a druid would do so while your pet follows behind. This dosent give you alot of med time But meditation is just mana every 6 secconds so if you can get it timed right and be sitting on the 6th seccond every time you can regn mana just the same as if you were medding. This is no easy feat to do but once you get use to it its not so hard.  The Snare spell really dosent last long at all but I did this alot in DL and at that level I was useing the dot &quot;Venom of the Snake&quot; The duration of both Clinging darkness and venom are Reliably the Exact same soif you cast venom before clinging darkness then when venom wears off after you recast Immedatly recast necklace. IF you have agro problems with pet Sitting and malise obviously should fix that.<br />
<br />
Seems like alot of work but its same dmg output without having to heal/slow/frail (if you do that sort of thing) or waste mana on defencive buffs for your pet. in the end its alot faster becouse as I said your dealing same dmg you would if you were taking hits. Just make sure you turn taunting OFF on your pet.<br />
<br />
 Hopefuly this is useful :D I tend to have spelling errors so i apologize in advance.<br />
<br />
 Kudos to Cate The Druid, Started doing this after my monk and her did this in Fear. is Quite effective in that manner too we did decent just 2 people in fear killing, slow going but effective. (Course entrence was broken in for us so we had room for such actions)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this will work for any shamy with the use of Flash of Light (or fear necklaces for cazic worshipers)<br />
i started using this tactic in LOIO while i was in my 20's<br />
use blind/root to keep the mob in control, Dot the crap out of it, and then you can even med while the beast dies. <br />
with the fear necklaces its even better. &quot;yo-yo&quot; kite with pet and dots they go down fast and efficient.<br />
(at lvl 48 i sat at the pyramids in DL and got lvl 50 in about 12 hours)<br />
however, if your defense is not maxed id reccomend doing that first =)</div></div><hr />
