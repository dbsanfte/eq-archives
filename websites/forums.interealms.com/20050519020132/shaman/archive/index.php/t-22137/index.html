<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just saw this posted on the Druid's board. Evidently this is the Shaman &quot;bio&quot; from Sony's website.  Now I don't really put much emphasis personally on this blah blah blah, but it sure is a funny read and worth a few laughs: especially the parts about MASSIVELY improving the physical aspects of the group and the MASSIVE damage over time, lol.  It's probably been 5 years since I have read the &quot;official&quot; class descripton and I just have one comment: Gosh, sign me up BABY!!<br />
<br />
Oh, and BTW the way I read this is healing is a secondary skill.  Not that it matters in the least, but I love it when peeps on this board claim that it is the Shamans right to be able to function as a primary healer in all content and point to class descriptions to augment their argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman <br />
Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears.<br />
<br />
Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<br />
<br />
The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster's attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations. An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">diffinate needs updating.<br />
<br />
here`s my attempt:)<br />
<br />
<br />
shaman.<br />
<br />
execel at long distance fights, which is great for old content, but not anything new or up coming.<br />
<br />
master of slow and debuff these nice abilities have effectively killed off shaman at higher levels due mainly to misconception and envy. They have an ok buffing ablility which gets worse at higher levels. but due to the way the game works now to combat the slow misconceptions/envy cant heal well or do much dps. they can solo but its alot slower than the best classes at it, but least they can solo. mana regen is great for downtime but not if you have to keep moving or do anything esle aka ldon, and newest content.<br />
<br />
be perpare to solo alot and be asked for buffs but not groups. only choose this class if you like older content which shaman excell at solo, or if you like just buffing random people and not grouping!<br />
<br />
<br />
(ok its a slightly jaded veiw, but its not that far off)<br />
{on a completely different note, i realise that ryan was a druid! and you know the type that was druid orignally! he has never forgotten how good shaman where taking HIS spot in the group he want ! (the nerve of them shaman) though he could solo amazingly he wanted to be like shaman and be able to solo and group! only he wanted to keep his amazing solo abilites and way overpower shaman grouping abilities, then he got lucky. someon in SOE hire him and he manage to work his way to spells. suddenly shaman declined , druid became better than shaman. he must be a druid! i `m betting shaman declined happen exactly when ryan became spell guy and the rise of druids!}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is the original class description from Kunark (and it hadn't changed up through Planes of Power):<br />
<br />
Shaman. Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primative races. Her primary focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
A cookie for the first person who points out the obvious change. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
The new class description might be more accurate NOW (maybe...I'll let you guys argue that one!), but many people didn't start their shaman under the current description.  SOE changed it from underneath us.<br />
/shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, thats the description I read when I rolled my shaman;  thats what was written in the Kunark book that I got when I bought my first copy of EQ.  <br />
<br />
I think it would be interesting to toss that into SOE's lap and see how fast they try and backpedal from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, the current description is how I've allways played my shaman for the last four years, so the it doesnt seem odd to me at all. I've allways thought that the true power of shaman is their ability to act in a strategic way during fights. Historically I  have rarely healed except in strategic circumstances.<br />
<br />
In more recent years that role has waned somewhat, not so much as a result of healing or other casting issues IMO, but more because we lost the ability the directly tank mobs for any period of time with the advent of the short fight paradigm in PoP. That more than anything else has had a dramatic impact on our strategic abilities, and consequently on our feeling of self worth.<br />
<br />
How you would solve that I'm not sure, but I'm dubious that things like increasing healing by 200 or whatever are really going to change anything. What we need are buffs/debuffs that allow us to regain that strategic role in the new paradigm - using the tools of the old, even if upgraded, are not going to really solve the fundamental issues we face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back in 99 when I created my shaman, this is the definition I remember - not that I paid much attention to the written definitions. Mainly I chose shaman for what I saw of it's abilities in the game - and primarly that was because I wanted to be a healer, but not a cleric (or druid). I didnt chose shaman to be a slower, because people didnt know what slow was then. I wanted buffs and healing. I knew I wasnt going to be as good as a cleric, but shamans and druids then were good enough to be the healer in a group in practically all situations. I spent many nights raiding Plane of Fear in the time before Kunark was released, and I was always assigned a group healer duty. Never once did a raid leader assign me or anybody else (shaman or enchanter) as a slower, even though slowing was something I started doing as soon as I got Drowsy. <br />
<br />
Back then, some people would actually complain about me slowing and tell me I should be saving my mana for heals. They would change their tune though when I stopped casting Drowsy or Walking Sleep or Targar's and they saw the difference firsthand. Then Kunark came along and totally blew the lid off of the class - Turgur's practically mezzed mobs. From then on, we started quietly sliding out of the priesthood and into some other psedo-enchanter-necro niche. It didnt happen immediately because I still got groups for my healing and buffs, but I was also expected to slow as well now. I remember Kunark era as being the most taxing time for my character - trying like hell to keep mana but always being low mana.<br />
<br />
Velious and Luclin rolled around and druids started getting better heals than shamans, and in time slow and buffs became my only duties. And for a long while I was actually relieved because of the difficulty I had during Kunark trying to do all three roles in a group. Part of the reason however, was because I was a slow leveler after Kunark. I had raced to 50 prior to Kunark and pretty much burned myself out on grinding. As I finally started catching up again and hit max level I had the mana and utility spells to allow me to do all three roles again without so much strain - but at this point my heals were now not up to the job. That's when I started to voice my concerns here and through feedback. That's when most people told me I was crazy - 'shamans arent healers'.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying, Purdydog, is that some of us who talk about shamans being primary healers in a group do so because that's how we were made. We just got the rug yanked out from under us, as somebody else put it. Not that I really care if you or anyone else gets it at this point, I ended billing 3 months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
W.T.F.?<br />
<br />
We used to have regular charm (can't remember if it was only during beta), guess they forgot to update that after taking it away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thyrm - Charm for shaman's never went live, they replaced it with Befriend Animal if I remember correctly.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And just as a small tangent on the subject of nerfage and changing class roles:<br />
<br />
Later, Befriend Animal was one of the first of many nerfs to follow.  For some reason, Befriend Animal was not capped by the level of the monster which was a bug, unknown to most people at the time and Verant (before SoE fully took over) beat it with the nerf stick capping it at 19th level monsters.  I don't recall if it was a stealth nerf but I do remember the entire shaman community giving a collective what gives when we couldn't charm Sonic Bats in Sol B.  &lt;wi****l sigh&gt;  Anyways, to compensate, they gave us Charm Animal and said they'd look at compensating the Shaman class later in other ways but did say the Shaman class was never intended to have a Charm series of spells.  Well, months went by and Verant conveniently 'forgot' all about doing something and the Shaman community lost the will to continue bringing it up.  <br />
<br />
It was after this point, pre-Kunark, that the idea of nerfs was introduced and one of the first of many to follow.  <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, level 60 was max for Kunark.<br />
<br />
Charm, originally, was either removed during beta or shortly after release before anyone was high enough to use it.  Also, we had a fire DS at level 50, but that never went live either.<br />
<br />
As for the charm spell seen on vendors later, I recall is was an error included in a patch.  You could mem it, but couldn't cast it.  Then they eventually fixed it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The thing about charm/befriend animal is that they nerfed that ability of ours after having it for a long time. We use to be able to charm animals of any level, and then they introduced the level restrictions effectively eliminating any use for it other then as a toy. It once was of great use in places like Kedge Keep and Fear. We never got anything as compensation for it.<br />
<br />
As for healing, Shaman were the only healers for those races when alot of people originally made theirs. There was no other choice. If you wanted a healer and were barbarian, you played a Shaman. The chances of seeing a cleric or druid back in the day in halas was extremely rare. This continued well into velious where shamans could heal their group fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shaman class:<br />
Tapping into the spirit world has granted you the abilities to speak with spirits and cast their magics on your foes.  Certain Spirits when used by the Shaman's inflate group self esteem which makes the impossible seem possible.  A proper dose of reality which sets in shortly after application, will once again prove: The impossible is just that.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: Spirits, in game beer, will not respond to tells directly. Spirits have a detrimental impact on Non-player characters (NPCs) in ways which are sometimes hard to notice.  If you can not tell, either your use of spirits is not liberal enough, or the spirit you are using is not of the correct type.  Proper use of the Shaman's ability to tap into Spirits will result in a form of euphoria as you accomplish your in game goals.  Certain spirits, namely those which have 'ruined your own land', cause NPC reaction to be somewhat overbearing.  Consider hiding behind a tree or pillar where your actions will go unnoticed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, This is what I read before creating my Shaman.  It was my understanding that a Shaman was the primitive races' (Barbarian/Ogre/Troll) cleric.<br />
<br />
Funny how things turned out.  Also funny how, even under the new descriptions, they use verbage like &quot;Massive&quot; DoT damage and &quot;Brutal&quot; Debuffs.  Actually there are several levels of brutality depending on mitigation status, and the DoT is scaleable, but we'll let you find that out AFTER you've been subscribed for half a year.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah, nice puffery on the adjectives with the &quot;brutal&quot; and &quot;massive.&quot;  If you can't or won't do, at least you can pump out baloney.  After all, since when does reality matter?  It's all about perception, and what you can get away with.<br />
<br />
I know when I created my shaman, I very much wanted to be a healer.  I had been a druid first, and was sick of how everyone assumed that just because druids had snare and SOW, you never needed to taunt off a druid, even indoors.  You were supposed to heal people, but after getting massive aggro from every mob in the vicinity, nobody would bother to taunt off you!  And unlike a cleric in his plate armor, a druid could die in just a few hits from a single mob.  Getting massive healing aggro while wearing leather, and almost never getting mobs taunted off you, was completely nuts.  <br />
<br />
So I wanted to keep healing, and getting more groups than druids did(people used to hate druids -- any druids -- more than some people hate their own spouses). But I didn't want to  be a boring cleric.  So a shaman was someone who could heal but take a hit!  Perfect!<br />
<br />
And unlike a cleric, he could do other things, too, including solo, and even melee!  (I remember the days when shaman melee wasn't a death sentence.)  Sounded like the perfect class.<br />
<br />
And in many ways it was.  But...take out the healing, and you take out the whole reason I took up the class in the first place -- I wanted a healer who could take a hit.<br />
<br />
Uh oh...now I can't really do either.</div></div><hr />

How exactly do you use mokara to fit the new role??  Mokara is a slowbot (where slows work) and buffbot.  I can't remember the last time I saw you actively playing mokara without yella logged on right beside.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, being a shaman you wouldn't know, now would you. Not like you are going to be in the same group as Mok when I'm leveling him (or in Yella's groups for that matter ;) ). And since you play once a blue moon you are hardly in a position to see anything. When both toons are on and active I'm usually playing both, one is neither more of bot than the other. The fact that one is geared as a main and the other is not is totally irrelevant to playstyle.</div></div><hr />

What is really funny I think is the fact that they don't tell you that Massive DoT damage is what the mob inflicts on the Shaman after he casts teh DoT and draws Aggro. <br />
Please don't forget our most Brutal Debuff! Casting Torpor on the Ranger, now that gets really brutal!  ;) <br />

What the heck does this mean?  Does &quot;strategic circumstances&quot; mean healing the tank when his hp are low?  <br />

Gart's been around since 5/99, and I assure you that shaman functioned as healers for a long time.  Slow was simply a tool to help us do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I've said it before on the boards, but I also started my shaman to be a healer. My very first character was a bard, but the combination of lack of gate/bind (always being lost) and the inability to directly heal/buff those outside of group made me want to switch.<br />
<br />
I didn't want to be a druid, there were too many druids! I started a cleric and a shaman at the same time and played them both off and on until level 20. Then I had to decide which one I wanted to keep. At that point, I still had no idea what slow did (or could foresee a future where my role would be defined by slowing).<br />
<br />
I liked the barbarian shaman, I was basically playing her like a meleeing healer with SoW. I also liked the idea of having invis (although that was still in the future). I met some friends, formed a &quot;regular&quot; group that met nearly every night from level 25 to level 50. <br />
<br />
I was the only healer in that group. I was able to act as the only healer until the 50s and Kunark (this was when sup heal was 53 and no stoicism!).<br />
<br />
Anyone that says that shaman were never true healers is nuts, I was.</div></div><hr />

Frankly, I think SoE views us as Healers as well.  1/2 to 3/4 of the spells we aquired in GoD are heals, depending on how you view Slow.  Honestly, with the Ancient Canni being so freakin rare, I almost don't even count it as being something we received.</div></div><hr />

If I remember correctly, Charm for Necro's and Shaman was removed because they only got the first spell in the line, and it became totally useless later on.  Shaman's Charm was replaced with Shrink, and Necromancer's Charm was replaced with Screaming Terror, if memory serves me, both of which happened in classic era... though yes, they did have it in Beta, or at least phase 4, which was the phase I was in (phase 4 sucked, it lasted what, a month?  I remember the outrage when they said people couldn't port their level 40plus beta characters to the launch day of classic).  Meldonox, Gnome Necromancer in Steamfont Mino caves, used to charm my poor little Gnome Wizard very often, even had me kill a few peeps, those were the days.<br />

I wish someone would ST and memory wipe me, I sound like such a doofus.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Shamans are effective healers early on.  It's later in life that we are pushed aside for clerics and druids.  Some of that is perception.  Some of that is reality.  I can be MH just fine for normal LDoN adv.  I am next to worthless as healer for more difficult encounters.<br />
<br />
There seems to be a gap between what Sony sees as our role and the role that we want for ourselves.  We both say primitive witch doctor but interpret meaning differently.<br />
<br />
I agree with the strengthen allies and weaken enemies part.  I would like to see us get spell like clarity except have it be for endurance.  I am still upset about acumen and invigor nerf.<br />
<br />
Poison, disease and curses make sense.  Same goes for spirit pets.  Too bad we can't talk to the dead or make zombies but that would be unbalancing.<br />
<br />
I think we should be able to melee a little better.<br />
<br />
I also see no reason why clerics couldn't be the ones with biggest heals, druids with fastest heals, and shamans with best regen/group heal.<br />
<br />
Charm was sort of fun but I don't miss it much.</div></div><hr />

I duoed with my husbands monk or was the MH most of my first 50 levels.  And then often in early PoP our healer was a druid friend.<br />
<br />
We rarely had a cleric.  But now HE plays a cleric and has forgotten that I was able to heal effectively once, and he is one of those clerics who says that shaman and druids really shouldn't be healers!<br />
