<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Veakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey again guys.  I have another question now pertaining to a named in BoT called Thorolf Sutherland.  On my list of &quot;Things to Get&quot;, Ornate Chain Bracelet is up there because of the FT2 and because it's overall stats beat my current two bracelets.  However, with my current 73k funds, I am going to spend those on getting Fo7 (40k), Quisenence (15k), Malos (5k) and Blood of Saryn (5k).  So I would not have enough to buy an Ornate Chain Bracelet Pattern which goes for 60-80k here.  <br />
<br />
As forementioned, but if others haven't seen yet, I 3-box a 64 stb 65 shaman, 65 rogue and 65 druid.  So for BoT, I will have available a 6600hp/1300ac rogue tank with 180AAs, a 65 druid with harmony of nature, snare, cheals and a 64/65 shammy with what he's got.  Now, on to the questions I have.  I looked up on Allakazam and saw that Thorolf drops the chain bracelet pattern.  But it lacked some info I would like supplied by others if possible, becuse I haven't been to BoT in ages and would like to have a decent idea of what I'm going to get into.<br />
<br />
1) How hard does he hit?<br />
2) How resistant is he to slow?<br />
3) Does he spawn in the same forge/oven room as the wolf named Valabrand so I should set up camp in this room?<br />
4) Do you think I would be able to handle taking him down and farming these ornate bracelets, or should I take a separate approach and either get my EF incorporeal bracets + augs (which'll take considerably longer) or just try to raise more funds to buy two patterns?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any replies and insight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) about 1k<br />
2) he's pretty resistant, like a Kriger<br />
3) yes, take the Middle Earth camp (we call that camp ME)<br />
4) you can if you have an all buddy group who will let you have it when it drops.  The chain bracer seems to be the most rare.  Usually drops silk if its ornate.<br />
<br />
btw, 40k for Fo7 is a RIP OFF!  That spell is like 10k here now.  Price should be equal to Q or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly the ornate bracer isn't worth that much.  The stats aren't that awsome, and with a sham's natural mana regen, FT2 doesn't make a huge difference.  <br />
<br />
I went from FT4 to FT14 in 30 hours due to some very good luck and didn't really notice much of a difference in mana regen... It's there but nothing compaired to the mana that canni4/5 gives ya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's true that FT2 alone will not make much difference.  But, I have to disagree that FT14/15 is not really noticable.  It's like saying you wont notice whether you had KEI (equiv of FT14) or not.  For me, FT15 made a huge difference.  I can now xp in outdoor zones while standing and rarely even  use my drogmar anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Veakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I so wish Fo7 was 10k on my server.  But it's still in 40-70k range.  Quisenence is in the 15-25k range too.  But thanks for the replies, I won't put too much work into it since it's not too vital, but I'll give it a try every now and then for the experience.</div></div><hr />
