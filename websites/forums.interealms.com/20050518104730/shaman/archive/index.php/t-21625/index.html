<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play EQ on dialup... I never had any problems staying connected and don't have much lag... so don't yell at me for &quot;being behind the times&quot;.<br />
<br />
That being said, holy moly!!! This next patch says its going to take 2 hours and 50 minutes to download!!!  And most of it is for tutorial crap that I will NEVER EVER EVER use ... <br />
<br />
This is so WRONG on Sony's part.  There should be a check box where you can choose not to download these zones/mp3s.<br />
<br />
GRRR... man I'm pissed right now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">so.. blame sony for something that they are bringing to us to help people out, but that provides an inconvenience to you because you use dialup.  If anything, you should blame the phone company for making it so that dial-up sucks downloading stuff with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It really should have been an optional download, but then again perhaps the new login ui should have been one aswell...</div></div><hr />

get off your knee's sony doesn't need more oral support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Having an option to not download the mp3s would certainly be nice as many people do not have music turned on (or sound at all).<br />
<br />
As for the tutorial, as long as it is not going to be updated for another couple of years I can deal with downloading it once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the tutorial is actually fun , and i enjoyed it thoroughly</div></div><hr />

its all an optional download friend :)</div></div><hr />

Sure hope you dont fall off that horse of yours will definitely be over 10K damage. You might want to look into the limitations of dialup and the equipment it utilizes before you spout off. Crawl back into your hole or the beta for OoW then you can continue your jovial conversations with the GM's over a bowl of cherries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have dial up, you could have DSL for about the same price, on the same line.  Just say &quot;No&quot; to dial up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I play on dial up too  ( gogo New Zealand! ), and I agree. Nothing annoys me more than having to download things I just do not use, like mp3 files. <br />
I would use the tutorial, but not the sounds files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, dialup from New Zealand here too. I thought I'd got all the dam mp3s when I patched test just recently, but had to get em all again for some reason. <br />
<br />
If I'm not able to patch while I won't be playing anyway, I just play Baldur's Gate for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And you think 3 hours is bad? Geez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hint: Run the download overnight, you won't even know it happened :-) !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Earlier I saw someone else on dial-up say it took three hours. It only took 8 minutes on my cable connection. I was surprised it went that fast.<br />
<br />
Some people can't afford more than dial-up and you can't get dsl everywhere. I myself wouldn't have cable if the company I work for wasn't paying for it. 60 bucks a month is a little steep. Anyway, I hope you still had some time to play after the long download.<br />

<br />
This may be true in the States and Uk but.........<br />
Lived in Germany now 4 years and was on dial up for 3 years as there was no DSL supplier available now ive got DSL but unfortunately stuck with AoL as theyre the only supplier available.<br />
Here also DSL is a damn sight cheaper as you pay a flat fee for the month whereas on Dialup you pay for your calls by the minute so if youre an EQ addict it can cost a fortune.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Four and a half hours for me. 28.8k dialup speed is the BEST the local phone lines will take.  Dont have any lag problems, raid frequently, etc.  Usually use a little over 50% of bandwidth at that.  I've two-boxed completely problem free with 26.4 connect speeds.<br />
Dont assume, however, that dsl is available everywhere.  Two years ago, the phone co said they were 'working out my way'.  Now they tell me it will probably never be available where I live, a whopping 10 miles from 1 dsl station and 8 from another.  Coverage is spotty, at best, in rural areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">...and the problem with Satellite connections is that they usually run only downstreams via air, you still have to use your phoneline as uplink...</div></div><hr />
