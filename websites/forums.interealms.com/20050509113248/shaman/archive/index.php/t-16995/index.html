<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Came from another board. Better to assume it's true.<br />
<br />
========================================<br />
<br />
Augmentation changes for Update - PLEASE READ<br />
<br />
As of our update on October 8th, the Solid Coal of Prowess, Blook Ruby of Understanding, and Ooze-Covered Pebble of Perfection will no longer be valid augmentations. If you had these augmentations bonded to an item, you will find them on your cursor. You can take those items to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE: You MUST have some open inventory space to hold these items! Also, if you zone with those items on your cursor, they will disappear. So when you log in before the update, make sure you have some free space in your inventory. And when you log in after the update, make certain to get those items off your cursor and into your inventory.<br />
<br />
This change is happening due to an issue with some of the new LDoN items. These three augmentations will be replaced with three similar augmentations that fit into slot 7 or 8. Along with that, pre-LDoN items that were given slot type 1 will now have slot type 7.<br />
<br />
Essentially, this will mean no change for those with these augmentations in their pre-LDoN items. It will, however, restrict the use of multiples of these augmentations on LDoN items. We apologize for the changes, but these items needed to be more restricted to help maintain game balance.<br />

/sigh<br />
<br />
Someone still needs a clue, and here i thought, it was getting better with the latest changes. Anyone wants to calculate just for fun, how many LDoN points one would need for a 'unbalancing' full set of LDoN gear with fully augmented HP-additions?<br />
<br />
Hint: we are looking at a number higher than 50.000 ... as in 10.000 LDoN adventures - rofl 'unbalancing'?? what a joke.<br />
<br />
With 2.000 points per month it is only two more years for me to break this game - go me  :rolleyes:. I will admit, hardcore players gather points much faster - good for them, that's the way, all expansions worked so far: more time/better gear/higher skill = higher reward.<br />
<br />
Just curious - chest RvR, adventure difficulty, raid difficulty, spawn bug at ZI, 'adventure too difficult'-bug, collection difficulty ... will be tuned or fixed with that patch? thought so<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your math is off, 50000 points = 981 normal hardness level 65 adventures, a year of play.</div></div><hr />

chain bp have same hp with less ac/stat, not sure if anyone made one yet<br />
<br />
unbalance = a full set of those armor which have same/better stat than element armor; <br />
<br />
it take 100 adventures(~80 hours+) for one element quality item, it take about 50-100 hours worth of dkp in element guild for 1 element armor, for VT and lower guild, very unfair for VT and lower guild who spend similar hours for VT quality item or lower<br />
<br />
after nerf it will have 40hp less but can add 10ac or effect, which is about same as VT quality rather than element<br />
<br />
I don't care how long it take casual player to earn AP to buy loot from vendor, because hardcore player will take similar hour to earn their dkp to buy loot from guild, some cost more hours other cost less, depend on how their guild doing</div></div><hr />

&quot;unbalance = a full set of those armor which have same/better stat than element armor&quot;<br />
<br />
A fully augmented set of top LDoN wont have better stats overall than a full set of elemental. It might be better in *some* stats than VT armor but it sure wont have as good effects. And if a casual player should ever get a full suit - which I very much doubt - it wont really enable him/her to do anything significantly new.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how leaving the augments as they are will unbalance anything in the game. On the other hand it wont matter much if they do change them - it will just be time wasted that could have been spent on some of the real issues that are in the game.<br />
<br />
LDoN has been out for over a month and I doubt that any casual players have even one piece of top armor fully augmented. Would love to hear if I am completely wrong about this :)</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
And boo frickin hoo someone has comparable or better gear than elemental.  Some of us know we're never going to see EP.  So we have to have lesser gear because we dont have the time nor want to put up with the hassle of being in an uber guild? Besides LDoN is a HELL of alot more fun than the flagging process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">unbalance = a full set of those armor which have same/better stat than element armor; <br />
- Please show me the FT on those armor pieces. Or the insane saves, stats. Or the very nice Focus effects. Or how about Aura of Bravery? Oh wait ... you can not. PS, Vindicator BP has better builtin stats/saves and it's a 3 year+ old item. Why isn't everyone so OUTRAGED about that? H-Y-P-O-C-R-I-S-Y is a simple word. Why isn't everyone outraged or Myral's wand? How about Copper Hammer of Striking? How about Obsidianwood Compound Bow? Hell, all elemental bows! How about high end Velious loot that a level 1 n00b can use without penalties? Goddamn hypocrits.<br />
<br />
it take 100 adventures(~80 hours+) for one element quality item<br />
- Bullcrap. And how are you going to pay for Speeding Thought? Or how are you going to pay for Preservation of Xegony? Or if you are a melee, how are you going to pay for Aura of Valor? Newsflash: you can't buy them.<br />
<br />
This is all bullcrap that you can get better than elemental gear in LDoN normal adventure point farming. With the nerf, instead of wasting 100+ hours to get a 140 HP BP + AoB, you are better off getting a few friends and killing Vindicator (45 min gig) for a very nice bp and spend another 20 hours getting a 40 HP Aug. Grats, you will be still using a BP from THREE GODDAMN expansions ago!<br />
<br />
This nerf doesn't hurt at all Casual Joe. Casual Joe doesn't have the time it's needed to get maybe 1-2 pieces of this gear for over 4-5 months time. This nerf hurts the people who raid currently elemental planes or are very close to it. And to some extent time players.<br />
(1) Some guilds have skipped VT/Ssra. Ooops, the best BP they can get is Statue BP. 3 year old expansion. If they aren't doing Time extensively (meaning they are still in lower PoP or Elementals) their BP choices are ZERO or close (some people would count Ornate, I wouldn't it's POS). &lt;----- Itemization problem!<br />
(2) There is NO VIABLE chain/plate bp UPGRADE BEFORE TIME GODS for guilds who took the regular progression route. I am sorry but 99% of the guilds don't farm Rathe cuz it's a grueling encounter, Coirnav drops chain BP once every eon, not to mention, even time plate BP drops a fubar. &lt;----- Itemization problem.<br />
(3) People in DKP guilds who don't want to blow their lifetime &quot;earnings&quot; on a time BP with POS effects think: hey, I got an alternative to my 3 expansion old BP! Not anymore. &lt;----- Itemization problem.<br />
<br />
Guess what? LDoN BPs actually FILLED that itemization GAP. They actually gave people who don't forsee in the near future a BP upgrade to get one and stop using a BP from 2-3 expansions ago. <br />
<br />
But I guess whiny retards in uber-guilds and clueless monkey EQ designers got another win for the system. Screw players more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it take 100 adventures(~80 hours+) for one element quality item, it take about 50-100 hours worth of dkp in element guild for 1 element armor, for VT and lower guild, very unfair for VT and lower guild who spend similar hours for VT quality item or lower<br />
..<br />
<br />
<br />
So that 'unbalance' will not exist for a casual player for 2 more years, or? I don't see the actual problem now and honestly i don't see any casual player spend 2 complete years exclusively on LDoN, so the problem does not exist at all.<br />
<br />
As Spiritblood mentioned, it is debatable, if LDoN gear (stats AND effects together) is even equal to elemental armor. And the casual player (with the gear and experience of a casual player) will need more than 50 minutes (adventure and preparation) on average to complete an adventure. No insult meant, but i think your numbers are too optimistic here.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact, that all adventures, where i grouped with rather high-end-guild players took  around 35-40 minutes at least (i slowed them down :D), not counting 10-15 minutes for gathering and preparation. It's entirely impossible for a casual player to keep up that pace in my opinion.<br />
<br />
'Very unfair to VT guilds'?  - i can understand your feelings, but really EVERY expansion somehow gave players easier access to better gear, so why should LDoN be different here? To look at it from Sonys (possible) point of view, they have to give players some reason to play their new expansions and better/'easier to get' loot always seems to work and it is likely the cheapest way to keep players in the game.<br />
<br />
What we realistically will see are some casuals getting maybe 2, 3 or rarely 4 pieces of that equipment during the next year - giving them a HP increase of 300 or 400 HPs (if they ignore  available effects and other stats at all). That is NOT unbalancing in any sense of the word.<br />
<br />
Quick edit: Let us not go into another uber vs casual argument please. My remarks were pointed at SoE, not to critizise anyones chosen playstyle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually you can. I already have the incoporeal arms and legs and almost have both Tak and Ruj opened for the augments with 1250 points floating. 3-5 adventures per day (~45 min each) and you can get at least one augment a week, if not more.  So much for my 195hp greaves :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe :)<br />
<br />
I guess you cant expect too much of them. Just look at the last request for information about problems with collection-missions. Any sensible company would have the programmer sit down and look at the 5-10 lines of code that comes up with the number of items to be placed in the dungeon. Instead they somehow think collecting name/server/avg level of group/name of items will help them - more wasted time on something that can/should be fixed in a couple of hours max.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it almost feels as if calling them &quot;clueless monkey EQ designers&quot; is an insult to monkies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3-5 adventures a day is hardly doable for 'the little guy' as Naag called it. 2-4 hours every day doesn't really make you a casual player unless you're in Uberguild_008... ;)   Plus, by definition, Warador just called you abnormal.  :rolleyes:  :p<br />
<br />
But to end on a more serious note, Just curious - chest RvR, adventure difficulty, raid difficulty, spawn bug at ZI, 'adventure too difficult'-bug, collection difficulty ... will be tuned or fixed with that patch? thought so<br />
That's the kiddy that I'm gonna be looking for, cos whacking augs without sorting some of the more direct player-affected problems with LDoN would not be appreciated Mr Sony...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How anyone can begin to compare LDoN gear to current gear or EP gear is beyond me.  Hell, I'd rather have ornate gear due to the effects.  Stuff I can get in trash groups in BoT but only if I'm very lucky.  <br />
<br />
Zorlac is dead on, it's not even close.<br />
<br />
Further more, everyone just talks about the time for the one DKP item.  That's also crap, because tons of items drop that would be huge upgrades for lots of folks that either rot or turned into bazaar fodder for huge bank account.  <br />
<br />
So the base gear level gets very rapidly inflated while the top of the line gear gets worked in.  These numbers about time that people throw about are pretty deceptive I think.  Sure, once you have a full set of state of the art gear, upgrades will be slow.  Doh.  <br />
<br />
As for a hard rule that LDoN must never equal EP gear, while it's miles from that level, where do these &quot;rules&quot; come from?  It's a tricky business to freeze LDoN in that way.  I think LDoN will probably require periodic tinkering if they want it to fulfill the function it's currently designed for in the future. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, it will become mostly empty as time passes.</div></div><hr />

I fail to see how leaving the augments as they are will unbalance anything in the game.<br />
<br />
I'm not defending Sony on this, but I do think I see what they are driving at with this nerf.   This 'nerf' isn't aimed at all at the casual player in my opinion. I think it is aimed SQUARELY at the higher end extreme player.<br />
<br />
I have a good friend in the top ten (last time I looked) on my server's Leaderboard.  He is in an EP-capable guild &amp; has something ungodly like 400+ AA's.  He can knock out a mission in about 30 minutes (or less?)with a group of his guildies.  If he slums and groups with people like me (and though I'm not in EP, my gear isn't bad) it takes us about 45 minutes if things go smoothly, which is most of the time w/ an uberpally for a MA. :D <br />
<br />
He has almost every LDoN vendor completely opened up, and he's been concentrating on missions for the 40hp augments.  Replacing his non-EP gear w/ a few LDoN pieces and then adding 40hpx3 augments would enable his total hp to reach levels I don't think Sony ever intended.  If you have 2-3 groups of people who are that extreme about their gameplay (figure you could get 6 adventures per day in 3 hours &amp; still get a good evening of raiding in afterwards w/o burning out), and you can create groups that aren't 'balanced' for certain content.  <br />
<br />
Do I agree with the nerf?  No.  I don't think it will affect casual players very much at all.  I believe the intent was to stop hardcore players (1% of population maybe?) from taking advantage.  Sony has a bad habit of underestimating powergamers, and usually has an even worse method of curbing such players (affecting casual or 'average' players at the same time) w/ nerfs soon after an expansion has been released for the sake of 'game balance'.<br />
<br />
I think this is predictable considering how few 'hardcore' players live on Test (compared to live servers).  The Testers do a great job, but it is extremely hard to mimic a live server population on one abnormal server.  The beta test for LDoN had lots of people playing around in dungeons, but I don't think there were very many who were pursuing high end augment outfitting like we've seen the past month.  I don't think the Dev's expected the hardore players to be advancing as fast or choosing repeat purchases of 40hp augs as they have been.<br />
<br />
That's my 2cp. YMMV :cool: <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm sorry, but I just don't see how this is going to cause all that much of an effect on people.  Imho you're far better off using the type 3 slot for an effect than putting an all-slots 40 HP augment.  For melee, how many different regen/aura of battle/vengeance/utility augs are there?  Are there any that aren't LORE?  For shamans, how many different regen/FT/aura of battle/focus effect/utility augs are there?  Are there any that aren't LORE?<br />
<br />
Granted, I haven't made up my &quot;dream set&quot; yet, but I'm sure you can (in many cases) find something better to do with that type 3 slot than add 40 more HP.  For Time guilds - shouldn't they be keeping almost all of their old gear anyway when it comes to LDoN?  This ONLY affects people who buy LDoN gear, and, in most cases, only affects people that buy several (like, at least 7) slots of LDoN gear.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just tired and unable to grasp the situation properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. the higher end extreme player is unchanged or benefitted by this. Bear in mind, there are new raid-level augments with incredible new stats (+40% damage spell foci, as an example). A higher end extreme player is going to have a full suit of AHR/Elemental/Time gear, and then stick the changed coal of prowess into those slots for another 240 or so hp on top of their already sizeable advantage.<br />
<br />
 He has almost every LDoN vendor completely opened up, and he's been concentrating on missions for the 40hp augments. Replacing his non-EP gear w/ a few LDoN pieces and then adding 40hpx3 augments would enable his total hp to reach levels I don't think Sony ever intended.<br />
<br />
It isn't possible to have 40hpx3 unless he gets one of those ---&gt; *L*O*R*E* &lt;--- any slot augments that drop on raids. You can't equate an LDoN raid drop with something that 95% of the game's population will have access to. You can only have 1 of the same augment in a given piece of armor. The best possible is the sapphire of courage, the coal of prowess, and the ooze-covered pebble for a total of +100 hp/20 mana. The trick is that the coal of prowess fits into current items. Add +40 hp to a 140 piece, and you've basically hit the LDoN max (which only really applies to breastplates, no BP slots have significantly less base hp), while adding elemental resists and foci/affects, which the LDoN armor would have precisely none of.<br />
<br />
 I believe the intent was to stop hardcore players (1% of population maybe?) from taking advantage.<br />
<br />
Your base assumption is highly faulty, so your conclusion is laughable. The top 1% of the game's population is in Time gear, and would never really ever consider swapping in LDoN items, because the result would be a HUGE downgrade in item quality.<br />
<br />
Upper end players are essentially unaffected by the upcoming change. They will still be able to put the new coal of prowess into their Time/Elemental armor slots for another 240 or 280 hp...LDoN people will be putting in +10 AC or +3 resist_all into the slot that the coal would have taken. Whoopty-freaking-do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Well lets look at this from a little bigger viewpoint.  If you would have put all the hp items you can in each type one augment you gain 400 hps and 200 mana.  That is a fact.  The cost is (was, lol) 20,700 points which is 405 regular dungeon wins.<br />
<br />
Now friends, this doesn't look overpowering nor unbalanced.  Hmmmm, ND3 - 12 aa's about 20 hrs (and I'm being real kind) = something like 300hps.  For 100 hps more and some throw away mana 405 wins x 1.5 hrs = 600 hrs (ish). Do the math.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">We can all argue round, and round about who it affects most, but none of that really matters. The only thing I see in a thing like this is that it is typical EQ. It happens all the time, they put something into the game, find out people are actually going to USE these items, and are actually going to BENIFIT from the use of them and decide that they can't have that and throw in some kind of nerf. Now you would think that they would be able to foresee that people were actually going to play LDoN, thereby gaining points. And you would think that they would be able to understand that you would use those points to buy something nice. And that you would use that nice stuff to help make you be more effective. If you don't want us to use something don't put it into the game in the first place and you don't have to hear all the backlash from angry players (actually, paying customers would be a more appropriate description?).<br />
The AP purchaseable gear was one of the things that I thought they got right in this expansion. I was plesantly surprised to see that it was even possible to equip yourself at such a level without having to be in one of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds. No reason why hard work and persistance should not pay off.<br />
However you look at it there is no excuse. Many, many games in developement aimed squarely at the market EQ has held dominance over for so long, one of them is bound to get it right.</div></div><hr />

They absolutely understand it.  They are smarter than the chimps you make them out to be.  This is simple bait and switch.  Market something that appeals to everyone getting more people interested than you could otherwise.<br />
<br />
Then a small number of people (the hard core gamer who has the time) can flash around there newly augmented stuff and further increase interest.<br />

THEN take it back.  Think about the timing of WHEN they are doing this. One month after release.  Long enough to sink the hook but short enough not to add too much good stuff into any significant portion of the population.<br />

Hail,<br />
<br />
I said what I thought after spending all of a minute reading the impending patch message.  It was an opinion post.  Your right to have a different one of course. :)   You were rather snippy about it, but that's your right as well.   :(   Our definitions of 'higher end' &amp; extreme differ.  I didn't say the 'very best geared' players, I said higher end.  You cite the top 1% being in Time, that's not who I am talking about, or I would have said the BEST equipped players.  <br />
<br />
The 1% 'hardcore' I referred to are the players I see who are so extreme about their playtime.  Not all of them are in the top guilds or even in the EP much less PoTime.  But the majority of them are in the 'higher end' of the game, and they to a large degree got to that stage by putting in more time than anyone else was capable or willing to put forth.  Some of them are cash farmers, some of them are into perfecting their avatar, some are trying to 'win' the game, some are into creating an army of characters, etc. and so forth.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not upset about being right or wrong about what this patch will mean.  The half dozen or so cheesy looted stat &amp; resist augments I have should be unaffected. :D  Once we have hard data after the patch we can examine exactly what effect the 'nerf' actually has.<br />
<br />
Whoopty-freaking-do <br />
Exactly.  Hope you feel better about yourself now. :o <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

If that's the case, is it really even a nerf? It sounds rather nice if you can stack 40 hp augs in ornate armor, VT drops, etc... Can you put the 40 hp augs in elemental armor now? I am not entirely clear on what this change does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Is the practical upshot here, that we can no longer put 40 hp augs in LDoN-purchased armor, but we CAN now put them in all of our pre-LDoN gear? <br />
<br />
Not exactly. There are 2 (non-raid drop) 40 hp augments. The solid coal of prowess, and the glowing sapphire of somethingorother. The difference is that the sapphire is type 2 only, and the coal is any-type.<br />
<br />
Leaving aside the wear restrictions (the coal can pretty much only fit in visible-slot armor pieces), it meant that the coal could go in any piece of armor in the game except the fungi tunic, thus making it beneficial to people with Elemental/Time gear and also newer LDoN suits. That's really not a big deal. The big deal (to Elemental/Time geared whiners, who passed it to SOE) is that you can take say the Incorporeal Chain Tunic, put a coal and a sapphire in it to get a BP with +180 hp. A large contingent of the aforementioned whiners felt that doing a hundred LDoN adventures did not mean that people earned the right to wear such armor. They conveniently ignore about a thousand counter-arguements, but that's neither here nor there.<br />
<br />
With the change to the coal of prowess, 1492-level armor in LDoN loses the ability to get the 40 hp that it provided. You can still use the sapphire, so you can still get excellent armor out of it, but not QUITE as good. <br />
<br />
That of course, assumes that there is nothing in the world better than hitpoints, a pretty silly assumption from the get-go. LDoN armor is somewhat better than Elemental/Time gear if you look at it from the molecule-wide tunnel vision perspective that hitpoints are the only thing worth caring about. When you look at VT/Elemental/Time gear in its totality, the arguement becomes ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Just making up numbers (aproximately right, but by no means exact), a full suit of incoporeal chain armor with current maximized HP augments gives 1000 hp. A full suit of visible elemental armor, with an ornate BP (Time BP not a good comparison, owing to difficulty) is 930 hp. Oooh, look, LDoN armor is WAY BETTER! But then we look at other stuff...like foci/bonus effects where the elemental armor gives preservation of xegony, marr's gift, enduring breath, ultravision, see invis, flowing thought VI, right click pox of bertox, right click swift like the wind, and much much better resists and base stats (like +120 stamina, +150 wisdom). Plus, the elemental gear has the option to add another 6 or whatever +40 hp of the any-type augments (currently the coal of prowess, but will soon be whatever the replacement is).<br />
<br />
With the change, VT/Elemental/Time gear will still be able to add the +40 hp that they can now, just the name of the augment will be different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually it's a bit more than that even. You could augment a +30 augment, a +40 augment and a +40 augment into a bp to get a 210hp bp from augments.  The all slot augment allowed you not only to get another 40 hp augment but to stick it into the type 3 slot that normally would be an effect.<br />
<br />
While I can definitely see your augment about compairing it to vt/elemental/time gear. You definitely do loose alot in the way of focus effects and other useful effects from vt+ gear compaired to the1 dementionally hp augments LDoN gear. The situation isn't as clear for melee classes especially tank classes like warriors. For them hps is almost everything and that hps does end up being a better peice.<br />
<br />
Currently it's too early to say what exactly is going to happen with this change. The only thing that seems to be clear is verant wants to prevent this 1 dimensional augment of the LDoN items with multiple slots. There seems to be alot talk about higher end items VT+ or maybe elemental + getting the ability to take more useful augments like effects (eb, extend range etc) and more buyable high end augments for high end peices being added. If that does happen this may end being better overall for the people with access to the high end drops than max augmented LDoN stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortuntely, I think so Ceno.  The 20/20 Aug is one of the three being switched from all slots to type 7, so no go there (the third aug is the 40 mana one from MM).  The 30hp aug is slot 2, and theres already a 40hp slot 2 aug, so that wont work.  If I'm not mistaken the only augs that you can buy with points that add + hps or + mana will be slot 2 (LDoN gear) and slot 7/8 (everything else/time gear) augs.  I belive there are 12 hp slot 1 augs, so the maximun you could add to our chain bp would be 52 hps (total 152 hps).</div></div><hr />
