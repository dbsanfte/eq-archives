<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had a group in Wall of Slaughter earlier today. Me, Paladin, Wizard, Wizard, Enchanter. <br />
<br />
And it was CAKE for me to heal. We even pulled 3 nameds, although the Chanter chain-runed the Pally to keep the damage down, I am still certain I could have handled the healing. XP was reasonable, fun was good, was chain-pulling, pulling 2 with chanter mez-parking. Picked up a spell rune too, although I havent turned it in yet. <br />
<br />
Guess I can stop bitching a while now. I am pleased. The fights were reasonably long (got full Bane every one, even with 2 wizzies). Trushar was nearly enough alone to keep the Pally healed, and she was hardly &quot;uber&quot;, prolly under 9K hps buffed, still needs STA buff to max it. But she does have a Hopebringer, that thing kicks ass. <br />
<br />
All in all I am happy with the expansion, the group areas, the zones. Some nice models, fresh looking zones (Nobles Causway is cool as hell looking), and my whole guild is looking forward to the new Shaman buffs (the melee guys anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have OoW.  Have still yet to kill more than a couple of mobs there however.  My guild just doesn't believe shaman belong in xp groups and the pick up group I got only killed that many after two hours.  For some reason they kept running off and getting themselves killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same here. Was playing main Healer in a WoS group and was able to keep up fine with Q and Tnargs. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind I have no healing AA's either. <br />
<br />
So far I'm having a great time in the expansion. Leveling is slow as hell though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I was at wos tonight.  Was cake healing the little blue mobs, even some white cons.<br />
<br />
We pulled a named red, np there either.<br />
<br />
Then we pulled another named red.  AE FD, stun spin, hit for 2k, group wiped.<br />
<br />
<br />
So yeah, if you are careful you can main heal in wos.  But you can't get the uber named at all.  With a cleric, we would have lived.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well i don't have oow and don't plan on getting it, but even a cleric can fail it's not like have a cleric and nothing can go wrong, did a normal ldon with my cleric 2 days ago, assasination in mmc dungeon, we did great up untill we pulled the mob we should kill, got 1 add and both mobs where chanters so our tank got charmed i think he killed the mage but she died so fast i'm not sure, then bard got mezzed and a bit after that i got mezzed to, was very fun to see my group go down and i could do nothing :(<br />
<br />
With the AE fd and then stun sure sounds nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spent some time in WoS night before, guess I missed all these easy mobs. Got run over by a red named that hit for nearly 3k and was fast as hell. <br />
<br />
Tonight was 70 people in WoS so went and did some of the instanced stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leave them. The very least you should be able to expect to get an exp group is in your own guild. Why should you have to work with pick up groups and level up just so you can buff the raid when they need you.<br />
<br />
If I was in your shoes I'd walk away and never look back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WoS tonight...ran out there with a few friends...2 druids, me (duh...shammy), warrior, monk, rogue.<br />
<br />
ran out of the wall gate, and hey, look what we have here? big bazu named...<br />
<br />
pull w/malos, slow, BoS, wait a bit...spear of torment a couple times, thing goes down. one of druids wins ranged drop, i win spell rune.<br />
<br />

now if i can only find the turn in guy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">im gonna agree with haleice on this one.. if you cant even count on YOUR OWN GUILD for a group, then why should you even be with them in the first place<br />

<br />
Sorry, but your guild sucks. The whole point of a guild is that they weill be there for you and if you cant even get a group with them to help you level, then they dont appreciate you and you will be better off soloing or applying to another guild.<br />
<br />
I mean thats just plain f'd up. You can come buff them on a raid, but they wont help you level so you can get the spells to buff them on a raid.<br />
<br />
F them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I gathered up 6 fine folks and proceeded to abuse them the proper way. Warrior (65)  Mage (66) , Enchanter (66) Ranger (62) Myself as Snoww (66) and My hot box Sk (65)<br />
<br />
We tried out the grand historians Expidition. In Dranik's hollow. <br />
<br />
We are all bazzar geared with a smattering of LDoN or some God easy zone drops. (Ferubi and before No raids)<br />
<br />
We wandered the tunnels for about 3 hours. I got 1 and a half aa. With 2% aa per kill in the full group. My SK who is getting through 65 got around 30 % reg xp. <br />
<br />
No loot other than a few gems of various types. Some small tradeskill (I guess) based drops at one point we thought we might ahve spotted a named so we went there to beat em up. Took out the one but it seemed to be a placeholder. Was headed for the second when I pulled stupidly and got three. 3 resists of slow later I was dead and the group wiped. (I really need to stop pulling when I am the only healer. )<br />
<br />
Well It was midnight anyways and I was tired. But I wanted to get a res for the folsk since I was the one that killed them. Guild clerics (the 2 that were on) were all busy in a deep run in ferubi. So I ooced politly to the zone asking for 4 resses and was happy to pay. I got crickets. <br />
<br />
Finally after 45 minutes I had enough and just offered 1200 plat for the 4 resses so I could go to sleep. and Lo and behold someone logged in a cleric to res us. <br />
<br />
Yay I guess.<br />
<br />
There used to be a time people would help each other out. Sadly that day seems to be harder to see sometimes. <br />
<br />
The instance was okay. really a bunch of long corradors with little visual flavor or appeal. Mobs interspersed with no reason for standing around other than to be killed. To be honest It didnt feel like an adventure. It felt like a First person shooter. And In that EQ has failed for many years. The adventure is gone from that part of it. Hell I couldnt even come up with a landmark or a catchy name for any of it. It was just cookie cutterish. <br />
<br />
Oh mobs hit from 200 to 500ish and 95% were Only mostly slowed. But I healed okay. <br />

This is the saddest part of todays EQ. LDoN and other instanced style events have so much potential, but the just end up turning into Quake 4.75, mow em down and mop em up. <br />
<br />
Maybe they will have some time soon to increase the adventure in this stuff. The task system has potential too, but it looks to be more of a &quot;go fetch&quot; system than an adventure one. Some reports on tasks are encouraging though, if for no other reason than they send people to places that are relatively under-utilized, like Droga, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree I was in a group last night in WoS..<br />
<br />
2 warriors ranger pally wizzy and me I was main slower and healer no problem what so ever..  well pally had to throw out his heals to help a little but hey im only a shaman not a druid 8P....  I only have 11aa's 2 lvl 65 spells..  so im not exactly uber or anything but hey this zone is a blessing a new BoT lol.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wouldn't worry too much about the clerics.  When I logged on last night our group headed over to WoS for more fun.  <br />
<br />
The first night of release there were only 16 people in the whole zone, and we had a blast.  Yes it was easy to heal.<br />
<br />
BUT last night there were 56.  Welcome to BotB.  <br />
<br />
So we invis'd up and headed to Muranite Provingground (sp??).  Found it no problem, had a major scare at the mob guarding the entrance.  Got to admit I slammed into the war's back looking at this thing.  Thankfully, he didn't see invis or we would have been a smear.  Note, if you get agro just keep running. If the Boss Mob is not at the top - keep running.  Click on the wall behind him for entrance to PG. Once in, find the nearest corner and set up there.<br />
<br />
Zoned in, and proceeded to get our butts handed to us all night long.  Group make up - 12.5 war, 9.5K sk, cleric w/big mana pool, bard, enchanter and myself.  All level 66. <br />
<br />
You can handle zin mobs no problem.  So you travel a bit.  And learn these fun things ...<br />
<br />
No mezzing at all for level 66 enchanter.  And lord knows he tried.  So be able to control your adds.<br />
<br />
A named agro'd us through a wall while we had a mob in camp.  Want to know how fast you are going down with a blood red named mob that is an add you never saw coming?  Cleric never knew what hit him.<br />
<br />
Of course respawns, that seem to pop wherever in the hail they wanted.  Big time agro range.  If you can see them, they can see you.<br />
<br />
Only runes to drop were level 68 .. but got to admit we never got more than 4 halls away from zin.<br />
<br />
Balance landed no problem.  On the one name we did finally get dead, drops were decent .. this one dropped an attunable item for waist and a normal rune.<br />
<br />
All my dots went full - but my night consisted of:<br />
<br />
Balance - even slowed these sucks were fast<br />
Malos<br />
dot<br />
heal heal heal heal more heal.<br />
<br />
We all took 4 deaths, and still managed to come out of there with positive experience.<br />
<br />
My take?  Clerics are golden, enchanters may need to level a bit before they go to this zone.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It sounds like this expansion is loads of fun.  Its good to know that we are able to heal here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly I have to agree. Was in Dranik's Hollow last night with some friends. XP was decent, in fact some people in the group were saying it seemed faster than WoS.<br />
<br />
But it was so repetitive with no real goal set in sight. Only 3 differnet models to kill. Bats, Rats and those wierd looking blob things. Which are Undead and the only KoS mobs in the place. So with IVU you can scout the whole zone. After about 90 mins - 2 hours of killing we made about 10% XP and 1200pp in loot. Our Pally scouted ahead but we found nothing special up so quit out. <br />
<br />
After reading up some posts on Allakahzams it seems some of the normal trash mobs are PH's for various named. So you basically just kill stuff and backtrack to look for named. So if you're going there, bring a tracker.</div></div><hr />
