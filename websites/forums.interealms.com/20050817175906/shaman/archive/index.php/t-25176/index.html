<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen some concerns raised in different places about how poorly some subclasses work with 2 of the same in a group.  I have a friend who's playing a 20 mystic and I've been leveling up a shaman as my main toon at this point as well.  Our typical group in other games (I got a late start in eq2 so I'm running behind) has been me, her, and her boyfriend plus any other guildies that are around and want to group.  If I continue with the shaman, then that core half of the group is going to wind up being a mystic/mystic/druid (not sure which sub-class druid yet).  <br />
<br />
Somehow, I've got a feeling that a group with 3 healers, 2 of which are mystics, isn't going to work very well as we move into tier 2+ stuff.  So I need some advice..I figure I need to play something else for a main toon, but the question is what'll work well and still be fun?  The toon would have to have some pretty decent soloing ability as well (I love that I can solo green^^ and blue ^ group mobs with the shaman), since I'm a good bit behind in level and going to have to push hard to catch back up to my friends (thank goodness for quest xp).<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer me any suggestions??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I started late too, when I came in everyone was already in their mid teens. I got my Shaman up to 12 before I realized we had an influx of Shamans in the guild already. (and I was getting the feeling it wasn't something I'd personally enjoy later on)<br />
<br />
So I made a monk and still managed to catch up to everyone by primarly soloing and working quests. I'm level 19 now and I commonly group with two friends both 20. A Druid and Ranger. And I've been the main tank.<br />
<br />
Currently there's a problem with deflection though. So my tanking ability is a bit hindered though I'm still able to Tank. But believe it or not Sony already knows of the problem and said it'll be fixed in the next patch. <br />
<br />
Word has it our tanking ability drops after 20. Though with the deflection fix, who knows what's in store. Besides, you have 2 healers backing you up, it may even things out. And Monks do pump out more damage than a Crusader or Warrior.<br />
<br />
The abilities a Monk gets along with the animations to get with them are awesome too. I love playing in 3rd person just to watch the action. <br />
<br />
As for soloing abliity, I can solo green ^^ and blue ^ mobs usually just fine. <br />
<br />
Best of luck in whatever you choose. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Funny that you should mention that.  I had started a tank yesterday, I just hadn't decided what branch to take in the class tree.  A friend of mine swears that the fighter archetype can't solo jack past about level 13 ( interestingly, his warrior got to a whopping level 13 before he switched to druid..coincidence?  :cool: ) I'm at the stage in the class quest now where I have to decide so I think I'll give brawler a whirl.  Plus I can continue to use my scholar shammy to alchemy up app 3's for him.  <br />
<br />
I'll post and let you know what I see with the toon and if I change my mind  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You are correct that three healers in a group is a mistake.  It really doesn't make sense to have 2 of the same class healer in any group.  However, 2 healers of different classes in a group is a very powerful combination and necessary for some quest related encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, two healers of the same class works just fine if they cooperate well - otherwise no.  I seem to group a lot with Shamans (have YET to group with a Druid, sheesh) and so one of us gets the direct heals while the other gets debuffs and wards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think even if the two work well together, you are simply throwing away too much by having two identical healers.<br />
<br />
Two Shaman will never be as effective as a Shaman and any other Priest, simply because most of the important abilities are duplicated in the 2 Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye. A ward with a reactive heal underneath helps when the mob hits off the ward in a few hits.... as is happening to me at level 24 fighting level 28^^ stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think even if the two work well together, you are simply throwing away too much by having two identical healers.<br />

<br />
May not be as effective vs all mobs sure, but it's not a waste by any means.  For min/maxing purposes yes two healers of different types (actually I'd say that dru+clr should be better than shm+either) will perform better than 2xshm, but the difference will be pretty negligable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You need to play a Cleric and Druid to see some of what they bring to the table outside their unique heals.  You'll quickly see that the difference is far from negligible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So far I have a 13 Cleric and my fiancee has a 13 Druid, so soon we'll start getting the good stuff. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have two characters that I play:  Brigand and Brawler -&gt; Monk.    When I was playing my Brawler, I could not tank crap - granted, her gear sucks.  When I played her yesterday with a friend, paladin.  We were duoing yellow and orange double arrow mobs with us switching tanking.  He would start off since he is level 15, and I was only 13.  At half way, I would start spamming Taunt, and after a few taunts, I would tank the rest of the fight - usually, my friend would be in the red.  :P  But, it was duoable with the two of us.  I guess the point of this is:  brawlers seem to be better than when I first played them.</div></div><hr />

They fixed a bug with avoidance from memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They fixed a bug with avoidance from memory.<br />
<br />
Yes, they did.  And it had a major impact.  At 16 as a brawler I spent 3 hours last night main tanking for a short group (4 people) in stormhold doing blue ^^ caster goos, and groups of 2-3 white and/or white ^ skels.  I died twice, and both times because we weren't watching spawn timers like we should of been and got 2-3 adds on us near the end of a battle when we just didn't have quite enough power to carry through the adds.  And even then we never wiped, even with the &quot;suicide tank&quot; (a term I find increasingly funny) chain pulling every mob I could find.  Of course, I did have a shaman and druid healing for the group, wards + regen = an avoidance tank's best friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A lot depends on the level of the tank.<br />
<br />
I had no problem duo-ing orange^^ skels in TS with a monk. But he was 2 lvls higher.<br />
<br />
On a related note, the tight lvl range is a big annoyance with me atm. You group with a tank less than 2-3 lvls lower and it starts to become an exercise in frustration for less than stellar rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can feel your pain on the level ranges.. the range does widen as you level up, but it's still a very narrow range and the grouping options post 20 start shrinking fast as a result.</div></div><hr />
