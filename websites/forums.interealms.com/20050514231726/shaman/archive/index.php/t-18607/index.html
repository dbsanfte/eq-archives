Melee Enhancement, part 2<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Melee classes are currently enjoying the first part of the improved Melee system and the feedback we are receiving has been great.  Early in 2004 we plan to move forward with the rest of the melee enhancement, the reaction abilities.  The enhancement gives Monks, Rogues and Warriors the ability to use special skills in response to a mistake made by their opponent or an exceptional move of their own.  This enhancement will be in addition to the existing system, allowing players to use the skills for more involved game-play and to improve the abilities of their characters.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A more detailed explanation and the transcript of a chat with the EQ Live team about the system can be found on the Developers Corner.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Graveyard Zone<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Tired of losing your corpse?  The current EQ system removes corpses from the game after a week to reduce clutter and potential video lag.  But we know there are times when your character dies and you just can't get it right away.  Next thing you know a day turns into a week and BAM!  Your corpse is gone.  Since we can't leave the corpses sitting in game indefinitely, some inventive folks here have come up with another option.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We plan to create a &quot;graveyard&quot; zone that will only work if your corpse has decayed and disappeared.  If you have lost your corpse due to decay in other parts of Norrath, you will be allowed to enter this zone and reclaim it.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Tradeskill Interface Upgrade<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Tired of all the clicking and dragging needed just to make a type 1 wood arrow?  We know that the current tradeskill interface is cumbersome, so the UI guys have come up with some new ideas.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface.  In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently available to you.  This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as some above it.  Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion.  Clicking the &quot;combine&quot; button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the results on the player's cursor.  The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination.</div></div><hr />

Most games don't have a lot of original concepts anymore. If it hasn't been done in another MMOG, it's been done on a MUD somewhere. What's important is that the developer does a good job of implementing solutions to problems in their game. SOE's got a fairly good track record of implementing game improvements like this, so don't knock them for making the game easier for players. I'm glad they're taking the time to address tradeskill issues and mechanics, myself.<br />

I like the idea of keeping players from messing up their wrists (and no there it is not the fault of the players for not having the proper posture, repetitive injuries are just that caused by repetition) but the new Graveyard idea is just another element that has dumbed down the game and made it less of a challenge.</div></div><hr />

The reason why corpses decay is so that they aren't left around zones taking up space and getting in the way. The Graveyard zone will allow people to retrieve corpses without worrying about forever losing their gear. This keeps players happy and less frustrated, so it's a good move. Also if you do something really stupid and can't get to your corpse because, I dunno, a dragon or something is sitting on it, you can play an alt for a week while you wait for the corpse to pop. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, that's what Necros and SK's are for...summoning corpses. <br />
<br />
Actually, this works really well if u go LD and then your computer dies. Of if you have a sudden emergency in middle of corpse run and you just have to join RL for a little while becuz EQ just isn't as important as what may be happening around you.<br />
<br />
I like this GY zone thing. I've never lost a character but I can imagine how much it would suck to lose everything on one of my characters simply becuz EQ had to take a back seat for SEVEN WHOLE DAYS out of my life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will be interesting to see this zone: &quot;They were stacked liked cordwood!&quot;<br />
<br />
Also curious how long they will keep corpses in the graveyard-graveyard? There has to be a time limit considering folks still decide to leave EQ by dieing in some remote zone to some uber mob and never playing again ... or deleveling first and leaving a string of bodies throughout Norrath, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I suspect it'll be an instanced zone, and when you enter, you'll see only your own corpse(s).<br />
<br />
I don't really see this as making things a whole lot easier overall.  Nearly anyone would make a valliant effort to get their corpse back over waiting a full week for it to pop to the global graveyard, I'd think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's new for EQ.  Face it, not many ideas in life are truly original, so bashing someone for using an existing idea is a bit harsh.  There are some people that will never be happy, and that's what those types of posts (attacking Sony every time they introduce a feature that's new to EQ) indicate to me.  I guess the bottom line from me is, if you can't think of anything productive to say, keep quiet.<br />
<br />
As to the changes, they sound great to me.  I really don't care about the corpse one, but now I'll probably do some of the tradeskilling I'd always pushed off because I didn't want to sit there clicking all day.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As far as the graveyard being an instanced zone, you realize that they'd have to set up this zone for every single character that has a corpse, right?<br />
That's a LOT of system resources, especially when you count the number of people who do quit by dieing.<br />
In all honesty, I'm not sure how they'll pull this off.  My guess is that they add it on to character data after the corpse decays and add it to the graveyard zone once you zone-in.<br />
Again, that's just a guess. Nobody but SOE knows how it will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As far as the graveyard being an instanced zone, you realize that they'd have to set up this zone for every single character that has a corpse, right?<br />
<br />
Well, I figured they'd only have to set it up for every person who's currently getting their corpse, which should be considerably less than every person who has a corpse out there...  Just like LDoN - they don't make a dungeon for every single person in the game, just those that request one.  The rest of the corpses are just in a database until needed.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm curious how the current tradeskillers view the upcoming changes.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping they spend a bit of time thinking about how the recipies will appear. I could see a few ways of doing this:<br />
<br />
<br />
a)  ALL recipies up to a certain skill level (say current lvl +20) are visible.  You just have to buy the required items and click away.<br />
<br />
b)  The system checks your inventory and displays only the recipies that you have ingredients for. <br />
<br />
c) The system only displays recipies that you have previously attempted (or succeeded).<br />
<br />
If I was a master tradeskiller I would be concerned about method A (which is what it sounds like they are going to go with).  Knowledge is power, and currently only master tradeskillers have that knowledge.  I would even suggest that their knowledge is more valuable than their skill rating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thank you for playing DAOC. (which has a much better tradeskill system) <br />
<br />
With all due respect - you are on crack.<br />
<br />
DAOC does NOT have a superior trade skill system.  What DAOC HAS is a money sink that is also time - consuming.  Oh I suppose you just happened to forget that?<br />
<br />
Skill-ups? Yeah DAOC has them. Their system runs to over  1 - 2 - 0 - 0 <br />
<br />
Now gentle reader, what the aforementioned DAOC fan boi forgot to mention is that at the higher levels (think 600 +) it's not 'click' and 'combine'. Oh no, no, no, no.<br />
<br />
It's 'click' read a book, watch t.v. do sit-ups and push-ups, comeback and do it again. In other words - <br />
<br />
HUGE time sink.<br />
<br />
Well I don't know about you - but while the nuances of 'whack-a-mole' aren't close to zero brain activity - simply clicking to combine is. <br />
<br />
If you play simply to craft (hardly immersive) then play Craftizons. Frankly, I'd rather set my hair on fire and put it out with a sledgehammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">regarding the graveyard zone... some of you seem to have missed the part about only corpses that have decayed (as part of the current corpse decay rules) will be in there.  this has little or nothing to do with graveyards in pop zones...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy its more like, whats up with Honda not putting wheels on the cars till someone else was going to do it. Its not stealing, its poor imagination and lack of drive to give the consumer what they want till your forced to up the level cause now they have a choice.<br />
<br />
Far as im concerned this is good. If SoE is sweating, that means they think the games coming are good. I dont need to say why thats good for me do i?</div></div><hr />

true but 1-600 or so wasn't too bad and it doesn't appear eq will have that extremely boring wait 20 minutes for a combine function.</div></div><hr />

/shrug.  You don't have to use it.  You can always re-equip yourself from scratch if your body decays.  As for me, I'll be grateful for it, though I have never lost a corpse and never plan to, sometimes things happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Heh I remember when you could not pick up multiple trade items, and you had to use that obnoxious slider to buy and move stuff.

<br />
More efficient use of developer's time would be to make the 8th shawl droppable or sold on LDoN vendors or something.  I think the lionshare of tradeskillers around are doing it for that quest.  I know I have not clicked combine for anything but gate potions since I got mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Curious how this will actually work. The comment about &quot;... skill level as well as some above it&quot; concerns me. Baking comes to mind and the rabid skilling with fish rolls then patty melts. If these are not in the &quot;some above it&quot; category then the whole point is missed - at least for me.<br />
<br />
Will just end up doing it the 'old-fashioned way.'<br />
<br />
First impression, even suggesting only certain recipes based on skill level tells me the same developer(s) who did the LDoN vendor item listing is doing these changes ... and thinks the LDoN vendor listings are just way cool. Hasn't dawned on them yet that everyone now knows what each vendor has and which are the best adventures for them to concentrate on. Likewise, we know the recipes ... why cloak them with an upgrade system but then allow the old carpal tunnel system to be available to still do them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>PBTNidoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Here is an idea for the new Grave Yard:<br />
<br />
Make it a morgue with an NPC.  You zone in or go to the morgue, hail the NPC and if you have a corpse, you pay him a fee say... 500pp then he will retrive the corpse from the morque and you can loot it.  Make sense to get corpse(s) from morgue right?  :D <br />
<br />
This way, there won't be a bunch of corpses lying around that you have to look for yours.  Also cost you something to get it instead of total risk free.</div></div><hr />
