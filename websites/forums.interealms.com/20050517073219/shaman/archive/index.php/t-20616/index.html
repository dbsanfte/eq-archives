<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jarcey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well seems that SoE has decided to have thier own class boards...<br />
perhaps easier to see class balancing issue's, or what ever reason they may have or need....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wonder if we should just repost some of the better analysis / summary / petition posts over there. We could probably find enough decent posts to keep the front page occupied for a month or so with old material only.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tugela's already infected that board with his stupidity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm afraid to look.   Those boards (any class) is going to be a headache.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah no kidding, its going to be like reading the castersrealm boards, 90% people that don't have a clue how to play the game and the other 10% don't bother posting because the newbs will just turn a good post into a bunch of steaming crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Semi private (non affiliated?) Boards always end up with much better discussions and alot less of the l33t d00d fan b01 mentallity. I'm sure whoever is in charge of ignoring the players over at sony is aware of this as well, and will take great pains to implement stupid changes that amount to crap based on those morons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol, pretty funny<br />
<br />
Another example of: if you wait long enough everything comes full cycle. I wonder how long SOE will keep class boards up this time? Anyone interested in starting a pool?</div></div><hr />

You're such a sweetie ;). I could equally well say the same thing as you you know, the game you describe has never existed from my observation :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From your observation? I fail to see how you can &quot;observe&quot; things from a shaman's point of view unless you actually play one to greater capacity than a bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You're such a sweetie ;). I could equally well say the same thing as you you know, the game you describe has never existed from my observation :)<br />
<br />
Maybe because we play a shaman and you box a shaman for your warrior main?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think i've said this in the past, I'll say it again: the only time I bot is when I'm duoing, and then its just as normal for my warrior to be botted. It all depends on the situation I facing with whatever project I'm working on. <br />
<br />
I don't play my shaman as much as my warrior, that much is true, but when I do it is in real groups in the same places that you play. I see the same things you see. How does the fact that one of my toons is flagged as a &quot;main&quot; by my guild affect that? The only difference between me and you is that I come from the perspective of seeing the world in multiple ways, whereas you have a very one dimensional view. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely not true.  I will see MORE issues by playing my character 100% of the time vs you who will only see what you wish to see .. in other words when you're bored or sitting LFG for hours on your shaman you can just say to hell with it and fire up your warrior for instant group.<br />
<br />
I have played:<br />
enchanter<br />
druid<br />
shadowknight<br />
warrior<br />
<br />
I know what other classes can do,  not only have I played them but I group with them daily.  Does that mean I am going to go over the druid board and tell them that they don't need CH to be useful in a group?   NO<br />
<br />
Does this mean I will waltz over to the chanter board and tell them the charm nerf was 'no big deal stop whining' .. <br />
NO<br />
<br />
I contest, sir, that you know only as much about this class as you allow yourself to see from your warrior perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Or it comes from dedicating all our energies on the one class, and focusing on learning all the nuances of that class ... approaching it as a whole new class, not just a support-bot you play when your friends have no use for your main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't play my shaman as much as my warrior, that much is true, but when I do it is in real groups in the same places that you play.

<br />
Now that is funny.<br />
You now gonna tell me that you play your Shaman in Kod? In Ikkinz? In Yxxta? and in Uqua?<br />
<br />
I think you maybe see those zones with your warrior, and we all know that any decent warrior has no issues at all in those zones <br />
<br />
The only difference between us is that I try to fix the issues I see with my shaman in those zones while you feel uber because you can keep someone alive in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If it helps us get attention on what we need, then im all for it. Stupid people or not. Just need to have some well thought out posts over there, i dont think the devs and SoE are stupid, they will listen to a non-flaming, intelligent debate. Well, i can hope anyway :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure they will listen to us Litgruv.<br />
Will you be playing Horde or alliance by that time  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which one is Tauren ?  Horde?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">what makes anybody think that that board will be any different than this one? other classes posting there? what's keeping them from posting here? the only thing that i can see being different on that board compared to the Crucible is people will post there when they want to say something 'LOUDER'. i guess it's nice to have a board where we actually think the dev's are reading it because it's sponsored by SOE.<br />
<br />
praise the Crucible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">no IGE banner ofourse. NOW they will listen !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
( that was a joke )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tugela, do us ALL a favor including yourself and just stop posting. its painfully obvious to everyone here you have virtually no clue how to play a shaman and have just as much insight into what is wrong with the class as a whole. you are actively trying to keep this class from getting any of the help it desparatly needs and you play a shaman...basicly you are trying to nerf yourself. <br />
<br />
to me that reeks of troll. why else would you continue to post such drivel? if you acctually have a shaman then you would want to see the class improved, there isnt a good argument for shaman to try and sell the &quot;we are fine as a class&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
and that nonsense with the math and how mobs do 20% more damage with chanter slow vrs shaman slow? yeah get over it, that was bad math 2 years ago and its still stupid.<br />
<br />
this is the first expansion that has made an entire CLASS obsolete, not gear, not play styles, an entire class is left out in the cold with this one and you are fine with that, wonderful now do us a favor and keep your joyful bot duo to yourself while the rest of us try to become a GOD worthy class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">omg warriors were fine with no snap agro because they had defensive~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jarcey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">well im gonna say it gets their attention... look at what the rogs got... and go to the class board and they have the most posts under thier class...</div></div><hr />
