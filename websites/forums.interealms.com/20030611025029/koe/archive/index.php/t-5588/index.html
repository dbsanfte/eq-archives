<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's the link to the interview<br />
<br />

<br />
Here's a snippet from the interview:<br />
<br />
GS=Gamespot --- JS=John Smedley<br />
<br />
GS: What do you have to say to players who claim that Legends is an elitist service? Shouldn't everyone who subscribes to EverQuest get the same treatment? <br />
<br />
JS: I wouldn't want to characterize it as elitist--it's more for an audience that's looking to get a special kind of experience. <br />
<br />
<br />
----&gt;  Oh, I see, and those who pay $10/mo. are just looking to spend all their RL time on a mundane, ordinary experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a couple responses from the forums:<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
Dear God... beating up geeks for their lunchmoney just entered the 21st century.<br />
------------------------------<br />
&quot;Time and money spent developping this premium service could and should have gone on improving the basic game for ALL.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
I posted my 2 bits, and my personal response to John Smedley's comment is:<br />
<br />
ROFL - I guess the prison-love you're giving your 'ordinary' customer base could be called a 'special kind of experiance', but not a good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think all of us who have spent time playing this game since it first came out should be put on the Legends server for FREE. I don't know, maybe Verant could show some appreciation for loyal customers. Oh geez, what am I saying?! Verant show appreciation for all us addicts? Apparently, my additional addiction to crack is starting to affect my thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>XunilTlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">JS: We're trying to provide much more of a tabletop RPG experience to our Legends customers. We really want to try to have people feel like they are part of a world that's changing at a much more rapid pace. In fact, players will feel like they impact the world in a much greater way. For example, if players complete a specific dynamic quest, they could end up getting a sword named after them. Eventually, that sword could find its way to other servers. How cool would it be to have other people getting the &quot;Sword of (your character)&quot; and know that the epic adventure you had on Legends is what led to that item actually being created. That's the level we're going to go to. It's going to be absolutely mind-blowing.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Grrreat...just what I've always wanted:  A &quot;Sword of Sowmeplzdood&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Brell Serellis was the 'unofficial' RP server when it came out, they never would make it official, but tried to encourage RP on that server.   I moved to it on opening day, creating the Human Paladin 'Arcadio' (a vague reference probably only Dahrc will get) and a gnome named Stankee (lol - last name was gonna be Whistlebottom).   <br />
<br />
Lasted about a week until it was overrun with the likes of 'Dewd Sohpleez'</div></div><hr />
