<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khashik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm in a position where I do most of my exping 3 boxing a Shammy/Cleric/Ranger. Its more efficent than grouping for me due to my odd play times and frequent afks. Also, when raiding I frequently box the cleric. <br />
<br />
Since archery isnt a viable form of attack for me (see above), I have decided to go the defensive route, then Archery/Melee.<br />
<br />
I have CS1, CA1, ND3 at the moment, and plan on doing PE next and then maxing Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes. <br />
<br />
2 Questions:<br />
<br />
1) Is it worth the points to max Combat Stability and Defense?<br />
<br />
2) Where should I look to exp with the above AA's and group? Currently have access to PoV/PoS/BoT and soon to have CoD, HoH and Tactics. (1200 AC / 6000 HP buffed)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I cant help you with your first question, since I am an offense oriented archer-rangerette, but I can offer advice on the 2nd one. <br />
<br />
Based on the zone access you have I would recommend an alternative route to experiencing. Endless quiver would be ideal for this, but once you have that its a great alternative to melee 3boxing. <br />
<br />
Aggro kite in HoH. Basements are all good, zonein and hero temples are good too. Aggro kiting has some advantages:<br />
<br />
1. You can specialize in being an offensive ranger that will make you more effective on raids. You can focus on archery and SCF to increase your raid dps.  <br />
<br />
2. Mobs in HoH dont summon so kiting is easy. <br />
<br />
3. Most of your cleric/shaman's mana can be used to nuke and kill faster instead of healing/slowing for you. Keep shaman and cleric on a horse for more mana. <br />
<br />
4. In HoH if you rootpark human guards til slowed, you will be able to tank them easily without needing CA3-LR. So you can work on getting EQ/AM3 and then start aggro kiting. <br />
<br />
==========<br />
Try the following strategy and see if you like it:<br />
<br />
Go to HoH, set up in one of the trial basements in a human guard room. Summon a bunch of arrows just to test 1 round with archery kiting. Harmony split 1 guard. Snare, flame lick 1-2 times. <br />
<br />
Send shaman pet and cleric pet in. DoT stack with shaman, Cond/SoP with cleric. Flame lick/snare generates insane aggro, so  casting it a few times a minute you'll keep aggro on you easily. <br />
<br />
Kiting with Frozen Wind, Brushfire will let you generate a decent dps on top of what the shm/clr/pets are doing. If you kite on a horse you will have more mana too Once you get AM3/EQ archery will add a substantial dps on top. <br />
<br />
Time your test run and see how fast you killed the mob and how much mana you have left on your toons. Compare it to a melee round on another mob. I think you'll be suprised. <br />
<br />
And remember, offensive AAs are FUN. Defensive AA are booooring. :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are going to 3 box I would say do ambi and ferocity for offensive those 2 give a nice dmg increase.  You cant go wrong putting points into cs and ID because they do lower the damage taken and less dmg taken means less heals from your cleric.  As to where to xp try them all and see what works best for you.  Bot really seems to be the best overall xp spot. tactics pit can be nice but lots of roaming mobs and that group isnt the best for crowd control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For your setup I think PoV would give the most low risk consistent xp for yourself. I would definately max out both CA/LR and CS/ID. Those skills are going to be fundamental in how far you can go three boxing.</div></div><hr />

/agree.  That's why I'm glad I got am3/eq first.  If I had spent 45 aa's and only had 250 more hp, better mitigation and such, I'd be very mad at myself.</div></div><hr />
