<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The subject says it all, I'm looking for people to come to Burning Woods on Friday with me, 7 PM CST, to camp Burning Embers, which is the 3rd to last item I need for my epic, and the last one that does not require a raid force.  We also have a shot at Wurmscale Cloaks, which is a very nice resist gear item (not sure of exact stats).  One group is more than enough, although if more show up we can split up into two groups.  The hardest part is location the placeholder as it wanders.  It's also very good exp for the 45-53 crowd, but higher lvl people are welcome.<br />
<br />
Please meet at the BW zone in Dreadlands, and post here so I know who is coming.</div></div><hr />
