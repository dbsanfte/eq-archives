<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hehe.. well after months of checking this site every day from work to see if I could buy one.. i finally got my SEOC in hate on Friday night.. we got into hate.. and what do i see on track.. INNO!.. but .. to my disgust there's another guild already there and have already cleared first floor.. then after a few minuites my guild leader announces that the raid is still on.. that the guild in before us are only after ashbone drakes.. woopii.. well i really wanted to hurry up and go kill inno since the whole first floor had already been cleared.. but.. monk asks if we wanna pull rancor who currently had no adds around him.. i didn't want to waste time with that but we pulled him anyway.. my group got the kill and what do i find when i loot.. :) an SEOC!!. which i got awarded.. boy was I a happy ranger...<br />
<br />
anyway.. sad for the other rangers that were there.. cuz we went up and killed inny who did not drop the stone.. so i guess i was really luky</div></div><hr />
