<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Forza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's a good level for a soloing ranger to start the Ivy quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lvl 22 I believe for the bracers, then it goes up from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mrchiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I needed help to kill Meldrath at 35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think I need help with Meldrath at 45.  That little dude is rough.  Forza you might just want to farm the cash and buy the ivy armor in bazzar.  It's dirt cheap now.  Unless you are one of the crazy people that still enjoying quests.  Are there still people like that in the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, yeah, I would be one of those.  But I saw an Ivy Etched Bracer for sale on Sullon last night for 150 plat. Since the emeralds run about 100, or are in zones and MObs I can't get to right now, that seemed like a good deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>loKase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I was one of those crazy people and it truly was an excellent experience.  If you are new to EQ, have a Ranger and want to improve your ability to play the game do all of the Ivy Etched quests.<br />
<br />
I started at level 27 and was able to do the bracers on my own.  <br />
<br />
I definatly needed help with Meldrath in Steamfont - one nasty little caster.<br />
<br />
Maldyn in Rathe Mountains is an elusive (rare) spawn but fairly easy to take down.<br />
<br />
Windwalker in OOT was also a tough spawn, but once you figure out the technique for making him spawn it is not that bad.<br />
<br />
Slathe the Slayer in Lower Guk was not hard to kill but the 3 Minataurs that guard him are nasty and its hard to find someone on the light side to help you as most higher lvl peeps are in the dark side (luke I am your father...)<br />
<br />
The hardest part of the full set of armour were the boots - alot of faction work and you need 2 Granite drops from Mistmoore.  I finally figured out the camp in mistmoore after dying many times.<br />
<br />
All in all these quests produced some of the most exciting fights I have had in the game.  Apart from getting some nice armour these quests really teach you how to play EQ effectivly from researching the Mobs, to forming a game plan to gearing yourself appropriatly for the camps.  I am now 47 and am working on the Tolan's armour now (anyone have an extra BP - cheap - lol) but I still am wearing a couple of the Ivy Etched pieces.  If for nothing else the Ivy Etched makes for good resist gear for raiding.<br />
<br />
Hope you have fun and smack Meldrath upside the head for me when you see him. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Forza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Lokase.<br />
I printed out the walkthrough.<br />
I don't mind buying stuff but I'd rather quest for it. It's what makes the game fun. I have about 10 more levels before I start it. I can't wait. Thanks again to all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>forsaken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wiltin can be brutal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daeric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wiltin is definitely brutal. I only play for a few hours at a time, so I can sit for a game day or 2 waiting for him. <br />
He's the last thing I need for my leggings and he's annoying the heck out of me. I know you talk to Lt. Leafstalker in Kelethin between noon and 4pm (so I read) then head out and wait. Apparantly I just don't have enough time to wait the hour and a half between game days 3 or 4 times to get him up. Ah well, aside from the waiting around, these are kinda fun!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Buvin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 22 if you find a small capable group you should be able to take down Redwind without much trouble.<br />
<br />
I was 22 when I looted that rune from his dead corpse. We three in our group, a Druid to harmony pull his cronies one at a time, and a warrior to tank and myself. Was a cake walk. Just don't have the druid pull Redwind, nice little harmtouch he opens with with scare the puss out of your poor druid friend. <br />
<br />
If you do want to wait a bit, fine. You will hit him harder if you wait till 27. Beyond that you should probably be able to solo him by 30 if you can't find a group before that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Poster-01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 45ish you should be able to solo most of them yourself, The only problems you might have are Meldrath and the brownies, Wiltin should be able to be done with a few arrows. Tarskuk should be pie.<br />
<br />
Hope i helped.</div></div><hr />
