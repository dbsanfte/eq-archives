<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When killing the emperor, what key piece do you get exactly?  Is it a staff that summons 40 pieces?  Those pieces dropable?  You think high end guilds will start farming them for plat?  You think noobs will be sitting in VT shouting &quot;Looking for 80 ac warrior bp PST!!!!&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zenok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">once the high end guilds get the pieces they need from emp, they'll move to VT and wont bother w/ emp until they have to.........that fight takes so much effort it makes AoW look laughable........any spare pieces will end up being saved for new members......<br />
but yes they are droppable and tradeable, so theoretically, u dont need an emp key to get the VT key.....if u have a way to get one of those pieces.........imo they'll never be sold off for plat........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm lead to understand that the loot off of Emperor is kind of good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They'll still kill Emporer.  His loot is that good, even compared to VT loot.    Yes the Power Sources are droppable (you get 2 stacks of 20 per kill), but you won't see any guilds selling these until they have farmed the crap out of VT and have moved on to PoP.  Even then they may not.<br />
<br />
You may disagree but no guild is going to sell keys to VT to their competition (anyone you sell keys to is now VT competition) while they are still hunting in VT.</div></div><hr />
