<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>clailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know exactly how you feel though not in that aspect. Its the age old conflict between enchanters and pullers. I havent played for a few weeks but last time I did I got the runt of the litter. So I was in KC, no clerics availible so I tell the druid to heal. Cool- works out great. Puller/tank is laggin like crazy and needs to debug. Logs out and I tell monk- you pull. <br />
I waited and waited. *it was only a few minutes but I impatient and I do know how to pull since I end up soloing some times* I say to druid- Pulling the Skelly WL- brb. I pull it back, root before it gets to me and tell the monk to start the beating down and I proceed to begin the nuking process with the wizard. Well... monk just stands there and says &quot; *** are you pulling for? You should be mezzing and paying attention&quot; <br />
We took down all mobs pretty easy and after a while I call med break. Monk starts saying &quot;You would have mana if you had been pulling&quot; about then warrior comes back, invite him in, he starts pulling but KC is just about empty- the spawn fight begins. <br />
So we were gettin probably 1 spawn every 2 or 3 minutes and I say &quot;monk, please pull or I will again, we need more mobs&quot; Monk &quot;I cant pull like a caster can, yall just cast a spell than run, I have to go actually get agro&quot; <br />
Me &quot; So you havent noticed that my health bar goes down every time I pull? I dont have room for any pulling spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
So then he disbands, we get a good big ogre tank. Soon after that an interesting conversation pops up and I join in, adding my 2 sense. Some how on one of those he found ground to start insulting my enchanting skills. *shakes her finger* bad idea.<br />
Every chanter in the zone stood be hind me on the pulling issue. Everyone else was asking him why he wasnt pulling. He got owned but people like that just make my skin crawl. He had the gall to call me EBAYED! *sniffles* OH THE HORROR ebayed...<br />
oh well thats my story- <br />
<br />
*note* I did remember to make sure everyone was buffed so he cant complain on that one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Domandred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Clailya just so you know...one of the BEST pullers I have EVER had the privilage of working with was an ENCHANTER.  Just kept lining up mobs for us melees to knock down.  Rocked hard on the exp and had very little downtime.  Took one at a time but with constant no stop fighting with no adds because the chanter was pulling and parking before the mobs could even think about adding.  Generally we had 5 mobs waiting in their little line to be killed.  Drop one, move to then next till we got the the end then start at the beginning again.  Chanter didn't have to tell us which was next because like I already mentioned the poor mobs were standing in line waiting for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mezumiiru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree<br />
Enchanters are mad pullers. I love it when you get them lined up like that... makes me so happy. <br />
Don't sweat the *******s. Chanters are teh win ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raeber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree that Chanters are among the best pullers, spent a good 3 hours fighting non-stop in DL one day, the chanter had them all lined up nice and neat for us :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>clailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love my new spell fascination! VERY low resistant AE mezz . I have gotten to the point where I will just run, pull a mini train, hit the tank with it, step back, hit fascination, then go back and 96sec mezz em. It takes a bit more mana but its fast and safe.<br />
<br />
I love rangers in my group. Just get a harmony for those hard to pull areas and bam- insta mob. Then there is the sow factor =+).Rangers are truely the best pullers. Monks are mostly PLVLed buttmunches, warriors are normaly big classes so unless you have shrinky then they arent going anywhere fast, pallies.... pull trains that are toooo big, then proceed to kill them selves while they attempt to tank.  LOL I have been in all pally groups and all ranger groups and seriously- its awesome to have an all melee group with just a chanter or a shammy or something.<br />
<br />
hehe P.S- sorry for hi jacking the thread</div></div><hr />
