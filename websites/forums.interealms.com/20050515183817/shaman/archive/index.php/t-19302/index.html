<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, i must say i am very disapointed with the lack of support for improvement to shaman (except from shaman) from alot of other classes, perhaps i am wrong prehaps other will post their support, but i have now gone from excitement , to concern to despair.<br />
<br />
but now i have decided to stop worrying, it is after all just a game. and although i will have some regrets if the shaman is shafted again and noone outside the shaman comunity cares, i dont have to play a shaman.<br />
in fact i dont even have to play eq. Amazingly i never thought i would stop playing my shaman let alone eq. But SoE has manage it. Not straight away, i am in a guild that just got to ep so, despite my lack of anything really important  to do on raid or in groups  i will continue living of our reputation for aslong as i can, but at the moment i will not buy god, and will probably play my beast because , well its more fun.<br />
<br />
bottom line is not the debates or what anyone else thinks rightly or wrongly, but my enjoyment at playing  a class, and for shaman i have lost it, and i think for alot of you that is the crux, enjoyment to playing a shaman, you like me can see it fading, and rebel against it.<br />
<br />
but as things stand there will be atleastast 1 shaman that will appear less often and eventually fade from memory.<br />
<br />
edit... i just realised , if i wasnt in aguild, i would likely stop playing my shaman now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do not feel that you are important on an EP raid or in an exp group, then you are doing something wrong.  Shamans do need a few improvements, but I have never once felt like I was useless.  I have felt valuable and I know for a fact that I have been valued by my guildies all the way from Velious to PoTime.  If you feel you do not have a role to fill, then perhaps shaman just is not that class for you.  I don't mean that in an insulting way, either.  We can almost always find a niche to fill, but if you don't enjoy being the RGC-bish or a blast healer or AE healer, then you should consider a new main.  We are exceptional at powerleveling, no one can deny that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">but what do you do that really important? i mean REALLY important?<br />
and slowing healing doting and nuke dont count cause if you werent there some other class can do these. i assume you still find it fun?<br />
and i really want you to think about this and give a serious answer if possible, this is not a off the cuff remark. you might be able to chance my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sorry, when you did cast MBG focus, a mob mitigated your slow and a mage overwrited your malos, what are you useful for?<br />
<br />
Shrug, either give uss heals or dps, that's the only 2 things that matter in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is no one class that can only do one thing,<br />
3 classes get track<br />
3 classes get FD<br />
numerous get pets<br />
numerous can tank<br />
numerous can heal<br />
numerous can slow<br />
several can snare<br />
<br />
what one REALLY important ability are you talking about that one class gets that absolutely no other class gets? please tell me... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Man I can't believe that you don't see the value a shaman brings to a group.<br />
<br />
I always amaze groups on what a well played shaman can do. Last night in POV I was rocking da house<br />
<br />
VP - is an amazing form of CC, add comes in to camp I would knock it back clear out of camp and root it<br />
<br />
SC - everyone loves our puppies<br />
<br />
DoTs - man I can lay the beat down with Bane and Saryn<br />
<br />
SLOW - man when I slow a mob it turns em into kittens<br />
<br />
They love my buffs<br />
<br />
<br />
Groups love me and they love a well played shaman. <br />
<br />
Problem with you is you believe all the negative posts from the whiners. The fact of the matter is no class in EQ is all important - we all need each other - it has been designed that way. It's an MMPORG<br />
that means massive multi player<br />
<br />
You think you don't have an important role???????????<br />
<br />
ummmm slowing is the most powerful ability in the game!<br />
<br />
You think were one dimensional?<br />
<br />
ummmm try being a warrior, hit attack button hit mob<br />
rogue - attack button, back stab hit mob<br />
cleric - heal<br />
mages - send pet in, nuke<br />
should I go on?<br />
<br />
What is more important than slowing???<br />
<br />
I have news for all the negative people and all the whiners, EVERY class has beefs! Every class can be improved.<br />
<br />
If anyone doubts the power of a properly played shaman, come see me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">but what do you do that really important? i mean REALLY improtant?<br />
<br />
Remember that you could say the same thing of every class except clerics and warriors.  What does an SK do that is important?  Cast their aggro buff on the MT?  If you're in EPs then you probably have BoW's with AngerIII procs on them and only a total fool is going to overaggro regardless of the buff.  What about mages?  They coth you to coirnav and rathe, that's about it.  Mod rods are about as important as MGB blessing of replenishment.  What about wizards?  They get to cast spellshield on mobs with nasty DD procs, but other than that they just nuke.  Rangers?  They take turn sacrificing themselves for a weaponshield pull.  Rogues? /attack on until you win.  /corpse if you lose.<br />
<br />
Obviously I am exaggerating a bit, but I hope you get my point.  You can't expect to look back on a raid and say &quot;I was the MVP of that raid - I'm a hero&quot; just because you are a shaman.  If you want people to juice your nuts about how important you are and what a great job you did, consider playing a warrior or cleric.  One person should never make or break a raid.  You are a small part of a large raid, but even still, you'd be amazed at how much of a difference you can make.<br />
<br />
I'll just run through every mob in pofire, since that's probably the zone you'll be spending most of your raiding time in:<br />
<br />
Charm Birds - They are a joke and no one is important on this fight except for the secondary and tertiary tanks to take over when the MT gets charmed, and the clerics because they have to pay enough attention to switch.  After the slow, I usually try to dot and nuke until it is about time for the charm, then I /assist the bird and try to keep its target alive until the next tank has aggro and the clerics have their rotation going.  I have saved quite a few casters who had a poorly timed nuke with my blast heals, and I help contribute to keeping the tank up.<br />
<br />
Quavonis - This is also a pretty boring fight once the novelty of shadowstep wears off.  Lots and lots of /assist blast heals.<br />
<br />
Babnoxis - A shaman is absolutely vital for this mob.  Babs has an AE mana drain with poison counters.  Your primary role will be to keep all the clerics cured with nadox, and in between AE's, use disinfecting aura to cure any melees/casters who are close to death.<br />
<br />
Magmaton - He's basically just an AoW on crack, and there isn't much for us to do here.  I usually make myself useful by blast healing the MT or RT (I think he rampages?  been a few months, but it might be flurry instead), but some shamans prefer to dot and nuke.  I've been over the healing vs. damage thing for raids a billion times, and I assume you're smart enough to make your own decision.  I prefer to heal, so that's what I do.  More than a few times, I've landed a crit tnarg's for 3.4k on a tank under 10% life.  That could quite possibly be a raid-saver, although it is unlikely that anyone will notice it was you that did it.<br />
<br />
Blazzax - I love this fight, because I love AE's.  They make things much more interesting.  After the slow (I think he's slowable - again, it has been a while), I park myself right behind all the melees and just start healing.  If MGB heals are off and just don't get cast, you can save quite a few people.  A quiescence or AA'd tnargs more or less cancels out one blazzax AE, so every person you heal is someone that might not die.  Even if MGB heals are landing when they are supposed to, there are always the low-hp gimps to heal :)<br />
<br />
Arch Mage - It isn't so much shamans that are important here, it is RGCers.  We have a bonus of not being as susceptable to the mana drain as most people are, since if we are completely oom we can just canni5 and we've got a workable amount of mana.  In my guild, every druid or shaman with RGC buddied up with a cleric.  The RGCer's job is, of course, to cure the cleric first and then himself.  Every time, though, there would be some RGCers who are just plain idiots and are incapable of curing their cleric in a timely manner.  I took it upon myself to cure any cleric that called out for an RGC.  Whenever a cleric said &quot;need RGC!&quot; I was 3 out of 4 times the first person to hit them.  After a few kills, I was no longer buddying up with just 1 cleric.  I had three (plus myself).  Through a combination of fast reaction time, fast typing, and a 23% beneficial haste item, I was the person that people trusted the most to RGC them promptly.  When I left the guild I did EPs with and came to my current guild, my current guild took a night off to just fool around in EPs.  Arch Mage was one of the things we killed.  I had three clerics in my group, a rogue, a druid, and myself.  The druid somehow died, so I was left with the three clerics to cure.  I kept them all cured and near full mana.  When the fight was over, they all thanked me and one of them even said something in GC about how well I did (I was still a fresh recruit then).  That was a good feeling.  Obviously, this isn't something specific that only a shaman can do, it is something that I personally took upon myself to excel at.  If you can find something like that for yourself, you'll find being a shaman (and everquest in general) much more rewarding.<br />
<br />
General Reparm - Mithaniel Marr on crack.  He has the highest damage output of any mob until you reach VZ in time.  The best thing to do is slow him as soon as possible (even a mitigated slow is a HUGE difference on a mob that does this much damage) and then blast heal your ass off.  It isn't a glamorous job or one that you're likely to get praised for, but you'll contribute a lot if you can save a tank from getting two-rounded.<br />
<br />
Fennin - Slow and cripple the bad boy, keep the clerics cured, and help blast heal (unless doting and nuking is your thing).  Keeping the clerics cured if they stray too close to the AE is VITAL.  If you're attentive, you can help out a lot.<br />
<br />
I think I'm gonna stop there before I go off and describe every mob in EP's :)<br />
<br />
I really hope you get my point, though.  Shamans are a very versatile class that can do a lot of good in just about any situation.  We usually don't make or break a raid, but then again most classes don't either.  You just need to find a niche and fill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">but what do you do that really important? i mean REALLY important?<br />
<br />
<br />
  I work for a living and support my family and my sister's family.  I lead a good life and don't do drugs.  I take walks at night down country roads with my wife and dog.  THESE are important thisg REALLY important things.  A game is not important, things you do in a game are not important, and it doesn't mean squat when it gets down to it.  I am sorry you don't enjoy your class anymore.  Choose another and try to have fun and feel as tho you have a role in the game.  Good luck to you.  If you don't find a class you feel is important then play something else you can.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yep thats what i figured now (above post). and likely i will, just all the time and effort that i put into a great class to see it not change as the world around it change, i feel that shaman are like t-rex`s , we where at one time king of the world, but we havent adapted for the new one and will eventually die out. <br />
<br />
it is my opion therefore not nessecarrily fact (though i think all shaman agree to some extent that shaman calss needs tweeking)<br />
<br />
( post 2 up)i pointed out 4 main functions of a shaman , you point out a couple per class, this didnt change my mind, i can see where other classes help more, most can aid a group and  decent dps while fighting a mob alot of which you didnt mention. for instance barring coth mage do great dps fast. rods are still useful, summon items are still useful. they can debuff with malosinia. but are still important for coth when can for late commers etc. the same applies to other classes , but i feel to a lot lesser extent shaman as explained below.<br />
<br />
shaman do contribute to groups and raids, but really very little in a fast paced fight. in a longer paced fight they can add more, but this is old world. and we dont live in alot of long fights anymore, and the new expansion show no sign of going back to long fights. shaman are designed for large amounts of input over long periods, not sort.<br />
<br />
only fights that i feel i really do help a raid is the named in vt, which are compareable longer than the ones i done in pop. or ldon.<br />
<br />
i must change the title i am not beyond caring, but i am beyond wondering maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">only fights that i feel i really do help a raid is the named in vt, which are compareable longer than the ones i done in pop. or ldon.<br />
<br />
Give EPs a chance, it's where raids really start to get fun and interesting.  Before we broke in to EPs, I honestly did find most raids boring.  It only gets better after EP access.  The harder fights get more and more fun (but then again I'm a psycho that enjoys Rathe), and in Time I really have a blast, and so did most people I know.<br />
<br />
If you read through my previous post thoroughly and none of what I said sounds appealing at all, then you probably did pick the wrong class.  Happens to lots of people.  I'm lucky because I randomly picked a class when I made EQ and it turns out that I completely loved it, and still do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no i picked the right class for me when eq first came out, i picked the class that i wanted to play, i didnt want to be a cleric, but i liked the idea of being able to heal, i didint want to be pure dps,i want to be able to melle, not as good at a melle type but better than a cleric/caster decent but not great and enhanced by our dots and dd , we didnt have tank hp or ac so slow made up for this but also helped groups, i like the idea of buff and enhancing groups. i wanted to have unqique ablilities and as primary class be best at it by a good deal.<br />
<br />
When i first started that was  what a shaman was , not the best at melle,dps,or healing, but amazing at buffing and debuffing (slow etc), but still good at the other parts. all in all a very balanced class at the time. (thats not to say other werent unbalanced at the time for over or under power)<br />
<br />
now we have no mellee abilities really, our buffs just arnt the group enhancing spells there where, our dps is very situational. (ie long fights)<br />
our healing has become totally appalling. <br />
<br />
No i choose the right class, just SoE change it to a point it is not the class i choose to play. the change was gradual, but has now got to a point where the class is not what i started. (and it wasnt just the solo ablility, though that was handy when you couldnt find a group, i actually liked grouping and did so most off the time soloing wasnt the reason i choose shaman but as mentioned above)<br />
<br />
If i started today, i would be a beastlord most likely(no healing the only down side, but you can pretend with yer pet, in some ways i see the beastlord as  what the shaman orignally seemed, and could have become). it suits what i want to be, but at the time a shaman was it. but i have still played a shaman for over 3 years and found the first 2.5years really fun. but do i want to still play a class that has change so much form how it started 3 years ago? <br />
<br />
I come to conclusion no, it was only with GoD that i really thought about it (well thought abit before) with the horrible stuff they came out with i suddenly saw just how much the shaman class has been changed, and not for the better (in my opinion)<br />
<br />
The shaman class is not the same class i started and i dont like where it has gone to. (and it has nothing to do with relative power, but the way i like to play)<br />
<br />
perhaps if i had started after lulcin i might not think like this, but i probably would have been a different class too:) <br />
<br />
This also might be why opions vary so much, newer shaman who still play the class well just dont know what the shaman used to be like as us old timers do. (though maybe some prefer it the way it is, it is all personal preferences)<br />
<br />
oh and i will give ep a try as i said :) i will continue abit, i still remember the fun i had. but i think a new main might be the only way to go.<br />
sorry for all the edits, but i think it now says what i feel. this should probably be the first post:)<br />
this my last post on this thread anyway, poeple see skills in different ways, but i know for  most is just pride in  a class and not truth. however if you still wish to play a shaman and buy GoD thats up to you, its your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">but what do you do that really important? i mean REALLY important?There is one ability which we get that no other class in the game does: Virulent Paralysis. While some may scoff at this skill, saying &quot;A ranger can just as easily pull agro with snare, run away, and root a mob.&quot;, that costs your group and or raid DPS.<br />
<br />
This is most noticable in a zone like Vex Thal, when you can root an incoming Eom long enough for you to slow it while enchanters mez the qua and zov's. In places like tactics, I've had Virulent Paralysis has save the raid during the Fake RZ fight.  It takes time to gain agro and move a mob somewhere, or to get it mezzed, but with virulent paralysis you can just blast it away from the clerics and out of harm's way, long enough to get it under control.<br />
<br />
I've done hard LDoNs with only root for crowd control, and Virulent Paralysis does such wonderful things as interrupt CHing/Gating level 66 mobs, splitting pulls, and all sorts of other good stuff. I honestly can't talk enough good about this skill, but if you get it and make good use of it, people will greatly appreciate it and see the value of having you along :)</div></div><hr />
