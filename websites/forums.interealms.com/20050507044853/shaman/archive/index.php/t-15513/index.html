Pets can pull better than any level 65 toon. Trust me. My dog single pulls from places where I'll get 3<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
What exactly is the technique for doing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol just saw someone make this same post in the tactics section wich i suppose is a better place~<br />
<br />
delete or lock i guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, the pet can walk right over a NPC and no get aggro, but thats aboutit, you cant really use your pet to pull better in most cases, not to mention your pet will still get aggro from mobs close once the mob is engaged in a fight in alot of cases. Im not saying it never works but its certainly nothingt o rely on. On the same note though, i tend to pull with malos then sick pet on while i slow, or Q pet and send him in to build aggro before i slow if he has mage weapons,  or if im afraid ill get a root reists on a split i can send puppy or spirit call in to keep the other mob busy while i get the first undercontrol then come back to the secon or 3rd in some cases and get it under control.  Thats the only truly dependable and effective use of pullies that i know of. I think anything else is kinda luck or making use of pathing well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, I basically do the same thing Litgruv does. Malo - when the mob gets about halfway to me, send pet - then slow. If I'm trying to split mobs, I'll usually root one and then send pet and/or spirit call on the others. If root is resisted, then I just have to deal with it (dont have virulent paralysis yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe creative use of the way a pet taunts can be used to pull.  However, I don't know how it would be better than someone just casting on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my guess would be that this is a creative use of the pet hold command, and the use of the fact that pets do everything at max mellee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oh yeah i forgot to mention that he said he had the aa for it<br />

Name: Pet Discipline <br />
Level Requirement: 59 <br />
Ability Type: Passive  <br />
Max Training: 1 Levels <br />
Point Cost: 6 <br />
Description: This ability allows the Shaman to control their pet better.<br />
It enables a new command '/pet hold', which prevents the pet from moving or attacking under any circumstance. <br />
<br />
The pet will break from this hold mode once any other command is issued to it. You will need to re issue the hold command after any pet encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually.  If you send in the pet long enough to draw aggro from the creature, then you activate pet hold and tell it to sit there...<br />
<br />
<br />
  In THEORY (aka - just me rambling) the pet will only DIRECTLY aggro the one mob, since it quits hitting real quick.  Then when the pet dies, possibly only the one mob that it hit will run back to find you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This may be a variant of the pet pulling technique I saw an SK use in Torment the other night.  He would agro 3 mobs and run back to his pet skelly parked near but outside camp.  The pet would agro one of the mobs, the SK would FD, and only the mob engaged with the skelly pet would stay.  The others would not join the fight with the pet because the owner was FD.  Not sure how this concept would apply to the shaman /pet hold, but there it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What about sending in your pet and then summoning it back to you?<br />
<br />
You could also send in the pet, then invis. You will loose the pet but the mob will come after you. He won't pass the hate list because you'll be invis.<br />
<br />
Just a thought<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Summon wont work if the pet is on the hate list. You get a message that the pet &quot;has the attention of mob_X&quot; or something similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Notgurck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What about sending in your pet and then summoning it back to you?<br />
Can't summon a pet once its engaged, so it would take great timing of the summon companion spell, and assumes you wouldn't fizzle.  The fizzle adjust on that spell seems really high, along the lines of acumen.. Considering we only got the spell as an answer to bad pathing it should, IMO, be mana-free &amp; not fizzle much if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok as a mage I use pets to pull a lot of places.<br />
<br />
First you do need pet hold to get it to work and it dose have a few limitations.<br />
<br />
It works like this you send your pet in to the mob you want to pull as so long as there is no other mobs in close agroing range when the pet swings you only agro one mob but as the pet is neutral you can bring that one mob past countless other mobs without ever agroing em. <br />
<br />
I have been able to use this to pull some very nasty pulls without and add for pinny in kedge keep to vindy and the Diane.<br />
<br />
One thing I did find out is if your pet dies you get the agro and you’re not neutral and you can say hello to a good train/summonsed splat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm, I have gotten aggro before by siccing my pet when he had taunt on.  Maybe it's a proximity thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bazza, where do you hit /pet hold in that process?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The way it must work is you send pet in, as soon as the mob hits your pet you /pet hold then summon the pet :) I don't have the aa for it or I'd try it somewhere in Sol Ro where the aggro is insane (they assist).. would be cool if someone tried it and told us =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">actualy if you spam /pet back off and get the timing where the mobs hasnt hit him when you summon, itll work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">try pulling with a 34 pet, he will get smoked in 1 round of combat, and the mob &quot;should&quot; run to you all alone, and always turn taunt off for stuff like that.  Pets have some weird aggro rules, or bugs or whatever, so in theory they can pull stuff PCs normally cant as easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Only on mobs the pet can outright kill. Anything you cast that normally draws aggro will piss off the mob's friends. But if the dog can kill it, you won't get adds.<br />
<br />
I'm still not sure if I like the &quot;new&quot; way pets act, in that they don't generate aggro. I sort of miss the look of fear on people's faces when the mage says, &quot;Hey, where's my pet?&quot;<br />
<br />
(I may consider EQ way too easy now, but I like leveling regardless. EQ was a hard game to play once, in case you youngins didn't know that. Back when lguk loot was tha ****, and dragons were raid material.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just to clear a few points up the pet dose no get summonsed at any time indeed as stated before if the pet is on some ones agro list the summonsed companion dose not work any way.<br />
<br />
You also can’t spam pet back as this will not stop the pet hitting back when hit and there for agroing near by mobs.<br />
<br />
Thankfully pet agro range if very small and if you can get only on mob agroed on your pet you can pull it past all the mobs mates and kick the ever living out of it without the mobs mates even knowing what happened.<br />
<br />
As to when you hit Pet Hold as soon as you are sure the mob is agroed i.e. as soon at as the targets hp drop to 99%.<br />
<br />
My top tips are cast sow on your pet so it has a chance of getting out in front of the mob and so will not get so badly owned. <br />
<br />
You can pull just about any thing that will not kill your pet outright even though mage pets are much stronger than shaman pets with good use of re rowth and the like you can keep you pulling pet alive long enough to get agro with your slow ).<br />
<br />
Best to try it out a few times in places you can ether zone/gate/easily get a rezz till you have it down. But there are still some zone/mobs that have a funny agro/assist set up that act very oddly and still do when trying to pull with your pet but still I solo piny with my mage (the get a add and gate/die class) with careful pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Seems like putting a pre-pull Q on the pet would help too if the pull is fast enough.<br />
<br />
A question about /pet hold, however.  This is the description of the skill:<br />
<br />
--------<br />
It enables a new command '/pet hold', which prevents the pet from moving or attacking under any circumstance. <br />
<br />
The pet will break from this hold mode once any other command is issued to it. You will need to re issue the hold command after any pet encounter.<br />
---------<br />
 I dont have this AA yet, so I am asking if this description is wrong.  It seems from the description like the pet would stand still at the mob once you hit the AA, then if you did /pet follow to come back to you, the /pet hold would be cancelled and the pooch would fight back.<br />
<br />
Still not clear how /pet hold allows you to pet pull, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If not mistaken the pet hold command prevents your pet from taking any aggresive action till told to do so.(Exp: /Pet Attack)  It will still follow all the other commands like Follow, back off, Sit, Stand, and maybe Guard Here.  I believe the reason that you're able to pull singles where other wise you would not is due to couple factors.  Pets have much smaller personal agro ranges and your able to stand at much further distances thus lowering your own agro.  You'ld still have to follow certain pulling technics.  As this really just gives us one more option to pull with.  I personally use my pet to pull mobs that like to hide around corners I am unable to cast spells on with out going up and killing them.  I just stand back and sick pet.  Once pet aggros him I just start spamming the old Back off key till the pet returns.  If your outside its even easier as you can cast sow on your pet enabling him to get back to you faster and out of range of the mob.  You just have to work at it.  With the added help of the Hold command you'll just not have to spam the back off key as you would other wise have to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Pet hold works like this...<br />
<br />
When you hit pet hold when your pet is not attacking your pet will follow it last command but not hit any thing it would normally do such as a mob hitting it or you.<br />
<br />
When your pet is fighting some thing and you hit pet hold the pet will come to you or your last guard spot. So as long as you have the pet following you when you hit pet hold the pet will return to you.<br />
<br />
If your are going to use your pet in any raids or camps with AoE mobs pet hold is a must for keeping the pet under control. It a key AA for mages beasties and necros and still very useful to the shaman community I would have thought.</div></div><hr />
