<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I love the sence of danger I get venturing out and having my post put up for ridicule on the board, but here goes =)<br />
<br />
I have a question about gear for pre topor 50s shaman.<br />
<br />
Currently I have JB BP and Fungi, as well as mostly artificers armor.<br />
<br />
Question, at this point, is there no real point in upgrading my armor, because the only thing that will make me better is level, and therefore fewer resists?  I have an oppourtunity to get a Vindi BP possibly, and I am wondering if that is an absolute waste, because until I have topor, i should wear the fungi and grind for exp?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Entirely a personal choice, level is going to be the single biggest thing to improve you, yes. Fungi is going to make that grind easier, yes. We have pre60 shaman in Vindis, don't forget AoB has a small regen effect.</div></div><hr />
