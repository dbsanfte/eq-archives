<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Welp, at least some of the shaman whining has dipped a bit with some of the new changes.  I was never one to find my shaman lacking in anything.  I have quite a few characters.... a 65 shaman, a 65 monk, a 61 ranger, a 57 wizard, 50 beastlord, 35 necro, etc...  3 of those toons are pretty damn powerful, with a 4th toon knocking on the door.<br />
<br />
So I've seen the many sides of classes, and trust me --- monks and wizards are hard as hell to level up due to their group desirability.  Never really had a prob with my ranger for some reason...<br />
<br />
I can play all these toons very damn good.  You'll never get a complaint about my monk's role in groups, he can pull like a mofo and then do some serious damage in-between.<br />
<br />
I can --- with a straight face and brutal honesty --- say that not one of my toons kicks as much ass as my shaman, and the higher the stress-level, the higher the danger --- the more the shaman goes supernova.  Some of the stuff I've been able to pull off with the shaman has been nothing short of amazing, including tanking/soloing the final 10% of a HoT dragon after it had wiped the raid and having less than full health and mana.  One dragon standing, one troll standing --- sit down, Mr. Dragon.<br />
<br />
Most of my playtime is 2-boxing my shaman and monk, who I consider to both be my mains.  The monk is good at damage, pinch-tanking, and of course, pulling.  Very strong character and fun as hell --- but when the **** hits the fan the monk can pretty much do damage 'til he can no longer do damage and then save his own ass by FDing.  Meanwhile the shaman is standing in the middle of all the carnage trying to work miracles as he's getting torn to bits.<br />
<br />
Last night, the shaman did it again.<br />
<br />
So you all know about those high risk LDoNs? Where ya need a full group of level 65s, including an incredible cleric, super-beefed-up tanked, and some helacious DPS... and the mobs hit for 1000, mitigate slow, and usually have to be pulled by only a monk or bard? Make 1 mistake and you can lose the entire adventure?  Okay, so if yer PoTime geared, this doesn't apply, but to us mere-mortal, casual players high risk adventures are pretty damn tough.  This is our big-leagues.<br />
<br />
A crew of shaman and monk (2-boxed by me), pally, cleric, warrior and necro were blasting their way through a high risk EF adventure last night. We got to the halfway point (45 mins) having achieved 16 of 26 items, which is actually pretty damn good.<br />
<br />
That's precisely when a nasty storm rolled through the NE part of the United States, effectively taking out the necro and cleric for the rest of our adventure. They went LD, never to return... although the cleric remained on the phone with the pally keeping tabs on us and tried repeatedly to log back in. I also had received a few messages from the necro via EQIM that he was trying to log back in, but neither of them were able to make it.<br />
<br />
Normally in a high risk LDON, when yer snarer AND cleric go LD, you sit there and went for them to return. However, we received news quick that these 2 might NOT be returning, period. Having had such a good start on the adventure (and being one win away from getting my new haste aug), I bucked up, said to the tank &quot;you ready? Pog is gonna be yer new healer&quot; and started the chain of pulling again with my monk.<br />
<br />
We plugged away for 30-35 mins, taking out as many as we could. Pog was like an over-clocked, overheated processor, fizzling and crackling --- every mob that we pulled he had to malos, slow, and cripple and then strain his hardest to keep the tank or warrior on their feet and trying to keep buffs refreshed. Definitely pushing the limits of his abilities. Shamans aren't built to heal in high risk LDoNs.  These dudes hit for ~1000 and mitigate slow.  We're not talking Karnor's Castle here.<br />
<br />
But we were doing it. At one point, I even fooked up and pulled TWO mobs. Somehow we pulled that off without a death (although a big drain on mana) using root and the shaman's dogpack of war.<br />
<br />
With about 20 mins left we went to a system of my shaman debuffing and throwing Heals-over-time while the pally medded to heal the warrior while the warrior assumed MA duty. We just kept chugging along slowly, taking one mob down at a time, and thanks to a fortuitous drop-rate, we were getting closer and closer to an improbable victory.<br />
<br />
Finally with 10 mins left, the necro came back and barely had time to get his pet up when the last mob we killed dropped the 26th and final item. Success! With 10 mins left!<br />
<br />
That's right --- 4 toons (no cleric or druid or true-CC) collected the final 10 items in a 35 min period. One mistake --- even one death --- would haved been our end and we managed to pull it off. It was probably the best 105 points I ever got.  The 3 of us were ecstatic for what we had just pulled off.  Any other time, we woulda packed our bags when the 2 went LD...<br />
<br />
The shaman was the hero of the day... even with very good single pulls by the monk and tanking by the pally and warrior... what the shaman was doing (healing, debuffing, buffing, CC, and extra DPS) was effectively doing the job of 3 characters.  No one there thought that the shaman could maintain that level, and for that matter even keep a tank on his feet against a single 1000-hitting mob, let alone allow chain-pulls.<br />
<br />
It was astounding.  The warrior said &quot;How the hell did we pull this off?&quot; and the pally responded &quot;it was all about the SHM powah.&quot;  And the warrior /nod'd in agreement.<br />
<br />
For us mere mortals down here in PoP and high risk LDoN, the shaman is still a very powerful being and this is proof of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i see people complain about shamans in high risk ldons all the time, and it never ceases to amaze me. i get requests for hard ldons all the time, and i find myself doing a LOT of useful things when i'm in one. people tell me all the time how much they love having shams along on hard ldons. so where are the complaints coming from? mob mitigates slow? big deal! bottom line is mitigated slow is better than no slow. malos + turgur's, have cleric or druid stick to direct heals, and i keep Q going on MT. keep the others hasted, keep replenishment on us, sprinkle FA, direct Lassie to timmy and the well, dot from time to time, etc.<br />
<br />
the only thing i DON'T do is run out of mana.<br />
<br />
piece of cake.<br />
<br />
<br />
another important thing to note: if you're a tank or puller doing hard ldons, it's very important to be well geared. as a shammy? pfft. 2500 hps and 1k ac unbuffed. all baz gear except for shoulder slot item and &quot;cap of drowned souls&quot; from BoT tower raid. got a whopping 54 aa at the moment, with five of those not yet spent.<br />
<br />
it's a beautiful thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the Shaman class is doing ok atm.  We are not broken as many have claimed.  We received the much needed heal upgrades.  BoT kicks ass.  The only thing I feel that we are a bit behind on is spot healing.  Daluda's should be a 1700hp base heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am 1 and 1 on Hard ldon.  The one ldon I lost I was new to the ldon adventures and so was everybody else.  Thought we could do it after winning a couple and got butts kicked.  The one ldon I won we had a great cleric and a super good caster class that had more hp than our main tank.  The tank and I got talked into doing a hard which we didnt want to do.  The tank and myself the entire mission kept sending each other tells of how scarry the mission was.  His hp bar would go from around 7k to 20 percent health in almost no time.  The entire time though I was rarely touched so for me it was no problem.  I am trying to gear myself towards hard ldon but will always have that scared feeling until I get used to it I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hard LDoNs success rate is 90% of how efficient your puller is IMO.  A good Bard/Chanter puller will make them as easy as Normals due to pre-slowing the mobs before mez is broken.  Monk pulls have been too time consuming in my experience, but it doesn't mean it can't be effective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nice job there Pog - keep the shammy flag flying! I have to agree with Adonnis about the pull being the key to LDoN hard success. The only question I'll ask before going along on a LDoN hard pick-up is 'Who's doing pull and CC?'. Having those roles filled out nicely makes the whole affair a cake-walk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, the puller is the key, and I can tell you a monk can pull a high risk adv faster than probably anyone else, including bard and chanter (actually wouldn't trust a chanter much at all to pull a high risk unless they were very well equipped...).  My monk pulls high risk all the time.  I have a mob in-camp constantly, with only maybe 5-10 secs of idle time, if that.  Monks get the unresistable single-target lull that usually does the trick... occasionally I'll hafta lull and then FD split a pair but normally I just use single-target lull, pull a few, and call for a quick tag... it's fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have done all of 1 Hard LDON at 65, but I have to say that I am impressed. We had a hard enough time keeping the tank (8K+ warrior with BoC and other high level droppable toys) alive with the Cleric CHing at 60% and the Druid and me patch healing.<br />
<br />
The closest that I have ever come to that kind of experience was in a normal level 65 LDON when I was the only healer and, of course, the main slower. I was 64 at the time and we had a 64 Enchanter along, so I thought we whould be OK since we had CC and I could relaibly slow/heal against a single 370ish hitting mob even at 64. What I didn't expect was that the Enchanter would turn out to be almost useless (a RL young girl, I think) and that the rest of the group would be rather shaky except for the MT. I ended up root parking, off tanking, slowing and healing all at the same time and frequently going OOM. We still won without any deaths, but it was a rather unnerving experience.<br />
<br />
By the way, I found something that the Warrior said during my Hard LDON interesting. It was his 1st hard adventure in EC and he said that he was seeing a LOT more ripostes than in EF, which is what he was used to. Once he switched to 2HS, it became noticeably easier to keep him alive, although agro got to be a bit of a problem at time. I ended up tanking a few mobs after they objected to my slows, but nothing that a quick Root couldn't fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Purrfekkt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I totally agree with you that shaman can do some pretty special stuff at a pinch.  I too have been the MH on a hard ldon as well as slower, with a monk tank no less (the monk was VERY well time geared mind you with a buttload of AA's) also we can solo reds in pofire with ease, take out named dragons in WW while polishing our fingers nails, the main complaint shaman have is our role in GoD (or lack of one). <br />
<br />
I'm quite happy with my abilities everywhere else, but when one sits LFG for over 100 hours in a 1 week period looking for a trials group in barindu and gets 1 stinking invite the whole time, then thats when I know shaman have been cast out into the cold as far as this new expansion is concerned.  And no, before you say &quot;you must have been a crap geared sub-baron AA'ed fresh out of PoV newbie who thought you could bust some shiz up in GoD&quot;, I am not.  I have 420+ AA's and am fairly well equiped with elemental gear mostly and a smattering of lower end GoD gear from mini raid named in Ferubi and LDoN items with some ok augs.  I was however missing guild tags at the time which may have caused some people to not give me a second look.  Regardless of that, its plain to see that shamans utility in higher end content is being reduced to zilch, mitigation is just one small part of the spectrum of nerf that is assailing us from the cluster-phark that is GoD, from our healing to us providing next to no dps in timed trials (did Sony learn nothing from PoJ trials?).   <br />
<br />
I have since passed all my trials but thanks only to my guild-to-be taking the time and effort to piggy back me through them, this was all pre-retune of the sewer trials (have the mountain pass trials been retuned too?) and it may be a little easier for a shaman to get a group if a member of the holy trinity (read Enchanter) can't be found whereas before the group would simply have not gone ahead with the trial at all.  But yes, all the noise us shaman are making is for a damn good reason, we love our class and it pains those of us who have put so much time and effort into getting into the high end of the game to see it be a tool of our own demise and that we should have stuck to BoT for the next few years as at least then we'd still be getting group offers, either that or switch classes ... NEVER, I'd rather fight to the bitter end to see my class restored to having some semblance of our former glory, or at the very least, at least be able to get some groups in the content I've fought so hard to reach, because I seriously couldn't give a rats arse about dragons in WW.</div></div><hr />
