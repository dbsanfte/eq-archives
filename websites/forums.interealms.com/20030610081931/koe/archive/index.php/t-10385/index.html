So, finally some guild killed Trakanon on Antonius Bayle yesterday nite, so this morning I headed to Trak Lair to attempt to kill the Sebilite Protector.<br />
<br />
I got SoW'ed, DMF, 2 x DA and there I was at Trak Lair. Stage one completed.<br />
<br />
PIC &quot;Hail, Sebilite Protector&quot;: www.strike9.com/file.aspx...tector.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the strat I thought out: <br />
<br />
1. First all I would FD split a Jugg off and kill it to be able to use Wake of Dead. I wanted to root Prot and have a WoD Juggy pet to tank it while I can load up DoTs to build up agro.<br />
<br />
2. Then I would pull Prot with Pillage Enchancement (super cancel magic off right clicky) because it might had been buffed by Tolapujm before.<br />
<br />
3. Then root Prot aside to gain some time.<br />
<br />
4. Snare Prot while rooted.<br />
<br />
5. Cast WoD on the fallen Juggy. My original plan was to have the Jugg tanking it while rooted and hopefully Prot would eat up the Jugg's enrage (very sweet extra damage). Unfortunately not long afterwards root would brake off and I had built up too much agro to keep him on the Jugg  <br />
<br />
6. Saryn's Kiss Prot.<br />
<br />
7. LifeBurn Protector. I wasnt unsure of Prot's HP, and I feared to be OOM in the middle of the fight (I even had Infussion mem'ed LOL), so I decided to gain some extra damage. Finally, it turned out to be a VERY easy fight and I was 100% HP and 80% mana when Prot got into Run Mode /shrug.<br />
<br />
8. Regular agro kitting with the 2 pets beating on him. He went down within 1 minute LOL.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some pictures:<br />
<br />
PIC &quot;pulling Prot&quot;. Note the dead Jugg corpse at the right side of the picture: www.strike9.com/file.aspx...g+Prot.jpg<br />
<br />
PIC &quot;killing Prot&quot;. Once root wore off with all my nasty shit loaded up, regular summon-Mujaki-summon kitting applies: www.strike9.com/file.aspx...g+Prot.jpg<br />
<br />
PIC &quot;Prot Run Mode&quot;: www.strike9.com/file.aspx...n+Mode.jpg<br />
<br />
PIC &quot;Prot Loot&quot;. Loot was Hardened Clay Bracer and the spells Trucidation and Trepidation. If any post 55 necro on Antonius Bayle needs them, dont hesitate to kick me a tell and they are yours for free, we necros gotta help each other out: www.strike9.com/file.aspx...t+Prot.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I must acknowledge this fight was MUCH easier that Lodizal and Guardian Wurm. I followed up a nice strat and my DPS was too much for him. Check out my mana bar at the Loot picture, it is like at 70% without having rodded nor infussioned. Trak Lair is the perfect kitting place, tons of open spaces without adds, and easy to FD split a Jugg off to gain a WoD pet.<br />
<br />
So, Prot was down. That didnt feel that great, as I said it was easy. Hmmm what is that shit I see over there? Is it Tolapujm surounded by 4 hasted Juggs? Hhmmmm Tola was so going down hehe.<br />
<br />
I pulled him with Pillage Enchancement again and ran to the back of the Lair with the train behind me. PIC: www.strike9.com/file.aspx...g+Tola.jpg<br />
<br />
A lil bit of FD split pulling here, a lil bit of root parking there, and Mr. Tolapujm is single for me. PIC: www.strike9.com/file.aspx...a+Solo.jpg<br />
<br />
Then I proceeded to kill the bastard. PIC: www.strike9.com/file.aspx...g+Tola.jpg<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly, something that I hadnt expected happend: Tolapujm gated to his spawning point with 10% health remaining, and I got promptly summoned among 4 pissed off Juggies. Ouch. I had to DA, drop down the bridge into the pond underneath and Feaign Death. I /q'd afterwards. <br />
<br />
I must grant that I made a mistake not expecting Tola to gate. Next time I will have LifeBurn ready (since you dont really needed for Protector) and wont let him gate this time.<br />
<br />
Overall fun morning. I recommend everyone to do it.<br />
