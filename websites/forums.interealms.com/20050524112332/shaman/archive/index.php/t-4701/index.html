<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been thinking about this for a while, and with some of the changes they are making in game lately, it seemed like a good time to bring this up. I am proposing the following AA skill tweak for class AA for shaman. <br />
<br />
Make the Quick Buff skill be a Quick Buff/Debuff skill. <br />
<br />
This would adress what the primary function of what a real shaman is on raids. Also, adding a quickness function to a classes main function is not without precedent. Wizards and druids both have the class AA ability to train for quick direct damage spells to reduce the casting time on their DD's and both of those classes typically have that as one of their major roles. I don't believe that it would be asking anything out of line for the possibility of our class AA skill for quick buff to also affect debuffs as well (since the truth is that there is only one spell that it is worth having it for now as it is). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Would be nice, although I dont think we will get the debuff time cut in half. Doesnt affliction haste 3 cut it by 30% already, or is that just a bug waiting to get fixed?<br />
<br />
Druid dd haste is more like 10% or so I think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Affliction Haste 3 probably will not be cut... seeing as there's so few items that give it anyways...   Kromrif Military Wristguard and Bone Clasped Girdle are the only two I know of, if I recall.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Coldain gives extended affliction 3. Dont know about girdle.<br />
<br />
Circlet of Falikan (SS quest) is affliction haste 3. Best way to find out is allakazam's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sevenkilts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ring of Shissar gives Enhancement Haste 3 i.e. Quick Buff and in high level game you anyway want this ring since its stats are very nice and it is the key to reach the Emperor in Ssra Temple. Quick Buff as aa skill is pretty much a waste as it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok sorry maybe to clarify...<br />
<br />
Wasn't speaking about a 50% reduction in debuff times, but perhaps the same sort of reduction that the quick damage AA skills provide. Here is the description from the wizard one. <br />
<br />
&quot;This ability reduces the casting time for direct damage spells.<br />
Since many Wizards have to watch their aggro in fights thr primary benefit of this spell is to reduce the chance of interruption due to Area Effects spells or rampages by the enemy.<br />
<br />
The first point reduces casting time by 2%, the second by 5% and the last by 10%.<br />
<br />
There is a requirement of 3 points in Spell Casting Fury before this can be trained&quot;<br />
<br />
Now even adding that 2/5/10% reduction to debuffs would still make it a bit more worthwhile to actually train your quick buff skills. I am thinking that it is something they would maybe even be able to do (having the buffs be at their current rate and debuffs be at that 2/5/20% rate) since i know that they are working on multiple effects on items as it is. Anyhow.... hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds great but might overpower us a bit in that we can get more debuffs in a short time. Even if it was a limited use on some debuffs it would be great I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bracelet of the Sky. Haste on all debuffs and dots.  I love this little gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bracelet of the sky is the one I currently wear.  The effect is 33% haste on all debuffs and dots.  2 second turgurs are niiiiiiiice :D<br />
<br />
Circlet of Falinkan is an EASY quest if you can muster a group of friends to help you and the reward is totally uber for a shaman.  Has respectable if not great ac (12), nice wis, int, mana and hps as well as resists and the SAME effect as on my bracer. <br />
<br />
So there you go, two attainable items that have the effect you desire.  One for +CoV people, and one for those who hunt NToV.  If you ask me, the CoV circlet is far easier to get.  <br />
<br />
Given the existence of this focus effect, and the fact that they very likely would not want to cut the casting time on afflictions/debuffs down any further than these items do, I think you're barking up the wrong tree.  <br />
<br />
Now a GLARINGLY broken class AA skill that DESPERATELY needs attention would be Rabid Bear.  The duration is too short, but most importantly, the reuse time is a HORRIBLE 2 hours!  That's the longest reuse time on any AA ability of any class!  Equalled by the enchanter class ability to gain an entire mana pool once every 2 hours . . . but they know that sucks.  <br />
If the reuse time on this ability was halved I'd be a lot happier with it.  I like mixing it up once in a while, not all the time, but when I do it's fun.  I hate having to wait 2 hours to have that fun again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Groggog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also wouldn't mind an AA or focus effect that makes debuffs last longer.   Having an extra 50% duration on slow/malo, etc, wouldn't be overpowering, but sure would be nice on long fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That's the longest reuse time on any AA ability of any class! Equalled by the enchanter class ability to gain an entire mana pool once every 2 hours .<br />
<br />
Second longest.  Clerics have one on a 72 hour (rl) reuse~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would like an AA that cuts the recast time for turgur's down a bit.  Really annoying to try to slow a mob in an exp group and have it get resisted, then you have to stand there for 10 seconds or so getting your ass beat.  Equally annoying when there are a bunch of adds and you're trying to slow them all.  First AA cuts it by 25% (3), second AA cuts by 50%(6), third AA (9) eliminates it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Katyana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Quick Buff 3 worthless after obtaining a Shissar Ring? I would beg to differ. The Ring will not alter the casting time of Torpor. Having 3 second cast time on Torpor has proved to be very handy in countless situations. I never considered the QB skill important for reduced casting time on buffs, but any skill that enhances Torpor is one I will pursue. The ring quest is a terrific one that helps aquaint a player with Ssra Temple. Between that and the VT Key quest you are likely to see and experience many fun camps all over the moon.<br />

<br />
Actually Verant made the mistake of having Afliction focus only affect DoT's when they first implemented focus items.  Since two patches ago, they have fixed it to include all debuffs, DoTs, and even root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Asta:  At first blush the debuffs were affected by the AHIII items.  Then they decided to nerf them to just be dots.  Then they came to their senses again and restored the effect to include all debuffs.  If they go schitzophrenic AGAIN and nerf them back I think a lot of people would be pretty upset.  As it stands, I've been using my focus effect on the Bracelet of Sky for over a month . . . and loving it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recently acquired Bracelet of the Deep Sea (it's been on my wish list for a while) and tested it out on a couple of debuffs (malo, turgurs) and sure enough, the duration is significantly longer. <br />
<br />
Since one can hear many rumors and know only a few to be true or false...even when you hear them from the almight VI....I'm inclined to test things on my own. I'm very pleased that they have re-enabled this effect to do what it should.<br />
<br />
Now I can die from ridiculous rampage off the creator and know that my debuffs will stay on for the entire fight!! :)<br />
