<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) I'd like to say I really enjoyed speaking to someone who was receptive.  The guide told me &quot;He'll probably say NO but who knows&quot; and that was disheartening even though I agreed with her about it.<br />
<br />
2) I explained to him, YES, it was 100% my fault, I'm stupid and smell like dead froglok (it's a new perfume in Grobb btw.. VERY pricy).  I also explained to him that if I had to redo the Idol/Ring part my faction may be TOO high and result in issues.  I told him I had done ALL the parts w/o cheating and asked for assistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) He was VERY friendly about everything AND gave me back my piece.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, in short, Thanks Beghn for being rational and understanding how much effort we all put into these quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thankfully!</div></div><hr />
