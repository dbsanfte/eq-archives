<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I just found an easy way to get lvl 10 maybe even farther...<br />
<br />
Fishing lol..  you can fish for flounder, sunfish, or froglegs..  At least thats all I have caught..<br />
<br />
Just go fishing for a couple hours most spawns of all resources..  And do baked froglegs.  Then Herb encrusted baked frog legs..  2 for the price of one resource..  although its a lil bit more expensive maybe..  Then do Sunfish Steaks.  Then pick one of the things sunfish steaks can go into I did Jerky..  again 2 for one..  Then just roll baked flounder...  <br />
<br />
This got me to lvl 10/160%..  5 hours total..<br />
<br />
Again maybe not the fastest or cheapest but deffinatly easy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would run around and fill up 6 4-slot bags full of harvested/mined/fished/etc items, then tradeskill everything in the pack.  The artisan levels went quickly plus it got me skill in the harvesting/mining/etc skills in addition to the various artisan skills.  Keep in mind that even though there are artisan levels, you still have seperate skills for armoring, baking, alchemy, etc.</div></div><hr />
