<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi -- where did all of the old posts go? The thread on &quot;can I slow such-and-such&quot; and the threads on the Iksar Shaman Cudgels and so on....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just went away for lunch. What the heck happened here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They only exist in a backup db form I imagine somewhere.  Sunmoon did give us warning of a few days to go and save those posts for reposting.  I think he saved a backup of the old DB for such use but I imagine we will have to manually restore the important stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There was so much good stuff! I hope that some people dedicate some real time to crawling through the old forums and reposting that stuff here. These forums are certainly faster -- but god I'd hate to lose all of that content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cradossk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's hoping it all comes back but I'm sure we will rebuild it over time if not, nice to see the boards loading faster at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/mourn Spell Locations thread :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guys, I warned you all last week that I would be wiping the boards. I am going to TRY to get the old database up so that you can pull off old posts... but I'll have to see how busy I am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought Thantu was saving a bunch of the ones that were good.   Like slowable list, spell locations, etc.<br />
<br />
??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm sure he did.. you'll have to ask him when he's around :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/summon Thantu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That'll teach you not to read the damn stickies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, I saved them :)  Though the very thought of looking in the Archive directory on my burn drive gives me the willies.  I was up till 4 am three nights in a row saving, saving, saving.  I did pull from each forum too, not just the general.  In case you don't see the 70's thread Sun, you can mail them to me or I can download them via Ftp and through them up on my unused webspace for a month or two (in case people are insane enough to do what I did last 3 days :P).</div></div><hr />
