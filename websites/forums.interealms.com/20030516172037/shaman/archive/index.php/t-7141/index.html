<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Astyanaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am desperately looking for suggestions on where to money-grind, because after buying an 8th ring MQ and all parts of the Earring of Solstice quest, I found myself with a measly 300pp in my bank. I am looking to earn enough money for a selo's horse and gear to twink my bard PKer with. Exp would be just a bonus to a good money spot, but not required. If anyone has any suggestions, that would be great. I was thinking about possibly working up my smithing, because that seems like a very profitable trade skill nowadays, although I only have around 80ish skill in it at the moment, as well as mid 70's in alchemy and no other trade skills.</div></div><hr />

Your best bet would probably to farm UP of nameds. Learn where they all spawn and their timer, be there at serverups too. Shak dathor warlord, a gantru raldukan, Gantru dralkenr, corrupted elder elysian, shadowy assassin and those green hivefiends are all soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to plane of growth and solo there. some good EXP and nearly a gem on every mob that sells for 100p+. Also spells drop there u could sell off for 100-200p. =) gluck<br />

Ayonae ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoM is a fairly nice place if you can find ppl to sell cards too. Also they drop from 3-9 pp per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go to Dn and farm phase spider carpases. Good solo exp ands good money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hill giants, rathe mountains.  at 60 w/c3 I was farming 600-750pp/hour.  Don't listen to the people telling you to go farm pp elsewhere, the lowbies there actually getting xp could get it elsewhere too, they're there for the money just like you are.  just gave pet two FS, pulled with turgur, and clicked JBB a few times... haste on pet, regen on yourself.  <br />
<br />
And if they get stuck up in a tree, bearform+levitate and look straight up, you can climb any wall/surface that isn't exactly straight up (or leaning back towards you of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">guards in Seru drop up to 15pp a kill, averaged at about 10 I'd say  Easy kills and can probably find somewhere in the city for constant pulling.<br />
<br />
  Most any greenie zone where they drop cash or gems will work fine for you if you can stand the tedium of it (well, tking on the entire MM castle with pet and DS isn't totally tedium..  sorta refreshing actually).   I'd say the best money is going to be in the planes (Growth and Fear) if you don't like selling to PCs, and in the new planes if you are good at winning randoms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like Caanus's idea alot.  Periodically I still take on a zone for cash and to feel the power.  It is oddly refreshing to clobber Splitpaw or Mistmore.  See how long it takes you to kill every mob and walk out. Wierd how invigorating it is after grinding AA's.<br />
<br />
Next one is Dalnir which owes me bigtime. Died 4 times there one afternoon.<br />
<br />
If hill giants are too camped, I used to do Frontier Mt giant fort for forest loops. Usually make 500-600 an hour off tunics, loops and weapons.  Pet plus Jbb is enough, dont slow anything but maybe braes since it is cheaper than healing the pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was a fantastic way to make money before UP became KC v2.0, but now it's too freaking full to get anything regularly.  Besides, the ONLY named that is on a cycle is dralkenr, everything else is spawned by killing either elysians, or gantru's, or assassins, or what not  (and/or random spawn on some).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ZharfaySolRo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">U should farm Lodi. He no longer skips spawns since the Patch yesterday and got a spawntime of 11h 40mins. He is real easy at lvl 60 for a shaman with his toys (Torpor/Malo).<br />
If u dont like to farm Lodi, Guards in Neriak are a great spot for money too. each of the guards drop about 10-15pp (FS Stuff included)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Named rock golems and snakes around the temple in The Grey, Golem Jawbone, Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves and lots more easily sellable loot, most of the stuff sells for four figures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Astyanaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for all the suggestions guys, I appreciate it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if you are just looking for cash of merchants, jpf gnoll cave is the place to go. I make about 400 pp an hour there soloing light blues with jbb, horse and dog.  Plus experience to boot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">is lodi soloable without malo? like will malosini stick without it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i'm sure malosini will work just fine.. just might not stick on the first or 2nd cast though =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bacchas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">go back to HHK. old times. slaughter guards. guards drop up to 5 or 6 plat and a FS Short sword every time. you can sell to the erudite chanter vendor on the 1st floor (at least my SK could, not sure of the faction he is on) dull, but easy and profitable. just watch out for Rann</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I spent a few weeks in the rat jails in the Hole with a monk partner. We got 4 idols of the underking. Sold 3 for 50k, and last one for 15k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Lodi is pretty hard to slow, even with malo. Atleast in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">dont need malo for lodi, kite him around til root sticks, malosini til it sticks, turgurs.. can even canni up and ds before going in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I had thought the Idol dropped from Master Yael, did this change?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Mistmoose also good place to earn cash if you don't want to ruin HHK faction, common drop some pp and FS weapon at castle area<br />
a duel wield lv 61 pet can easy clean most part of castle and moonlight essense can sold to Elf culturesmith.<br />
<br />
Paineel: skeleton guards also drop some cash loot, but require key and faction if you are not Evil Edurin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">had thought the Idol dropped from Master Yael, did this change?<br />
<br />
Heh that was the funny thing. Most people thought it dropped only off Yael, but also drops commonly off Slizik the Mighty. He's a rare spawn though.<br />
<br />
Course now that we have focus IV though, the idol price has fallen a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I make 2-3kpp an hour in PoG depending on my luck. In one brief 40 minute trip I got 7 ruby crowns which sell for 190pp each. PoG is the absolute best for cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Miserable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">As far as the Neriak guards go, what's the minimum level these can be killed efficiently at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Do the trial of execution in PoJ repeatedly.  Each time a named pops, you'll get a drop worth 3-5k.  Low risk of dying, great rewards, decent experience.  You'll need a few people to help, but you don't even need to get past the first wave, really.<br />
<br />
Each time I do trials, I end up with stuff to sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If you're 60-62 then guardian camp in seb is the way to go. You can make decent xp in 60 or so-so AA xp at 61 or 62 there - most mobs in the camp are still dark blue at 61.<br />
<br />
The cash flows from the three sepsis scarabs in the camp, every single one will drop a gem or piece of jewellry of some sort, ranging in value from 70pp to 600pp for blue diamonds. Maybe 1 in 20 you'll only get a worthless crystallized sulfur. A rare spawn is level 51 necrosis scarab (very easy, not a caster despite the name) who will usually drop 2 gems and either Jaundiced Bone Arms or a Cane of Tranquil. <br />
<br />
Once you kill the scarabs, pull the frogs down the hall and then pull the golem up on top of the ziggurat thingy above the door to crypt / PLA. The sebilite golem is a placeholder for a sebilite guardian, who will either drop a crappy Larrikan's Mask or a Lamentation. <br />
<br />
If you're level 60 with torpor and decent gear you should be able to clear it all plus pull some mobs from zone out area as well - obulus death shrouds seem to drop more often off of them than anywhere else in zone - I've had 2 drop in the last week that I had to let other people come loot because they're lore. On Drinal ODS's run 20k.<br />
<br />
The most difficult part of this camp, which isn't very difficult at all, is when you get a roamer krup wizard or enchanter. The krup wizards can cast ice comet, and enchanter mobs are a pain in the ass to kill, but if you keep your resists buffed you should have no problems. <br />
<br />
I sell everything to the vendors except for the blue diamonds, ODS, Lamentations and Cane of Tranquils. And yes, I mean sell the Jaundiced Bone Arms to a vendor - they sell for 340pp or so. I manage to pull in about 1k per hour there not counting the rare drops from the named mobs. I did the camp this morning for 3.5 hours and walked out with 28 gems, 3 of which were blue diamonds which I sold for 600pp each, and netted myself around 5.2k plat total. If lammy dropped for me I woulda done better but I got 3 guardians in a row who dropped masks. Made 3 yellows of AA xp while I was there to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">At the Necrosis scarab camp..do you pull to OUTSIDE the tunnel..or do you pass the three spawns and pull from the inside?<br />
<br />
And how are you single-ing them? I can't at 60 and it's pissing me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'll explain as best I can. I go across the bridge immediately across from the zone out path, and move down to the very start of the tunnel, summon pet and buff up. You can med safely in the corner with the torch, almost falling into the water - roamers will just path by if you need to med. Once the mob is nearly dead it will start to run if you don't have it rooted, so have a nuke memmed or just root it. I prefer nuking since I have SCF 3 and always have a mage summoned damage bracelet, and if you root a running caster mob you stand the risk of it gating.<br />
<br />
At 61 I still can't always pull singles, but it's an easy matter of root parking mobs. Always root the melee mob if you pull a casting mob as well - casters can make your life difficult, so kill them first. <br />
<br />
I've been able to solo the entire camp all the way down to and including guardian at level 60 (when I finally got torpor, that is) using just self-buffs. With KEI I've been able to pull up to the third golem of the zone out mobs as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Csin, I had the same problem at 60. I think I could pull the first one solo but second and third came together. I always pulled the first time with root and see what came. If another came I would slow it and kill it while the other I kept root on ( I would slow it just in case). I could kill 2 of them ok with torpor then rest up for the third. Now they are broken and can be single pulled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">That's a lovely solution..but I am camping this spot to get cash to BUY topor..I guess I'm out of luck unless someone has a bright idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well ZO is close by and my root seems to hold well on them, I am sure you can get them broken up with Kragg's. Heck, shaman are soloing yeldema now with kraggs. If you dont' feel things are going well, head to the ZO or gate out. I think it is fun to try things that might not work out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Necro is a great camp, but not the easiest in Seb.  Another good spot is the tunnel on the way to Discos.  Perhaps not quite as much cash or xp, but a little easier IMHO.</div></div><hr />
