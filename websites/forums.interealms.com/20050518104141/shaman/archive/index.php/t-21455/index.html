<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently discovered a way to get our pet to dual with only one weapon.  If you give him a secondary only weapon he will dual wield.<br />
<br />
I tested this with shardwurm stingers first.  When I gave him just the stinger he would both bite and pierce.  <br />
<br />
I have since tried with a Master's Eitchatka combined with other weapons.  If I would give him a primary weapon he would only use that attack method (pierce, slash, crush).  If I added the Eitchatka he would start biting occasionally as well so he will use them to dual wield.<br />
<br />
So you only need to give him one secondary only weapon to get him to dual wield.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of a few items that should work that aren't hard to find on merchants.  The MoBs that drop them are pretty heavily farmed for other reasons already.<br />
<br />
High Apprentice's Eitchatka (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8040) <br />
<br />
Master's Eitchatka (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7152) <br />
<br />
Sarnak Eitchatka (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=264) <br />
<br />
Shardwurm Stinger (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3845)</div></div><hr />
