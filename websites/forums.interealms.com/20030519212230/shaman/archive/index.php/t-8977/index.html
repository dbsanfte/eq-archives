<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, im new to the board, but I was reading here that people fight in HHK? (I'm assuming it means High Hold Keep) What is there to fight in HHK? I thought it was only around lvl 30 that you fought there. =P, so please correct me if I'm wrong, and sorry if I'm repeating an already asked Q.<br />
<br />
BTW, im a lvl 53 Shaman, if HHK isnt good for me, maybe you could suggest better? (yes, im repeating many other ask q's, sorry) Thank you guys. Merwenn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most evil races (and some good ones too) hunt one the 2nd floor. There are many posts about this, and i think like 3 on the front page of this fourm, so not hard to find for more info on this. But there are 2 nobles, and 3 bards, one bard is 6 ish mins, the nobles are 6, and the other 2 bards are like 15. The bards spawn together and the nobles spawn in a different room. Just look around and you'll see some detailed guides on this.</div></div><hr />
