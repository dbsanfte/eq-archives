<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Problem: Assuming that our heals are tuned to be effective in conjunction with slow, mitigation clearly presents a problem.<br />
<br />
Idea: A line of heals that would be cast on a MOB instead of a player. When the spell lands (unresistable), it checks to see if the MOB currently has a slow spell on it. If it does, and if the MOB mitigates slow, the spell puts a super-short duration (a few seconds max) recourse effect on the MOB's current target that heals (instantly) for an &quot;overtuned&quot; amount based on how much the slow has been affected by mitigation.<br />
<br />
For example, Tnarg's Mending heals for 1300 base. This new spell might heal for, say, 1300*(1+(slow%-mit%)/slow%); so, if the MOB mitigates a 75% slow down to 50%, the heal would be for 1733 base.<br />
<br />
The numbers above are just an example to show the math behind the idea. Actual tuning would be needed to make it realistic. What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting idea, but probably a bit too much for the Devs to consider coding.  If mobs are going to quad 4K+, our patch heals are going to have to come closer to 3K for us to be considered a patch healer.  When OoW releases and GoD gets tuned back up, there will be alot of 2 Cleric expeditions again.  Healing &gt; Slowing in 30 second fights, and there is no way around that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">or even a wierd one, an unresistable spell that adds a proc to the mob that heals the target for 100hp. Would be an interesting idea that seems in flavour of a shaman buffing &amp; debuffing, this one is a buff with a debuff added :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is pretty much the cleric Mark (reverse DS) line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So you can't use this heal inbetween fights ? That's a darn thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The original idea of this thread isn't really viable.  The coding required would probably be terrible and it's just not general enough.  I think the main problem with our poor healing in conjunction with mitigation of slow is that the developers have slipped down the slope of &quot;balance&quot; and they only look at surface numbers when it comes to that.  Obkin's Mending is 1690hp currently because giving us a 1750hp heal would make it Nature's Infusion.  God forbid we're able to heal like a druid 4 expansions and 2 years later.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I propose heal spells that work only in certain zones, kind of like how Call of the Hero works in some zones and not others.<br />
<br />
Kragg's Planar Mending: 3120hp, 10s cast (incomplete CH) that works in PoP and GoD zones where mitigation is present.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's Planar Mending: 1700hp, 3.75s cast that would only work in PoP and GoD zones where mitigation is present.<br />
<br />
Kragg's Discordant Mending: X * 0.67, where X is the hitpoint value of the new druid incomplete CH they will likely be getting in OoW.  This would only work in OoW and possibly some GoD zones where mitigation is present.<br />
<br />
Daluda's Discordant Mending: 2050hp, 3.75s cast that works in GoD and OoW zones where mitigation is present.<br />
<br />
Obkin's Discordant Mending: 2350hp, 3.75s cast that works in OoW only where mitigation is present.<br />
<br />
We can keep the version of Tnarg's, Daluda's and Obkin's that are presently there or planned, and those will work in all zones.<br />
<br />
Essentially, a cleric should be able to heal in a group where there is no slower present.  A druid should be able to heal in a group where there is an enchanter, bard or beastlord.  A shaman should be able to heal a group alone due to being able to slow.  Priests should be able to substitute for one another.  If druids and clerics think this is unbalancing, then they can dps in a group instead of healing if there's a shaman present.  Clerics can use their &quot;awesome&quot; hammers and &quot;awesome&quot; melee powers they begged for a while back and druids can nuke and we'll all be happy.<br />
<br />
SoE is so afraid of breaking old content that they pass up giving us the appropriate upgrades.  A paladin and a ranger can be the only healers in hard LDoN and win it, trust me, I've done it.  If you don't want to break old content, at least make it possible for classes to work in new content. They have no problem with giving classes spells to increase their dps (any class that can cast a spell always gets upgrades to their direct damage spells or DD proc buffs), yet suddenly there's a HUGE problem with giving priests (and shamans specifically) better heals to mitigate away the damage mobs in new zones put out.  Sounds like a double standard to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">better would be making an u/g slow that also autocast a spell on the caster that check mitagation (if that poss) and gives shaman a buff that increase heals by 25% , 50%, etc depending on mitagagtion. or what ever keeps us at what we are for fully slowable mobs. and as such wouldnt affect our position to cleric<br />
<br />
abit like the necro/sk spells that cast on target and then autocast and buff on the necro.  least it would be easier to code a straight buff, but i would have thought that mitagated mobs would have a number for that mitagation that could be added or multiplied to give a bonus buff?<br />
<br />
(not completely my idea seen it mention somewhere else)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some raids you just can't spare a buff slot.  The coding should be independent of sort of spell checks on the mob or recourse effects.  Or if they wanted to do it through buffs, give shamans a buff that increases healing power (seems shamanic to me) by 10% or something.  Clerics get spell haste buffs (which I see no logical reason for anyway), so why not give shamans a buff that increasing healing power?</div></div><hr />

<br />
perhaps get it go into the bard buff slots like wards.</div></div><hr />
