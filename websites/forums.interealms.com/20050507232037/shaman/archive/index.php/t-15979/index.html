<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there, guys.  Our guild just defeated the Rathe and got PoTime access.  I was going to run a mini-raid of 18 in there to start gathering strats on the 6 encounters that have to be beaten to get to PoTimeb, but I was going to see if any of you time-enabled folks could save us a bit of running and clicking.  Are all the ring events started in the caves?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i hear you need at least 32 or 36 in the raid now ????  to even start time trials now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's 5 trials and yeah they are all started inside the caverns. Wasteland = Undead trial, Snow = Air trial, Ssra = Water trial, Earth = Earth trial, HoH = Fire trial. Mini-raids of 12-18 ppl works just fine, and it's quite fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no, it doesnt work anymore as a guild tried to sploit the instance and putted down 18 twinks in a trial and then disband all but leader and invite mains...<br />
So I dont know how many you need anymore.</div></div><hr />
