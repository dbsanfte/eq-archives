<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've had some interesting things happen in the last few days with EQ so I called tech support and thought I would pass along what I found out to everyone because I hear that a lot of people are having the same problem.  I would be interested in hearing if anyone else has run into this.<br />
<br />
After the patch to fix that strange text bug last week I've had 3 other unannounced patches come up where I've downloaded files like eqgame.exe and some equipment and spdat dll files.  One patch on Monday had me downloading files for about 25 minutes but when I got into the game and apologized to people waiting for me because I had to do a patch they thought I was nuts since they didn't have a patch to do.<br />
<br />
It seems that randomly many people have been made to redownload quite a few of the main EQ data files.  I've heard recently that some people on other servers were banned because they supposedly had some snooping software installed on their computer (some unknowingly) so I was worried that a virus or something similar had hit my computer even though my virus software wasn't picking anything up.  I called tech support and they said that a lot of people were having the same problem and they gave me a list of files to delete and repatch.  There were about 10 and I didn't write them down or I would post them here, but if you are having to download files in the patch frequently you might go into the tech support chat room or call Sony and get help.  It's seemed to have fixed it for me so far.<br />
<br />
The tech support lady also gave me a URL for an online virus checker that they say picks up things that Norton and McAffee tend to miss and they recommend it to people who are having similar problems just to make sure there's not something strange happening on your computer: www.centralcommand.com<br />
<br />
Hope you find this helpful.  It's eased some frustration and worry on my part.<br />
<br />
Take care!<br />
