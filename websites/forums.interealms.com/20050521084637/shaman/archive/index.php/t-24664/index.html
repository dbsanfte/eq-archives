<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What do you think of th Call of the Wild AA and what is it's refresh timer?  I am considering it as my next AA purchase for those times when the cleric dies and there is no Pally in group or other cleriks nearby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">10 minute recast, I believe.  Want it vera badly, myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've already saved raids with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aniha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the best AAs we get in OOW in my opinion. The refresh of 10 min has not been a problem to me so far at all. Usually you just need to call a rezzer back. Near the end of a God Trial or in middle of PG - this AA has been enormously useful. Don't use it often, but very glad to have it for that situation iwhen ts needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's awesome, especially with fd-ring from posky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would say its one of the better aa we get. I actually use it quite a bit. Its awesome for when your cleric dies in MPG and they are bound in PoT. Much better then waiting 30 min for them to get back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was the first OoW aa I purchased.<br />
<br />
And as for usefulness, a few weeks ago it was this Shaman's dream come true:<br />
<br />
I was the only one in raid to make a successful camp out during an Uqua wipe.<br />
<br />
The recycle time hasn't bothered me, as you usually don't need to rez more than one person at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its definately one of the best AA ever just behind Canni V.  It is great for xp groups when the cleric dies, and it rocks on raids when none of the clerics live.<br />
<br />
Its also great during raids for mid fight rez's.  CoW strips your buffs but it doesn't remove all your hp or mana.  So people rez in with the amount of naked hp/mana they got.  While that may not seem like much it is good for some classes.  Necros/Mages rez in with enough mana to summon a pet and send it in for instant damage.  Healers zone in with enough mana to cast a few heals, casters have enough for a few nukes.  Etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I double checked with Rashere (the AA guy at Fan Faire), CoW not acting like a normal rez is not the intention. It's supposed to cause rez effects and lower hitpoints/mana like a normal rez. Expect it to be changed shortly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm only a few aa from training it myself.  Can't wait.  I also think this is one of the better things for us, added in OOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Benthebaoa Laytor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have save our raids i think 3 times with this now, Bought it as soon as i dinged 70 some time in the 1st week of OoW.<br />
<br />
Another think even if my whole exp group wipes, i just tell the cleric to not to run back and chance dieing again. God i love spirit veil<br />
<br />
CoW+Spirit veil could be the best things to come out of OoW for shaman<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The day I dinged 70 I bought this AA.  10 minutes later I ressed our cleric deep in MPG.  Before the night was over I ressed the cleric 5 more times.  This is a very usefull AA to have.<br />
<br />
-G</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Even if they change it so the people Called have rez-effects, its still the bomb. Massive timesaver at its most basic usage (calling the cleric so he doesnt have to run) and is so strong it can be a Raid saver. <br />
<br />
Its wonderful that the peolpe come back without rez effects currently, but I suspected this wasnt intentional. For the time being though, its nice to call back a dead MA and have him now worry about rez effects and jump right back in, or call a Wizzie or Cleric and have a couple fast nukes/heals available. Even if they &quot;fix&quot; it though (not gonna call that a nerf, heh) its STILL awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You do come back with Rez Effects, you just come back with hp/mana.   It's naked hp/mana so its really not much at all.  Its something like 1600 hp/mana for me, barely enough for a couple casts.  Hardly needing a change, its not game breaking in any way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This ability allows you to call a fallen comrade's spirit back to their corpse.<br />
<br />
imo, it's not a rez so there should be no rez effects. that's what i get when i read the description.<br />
<br />
as for the question, this AA rocks the socks! i use it all the time and it saves --dramatic pause-- so much time.</div></div><hr />
