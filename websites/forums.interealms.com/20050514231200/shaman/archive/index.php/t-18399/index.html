Aye. Has that empty slot in the top left corner always been there? Maybe it's just me since I haven't seen a Magelo for a bit.</div></div><hr />

It looks like that the filesystem i choosed for the database server (XFS) is not reliable under amd64, i will have to re install the server, the website should be online within 24 hours.<br />
Sorry for the inconvenience, be sure i am working hard on this to bring magelo back online as soon as possible.<br />

The stability of the server has nothing to do with AMD's hardware. The file system he chose does not run well under the version of Linux for Opteron based processors, which would make it a software issue. All he has to do is rebuild the box and use a different file system like ext3 or ReiserFS.<br />

AMD is still evil  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
AMD is the little guy fighting the corporate monster called Intel.  For four years now (ever since release of the first Athlon) the two companies have been going back and forth with the performance lead.  It is currently in the AMD camp with the release of the FX51.  It will most likely swing back with the Prescott 3.4ghz...<br />
<br />
What does this mean? it means if it wern't for AMD pushing the performance edge we would all be paying $400 for a 800mhz processor.  Thats what a lack of competition will do.</div></div><hr />

Its been up all day and part of yesterday.  I've been using it an on there posting and doing things for most of the day.  Only thing I can suggest is to flush your cache or do a hard refresh.  Because it is working.<br />
