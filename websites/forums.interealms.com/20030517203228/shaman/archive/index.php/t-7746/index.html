Could you please check it out and tell me what I should buy?<br />
<br />
Until lately I have been working on wis gear, but I noticed that hp and ac is more important so I have been on the look out for cheap hp gear.  I am making cash from Sea furies in OOT so money is coming to me fairly easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok just going by memory here are some good upgrades for you<br />
<br />
Fingers - Dump those rings! Get some velium fire wedding rings or shadel bandit rings. VFR rings go for around 400 each I think. Shadel a bit more at 1k-2k each.<br />
<br />
Neck - Ivory Imbued Collar would help ya here. Should be cheap now.<br />
<br />
Hands - Jaundiced bone gauntlets are a cheap upgrade<br />
<br />
Shoulders - A tattered mantle would do ya well here. Or if you worried about losing wis get a chokidai hide spaulders.<br />
<br />
Belt - A chitinous belt give great ac and around the same wis. Got one last night for 800.<br />
<br />
Legs - Gatorscale is for druids. :D  Get ya some brown chitinous legs.<br />
<br />
Feet - Several options for ac and hp for feet. I keep my fur boots in inventory and hotkey em for use.<br />
<br />
Shield - If ya got the plats get a Crystal Chitin Shield or Skull Marked Shield. Both around 1500 and good upgrade on ac without too much loss in wis.<br />
<br />
Chest - Barbed ringmail may be an option.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For your wrists, you can quest for the Kromrif Military Bracer.  <br />
For your hands, JB gaunts or Crystal Chitin gaunts would both be much better.<br />
For your face, wait a month or so, and buy a Mask of the Executioner.  The price should be fairly low by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Above suggestions look good, but you may want to go for a ceremonial iksar chestplate, regen is good.<br />
<br />
Hands - Shissar or coldain skin<br />
<br />
shield - sarnak battle shield (no wis, but good hp and resists)<br />
<br />
ears - electrum black sapphire</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate is better than barbed anyday.<br />
<br />
Cystal Chitin Guantlets are good for that hands.<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield (or if you have the time and a few friends Shield of Bane Warding)<br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice if you can swing the price (about 8k on Zebux)<br />
<br />
Elder Wolf Hide, Campable solo at 51 easily just takes a little luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmmmm sounds good.  I agree that I have had a 1 track mind for wisdom gear.  This should help me out tremendously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dont let anyone tell you your gear sucks, yes you need some up grades, but we all do really. if you can do your job and do it well, you could be wearing paper bags and be good. lol seriously, most of the gear you have i had up until very recently so the up grades will come just takes some time...<br />
<br />
ryoz soulcrusher<br />
Oracle of the Fellowship of Midnight <br />
tarew marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah last night some guy gave me a Chitinous Belt and Djarn's Amethyst Ring for free.  So I equipped the belt and I am still deciding whther to keep the ring or sell iut off and buy somemore gear upgrades.  THe ring goes for 4-6k on Xegony server so anyone know what I should do with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">try to find a shadel bandit ring for a trade its a better shammy ring and should be about the smae price, atleast it is on the rathe</div></div><hr />
