<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any other guilds do anything out of the ordinary due to all the patches last week?<br />
<br />
Me and my guildmates on Zeb cleared Vex Thal 4 times over the course of the patches with Aten Ha Ra kills on the 21st, 22nd, 23rd and the 24th. The healing is just starting as my eyes completely bled from my face and my brain oozed from my ears like soda pop shaken from the bottle.<br />
<br />
It was a Merry Christmas indeed as many, many upgrades were looted over the course. Thanks SoE!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same with my guild, four VT clears.  Pretty much more in one week than we generally get in three months due to patch times and Euro dommination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We did 3 clears, because we are in a rotation with another guild. They deiced to skip one turn, so we took it. Got 3 upgrades out of the runs too, Gloves of Warding, Boots of the Wind, and the biggie, Mail of Judgement!! Jammed a 40 hp Aug right into that puppy, I am thinking Mail will never be upgraded by me.</div></div><hr />

I hear ya. The VT level Euro guild on my server refused to enter into the current VT rotation (2 USA zone guilds), thinking they would be able to take better advantage of the spawns because of timezone advantage. Boy were they right, taking 6 of the last 7 clears prior to the Patch Fest of Christmas '03. Wasnt too bad though, they just basically got in there before that and we had 15 runs on them before they killed Atan the first time. Was nice to get a few though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">6 runs in week was nice. And vt clears are hardly eye bleeding, park some plants and you can clear under 3.5hrs easy incl blobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many in raid?  The reason I ask is it takes us about 4 hours for a clear minus ahr blobs with 35 people in the raid.  And were not slacking here.</div></div><hr />

It takes us between 4-8 hours.  Our numbers usually start at 25 and it stays around there for a good third to half of the clearing and then gets a lot bigger as we near blobs and AHR. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild were in the middle of a AoW fight (guild first most unexperienced with only 30 people). He was down to 40% HP then the ****ing server crashed.</div></div><hr />
