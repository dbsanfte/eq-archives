<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, level 38 now almost got new spells ready for hunting in EW then my guildy friend tells me another place. The specs in Ferrott near the PoF zone. He said they drop good items etc and gave me a ikky BP and a Rallic pack to hold items they drop and to help me kill them. Any idea how much a level 39 would make in 2 hours of hunting here(exp and PP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Telosk....hello :)<br />
<br />
So how much you make the other night in CC, the reason i ask is that depending on drops i have found CC to be most lucrative. All weapons sell for 4-6pp each and if you get velium drops then your laughing. Did you go further in and try the stalags,spiders and genoids, they all drop loot, gems and silks depending on type of mob....I would stick it out for XP to, i made 65% XP in 2 1/2 hrs hunting the broken bridge stalags and then the genoids when the person camped there had gone. Especially if you have a higher guildie to help you out.<br />
<br />
I've never heard of the place you mention but thats my 2pp :)<br />
<br />
And get yourself to HollowShade and kill the Owlbear prince for his &quot;Brain of the Beaked Bear&quot; and &quot;Feathered Owlbear Circlet&quot; both no drop and better than what you have at the moment. You will be able to solo him now and easily when you have your 39 spells.  The Elder Wolf Hide cloak crops there too, you can do it solo (just invis up go in a attack from right behind the ph or mob) but it's scary as hell but fun too....run forrest run!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok, looked on eqatlas and allakzham, there no mob called owlbear prince, whats his proper name, and also what does the circlet drop off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The named owldbear in the caves in Hollowshade Moore is Scriet 'Atchu (or somesuch spelling).<br />
<br />
There is another named that spawns there too, but can't remember it's full name. I'm pretty sure it's similar to the one above with 'Atchu&quot; as it's last name.<br />
<br />
One of them also drops a Preserved Owlbear Eye. Decent mid level range slot item. Check my druids magelo for it's stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Prince Skerat is his name, or something like that. he also drops the feathered owlbear circlet which I wore for awhile... it has no graphic (yay!) a 3% to med, 15 hp, and a little bit of wis. Not too shabby for something that was way green when I killed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lots of info on Hollowshade Moore:<br />
