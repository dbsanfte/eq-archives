<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We are looking to have a Dev chat this week. Possibly Thursday.  Watch EQlive for details.  It will not be specific to any one subject so please stop by.<br />

Brenlo<br />
<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd pass that on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's playing a shaman now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Link please!  Curious to see where that was posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Dev Tracker button on the EQlive main board page is great:<br />

<br />
That specific comment comes from:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just cut and pasted that to the board from the EQLive message boards...I am not Brenlo, nor would I want to be.  But if I were I would at least have better communication than anybody at SOE now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sure would be nice if this was a more open format rather than the highly censored PR cluster the past ones have been.<br />
<br />
Chutoi something tells me if you submit a question it probably wont get approved. :p <br />
Nothing against you bro but they dont like confrontation nor being put on the spot in regards to answering anything of relevance to the game, other than new and unique (read: broken) features that are uncannilly similar to rival competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lol.  Somehow I suspect you're correct, Makelike.  Any questions I asked would probably end up being something they're trying to avoid answering.  I'll go out on a limb and guess I'm not a popular person over there!  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lol.  Somehow I suspect you're correct, Makelike.  Any questions I asked would probably end up being something they're trying to avoid answering.  I'll go out on a limb and guess I'm not a popular person over there!  :)<br />

Chutoi<br />
<br />
<br />
We love you though Chutoi!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We should try to gather some questions we need to ask in advance. It is a lot harder to ignore 30 people then it is to ignore a single person.<br />
<br />
From the top of my head:<br />
<br />
- It has been stated that the ratio between the different priests' heals should be 100/65/45. Are there similar intended ratios for mana regeneration, HP buffing, nuke damage and DoT damage? If so: what are these ratios? If not: why do such ratios not exist?<br />
<br />
- Why do our DoT spells aggro so much more then direct damage spells? Are we intended to use them only while soloing?<br />
<br />
- Why does the Bane line of spells have such a long recast time, given that the spell is similar in power to our other DoT spells?<br />
<br />
- Why can we still not shrink our dogs?<br />
<br />
- Given that stat buffs are all but useless in the high end game are there any plans to make the focus line (or any other of our buff lines) more useful by adding non-capped effects to them?<br />
<br />
I will post more as I remember them. It is getting a little late here.</div></div><hr />
