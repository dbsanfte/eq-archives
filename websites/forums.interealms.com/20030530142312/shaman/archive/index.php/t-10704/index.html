lol<br />
<br />
tone down the coffee a bit there mate...<br />
<br />
Your angry outburst reminds me of a story...  A long time ago I was in Karnors hunting the Jade Mace dropping Captain for cash with a group.  Well we lose our cleric but we still have myself and a druid when another shaman states he is looking for a group at zone.  Hey I welcome this as this was before the days you could easily buy a form of clarity.  <br />
<br />
So up comes this shaman very much like I described above.  I asked his wis and he stated something like 190s with an AC at least 100 below mine (I think I had 900 then).  And on the first mis spawn where we gained agro from respawns I started slowing and our tank when LD so I get agro as well as the other shaman for healing.... Ill let you guess who made it out of KC from that camp and who didnt make it past the bottom of the stairs.<br />
<br />
I realize people dont need to walk the most efficient path but it doesnt mean I dont get to laugh at them.</div></div><hr />

GEBs, Coldain Skin, They both seem fine to me untill I get into some Thurg Quest boots...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gebs have lousy ac, no hp or sta, in exchange for wis.<br />
<br />
I own a pair of gebs, but use them only for tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
For regular use, I wear barbed dragonskin, which has 35hp 9 sta or something like that... only 19ac, which is why  I want to replace them.<br />
<br />
Basically a person who chooses gebs is choosing wis &gt; hp/ac, which at the end game, isn't the most efficent route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To be honest what I hate the most about them is the way they look.  They are so damn ugly.<br />
<br />
Second reason is that there are so many other boots out there that are much better than GEBs and cost less.<br />
<br />
A shaman who utilizes regen and cann doesnt really need  wisdom about 150 or so.  At 58 my wis is 185 or so and I am looking to change some pieces so I can have more hps.  <br />
<br />
As you progress in the game you will come to the realization that AC/HP &gt; Wis.  Shamans get beat on alot.  That is what we do.  With a wis of 200+ and no AC or HP gear you are not much better off than an enchanter.  <br />
<br />
Max defense along with AC/HP gear means you live longer when you agro a MoB that quads for 500+.<br />
<br />
Having 80% mana as opposed to 50% mana doesn't mean much when your dead.</div></div><hr />

So after hearing him yell in all caps about the 4th time &quot;61 SHAMMY HERE!!&quot;,  I turned around and said &quot;damn, you look so pretty!&quot;.<br />

I stand and take a beating and even enjoy offtanking at times though not for too long.<br />
I've just recently managed to break the 1000ac/2200hp self buffed mark.Even if you offered me all the plat in Norrath I'd never give up 100 of that ac for more wis.<br />
<br />
I came and sat here nearly 12 months ago and lurked reading what I could. To try and glean some good pointers on shaman as  Moyes was being born that may help him out. The first and most important lesson I learned was ac/hp = I live, I live = I slow, I slow = group lives. The fact that also meant I have more mana than I can shake a stick at was a bonus.<br />

Having 200+ wis is all very well but it means bugger all when you sat at your bind point.</div></div><hr />

If it works they move on and live to slow another day, if not.. the cleric rezzes em back and my point is further reinforced. <br />

These GEB's they perhaps got when camping in the Sol B, otherwise they wouldn't even perhaps have these. In any case I have more respect to that person, who is in ****ty gear but higher level and is still effective - despite his/her crappy gear, he/she is still on par with others.

Now, i don't come from an uber guild (acctually not even guilded atm, and my old guild enver did a thing to help us get gear), but with the money i scrounged up, i think i found a good mix of gear that any shaman would find respectable. if i can do it, anyone can.<br />

<br />
When I was a newbie shaman(1-50ish), NOT wearing (or wanting to wear) GEBS was STRONGLY counter-culture!  All the &quot;uber&quot; shamans of the time advocated GEBS as the ultimate in shammy footwear.  It took a LOT of prodding, arguing, and convincing to get shamans to come around and realize that AC/hps matters more than wis.  I was part of that movement, and am proud to say that I've never ever worn a pair of GEBS.<br />
<br />
Now that GEBS are outta fashion, it just tickles my funny bone to see a statement like Krup's!   :D   Used to be that advocating something with AC/hps over wis would get the same kind of disapproval from the shaman community.  <br />
<br />
OH, and I agree that shamans who wear GEBS do get beaten HARD and OFTEN.  You know who you are, and you know that I'm right.  :p</div></div><hr />

    Friend of mine (shaman) strove for wis i strove for hps's/ac stam and all that. Funny part is with my latest two uprades which put me finally over 1k ac and more wisdom than his wisdom gear and couple hundred ac not to mention the hps. <br />
 <br />
   My though people can wear what they want doesnt mean i have to understand why they would go the wis route for a class that takes some hits for sure. But i dont tease them about it and posting here about it probably not such a big deal since no names were named. <br />
<br />
  Last thought dont wear the wisdom. I didnt buy gear for the wisdom in it just kinda happens and bear form and c3'ed was shocked to see a wis of 252. No wis on my feet,  one finger, arms and minimal wis on neck. Next upgrade will add 8 more wis just cuz its there. Anyway talking about my char more than i want too. Just wanted to prove a point wis will add up on its own. All droppable gear except thurg helm.</div></div><hr />

I don't care whether you're an enchanter,shaman or any other class. Every so often you get aggro, it happens. You get a bad run on resists and have to atempt slow a couple of times, you'll gain aggro no matter what. It may only be for a second or 2 but in that time you can lose 30% of your health.<br />

You run out of mana, why and how? We have this litle line of spells called Cannibalize. It converts our health into mana. Ooops sorry you can't cani down to far because if you do, you may get low health aggro and your wis isn't going to help you there is it?</div></div><hr />

 I never tended to play the easy as piss exp mobs, when we fought, we fought very hard, dificult places, so yes, I ran out of mana. I don't care how cool ya think you are, if you are fighting a tough battle, it can happen. And remember, this isn't can5 with torpor. I also tended to be the primary healer, as we had no guild clerics.(ten person guild maybe, all drunks)<br />
<br />
 Sure, billy joe uber shaman_105 with temple of pimp gear and 125,000,000 platinum in the bank doesn't have to choose between wisdom and ac and stuff, but alot of casual players did, and do.<br />
<br />
 I freely admit I am way behind the times, but I simply never had trouble with ac. Has there been a damn test yet that actually shows how much damage you mitigate?<br />
<br />
Look, I just think it is silly for people to preach the best way to play, when 99.9% of them go through their EQ existance following the path of least resistance. You know exactly what to do, where to go, what to buy, how to do it safely. That wasnt my style, and I am not WRONG for doing things my way. I happen to like efreeti boots, so what? Best armor I ever owned was iksar hate plane armor, so what? That make me a worse player because I didn't invest as much time? I think it makes a player better, because they learn to rely on their small group tactics, gutter shaman abilities, and to think outside of the box, not min-max. a group of trained monkeys with enough time can handle any EQ mob, doesnt mean the monkeys are smarter then baboons like me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before mill bashing begins, which it always does, once again, I admit I am behind the times, am stubborn, and long for the earlier days of EQ when things were hard, and people did new stuff rather then follow the path to l33tness.<br />

LOL or all of your health in that one or two seconds regardless of your AC...with the right MOB. :) <br />

Or you can play in a risk-free, low-threat, slow-paced environment where KEI and occasional cannibalize keep you in the 80% plus mana range.   I think Mill was referring to a challenging scenario. If you think cannibalize keeps you from running out of mana, you need to find a tougher venue. Cannibalize helps you recover mana more quickly - high wisdom pool allows you to go a little longer before you need that faster mana recovery.  Low HP and slow health regen hurt the canni process while AC, in cases of aggro, help preserve some health.  <br />

I have seen totaly pimped out in gear shaman play like garbage, while a gutter shaman played perfect, and vice versa. Player matters way, way more then gear. I am sure many of you are superb shaman, and it wouldn't matter one iota what the hell you are wearing. I am also sure there is a few schlups among you who have great gear, but just don't get it. Facts of life.<br />

This isn't even counting if you get a resist.  Seriously, ever mob that I face, depending of course on who the MT is (a warrior I will always take agro after slow and keep it for a few secs after cripple, SK and Pallies it just depends but will always take it after cripple if not for a split sec or more).  But, because I'm a more AC/HP type of guy, it doesn't bother me.  Heck, I was in PoV and this stupid add wouldn't stay rooted for more than a minute, so the cleric just told me to sit there and tank it till the first one was dead.  Not possible if you don't have decent hp and ac gear.  I have a good two shamans in my guild (including the main, lvl 65 one) that are straight wisdom and will not....and I repear will not...attempt slow until after the MT has gained sufficient agro on the mob.  Therefore, mob engages and MT has already had his first CH by the time that they cast.  Heck, I will malo on the pull and immediately slow and then cripple as soon as it will let me start casting again.  Not possible without decent hps because the mob will run through you quickly.  And besides, when you start building your hp/ac gear, you will easily get wisdom on it too.  I set a stand of 175wis that I was comfortable keeping, since I usualy have KEI on at all times.  Well, after upgrading, I found that my wisdom kept increasing higher without really meaning it to.  I am not in an uber guild, nor am I in one right now that even attempts Vindi (don't ask...it's a sore spot for me since I want that damn BP more than anything). <br />
<br />
And I challenge anyone out there to find me a good buyable upgrade for me.  I have plenty of money in the bank right now (thanks to gaining and selling alot of metallic liquids, and for selling MQing of parchments) but I cannot find anything for sale at this time that I think will be an improvement for me.  Spent alot of time in HoT and didn't once see the legs or bp drop, and like I said about the Vindi BP.  I'm a little bit concerned about my arms and boots...although I want to head to PoM to do the boot quests, but I'm a little bit concerned with being stuck around there or dying without a rez, not to mention even getting inside there.</div></div><hr />

You're right in saying that the most important thing is the player and not the &quot;toon&quot;. That's why this forum was set up a place where players can congergate and share ideas. If you choose not take them on board that is your perogative. If someone offers me advice I listen and analize it. If I feel it's of no use then I keep playing the way I have. I don't start foaming at the mouth because someone had the audacity to share their opinion with me. Advice is afterall nothing more than taking past experiences out ot he rubbish bin, dusting them off and recycling it for more than it's worth.<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem to me that you have a problem with wearing or not wearing the boots/gear. More that you have a problem with others expressing an opinion you disagree with.<br />

I've always advocated balance.  Some people go too far on the wis and their gear looks like **** when it could be decent with the same amount of effort/resources.  Some people go too far into the AC/hps and their manapool is about the size of a teaspoon and they can't do much casting-wise, learn skills more slowly, and fizzle too much.  I've always said, with 150ish wis, a shaman can cope adequately with anything the low to mid level game can throw at him.  After gaining that much wis, work for more durability, as there will be situations where you need every bit of staying power to keep yourself and your group alive.  Gear DOES matter.  Sorry Mill, but it does.  I do hope you get to be at least lvl 60 before you quit/delete this char.  You'd gain a bit of perspective and be able to relate a bit better to the high level game.  KEI in the nexus should help you get there fast.  I'd use the hell outta that resource and solo up fast as you can! Or duo or whatever.  With your knowledge of how to play the low end to middle game, you should be able to do quite well.  <br />

My question is, how do you know how much damage your extra AC mitigates vs how much mana you lose? And remember, if you have 460 wisdom anyway, it doesnt really matter, for most high levels, it doesnt matter, you got pimp ac/wis/hp/mana/resist gear all on at same time, this really only applies to casual players who dont raid, right?<br />

Yes but now you mute my argument once you include causal, non raiding players.  It is true that the best gear in the game has good AC/HP and Wis.  My best gear has all three in very nice quantities.<br />
<br />
I am also not saying to get rid of them.  I dont think I ever said to get something else cause GEBs suck, because they dont suck.  There are just better options imho for a shaman to choose from.<br />
<br />
My point was however that if you do aspire to reach the Planes a gear change  will be inevitable.  <br />
<br />
I personally think you could go from 1-60 with banded if you wanted to.  Regen, and cann are what make that happen.  <br />

I have a pair in the bank that I use for tradeskills.  And I do often see many shaman running around in Gebs, and never understood why.  The stats were crap on them.  They got some wis is all, other than that they pretty much do nothing if you are getting beat on.<br />
<br />
I know a few shaman that don't understand the importance of AC and HP.  And yes, they don't mind getting a rez, and often have a cleric in the group to do it.  But for those of us out in the remote lands, killing mobs noone wants, a rez can be a royal pain in the butt.  Its just better not to die.<br />
<br />
And I was cheap, and use tribal war boots.  Got some thurg boots I still need to go get, so at least I get an upgrade.  Most of my gear is junky handmedowns.  But Gebs had very little to offer for the value.  Other than using for tradeskills, then they are worth every penny.</div></div><hr />

I dont think it's lame to see Shaman with GEBs on.  I think it's lame if these Shaman are bragging about them, or recommending them to others but that's a different story.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">One of the above posters has a point... once you move into the higher end gear, wis comes naturally.<br />
<br />
For instance, The Girdle of Mithandrael... 10 wis, 50 hp, 10 sta... <br />
<br />
Or Wolf Caller's Leggings... etc etc etc<br />
<br />
At the post 60 game, a shaman who is still in wis-only gear, like gebs, is either a) lazy, b) unwilling to make even the smallest wis sacrifice for hp, c) a bot of some melee.<br />
<br />
There are far too many good combo gears out there that offer both wis AND hp... for instance, glassy frog eye, +5wis +40hp for an earring... tae ew ritualist's mask, +7 wis +40 hp...<br />
<br />
etc etc etc<br />
<br />
My wis is about 248, but I would gladly sacrifice 48 wis points for some serious hp gear. I probably would never have to make that trade off, being a kitty who put her starting points into wis, gives me 120 base wis to begin with, a distinct advantage in that department over my troll and ogre cousins. (Since my sta clocks in at 260 self-buffed, I'm glad I didn't put it in sta.... sta over 255 gives less hp per sta)<br />
<br />
The funny thing is there's a shaman in my guild who's part of a duo team. She's been in the game 3 years, and her unbuffed hp is 1780. I've been in the game about 10 months, and my unbuffed hp is 2440, and could go higher if I had about 40k, my guild ever got vindi, or I ever found drusilla up.<br />
<br />
<br />
And we're not even a ntov guild.<br />
<br />
So when she dies and gets rezzed, she needs focus to do her first canni V.<br />
<br />
When I die and get rezzed, I can get a torpor off, then canni V and still have 500 hp left over.<br />
<br />
Since she has had the same choices as me in terms of available gear, it's all about what choices you choose to make.</div></div><hr />

Very true. LOL<br />
<br />
Ok I am not the best shaman in the game and have been playing off and on for 3 years now, but I know one thing, I play how I know how to play, my equipment is what I can either afford or get lucky enough to loot.  To have someone else tell me that I don't know how to play my shaman just proves that they don't have the slightest idea what they are talking about, because I am me, you aren't.  I have a pair of GEBs and I do wear them from time to time while hunting, but I do wear them when I know my group, if I am soloing I wear my Tribal War Boots, if I have compentant tanks then I wear my wis gear because even if I get agro they will pull it off me or the chanter will mez it off me and the cleric will heal me or I will heal myself.  What I am trying to say is that no one can tell anyone how to play, they can give &quot;advice&quot; and then the player can either listen or not, if they listen then they will formulate their own methods and play how they want to play, if they don't guess what they will still play how they want to play.<br />

Give me all the advise you want and I will listen, tell me what to do and I will ignore.<br />

But on another note, as has been stated earlier, wis shaman that continue to level will eventually restructure their gear.  Personally, once you are over 1000 AC unbuffed its time for more wis and mana and hp gear.  My goal is to get 1100 AC, 305 wis, and as much mana and hp gear possible.

Dunno what planet you're from (ur-anus maybe), but generally speaking, when someone is being made fun of, that someone will retaliate. This is human nature.<br />

So up comes this shaman very much like I described above. I asked his wis and he stated something like 190s with an AC at least 100 below mine (I think I had 900 then). And on the first mis spawn where we gained agro from respawns I started slowing and our tank when LD so I get agro as well as the other shaman for healing....

But what can't be seen are the pair of Platinum Jasper or Velium Jasper rings. That IMO, is way worse (as far as stats go) when it comes down to it. 12 to 14 Wis, vs at the least 12 AC 130hps (assuming they get the cheap Velium Fire Wedding Rings (6AC 65Hps)).<br />
<br />
But GEBS dont make me ponder or even laugh as much as when I see a Shaman holding a Testament of Vanear in one hand and a Spirt Tome in the other. Mainly cause they actually did the quest to get that piece of crap!(Testament).  Of course, I admit I did get a ToV back before the Kunark Expansion came out and when I was pre lvl 20 and that was a suggested item to get at that time hehe.<br />

One, wear wisdom until you get canni, then slowly start getting hp/ac.<br />

Two, start out with hp/ac gear and save yourself lots of money.<br />

I guess third would be: wear wis gear and get chuckled at as if you were wearing spandex.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wis is for druids and clerics. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I don't understand why low armour high wis is a valid strategy pre-planes (presumably preplanes means low damage hitter mobs).<br />
<br />
In my group I slow mobs when they are incoming rather than waiting for the main tank - a warrior - to build aggro.  The MT may have good damage mitigation, but reducing the mobs attack rate by 75 percent mitigates it a lot more.  That means more mana for the healers for other stuff.  Seems like high wis/low ac would be bad for this.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the puller pulls 3 or more mobs at once.  Deliberately: its more efficient that way sometimes.  I know then Im going to get some aggro, because Im going to slow them all as fast as I can and I can only root one of them on incoming, before they reach party members.  I don't even look at my hps, I target mobs, I slow em.  The cleric keeps me alive and he likes me slowing them fast so he never gets an unslowed mob aggroing on him.  Again how would high wis/low ac help me here.<br />
<br />
Now after all this, Im on a horse, I have a mana preservation foci item.  I can get mana back fast so I have lots to spare to do more damage.  All this despite a wisdom of around 160.  So I DoT, I nuke, and this gets me more aggro.  Again I don't see how wis would help me.<br />
<br />
In fact the only downside I seem to see from my lowish wisdom is that I fizzle a little bit more.</div></div><hr />

 I think the big reason most people are so gung ho ac rather then wisdom, is that they forget what it is like to be lower level.<br />
<br />
I never made it past 54, and I never, ever died with mana to spare(well, actually I did, but usually cause of dumbness), think I had 196 wisdom. I played as primary healer for our group, often botting enchanter too, things just dont hit hard enough for it to really matter at that level. I come from a  totally different perspective, I try my hardest to avoid and control aggro, I always figured it is stupid of me to tank when other classes can do it better. Trutch be told, I was a much better slower with my enchanter, rune 5, tash, stuns, roots, decent slow, left the healin to shaman. Or would fire a tash and a slow from shaman simultaniously, worked real nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't pretend to know what the high level stuff is like, I never did more then POG, but for alot of people out there, GEB's are just fine, and I love the look of em.<br />

Not everyone gets to the higher levels guys, and that isnt a bad thing, not like we dont know the game or have mental issues, just dont have the time. I did alot of things first, things that are silly now, but are the exact same things fires of heaven do, just not scaled up. Time + numbers do not equal skill all the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
It really sounds like, with can 5 and torpor and all that weirdness, you dont have as much need for mana pool, but the people who say that usually have 200 + wisdom, 5000 + ac, 10000 hps unbuffed, so like, what is their point? They dont have to choose.<br />

Quote: I never tended to play the easy as piss exp mobs, when we fought, we fought very hard, dificult places, so yes, I ran out of mana. I don't care how cool ya think you are, if you are fighting a tough battle, it can happen.<br />
<br />
I'd argue that that's the kind of a situation where you really see the difference between ac/hp and wisdom shaman. On a raid where mobs are hitting for 800+, an extra 100ac or 300 hitpoints isn't gonna make a helluva lot of difference if you catch agro. In your average, boring single-pull PoP group, waiting a few seconds to slow because you don't want to catch agro isn't a big deal. <br />
<br />
It's the tough battles where you're trying to keep your chanter/cleric alive, root parking or off-tanking adds, dropping an AoE slow to take the heat off of an enchanter doing crowd control, etc. that ac/hp becomes important. Of course, that's also the only time that your max wisdom comes into play... I guess it's a personal choice, but in that situation I always seem to be catching agro and I'd rather be able to take a few hits than have a bigger mana pool. What good is a huge mana pool if you have to constantly duck agro? <br />
<br />
I'm certainly not one to talk uber equipment (heck, still wearing JB boots at 61), but the distain for GEBs for a lot of people goes back to the pre-velious days. Back then, if a shaman had spent 10k on a pair of yellow boots, you pretty much knew that he has 200 wisdom and couldn't take a hit (or that he was a bot, if not both). Those were the shaman that bragged about 200 wisdom and rolled their eyes when I told 'em mine was 140. <br />
<br />
The good natured ribbing back and forth between the two schools of thought goes way back, and back then it really was a heated debate. The fact that some of us still chuckle over a shaman wearing GEBs isn't a big deal but let me leave you with one thought....<br />
<br />
I've never, in all my time reading the crucible, seen a shaman post that he switched over to ac/hp gear, didn't like it and switched back.</div></div><hr />

I was never super high level. Tough mobs for me did NOT hit for 800's.<br />
<br />
There is a ton of people out there who don't raid, arent level 60, and dont have malo and torpor and can 5.<br />
<br />
For them, GEB's are just fine.<br />
<br />
And dont give me the wisdom shaman at 19 getting beat down, jesus, thats just silly. At level 19, a shaman has a  spell called root, its a neat spell, keeps the critter at a safe distance. I assume at level 19 you are not fighting a quad hitting 800 smacking mob. Unless you actually twinked out, not gonna matter much at all wisdom or ac at that level. 50 more ac gonna mitigate what, 20 damage a fight? I see idiots even now at level 40 + without maxed defense, but swearing up and down their twinked uber ac gear makes them a tank. I can tank better with a caster.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it is playstyle, I have seen shaman that don't give a rat's ass about aggro, and those that try and avoid it, the tough guys brag and brag and brag, but it's the careful ones I have seen perform the best. I don't want the shaman to get hit, I want the tank to. Seen alot of enchanters do the same thing, go all ac/hp gear, and low and behold, the dummies run out of mana, even with ToT, ya, good thing that chanty was tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
And once again, remember, I am coming from a 55 and down level perspective, non-raiding, which believe it or not, alot of people do.  I have said this many times to try and get my point across.

Diary, Me Grun. <br />
<br />
Grun have interesting day today. That last pixel of white still blink at Grun, but me think it never go away. Oh well. <br />
<br />
Me was in good mood all day, until late. Puny friend Krup (Shammy lvl 50 Barbie), take Grun to OOT and we get Grun Ebon spear. So me happy. Krup good guy for puny Barbarian. <br />
<br />
Me bouncing along all day, doing normal Grun stuff. Me buff newbie troll, me scold humies harrassing bashers,'dat sort stuff. <br />
<br />
Me saving up to try for hoop again so me go Rathe to kill HG. Me see guildmate Rashana. She smart Erudite Wiz. She killing HG. She skinny, so me buff her good and we chat. Then me buff me and me go get a giant. Me say &quot;Hello Mr. Giant, let's have a chat&quot;, so he come to Grun to chat about weather and stuff. <br />
<br />
Remember, it long time ago Grun learn some these spells. And Troll no like admit, but we not smartest in Norrath. Anyway, me get giant and me root me like planned. Hmmm... me think something wrong. Me cast root, giant move but me no move. Me got headache from thinking too hard about it. <br />
<br />
Me kite no working good. HG no get far away. Me health go down fast, and me doggie too far away to care (he was doing doggie stuff). Then me realize &quot;Hmmm... maybe me head not hurt from thinking too much. Maybe me head hurt because giant hittin' it?&quot; <br />
<br />
So me panic. Me type &quot;/tell Rashana Heljp!&quot;, just like that. <br />
<br />
She no see where Grun is, so me stand there and do nail to his hammer. 'Dat no fun! BONK! BONK! BONK! <br />
<br />
Finally, root break (lousy root! me should root better than 'dat!), me get sow on me and me run to Rashana. She help Grun. Me live, giant die, me get loot. <br />
<br />
So diary, me sad after such a good day. Me root self like stupid Barbie, me cry for help like a sissy elf, then me hide behide skirt of skinny girly wiz. Me so ashamed! <br />
<br />
But tomorrow be 'nother day. Me go have a Gnome sandwich and me try forget it. <br />

There are other ways to solo at 19th lvl than rotting and the most efficient way includes tanking the mob (assuming low blue cons). <br />

Exactly, it's a difference in playstyles. Some people don't mind taking agro others do. It's almost like playing two different classes. You just miss the fact that, especially in dungeon crawls, there's often very good reasons for a shaman to take agro from people like a cleric or chanter. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">I used to think the same way you did Mill, but circumstances are different now. You play with your drinking buddies. I'm in a guild that was small potatoes and now wants a taste of the big time. After doing Kael, then PoG, then Halls of Testing, we killed Vindi our first time out and are now hungry for some more big boss blood. I still fart around with blacksmithing too much to progress beyond Tier 1 in PoP, but the bulk of my guild is making that jump. It's not a guild of powergamers either. <br />
<br />
Along the way I got upgraded from Jaundice/Totemic/Ry'Gorr to Tae Ew/Nightmare Chain and am pounding out Tae Ew shields and AC 45+ BPs for my guildies. This is some exciting ****. Sure you have some fun times in ghetto gear, but when you start putting on the nice stuff you wonder why you worked so damn hard with so little before.<br />
<br />
There's times when things go bug**** and your chanter can't control the mob chaos. You piss off a mob that hits for 250+ who summons you and won't let you go. The other groupies are trying to kill the other mobs off quick so that they can get to yours. In the meantime you got this thing slowed but all you can do is stand there and take the beating. Wouldn't you rather have that high AC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">If you don't have good ac why bother with a shaman.  Just get a chanter to slow and they can do CC also, or a cleric to heal.  A shaman without ac is no better then a druid.<br />
<br />
A shaman that does not take advantage of AC at the lower levels is only half a shaman.  The only time AC becomes less important is after you get to the upper game where the mobs have such high attack numbers that a good AC will mitigate no more then a bad AC.<br />
<br />
Having to sneak around with a low ac in a group is just garbage.  A good shaman wants to be on the top of every hate list except the one the main tank is working on.  It is much better for the shaman to be sitting in that position then either the cleric or the chanter and I view it as my personal responsibility to make sure that I get hit instead of the enchanter every single time.<br />
<br />
I don't give a flip what level you are....  if your chanter gets pounded on instead of you then you stink as a shaman.  If you save your chanter with a heal then you stink as a shaman because the mob should be poinding on you instead.  If you dress like a panzy so that you can have a big mana pool then avoid agro because you are scared to get hit... you need to ride on the short buss.<br />
<br />
It is not just a matter of style it is a matter of taking full advantage of the abilities that the shaman class has at it's disposal.  If you neglect you AC then not only do you stink at soloing in comparison to an in your face shaman...  you are very limited in how effective you can be in a group.<br />
<br />
High wis is not just an alternative way to play,  it is a stupid way to play. If you are a wis shaman at the expense of ac / hp,  you don't dance in a group you just hop around because you have amputated one of your own legs.<br />
<br />
Do I run out of mana in group?  Yes... at the same time I run out of health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Bennan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I am a Level 34 Shaman, and I have not bothered at all with AC hp's, and mainly look at Wisdom.  This is just laziness, as I climb levels I will look towards a more balanced approach.<br />
<br />
Maybe this will change when I get up to the 50's, but for now I have had zero problems with aggro, as in I never get aggro.<br />
<br />
Only players I have noticed at these low levels that do get aggro, are those that Slow dot nuke etc almost straight away.<br />
<br />
Also, I would like to add I have grouped with alot of shamans (I always have actively seeked out shamans to group with) with my cleric as I climbed from levels 50 to 60.  In that time I have grouped with Wis Shamans and AC/HP shamans etc.  The best Shamans I have grouped with are those that strive for a balance between HP's AC and WIS.<br />
<br />
And no matter who they are (or whatever belief they follow), they always need at least once a quick heal here and there to keep them alive.  And no matter what belief they follow, bad players always need constant healing.<br />
<br />
Is this just not like the old AC arguement, when you have players that just go AC AC AC (this is in relation to melees), or nowdays the HP HP HP belief so many players have.  Even if it means lowering resists consideribly....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cannabilize does not mitigate the need for a decent sized Mana pool.  Most of the extra AC you ahve piled is doing absolutely nothing for you against PoP Mobs.  <br />
<br />
You can slow on pull everytime and still get little or no aggro, play with better tanks if you are getting hit that much.  If you are sitting at 80% mana all the time, you should try contributing more to your group or get a faster puller.<br />
<br />
A good balance is where it is at, but it is not difficult to have good (1000+) AC with maxed Wis when you get into your late 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">In lower levels I tended to wear +6 Wis Rings, switching them out against 6ac 65hp rings once the pulling was in Progress, putting them back on during med breaks.<br />
<br />
There is no difference between your Actual Mana floating between 4000 and 2000 mana and your Mana floating between 2000 and 0 mana. Excess Wisdom is wasted once your actual mana falls under the threshold of mana Wisdom gives you.<br />
<br />
Now there are different people playing their character differently. I was a Wisdom Shaman in my teens, most often mainhealer. I needed a larger manapool because my Mana regeneration wasnt that great and because I didnt have enough time during fights to cannibalize while patching up Tanks with my inferior heals.<br />
<br />
In higher Levels, when my actual healing ability couldnt stand up to Tanks anymore (that was in the 40s, before Superior healing or - god forbid - Chloroblast) I was relegated from healer duty to Debuffer/Ghetto-CC/Damage Dealer duty. My main focus switched from avoiding aggro to actually gaining aggro (to rootpark/protect the Casters from adds/etc). My gear focus for that role was to actually being able to survive the aggro until the situation was under control and my regeneration kicked in to repair the damage, so that I could spare the Healer mana (theres no point in taking aggro away from the Casters if the Cleric has to heal you for the same ammount he would have had to heal them in the first place). <br />
This slowly shifted into HP/AC gear to survive the rising ammounts of damage the mobs and my Cannibalizes did, but up to then most of my items had varieties of HP/AC/wis, so there wasnt much of a choice to make even without being in a raidguild. (talking Midfifties/60s here).<br />
<br />
Did I have a problem while having a large Manapool and low AC? Did I have a problem wearing high AC gear without stats?<br />
<br />
No, at both times I did play my character somewhat differently and was satisfied with the roles I filled.<br />
<br />
Different people play their character differently, different situations need different gear.<br />
<br />
In my mind (and thats a very personal opinion, so no offense meant) somebody who is religiously into AC can run into the same problems somebody only into wisdom gear has. Variabiliy dictated that you have the right gear for the right situations if possible, but when you have to choose you choose the thing you personally are most comfortable and successful with!<br />
<br />
You are both wrong when you die all of the time while still having much mana to waste and when you are OOM all of the time. In both cases your gear is not balanced for your style of play.<br />
<br />
All of that doesnt change that GEBs are butt ugly and Shaman wearing them should be slain at the princible of their utter lack of fashion sense! :)</div></div><hr />

Mind you, I can only go into places like PoD and PoN, so perhaps the higher tier zones are much more fun.<br />

You will most likely find me duoing in Sebilis, Chardok or Charasis with a monk friend. I like these zones because they look very cool and are almost always quiet these days. Even in a dated expansion, the value of HP/AC over Wis is extremely obvious. I'm a busy Troll alot of the time, what with the slowin' and the root parkin'. Them Frogs, Sarnaks and Skellies may not hit as hard as mobs in PoP zones do, but I honestly don't think I would be able to pull off some of the things I can pull off if I focused on my Wisdom rather than my HP/AC.<br />
<br />
As far as gear... well some is okay but then again my eyes never fail to wander over those damn Crystal Spider Eyes and then cue the blush response. Honestly, I feel I have two much Wisdom and will trade out certain pieces of gear the first opportunity I get.<br />
<br />
I ran into a fellow Troll Shaman on my server who was wearing GEBs and wielding two books. I couldn't understand why he was running around wielding his toilet paper, so I asked him how he managed to live through the fights.<br />
<br />
His response was: I don't.<br />
<br />
Sure, I almost expect to die anytime I whip out Tigir's, but death shouldn't be a regular occurence in an exp group.<br />
<br />
For boots, I picked up the following for around 5k in the Bazaar awhile back:<br />
<br />
Barbed Dragonscale Boots<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: FEET  <br />
AC: 19<br />
STA: +9  HP: +30  <br />
WT:  2.5    Size: SMALL<br />
Class: WAR CLR PAL RNG SHD DRU MNK BRD ROG SHM BST <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
These were a great upgrade to my Tribal War Boots, I'm sure the price has only dropped since then. Really, 5k isn't that much when one trip to Sebilis will net you 1-2k and a trip to PoG will do the same.<br />
<br />
I don't think Shaman wearing GEBs and wielding books are stupid, I just don't understand what they're doing with all that mana.</div></div><hr />

Landragon, get your facts straight, during my last stint in EQ, I was playing two characters, a 56 enchanter at the time(he was later leveld to 58 or 59, forget), and a 54 shaman(iksar), neither one was a bot up untill then, played them both as my main, in addition to my orignal ogre.<br />
<br />
I have played every shaman race but kitty to 25 +, and I have tried a hardcore ac/hp combo and frankly, it sucked and was stupid. I don't get hit much,  I think it is stupid if you do, use your tools.<br />
<br />
I botted off and on chanty and shaman because I had to, our little group had no cleric, one other druid for healing which didnt play much, monk, SK, necro and mage was my friends, we did rather well, but it was difficult playing both CC and healer.(you try doing phinny when kunark first came out, one group, very low 50's, crap gear, playing enchanter and shaman healer, with multiple guardians coming with phin)<br />
<br />
In the sub 55 ish game, non uber raid, gimme a shaman with a big mana pool and I would beat ass on down on one of them ac/hp people, 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
I know it, don't expect anyone else too, so believe me you won't make me cry telling me how wrong I am because some guy says at 19 he got his ass kicked as a wisdom shaman.<br />
<br />
Shaman without a large mana pool is like a terrorist with a little bomb.<br />
<br />
So what other classes now don't you guys think need mana, cleric? Enchanter? Wizard?<br />
<br />
I may not have the real high level experience, granted, but good chance I have a hell of alot more experince at leveling different shaman to medium high levels, and small group tactics. It is the only thing I ever really did, and did it well.<br />
<br />
Funny how somone's playstyle is even subject to attacks. Have 20 friends that play/played EQ, are very smart people, and believe exactly like I do, are they all wrong and stupid as well? hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill = suck at large raids, or uber level encounters.(always said so)<br />
Mill = extrememly good at small group stuff 55ish and down.(the only thing we ever did)<br />

Got a chuckle out of that Mill. From one angle your like damn ubers think ya know everything and than you say something along the lines  of what your telling the ubers not to say. <br />
<br />
 Before you flame me i'm not uber and never been in an uber guild. I also enjoy the small one group see what we can do things and i've pushed my ac and hps up but i have wis and mana too. My opinion is blance is a good way to go. Does it make anyone else right or wrong? nope the beauty of eq more than one way to kill a mob (well usually)</div></div><hr />

What you think some magic fairy dropped out of the sky and handed me some stuff :D<br />
In all seriousness, I earned my licks, I was one of those shaman in a BS tunic and a Charred Guardian Shield, I think that fundamentaly that there is a problem with younger shaman, you can see it abundantly discussed on this board, shaman afraid to cann, shaman that dont slow, etc...<br />
In the end, your right, its your 12$/month, play the game and enjoy it how you will, I just give them not so gentle reminders that there are better ways to do things.</div></div><hr />

Sorry if you are a level 60+ Shaman with 1300 ac and 190 wis you know little or nothing about playing any class in Everquest.  Go get some new equipment and bring up that pitifull mana pool of yours to something at least reasonable.<br />
<br />
I like my mana pool just fine thank you and the equipment I will get will be +hp, not +wis gear because I need mana regeneration not a higher beginning pool.  When I need the higher pool of mana, the equipment looted will have it naturally.  Hp pool is much more important atm, as is ac.<br />
<br />
Cannabilize does not mitigate the need for a decent sized Mana pool.  Most of the extra AC you ahve piled is doing absolutely nothing for you against PoP Mobs.<br />
<br />
Unless chain casting or doing heavy buffing it doesn't mitigate but outright gets rid of.<br />
<br />
A good balance is where it is at, but it is not difficult to have good (1000+) AC with maxed Wis when you get into your late 50s. <br />
<br />
What do you consider max wis?  I'm sitting at about 189 or so with Paludal Beetle crunchies :) and will be at 202 when I put my RE chestplate back on after getting torpor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">About the only time I ever needed more mana was in my lower level days in upper guk with some friends, when I had to heal 4 melees and I was in my 20's. The extra pool helped us live long enough, and break the spawns apart so I could med/canni enough to live another round.  Thats about the only time I have seen a large mana pool come in handy (although what was my &quot;wis&quot; caster wisdom back then lol? 140?). Of course, you would be surprised what 50 ac means at that level. I pounded out some basic warplate for a friends sk, and the massive jump in his tanking ability was easily observed.<br />
<br />
Last night I was on as a friend's warrior, trying to get the last 4 percent of his level so he could go on our HoT raid today. We picked up a 51 shaman for a lil support. One bounced slow, and the guy was a smear... 1300hp, prolly 700ish. That 200 wisdom or whatever he had did him NO good when aggro = death.  AC makes a difference even in the low 50's, as losing hp means you cant can it down, and I can easily tell the difference between the effectiveness of a shaman with 2-300 more ac. If you have to root the mob before slowing it, you do not deserve to be in my group.<br />
<br />
I wont however knock the Paw. Never needed a weapon since my jbb started working, so it was decent ac in prime hand. Most importantly, it overcame the natural 70 agi I began with, so I didnt have to remember to agi buff myself at all times. Ahh, to have slapped 5 into Agi... Of course, I also believed em when they said more dex would help us channel through hits, so dumped a chunk of points into that at 1st level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">I wrote a nice long post, but too long for anyone to actually read.  I'll sum it up like this:<br />
<br />
I don't orient my gear in preparation for getting my ass beat.  Instead, I work harder at not getting my ass beat.  Someone once posted that getting hit is like getting mana drained for 2/3 that amount... I try to avoid it at all costs.  I keep my AC respectable, but if my tank can't hold aggro, we have some work to do.  I two-box with my ranger all the time, and with ensnare and flame lick, I would have to cast Turgur's, E-bolt, and Cripple to gain aggro over those two spells.  I'm not sure why mobs in PoP seem to jump you guys all the time, my one stint in PoP back at level 48 saw me slowing mobs left and right, and I only got aggro a couple times because we had a warrior with typical unreliable taunting.  A pally, sk, or ranger can hold aggro against any shaman spells as long as he is trying, in my experience.  Do the mobs you fight hate slow THAT much more than normal mobs, or are you just slowing super-early due to the damage output?  I would think a couple spells slung by the puller would keep you safe.<br />
<br />
My shaman has never died once in a melee action, and I've worked very hard in groups to save the melees by tanking adds.  When the group is working properly, and everyone is on the ball, a high AC is something that is nice to know it's there, but you should not have to use.<br />
<br />
And no, I don't own a pair of GEBs.  They are overpriced, and unbalanced stat-wise for us shaman.  AC is useful, but I still prefer hp and mana because i can actually do something with them.  Extra AC does absolutely nothing if you aren't getting hit, which is my usual goal.  I will jump in when needed, but that's rare enough that I don't orient all my gear around it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Sorry to say it that bluntly Xanden, but there speaks the experience of too many standard groups!<br />
<br />
There are times without Crowd Controller, there are times without Tank classes, and in those times you ought to be ready to take the hits. Avoiding aggro when aggro is not necessary is wise, having to avoid it at all costs is crippling the functionality of our class.<br />
<br />
Just IMHO, of course!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can slow on pull everytime and still get little or no aggro, play with better tanks if you are getting hit that much.  If you are sitting at 80% mana all the time, you should try contributing more to your group or get a faster puller.<br />
<br />
A good balance is where it is at, but it is not difficult to have good (1000+) AC with maxed Wis when you get into your late 50s. <br />
<br />
Once you hit 60+ AC just doesnt really become much of a factor anymore, yeah getting over 1100ac is wise as it does help a bit against yard trash, but tbh, HPs and Avoidance AA's/mods are more important imho.<br />
<br />
Oh and compare my manapool to other shaman on that magelo comparison list that are around my equipment level, yeah my manapool is somewhat small (3700, was 3200 not that long ago), but running me oom is a feat to be proud of, whilst duoing Hand reports in SSeru yesterday we managed to end up with a 66/67 dual wielding signiferis and the nearby paladin GM (100k hp mob, 400ish max hit, thankfully it was wearing a shield though so only doubling), I tanked the Signiferis for a little till both were fully slowed/snared and was FoM and ready for the next pull when the pally GM finally died =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Oh and I'll add, sorry but I really don't see price being an issue with equipment, if theres a nice bit of equipment that doesnt drop of a raid level mob, its really not that hard to get it, its just pure lazyness imho.  Its annoying to see fellow guildies wearing utter junk and not being prepared to take a little initiative to get out there and work for some nice little upgrades.  Want a dragonwing mantle?  Solo Bratavar, not got the gearlevel/spells to do that?  Np, grab a few friends and burn down the entire nest area for nice armor/twink stuff.  <br />
<br />
Look up quests, things like the spiritwracked cords may well take a fair bit of effort, but theres no need to condem yourself to a 12 hours a day over a week of non stop goblin annihilation, just spend 30 minutes to an hour at the end of the days killing there, it all adds up and you basically end up with 2 items that are as good as if not better than the very highest of raid level items even today.</div></div><hr />
