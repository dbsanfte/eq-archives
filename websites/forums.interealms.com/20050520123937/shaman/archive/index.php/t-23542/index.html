Howdy folks,<br />
<br />
This will indeed be a change that makes it to the Live servers, during our next scheduled update on September 14th.<br />
<br />
We feel that the current implimentation of AE kiting gave bards an unfair advantage in experience gain. It is our opinion that the changes currently on test will resolve this issue, while retaining both the Bards solo abilities and raid utility.<br />
<br />
Sorry folks but no more kiting 20 mobs at a time.<br />
<br />

I've duelled bards 5 times, 2 wins, 2 losses, 1 tie.<br />
<br />
Basically to win any duel you want to pit your strength against your opponent's weakness.<br />
<br />
So against your typical warrior -- with low DR -- VP, disease dots, hide behind tree to avoid arrows, tell funny stories /ooc, and laugh.<br />
<br />
Against your typical enchanter put low level disease dot on self to avoid mezz, put on high MR, get in close for melee, bash, and overwhelm with dps.<br />
<br />
But against a bard -- your biggest strength is dots, and he knows it, and he has a powerful defense against it. He'll be singing resist songs out the wazoo, you'll never land anything on him. Dots against a bard = your strength against his bigger strength = victory for bard.<br />
<br />
But a bard's biggest strength of all is mobility. Don't fight a bard in an outdoor arena. Ever. No point to it: you're going to lose. Any time you try you are putting your weakness against his best strength = victory for bard.<br />
<br />
One weakness of many bards is: they panic easily when you take away their mobility. The trick is to fight in a tight room where it is hard to maneuver. High keep is good for this. Rooms or houses in many zones work fine. Inside a building in Thurgadin is excellent.<br />
<br />
Another weakness of bards is: they really are not that good at melee, offense or defense. If you have worked your melee skills, you could probably match a bard both in dps and in defense. And you are a much better healer than he is.<br />
<br />
My best victory was when I (ahem) let a bard sucker me into a duel in Ice Clad Ocean. Good spot for him, wide open areas to run, great visibility. I bound under water near the gnome village; cast and fully buffed a pet, then suspended it.<br />
<br />
We started the fight a short distance apart. When we said Go, I immediately gated. Then I taunted /ooc that he couldn't kill me because he couldn't even find me.<br />
<br />
Next I used a potion to cast Illusion Gnome, and moved to the gnome village. I went inside an igloo, unsuspended my pet, and told him to guard there. I put a DS on with a potion. I went outside to the door of the next igloo. Kept taunting /ooc. He tracked me down, of course, figured out that I was in the village, finally figured out that I had turned into a gnome, and came charging in on me. I ran inside the igloo to hide. But he knew he had me now, so he came right into the igloo after me.<br />
<br />
I stepped in back of him into doorway of igloo, clicked Rabid Bear, and commenced to melee. In fat old bear I completely blocked the doorway. Selos is worthless when you are locked inside an igloo. With Rabid Bear, maxed 2hb skill, and Bone Shod Great Staff, my melee was about the equivalent of his.<br />
<br />
But Alpha Dogdog, guarding one igloo over, immediately came to help, and started attacking right through the wall of the igloo. Took Mr Bard a moment or two to realize what was happening. He turned to attack the dog, realized that was a mistake, and turned back to hit me again.<br />
<br />
In between swings I constantly cast cancel magic on him, stripping his buffs as quickly as he could re sing them. I had 11 junk buffs up, then a low level disease dot to avoid mezz, plus Focus, Sta and DS. He cancelled 8 of my 11 junkers. Every time he hit me -- and he hit me a lot -- he took damage from the DS. I also cast Malicious Decay on him several times: it's just a debuff, it does no actual damage, but its unresistable so it lands every time. I did that to make him worry about why he wasn't resisting this &quot;disease dot.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had myself wedged hard in the doorway, but he still managed to interrupt me some. Even so, I was able to channel through Spirit Call 3, and 5 more dogs popped into existence. (It was quite crowded inside that igloo by now, but almost everyone there was on my team.)<br />
<br />
I channeled through one Quiescence, and that was enough. Quiescence heals 50 hp per second; bard melee isn't quite that much. If you have backed into a corner or wedged yourself in a doorway, you can probably channel Quiescence at least one time out of three tries.<br />
<br />
But just in case, I had a 10 pack of Stinging Wort set up on a hotkey, for 300 point instant heals if I had gotten down below 30 % health.<br />
<br />
Once the bard came inside the igloo to kill me, it was all over in maybe a minute and a half. He got me down to about 45 before Q hit, but I was back up to 60 and rising when he fell into the snow.<br />
<br />
Also, when he got down to about 25, he stopped fighting and tried to run away, trying to squeeze past me out the door of the igloo. I couldn't hit him well at that point, because I was twisting to make sure I had that door blocked: but the six dogs didn't have any trouble eating him up.<br />
<br />
So. If you're going to duel a bard, find a mobility-restricted environment. Inside an igloo is great, but any small room where you can block the door is fine, as long as you can trap him in there with you. Get a lot of junk buffs up. Give yourself Focus, Sta, a low level disease dot, and a potion damage shield. Plan on doing all your damage with melee and pets. Wedge yourself in so that it's harder for him to interrupt you, so you can heal yourself and get your swarm pets out after he's trapped. You have strong enough heals to overcome his melee damage. He doesn't have strong enough heals to overcome yours.<br />

<br />
Brenlo, get your face out from between your butt cheeks and use the effort you're using to spank bards for GOOD instead of evil! Give Shaman something we can use!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In reply to Ungkor.<br />
<br />
Be glad you only duel and not face them on PVP servers ;) Usually i cannot choose where to fight when i encounter a hostile bard, but youre all right about closed spaces. A bard becomes less of a problem if he cannot move freely. The problem is though, as always, he can mana-drain you, cure everyting you throw at him (unless he resisted it, wich he is likely to do) and sing heal/dot songs in the meantime... he could also snare and mez you if your resists are low...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am sorry but some of the bards are full of crap! The fix (nerf) is to lower the range of PBAE* spells only when the bard is moving! <br />
<br />
So when bard is swinging full tilt in a raid situation the PBAE works like it always has. If you are in a group chain pulling 100's of mobs for AE it works the same. There are a lot of other situations where PBAE remain the same, just not while kiting 50+ mobs for phat exp!<br />
<br />
* Point Blank Area Effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Changed it. Normal range but PBAE do not work for bards if the NPC is moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One issue is what constitutes &quot;moving&quot;.   Either with the bard moving, or the mobs moving.<br />
<br />
Is &quot;push&quot; moving?<br />
<br />
Is taking 2 steps towards you, or towards a wizard nuking moving?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just in case you missed it, that was Macnair that cleverly and skillfully dueled the bard by trapping him in an igloo.  I've never pvp'd in my life, preferring to take my anger out on unsuspecting wildlife and Gods who happen to think they are all 'that'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trapping him in that igloo is probably the next coolest pvp thing i have heard about. :)<br />
<br />
The MOST cool pvp thing i have heard would have been Asta Khaan proccing knockback on a dwarf cleric, sending him flying from the bridge in eastern wastes, landing in the RyGorr fort faaaaar away... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That is a great story, I love hearing about people killing bards.  But it doesn't resemble PvP against bards in any way.  I have absolutely 0 chance against a good bard, and my resists are extremely good.  Bards just have the answer to anything we can do, except bane.  Good luck trying to stick it, cause if he resists it once, you will be out of mana before it refreshes.  Ancient mez should be destroyed forever, and their mana drain is even worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm pretty amazed the bard in the story went into the igloo at all instead of just getting the target and running circles around the guy outside.  A touch of luck goes a long way though :)</div></div><hr />

That is his first reply if you scroll up he started a new thread to explain it all, but this was more on point to your question!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So Charm swarm still works fine, and imo is less mind-numbingly boring than the pbae swarm anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The Hyena Shaman, no one like you on Druid boards and I wish you didn't make dumb comments here. Can't you just play your BST and just shut up.<br />
<br />
Well, Thimblenuts, since you declined to leave a name, I can't discuss with ya in PMs, so, here goes.<br />
<br />
First off, if you feel the need to give a negative bump, PLEASE try to garner enough reputation for yourself to make it show as red, i'm trying to get a Christmas tree going, and I already have plenty of silver.<br />
<br />
Second, nobody liked me on the druid boards, oh, now there's a loss, isn't it? 'Course, nobody liked being proven wrong, so it's to be expected.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, The Beastlord isn't quite as fun as my wizard. Can you say BOOM?! Oh yes. My personal revenge on Frogloks - Whip one up and overaggro EVERY time!</div></div><hr />
