	<p>***I fiddled around and wrote this a few nights ago. Could you guys take a few seconds to read it, then (BEING BRUTALY HONEST) tell me what sucks, what needs to be changed...etc.. I realize your time is important and if I don't get any responses then oh well <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" />. Thanks in advance...***<br />

<b>Chapter 1: A Strange Vision</b><br />
<br />
Darg pulled his tired hands away from the fire and sighed. It had been a long day indeed. All he was thinking about now was dinner…dinner and sleep. <br />
<br />
He walked over to his table and took a bite from the portion of bear meat he had prepared earlier. It was just right, and he more than welcomed the delicious taste. As he chewed heartily, he took a glance at the hearth, where a fire blazed and crackled.<br />
<br />
Lying not far from it was his tracking wolf, Starch, dozing in and out of consciousness. Darg tossed a piece of meat next to him, and it was promptly devoured. <br />
<br />
The month had been hard on the Barbarians, and the snow fell constantly, even now. However, Darg wasn’t concerned with the snow, he had something else on his mind.<br />
<br />
He kept thinking back to the fight he had engaged in earlier that day with Redwind (General of the orcs who followed and defended Lady Vox, the legendary dragon), and his followers. Sure, he had disposed of Redwind without much trouble, but one of the followers had escaped, and for some reason it loomed eerily over Darg’s head. <br />
<br />
He pondered for a while, but couldn’t understand what exactly it was that was troubling him so much. Suddenly, there was a flash of light, and a vision formed right in front of his eyes. <br />
<br />
Being a shaman, he wasn’t all too surprised by this, yet this vision did not seem to be like those he had seen before. There was a small shadow, which swayed back and forth, yet had no definite shape. As the shadow moved and the vision progressed, it took form. The shadow was running towards something, or maybe away from another, either way it seemed to be moving as fast as it could. Although Darg couldn’t tell what exactly it was, he knew it was neither clever nor agile by the way the moved. Instead, it stumbled and lost its balance numerous times…obviously something was troubling it. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Darg’s head cleared, and the vision vanished. As he recovered and tried to make sense of what he had seen, weariness set in. Shrugging it off as nothing, he crawled into bed and tried to push these thoughts out of his head. <br />
<br />
Somewhere out on the frozen tundra, a lone wolf howled. Yet Darg took no notice of this, for he had fallen sound asleep. <br />
<br />
<b>Chapter 2: A Hairy Thief</b><br />
<br />
Morning came too soon, and Darg tried earnestly to go back to sleep. Yet the bright light of the sun through his windows, coupled with the hustling and bustling of people outside his door in the market, persuaded him to rise for the day. <br />
<br />
He pulled himself from his bed and trudged over to the hearth, tossing on a few more logs. As he bent down to wake up Starch, he decided to let him sleep a little longer. After all, it was going to be a long day. <br />
<br />
Passing by his messy kitchen, he made his way to the shower, grabbing a towel and washcloth on the way. The water was the same as it always was, cold as ice and chilling to the touch. Yet he took no notice of this, since Barbarians are, after all, near immune to cold temperatures.<br />
<br />
After showering and doing what little hygenial work Barbarians do, he threw on some clothes and armed himself. Darg and Starch wandered through town, making their way to the raft. <br />
<br />
After a short joyride, they reached the other side, and began their long trek to the outer gate of Permafrost. As they wandered up and began to move more stealthily, Darg felt his pocket move slightly, then go flat. <br />
<br />
He spun around, lunging out his massive arm…only to grasp onto the small arm of dark elf. As Darg began to raise his large hammer, the rogue quickly cried out, “No don’t! I’m not as I seem! Take another look!” <br />
<br />
Instantly the rogue swung his free arm over his face and removed a small mask from it. His image shimmer for a split-second, then formed into that of a halfling. <br />
	<br />
“Oh joy, a lettle annoying halflin' creeture…maybe he doesn't talk much”, though a much displeased Darg. <br />
<br />
He put the little furball down and examined him cautiously, since one can never take their eye off a rogue too long…for fear of getting a dagger through their back.<br />
<br />
“Allow me to introduce myself kind sir!”, squeaked the halfling, “I am known as Fuzz, best pickpocket in all the land.”<br />
<br />
“You did a perty crappy job pick-pocketin' me, why should I think yeh can do it teh others?”. Darg was clearly annoyed with the rather odorous little thing.<br />
<br />
“It’s too cold in this blasted land, I can’t do a darned thing without shivering. It wasn’t my fault, my hand wouldn’t stay still and I accidentally hit the side of your pocket. Believe me or don’t, I’m still the best around!”. <br />
<br />
“That reminds meh, I want meh wallet back, give it back now”.<br />
<br />
“You mean your coin purse?”.<br />
<br />
“IT IS NOT A PURSE, IT IS A WALLET! Call it a purse again and I'll feed yer lettle body to Starch”. Hearing his name and “feed” used within 10 words of each other, Starch trotted over and looked at Fuzz. This apparently made Fuzz uncomfortable, for he quickly moved around, positioning Darg between him and the dog.<br />
<br />
“Terribly sorry..er..uh…what was your name again?”.<br />
<br />
“My name is Darg, and this be Starch, my loyal trackin' wolf, now give me meh wallet back”. <br />
<br />
Becoming even more uneasy, the halfling apologized profusely and handed the wallet over to Darg. As Darg began to walk away, Fuzz trotted behind him, asking him many questions which Darg had no interest in answering. Finally, in frustration, Darg turned to Fuzz and said, “Look, I'm goin' teh hunt Ice Giants. Yeh can come if yeh want, but I'm not going to be held responsible if  yeh get squashed under a giant's foot.”<br />
<br />
Fuzz’s eyes gleamed, and he seemed to brandish a rapier and a short sword from almost nowhere. He quickly shouted, “Then off we go!”, and took off in the direction of Permafrost.<br />
<br />
“Why me, I haven't dun anythin' wrong…I feed meh dog every day and kill those derty goblins. Argh…why is teh Tribunal pissed at me, what did I do wrong?”, thought Darg. And with that, the two began to quickly run in the direction Fuzz had gone in, hoping not to find squished halfling at the end of the Fuzz’s tracks.<br />
<br />

As far as little nit-pickity things go, it could use small work in its format, and word choicing.  For example, instead of "it seems barbarians are immune to cold temperatures", try something more assertive.  Are you finding this out, or telling me?  If its the first one im not sure i want to hear any more, because it makes you seem lost, but if you TELL me what barbarians can/cant do, are/arent immune too, then the story will flow better, and you considered a better story teller.<br />
<br />
And us barbarians arent trolls, we are very well-spoken, thank you very much! <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /></p>

	<p>That's awesome so far. Only recomendations I have are these.<br />
<br />
-Darg's speech resembles ogre talk way too much for my tastes. Personally I've always imagined barbarians as having a scottish kind of accent. Ever seen the movie Braveheart? They remind me a lot of what I imagine barbarians as. They say stuff like ye and yer and all that. When I think of barbarians I imagine a bunch of big men/women dressed in animal furs, with leather armor and metal do-dads if ya know what I mean. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /> That's really the only big problem I have with it. To me, the characters speach defines the character in any book I'm reading. That's why I don't really like books where they all seem to talk the same. That's also why I like the Lord of the Rings books. But it's your story, I don't think I'm the one to tell you what you can and can't do. I'll still read it either way. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /><br />
<br />
-Not really a recommendation, just something to clear this up. Is startch Darg's doggy? <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /><br />
<br />
-Write more! Lol stories about barbarians are some of my favorite. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /> You seem to be very good at writing, so I'd like to read some more when you write it. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /></p>

	<p><b>Chapter 3: Plotting A Defense</b><br />
<br />
Somewhere deep in Permafrost, a flame erupted around the lifeless body of an orc. It rapidly grew, until it was multiple feet high, growing brighter with every passing moment.<br />
<br />
“Rest in peace, me friend…rest in peace…” The low, saddened voice of the goblin was barely audible as he spoke, “I will find the man who did this to you, and I will have my revenge…”<br />
<br />
In ran a smaller goblin, “High Priest Zaharn, you are needed earnestly in…”, yet he stopped cold when he eyed the recovered but burning body of Redwind. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry my Lord…I had no idea you were…”, but he was cut short. <br />
<br />
Eyeing the trembling peon, Zaharn quietly said, “No matter Ghest, I was done anyway, I believe you were saying I was needed somewhere?”<br />
<br />
“Yes my Lord, King Thex Va IV has summoned you and the Priest of Nagafen, it seems to be rather important. Shall you go now, or must I tell him you are busy? Remember my Lord, it does seem urgent”.<br />
<br />
At this Zaharn sighed, “Yes, I will attend this meeting…have you any idea to what it is about?”<br />
<br />
“No sir, I was told nothing.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, lets head out before I change my mind.”<br />
<br />
Ghest went back to work, and Zaharn doggedly made his way to the Meeting Hall. As he reached the chamber, two large ice giant diplomats bowed their heads in reverence and swung open the massive doors. Zaharn quietly made his way up to the large, round, slab of ice that served as a table.<br />
<br />
“Well, Zaharn, I’m glad you could finally join us!”, remarked the King, visibly irked.<br />
<br />
“Save it Thex Va, now why did you summon me here?”<br />
<br />
The King lowered his head, drawing in a large breath. He seemed to be at a loss for words, but he quickly recovered his composure and began to speak. “Our scouts have discovered a large force lodging in Qeynos, I fear they may be coming to try and slay us. They number well over 40, and are a diverse bunch. Even though our scouts have informants among the corrupt Qeynos guards, they couldn’t gather any names, so we don’t know who their leader is. What do you say we should do?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn drew a quick breath and was about to speak when the Priest of Nagafen quickly piped up, “I am sure Lord Nagafen will send some of his best to defend you, after all, he would do anything to protect Lady Vox.”<br />
<br />
Zaharn cast a cold glance at the giant, who immediately silenced himself. Though small, Zaharn was known to be one of the strongest magic users on the continent of Antonica, and not many would dare to anger him. “Even if Lord Nagafen sends 1000 of his best, it would take them at least a fortnight to get here, and that is simply time we haven’t got if the King’s story is indeed true.”<br />
<br />
The situation truly looked grave for them, and they all were deep in thought. All of a sudden, Zaharn looked up and glanced over at the King. “We will send a pair of our strongest giants to Qeynos, they will be the deciding factor in this battle.”<br />
<br />
The King looked puzzled, “And what purpose will they serve by doing this Zaharn?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn had a crafty grin on his face, “If there is indeed a large force at the city, then our giants will surely perish. Yet if the defenses at Qeynos are normal, the giants should have little trouble causing sufficient damage. Either way, we win. Either the giants die because of the added fighters at the city and we know to prepare for an attack, or they cause a large ruckus and come back to report that no one was there to resist. Plus, the large force (if there is one) will surely want to stay and help repair the city and heal the wounded. So it delays their attack on us.” Zaharn turned to the Priest, “Priest, send a messenger to Lord Nagafen and have him send us 10 of his strongest giants. They will tide us over until we know for sure whether or not we need prepare for an attack.”<br />
<br />
“It shall be done.” And with that the Priest bowed his head, and left the chamber.<br />
<br />
The King was indifferent to Zaharn’s idea, but glowered as he spoke, “You better not piss of the Lord by requesting such a large number of units, he would surely delight in disposing of us and setting up his own dungeon for the Lady to stay in. He always did want her to be nearer to him.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t mock me Thex Va, I know what I’m doing. You may be King, but I am wiser and much more experienced in battle, never forget that.”<br />
<br />
These words angered the King, and he grimaced and left the room, mumbling as he went.<br />
<br />
Zaharn smiled to himself and went back to his own chamber, where he resumed his work. He stared at the runes and back at his reference sheet, trying to decipher the rest of the code. “Blast those damned elves, must they make these runes so hard to understand! No matter, once deciphered and put onto a scroll, they will form a spell which will stand alone as the most powerful ever. None will be able to oppose me then, not even Lady Vox or Lord Nagafen…”<br />
<br />
Yet it was a mistake for him to say this aloud, for the eyes and ears of the Lord were everywhere, even in that room. Silently and unnoticed, a small creature crawled from the room, and slid away into the darkness of the corridors.</p>

	<p>Hey Garf,<br />
<br />
I would get rid of the hygene part and the shower, change it to something like splashing himself quickly with cold water from a bowl near his bed, something like that.  <br />
<br />
Didn't know they had showers in Halas, unless it was a Giligan Island type shower haha<br />

	<p><u><center><b>Chapter 4: A Frozen Prison</b></center></u><br />
<br />
THUD! The corpse of a massive Ice Giant came crashing to the ground. It had been three days since Darg, Starch, and Fuzz had set out towards Permafrost, and they were now just arriving. <br />
<br />
Darg grimaced, “I travel three days teh get teh this craphole and all the cash yur carryin’ is a few lousy platinum! Yeh cheap son-of-a-bi...”, but he was interrupted by the halfling.<br />
<br />
“Shhh…I hear something, please, be quiet!” Slowly, Fuzz lowered his ear to the ground, not minding the cold snow. “There’s three of em…no wait…two. By God, they’re huge beasts to! Quick, lets dispose of this body and hide!”<br />
<br />
Using Levitation and the halfling’s innate stealth abilities, they were able to hide the gigantic body without much trouble. As they finished their work, they made their way behind a giant pillar, trying their best not to be seen.<br />
<br />
The giants passed by, mumbling to one another, “Zaharn says we’re to do the job and be back in no less than two days. Any more than that and you can guess what’ll happen…”<br />
<br />
Darg did his best to read their minds, but since giants are so huge, it’s anything but easy to do without knowing exactly where in their head to search. As he tried to concentrate he began to wonder, “What job are they talkin’ about. Could it be an attack on Halas! No…not even giants are that stupid. Surely they wouldn’t travel all the way to Qeynos…unless somethin’ very important is takin’ place…”<br />
<br />
However, his thoughts were thrown aside when he felt Starch begin to move and growl quietly. Darg tried to hold him back, but Starch had no collar that could be held onto. Just as the giants were going out of sight, Starch let loose a great howl and took off in pursuit of them. <br />
<br />
The fight was over before it started, and in less than five seconds, Starch lay motionless on the ground.<br />
<br />
The giants didn’t move, they just stood there motionless. Darg looked over his shoulder to give Fuzz a signal, but the halfling wasn’t there. Suddenly, one of the giants turned and snatched something up from the floor of the corridor. <br />
<br />
Barely audible, Fuzz could be heard screaming for help from the giant’s hand. Even though no help came, the giants quickly took off down the corridor, almost like they were running from something.<br />
<br />
Darg sighed and sat down to plan out his next move. It was quiet, too quiet. Being overly cautious, Darg cast invisibility on himself, and slowly made his way in the direction the giants had gone.<br />
<br />
As he crept forward, the sound of a lone voice could be heard. It was a powerful voice, and deep, yet strangely elegant. <br />
<br />
Soon, Darg reached two large doors, freezing to the touch. He peeked inside, and what he saw made his blood run cold.<br />
<br />
Standing there in massive numbers, were goblins, wolves, spiders, polar bears, ice giants, strange creatures of different sorts, and none other than the legendary dragon herself…Lady Vox.<br />
<br />
She spoke in haste, and those in the chamber missed not a word. “Long has it been since anyone dare challenge the inhabitants of Permafrost. But now, according to our scouts, there seems to be an attack force rallying within our walls as we speak! The scouts brought back two of their members, a halfling, and an unconscious wolf.” At this she turned to poor Fuzz, “Well foul creature, tell us of your attack force, and spare no detail. Do this or you will die one-thousand horrible deaths.”<br />
<br />
Fuzz was visibly trembling, and could barely speak. Finally, mustering up his courage, he piped up. “I am a member of no attack force, nor do I know of one. I come from a far away land, and care not to harm you or cause you trouble. Please, spare me and this wolf, for we have done nothing.”<br />
<br />
Lady Vox’s eyes grew red, she was visibly angry. “Done nothing! You’ve violated our home and attacked those who live here! What say you about that!”<br />
<br />
Knowing he was in deep…manure if he slipped up, Fuzz tried to be crafty. “Attack! I wouldn’t dare think of doing such a thing. I simply tried to pickpocket that scout on the left because I am looking for a precious herb. The herb is needed to make a potion that can cure my brother of a horrible ailment. Oh yes, and this wolf, I know nothing of it, it followed me here without me realizing it.”<br />
<br />
Half believing the story, Vox turned to her minions. “Search every corner of Permafrost! I want a report of ANYTHING that looks different. Halfling, if you are lying, you will pay dearly!”<br />
<br />
Darg’s stomach felt heavy, and he made a dash for cover. The massive doors swung open and out poured the minions of Vox. His invisibility held up nicely, and he watched them go in silence. He had avoided them, for now. At the moment, the most pressing task was trying to figure out how to save Fuzz and Starch.<br />
<br />
He peered into the doors, and his eyes met those of Lady Vox. She yelled for guards and swiped at him with her huge claws, which caused his invisibility spell to leave him. In an instant he was bound tightly and set up next to Fuzz.<br />
<br />
As he sat there, he wondered how in the world he planned to get out of this one. Peering over at Fuzz, the little halfling half-smiled and whispered, “Nice to see you again, how’s life treating you?” Darg grimaced and looked the other way, “Damn halflings…”</p>

	<p><u><center><b>Chapter 1: A Strange Vision</b></u></center><br />
<br />
Darg pulled his tired hands away from the fire and sighed. It had been a long day indeed. All he was thinking about now was dinner…dinner and sleep. <br />
<br />
He walked over to his table and took a bite from the portion of bear meat he had prepared earlier. It was just right, and he more than welcomed the delicious taste. As he chewed heartily, he took a glance at the hearth, where a fire blazed and crackled. <br />
<br />
Lying not far from it was his tracking wolf, Starch, dozing in and out of consciousness. Darg tossed a piece of meat next to him, and it was promptly devoured. <br />
<br />
The month had been hard on the Barbarians, and the snow fell constantly, even now. However, Darg wasn’t concerned with the snow, he had something else on his mind. <br />
<br />
He kept thinking back to the fight he had engaged in earlier that day with Redwind (General of the orcs who followed and defended Lady Vox, the legendary dragon), and his followers. Sure, he had disposed of Redwind without much trouble, but one of the followers had escaped, and for some reason it loomed eerily over Darg’s head. <br />
<br />
He pondered for a while, but couldn’t understand what exactly it was that was troubling him so much. Suddenly, there was a flash of light, and a vision formed right in front of his eyes. <br />
<br />
Being a shaman, he wasn’t all too surprised by this, yet this vision did not seem to be like those he had seen before. There was a small shadow, which swayed back and forth, yet had no definite shape. As the shadow moved and the vision progressed, it took form. The shadow was running towards something, or maybe away from another, either way it seemed to be moving as fast as it could. Although Darg couldn’t tell what exactly it was, he knew it was neither clever nor agile by the way the moved. Instead, it stumbled and lost its balance numerous times…obviously something was troubling it. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Darg’s head cleared, and the vision vanished. As he recovered and tried to make sense of what he had seen, weariness set in. Shrugging it off as nothing, he crawled into bed and tried to push these thoughts out of his head. <br />
<br />
Somewhere out on the frozen tundra, a lone wolf howled. Yet Darg took no notice of this, for he had fallen sound asleep.<br />
<br />
<u><center><b>Chapter 2: A Hairy Thief</b></u></center><br />
<br />
Morning came too soon, and Darg tried earnestly to go back to sleep. Yet the bright light of the sun through his windows, coupled with the hustling and bustling of people outside his door in the market, persuaded him to rise for the day. <br />
<br />
He pulled himself from his bed and trudged over to the hearth, tossing on a few more logs. As he bent down to wake up Starch, he decided to let him sleep a little longer. After all, it was going to be a long day. <br />
<br />
Passing by his messy kitchen, he made his way to the shower, grabbing a towel and washcloth on the way. The water was the same as it always was, cold as ice and chilling to the touch. Yet he took no notice of this, since Barbarians are, after all, near immune to cold temperatures. <br />
<br />
After showering and doing what little hygenial work Barbarians do, he threw on some clothes and armed himself. Darg and Starch wandered through town, making their way to the raft. <br />
<br />
After a short joyride, they reached the other side, and began their long trek to the outer gate of Permafrost. As they wandered up and began to move more stealthily, Darg felt his pocket move slightly, then go flat. <br />
<br />
He spun around, lunging out his massive arm…only to grasp onto the small arm of dark elf. As Darg began to raise his large hammer, the rogue quickly cried out, “No don’t! I’m not as I seem! Take another look!” <br />
<br />
Instantly the rogue swung his free arm over his face and removed a small mask from it. His image shimmer for a split-second, then formed into that of a halfling. <br />
<br />
“Oh joy, a lettle annoying halflin' creeture…maybe he doesn't talk much”, though a much displeased Darg. <br />
<br />
He put the little furball down and examined him cautiously, since one can never take their eye off a rogue too long…for fear of getting a dagger through their back. <br />
<br />
“Allow me to introduce myself kind sir!” squeaked the halfling, “I am known as Fuzz, best pickpocket in all the land.” <br />
<br />
“You did a perty crappy job pick-pocketin' me, why should I think yeh can do it teh others?” Darg was clearly annoyed with the rather odorous little thing. <br />
<br />
“It’s too cold in this blasted land, I can’t do a darned thing without shivering. It wasn’t my fault, my hand wouldn’t stay still and I accidentally hit the side of your pocket. Believe me or don’t, I’m still the best around!” <br />
<br />
“That reminds meh, I want meh wallet back, give it back now”. <br />
<br />
“You mean your coin purse?” <br />
<br />
“IT IS NOT A PURSE, IT IS A WALLET! Call it a purse again and I'll feed yer lettle body to Starch”. Hearing his name and “feed” used within 10 words of each other, Starch trotted over and looked at Fuzz. This apparently made Fuzz uncomfortable, for he quickly moved around, positioning Darg between him and the dog. <br />
<br />
“Terribly sorry..er..uh…what was your name again?” <br />
<br />
“My name is Darg, and this be Starch, my loyal trackin' wolf, now give me meh wallet back”. <br />
<br />
Becoming even more uneasy, the halfling apologized profusely and handed the wallet over to Darg. As Darg began to walk away, Fuzz trotted behind him, asking him many questions which Darg had no interest in answering. Finally, in frustration, Darg turned to Fuzz and said, “Look, I'm goin' teh hunt Ice Giants. Yeh can come if yeh want, but I'm not going to be held responsible if yeh get squashed under a giant's foot.” <br />
<br />
Fuzz’s eyes gleamed, and he seemed to brandish a rapier and a short sword from almost nowhere. He quickly shouted, “Then off we go!”, and took off in the direction of Permafrost. <br />
<br />
“Why me, I haven't dun anythin' wrong…I feed meh dog every day and kill those derty goblins. Argh…why is teh Tribunal pissed at me, what did I do wrong?”, thought Darg. And with that, the two began to quickly run in the direction Fuzz had gone in, hoping not to find squished halfling at the end of the Fuzz’s tracks.<br />
<br />
<u><center><b>Chapter 3: Plotting A Defense</b></u></center><br />
<br />
Somewhere deep in Permafrost, a flame erupted around the lifeless body of an orc. It rapidly grew, until it was multiple feet high, growing brighter with every passing moment.<br />
<br />
“Rest in peace, me friend…rest in peace…” The low, saddened voice of the goblin was barely audible as he spoke, “I will find the man who did this to you, and I will have my revenge…”<br />
<br />
In ran a smaller goblin, “High Priest Zaharn, you are needed earnestly in…”, yet he stopped cold when he eyed the recovered but burning body of Redwind. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry my Lord…I had no idea you were…”, but he was cut short. <br />
<br />
Eyeing the trembling peon, Zaharn quietly said, “No matter Ghest, I was done anyway, I believe you were saying I was needed somewhere?”<br />
<br />
“Yes my Lord, King Thex Va IV has summoned you and the Priest of Nagafen, it seems to be rather important. Shall you go now, or must I tell him you are busy? Remember my Lord, it does seem urgent”.<br />
<br />
At this Zaharn sighed, “Yes, I will attend this meeting…have you any idea to what it is about?”<br />
<br />
“No sir, I was told nothing.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, lets head out before I change my mind.”<br />
<br />
Ghest went back to work, and Zaharn doggedly made his way to the Meeting Hall. As he reached the chamber, two large ice giant diplomats bowed their heads in reverence and swung open the massive doors. Zaharn quietly made his way up to the large, round, slab of ice that served as a table.<br />
<br />
“Well, Zaharn, I’m glad you could finally join us!”, remarked the King, visibly irked.<br />
<br />
“Save it Thex Va, now why did you summon me here?”<br />
<br />
The King lowered his head, drawing in a large breath. He seemed to be at a loss for words, but he quickly recovered his composure and began to speak. “Our scouts have discovered a large force lodging in Qeynos, I fear they may be coming to try and slay us. They number well over 40, and are a diverse bunch. Even though our scouts have informants among the corrupt Qeynos guards, they couldn’t gather any names, so we don’t know who their leader is. What do you say we should do?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn drew a quick breath and was about to speak when the Priest of Nagafen quickly piped up, “I am sure Lord Nagafen will send some of his best to defend you, after all, he would do anything to protect Lady Vox.”<br />
<br />
Zaharn cast a cold glance at the giant, who immediately silenced himself. Though small, Zaharn was known to be one of the strongest magic users on the continent of Antonica, and not many would dare to anger him. “Even if Lord Nagafen sends 1000 of his best, it would take them at least a fortnight to get here, and that is simply time we haven’t got if the King’s story is indeed true.”<br />
<br />
The situation truly looked grave for them, and they all were deep in thought. All of a sudden, Zaharn looked up and glanced over at the King. “We will send a pair of our strongest giants to Qeynos, they will be the deciding factor in this battle.”<br />
<br />
The King looked puzzled, “And what purpose will they serve by doing this Zaharn?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn had a crafty grin on his face, “If there is indeed a large force at the city, then our giants will surely perish. Yet if the defenses at Qeynos are normal, the giants should have little trouble causing sufficient damage. Either way, we win. Either the giants die because of the added fighters at the city and we know to prepare for an attack, or they cause a large ruckus and come back to report that no one was there to resist. Plus, the large force (if there is one) will surely want to stay and help repair the city and heal the wounded. So it delays their attack on us.” Zaharn turned to the Priest, “Priest, send a messenger to Lord Nagafen and have him send us 10 of his strongest giants. They will tide us over until we know for sure whether or not we need prepare for an attack.”<br />
<br />
“It shall be done.” And with that the Priest bowed his head, and left the chamber.<br />
<br />
The King was indifferent to Zaharn’s idea, but glowered as he spoke, “You better not piss of the Lord by requesting such a large number of units, he would surely delight in disposing of us and setting up his own dungeon for the Lady to stay in. He always did want her to be nearer to him”<br />
<br />
“Don’t mock me Thex Va, I know what I’m doing. You may be King, but I am much wiser and much more experienced, never forget that.”<br />
<br />
These words angered the King, and he grimaced and left the room, mumbling as he went.<br />
<br />
Zaharn smiled to himself and went back to his own chamber, where he resumed his work. He stared at the runes and back at his reference sheet, trying to decipher the rest of the code. “Blast those damned elves, must they make these runes so hard to understand! No matter, once deciphered and put onto a scroll, they will form a spell which will stand alone as the most powerful ever. None will be able to oppose me then, not even Lady Vox or Lord Nagafen…”<br />
<br />
Yet it was a mistake for him to say this aloud, for the eyes and ears of the Lord were everywhere, even in that room. Silently and unnoticed, a small creature crawled from the room, and slid away into the darkness of the corridors.<br />
<br />
<u><center><b>Chapter 4: A Frozen Prison</b><br />
</u></center><br />
THUD! The corpse of a massive Ice Giant came crashing to the ground. It had been three days since Darg, Starch, and Fuzz had set out towards Permafrost, and they were now just arriving. <br />
<br />
Darg grimaced, “I travel three days teh get teh this craphole and all the cash yur carryin’ is a few lousy platinum! Yeh cheap son-of-a-bi...”, but he was interrupted by the halfling.<br />
<br />
“Shhh…I hear something, please, be quiet!” Slowly, Fuzz lowered his ear to the ground, not minding the cold snow. “There’s three of em…no wait…two. By God, they’re huge beasts to! Quick, lets dispose of this body and hide!”<br />
<br />
Using Levitation and the halfling’s innate stealth abilities, they were able to hide the gigantic body without much trouble. As they finished their work, they made their way behind a giant pillar, trying their best not to be seen.<br />
<br />
The giants passed by, mumbling to one another, “Zaharn says we’re to do the job and be back in no less than two days. Any more than that and you can guess what’ll happen…”<br />
<br />
Darg did his best to read their minds, but since giants are so huge, it’s anything but easy to do without knowing exactly where in their head to search. As he tried to concentrate he began to wonder, “What job are they talkin’ about. Could it be an attack on Halas! No…not even giants are that stupid. Surely they wouldn’t travel all the way to Qeynos…unless somethin’ very important is takin’ place…”<br />
<br />
However, his thoughts were thrown aside when he felt Starch begin to move and growl quietly. Darg tried to hold him back, but Starch had no collar that could be held onto. Just as the giants were going out of sight, Starch let loose a great howl and took off in pursuit of them. <br />
<br />
The fight was over before it started, and in less than five seconds, Starch lay motionless on the ground.<br />
<br />
The giants didn’t move, they just stood there motionless. Darg looked over his shoulder to give Fuzz a signal, but the halfling wasn’t there. Suddenly, one of the giants turned and snatched something up from the floor of the corridor. <br />
<br />
Barely audible, Fuzz could be heard screaming for help from the giant’s hand. Even though no help came, the giants quickly took off down the corridor, almost like they were running from something.<br />
<br />
Darg sighed and sat down to plan out his next move. It was quiet, too quiet. Being overly cautious, Darg cast invisibility on himself, and slowly made his way in the direction the giants had gone.<br />
<br />
As he crept forward, the sound of a lone voice could be heard. It was a powerful voice, and deep, yet strangely elegant. <br />
<br />
Soon, Darg reached two large doors, freezing to the touch. He peeked inside, and what he saw made his blood run cold.<br />
<br />
Standing there in massive numbers, were goblins, wolves, spiders, polar bears, ice giants, strange creatures of different sorts, and none other than the legendary dragon herself…Lady Vox.<br />
<br />
She spoke in haste, and those in the chamber missed not a word. “Long has it been since anyone dare challenge the inhabitants of Permafrost. But now, according to our scouts, there seems to be an attack force rallying within our walls as we speak! The scouts brought back two of their members, a halfling, and an unconscious wolf.” At this she turned to poor Fuzz, “Well foul creature, tell us of your attack force, and spare no detail. Do this or you will die one-thousand horrible deaths.”<br />
<br />
Fuzz was visibly trembling, and could barely speak. Finally, mustering up his courage, he piped up. “I am a member of no attack force, nor do I know of one. I come from a far away land, and care not to harm you or cause you trouble. Please, spare me and this wolf, for we have done nothing.”<br />
<br />
Lady Vox’s eyes grew red, she was visibly angry. “Done nothing! You’ve violated our home and attacked those who live here! What say you about that!”<br />
<br />
Knowing he was in deep…manure if he slipped up, Fuzz tried to be crafty. “Attack! I wouldn’t dare think of doing such a thing. I simply tried to pickpocket that scout on the left because I am looking for a precious herb. The herb is needed to make a potion that can cure my brother of a horrible ailment. Oh yes, and this wolf, I know nothing of it, it followed me here without me realizing it.”<br />
<br />
Half believing the story, Vox turned to her minions. “Search every corner of Permafrost! I want a report of ANYTHING that looks different. Halfling, if you are lying, you will pay dearly!”<br />
<br />
Darg’s stomach felt heavy, and he made a dash for cover. The massive doors swung open and out poured the minions of Vox. His invisibility held up nicely, and he watched them go in silence. He had avoided them, for now. At the moment, the most pressing task was trying to figure out how to save Fuzz and Starch.<br />
<br />
He peered into the doors, and his eyes met those of Lady Vox. She yelled for guards and swiped at him with her huge claws, which caused his invisibility spell to leave him. In an instant he was bound tightly and set up next to Fuzz.<br />
<br />
As he sat there, he wondered how in the world he planned to get out of this one. Peering over at Fuzz, the little halfling half-smiled and whispered, “Nice to see you again, how’s life treating you?” Darg grimaced and looked the other way, “Damn halflins'…”</p>
