<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Boy o boy...<br />
<br />
Please Please Please stop referring to these two numbers as being the &quot;same&quot;.   They are not.  And I'm going to tell you why.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Mob does 100 DPS.<br />
<br />
Shaman slow is 75%.<br />
Ench slow is 70%.<br />
<br />
Equation for calculating slow damage:<br />
<br />
Mob DPS x Slow Percantage = Slowed DPS.<br />
<br />
After slowed, mob does 25 DPS if shaman slows, and 30 DPS if ench slows.  Everyone agrees that this is the way slow works.  Time has nothing to do with the equation, not sure why people keep bringing it up.  I'm not sure why several people on these boards think that it is appropriate to compare 25 DPS and 30 DPS directly.  <br />
<br />
The only numbers that 25 and 30 can be compared to are the original number that was multiplied by the original percent.  Because the original number was 100, there is still only a 5% difference between 25 and 30.  There is no 20% difference between these two numbers, because they (and here is the important part) DO NOT EXIST ON THEIR OWN.  They are the products of an equation dealing with a real (virtual) world component.  This is one of the fallacies of mathematics--taking it from a textbook and applying it to the real world, some things just don't compute.  <br />
<br />
Now, if I were to ask you, 30 is what percentage of 25?  Your answer would clearly be 120%.  If you want to compare these two numbers on their own, you can, all day, and the answer is always going to be 20%. <br />
<br />
But when comparing to the original 100, the answer is always 5%.  20% of 100 is 20, which is clearly wrong.  <br />
<br />
Look at it this way.  You have a 100 DPS mob for 100 seconds.  This equals 10000 damage over the course of the fight.  If a shaman slows the mob at the beginning, it will only do 2500 dmg.  If an enchanter slows at the beginning, it will only do 3000 dmg.  If NOBODY slows, it will do 10000 dmg.  You only obtain the 2500 and 3000 dmg numbers by acting on the original value.<br />
<br />
This is almost like a Physics equation.  A mob has a Potential Energy, and that potiential is 100dps.  But in the real world, the Kinetic Energy it uses can be one of three values--100dps, 30dps, or 25dps--based on what percenage slow is applied.  These numbers can only be compared back to the original Potential Energy, because the 30dps and 25dps can't exist at the same time, only one or the other, therefore they can never be directly compared.   <br />
<br />
I'll use one more example.  Let's say you have an engine that can go 100 MPH.  But you want to test two governors (speed limiters) on the engine, to find out which will slow it down the best.  One limits the engine to 25 MPH, and the other to 30 MPH.  Which is better?  The one that limits to 25 MPH, obviously.  But I challenge you find an engineer or mechanic doing the testing to tell you that the one that goes 25 MPH is 20% better than the one that goes 30 MPH.  It's not--it's only 5 percent better.<br />
<br />
This is why there are liars, damn liars, and statisticians.<br />
<br />
<br />
What we really ought to be comparing is the amount of damage mitigated by slow, versus how many CHeals the cleric has to throw during the fight.  If the number of CHeals doesn't change between a shaman, BL, or Ench slowing, then all this other stuff doesn't really matter, does it?</div></div><hr />

That's only 5% of my base income, but it's a 20% increase in my effective spending power, and that's what really affects me the most.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I agree that really what matters is how much healing a slow saves, and on today's short (often slow-mitigated) fights, there is a negligable difference between the slowing classes.<br />
<br />
Edited to make a little clearer...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm making $100k per year, and the tax rate is 75%, so I get to keep $25k per year...

That's only 5% of my base income, but it's a 20% increase in my effective spending power, and that's what really affects me the most.<br />
<br />
Except, that, in this example, there is no case which would include you keeping the whole $100K/yr... You know what they say: there is only 2 certainties in life, Death and Taxes :) With only the 2 cases ($25K vs. $30K), the difference between the two *really* is 20%.<br />
<br />
This is not inconsistant with saying that, in the case of the description of the efficiency of the slow spells, the difference between the Enchanter spell and the Shaman spell is 5%. Because, in this situation, the No-Slow IS a possible case. With the set of possible result including 100% (no slow), 30% (chanter slow) and 25% (shaman slow) of the potential DPS of a MOB, the difference between the best case and the next-best is 5% because the worse case must also be considered.<br />
<br />
To reach that figure of 20%, you have to commit an inductive fallacy by excluding the 'no slow applied' case from consideration. At best, that's a newbie mistake in applying statistical methods... at worse, it's just plain old dishonesty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Okay, I think my example was flawed, but still to me, when comparing efficiencies, you compare the rest to the best, not to the worst.  ie:<br />
<br />
75% slow = 25dps ...base<br />
70% slow = 30dps ...20% less efficient<br />
65% slow = 35dps ...40% less efficient<br />
0% slow = 100dps ...300% less efficient<br />
<br />
It's the same as with healing, the infamous percentages (100%,64%,47% or something like that) are based on the best case (cleric) not the worst (oh, let's say warrior innate regen).<br />
<br />
Or fuel efficiency or something (for admittedly very inefficient cars...  Perhaps the new spring line of Hummers) - If there are 3 cars, one that uses 25 gallons per mile, one that uses 30 gallons per mile, and one that uses 100 gallons per mile, I'd say that the middle car is 20% less efficient than the best one, not 5% less efficient.  Would the efficiency difference of the best and second car drop to 4% if the 3rd car used 125 gallons to the mile?  If so, that really seems funky to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the actual debate is<br />
<br />
If I slow a mob that lasts 30 seconds, and it takes me @ 7.5 seconds to slow it, and it pounds on me for a second or two, really how much damage am I mitigating?<br />
<br />
Answer: I am not mitigating damage at all, nor saveing on healing?  <br />
<br />
At least this is what the issue seems to be from those who are experienceing the lvl at which the issue occurs.<br />
<br />
Now, for where slow is a viable solution, yes of course our slow on paper is only 5% more powerful than the chanter slow against a mob that doesn't mitigate and is worthwhile to slow, which means that there is 20% less damage being dealt over the chanter slow.  Those are the facts on paper. <br />
<br />
Though slightly distorted <br />
<br />
Mob does 100 dps (classic, oh yea)<br />
Chanter slows it down to 30 dps, shaman would slow it down to 25 dps, not into the math atm, but ok lets just call that 5 dps that just got saved 20% difference, I mean hey why the hell not?  I see 1/5th and 1/6th of a difference, but thats not the argument.<br />
<br />
The issue is that there are plenty upon plenty of ways to mitigate damage, and slowing has become the least effective of them all.  <br />
<br />
Increasing damage vs hps to the point of slow not being an issue is overall the issue.  So really, we need something else to do rather than buff and scratch.  <br />
<br />
Our options are<br />
<br />
Heal<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
<br />
or what we're known for<br />
<br />
Mitigate.<br />
<br />
I care not, I just hope that when I reach that point in play that the answer has been answered in a way that makes my gameplay and others rewarding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2 ways of looking at numbers, that is all. You can say there is a 20% difference between them, or you can say there is a 5% difference between them. Guess what! BOTH are right.<br />
<br />
Now what it comes down to is overall dps, higher dps mob does, the better our slow is. But it is trumped by the fact that a cleric casts CH when the mob dies and ends up with pretty much the same amount of mana as he started with, which in essence means slow doesn't matter for ****.<br />
<br />
The only thing slow helps with is making it safer for the group, and that's what we're pissed off about. so focus people! We don't want anyone to group w/o a slower being needed, atm a slower is obsolete for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The problem lies with people saying that we slow 20% better than an enchanter, which we clearly don't. We slow 5% better than an enchanter.<br />
<br />
The above example shows the misconception nicely. We don't say an unslowed mob does 300% dps, we say it does 100% dps. So why do we say that we slow 20% better than an enchanter? We don't. Our comparitive % is 20%, however we still only slow 5% better than they do.<br />
<br />
What amazes me is that this 20% misconception is being used at all as an excuse for us to be relegated to worthlessness in any of the other major categories we have become used to using when describing class utility. Even on a 1000dps mob, the difference between our slow and an enchanter is a mere 50dps. 50dps difference on a fully slowable mob that puts out that kind of dps, mind boggling isn't it?<br />
<br />
The next person who tries to make out that an enchanter slow, heck even a BST, is such a huge difference needs to stop talking. It isn't a huge difference, not when we are talking about 30-60 second fights. 50dps x 60seconds = 3000 damage. Barely a SL from a cleric or two Tnargs from a Shaman.<br />
<br />
The 5% and 10% difference between us and Enchanters and Beastlords is a joke. And I am not even talking about mitigated mobs.<br />

<br />
I don't get why people get all uptight about whether you say it's 20% or 5%.  The absolute numbers are the same for a given fight, so it makes no difference at all.  If you want to win, fine, it's 5%.  Are we fixed now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Honestly, after seeing the mob AE of 120% slow, I am planning to do some parses to make sure that slow honestly works the way I have levelled up believing that it does (that is, with my Turgur the mob makes 1 swing for every 4 it normally would have).<br />
<br />
<br />
  As far as I used to understand slow, having a slow spell on you negates all haste you have until the slow is removed.  So there is NO point in making a slow beyond 100% is that is supposed to translate into them NEVER hitting.<br />
<br />
  So, either worn haste still affects you after being slowed (which isn't too likely as instead of mitigation the Devs could have just added in none/none NO RENT NO DROP haste items to a bunch of mobs in much the same matter they made everything in Seru dual wield by giving them 2 weapons each).<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyway, once I get a rez in Ferubi lined up I will work on these parses and decide for myself if I have been wrong for so long.  (unless someone on PvP can tell me for certain that worn item haste percents are not cancelled out by slow)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">geln, i had to get my physics house mate to explain that one to me, cos i saw it as 5%... im glad yu bascially said what he said (gimme chemicals any day of the week)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">slow spells overwrite all haste, as in spell/worn/song<br />
its possible (even probible) that that ae slow is unique in some way that allows melees to still swing weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would doubt that the AE is not a normal slow.  It didn't show up in Lucy as &quot;Unkown Effect ####&quot;  It showed up as 120% slow from the first moment it appeared, which means it follows the coding already in effect for slow spells.<br />
<br />
  If slow spells also cancel out the worn and song haste, then there is most definately reason to redo parses on slow and find out EXACTLY what 75% means.   I've been on boards so much I still haven't tried to get a rez, but I will posts logs as soon as I get them and look them over.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If anyone is especially eager to get this looked into, you can feel free to post some logs as well.   I am planning to log 5 minutes of an unslowed mob hitting me (preferably one that can't quad).  Then I will slow that exact same mob with Grummus (40%) and log another 5 minutes, followed by Tigir (50%) and Turgur (75%).  Each time I wish to log 5 minutes of swings so that I can establish an exact time between the swings (ideally there won't be any variation at all and it will be pointless to have logged for longer than 3 hits).<br />
<br />
<br />
  With luck I can also find a fairly light dmg mob that slightly mitigates to look at that, but that is an entirely different question for analysis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The point of this is that 20% appears to be more than 5%, if not taken into proper perspective. At this point in the game and with the current state of the shaman class, I rather not use a number that appears to have a bigger effect than it actually does.<br />
<br />
I wish we were fixed, but we aren't. I think we are the class hardest hit by the recent change in how encounters work, but with GoD there are actually some others who are feeling mighty useless (hybrids) as well.<br />
<br />
I think what bothers most shamans is the fact that we've listed, analyzed and proven that we are very far behind the curve compared to other classes, and that the most recent changes have nothing but hurt all of our abilities, but yet the devs claim that we are fine and no changes should be done. To be honest, the whole 47% as well as a cleric in healing thing had me shaking my head. I mean, we all know that the current devs have been probably around only since PoP beta, but still. I am tired of all of the shaman issues at this point, I am thinking about making an alt to play while we don't raid and wait for WoW or vanguard. Heck, even if neither of those turn out well, I know my time in EQ is coming to a permanent end after over five and a half years.<br />

Lets say you are doing a tipt or vxed trial.  You malos the pet for him, but before he can get it charmed cast turgurs on it.  <br />
<br />
He will most undoubtedly cuss you out and ask you to cure it.  So getting back to the slow and its effectiveness.  <br />
<br />
Cure the slow off his mob, but use disenfecting aura or something that will strip his tash.  <br />
<br />
And than once the mob breaks charm, he will truly understand how  effective of our slow REALLY is.....</div></div><hr />

This is probably the best way to look at it instead of all these convoluted explanations.<br />
<br />
This is as simple as you can make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>philni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">For those arguing about 5% and 20% both are correct as long as you use the correct text with the number.  Yes, the shaman slow % minus the enchanter slow % is 5%.  Yes, an enchanter slowed mob does 20% MORE damage than if the shaman slowed the mob.  Hey, and while we are at it, the shaman slowed mob does 16.7% LESS damage than a similarly enchanter slowed mob.  All 3 are correct statements.  Get over it.<br />
<br />
And for those of you who think using the 5% number makes for a better shaman case, then you are dead wrong.  Let me cover the WHOLE slow process.  And yes, I do realize there are some assumptions below.<br />
<br />
Okay, let's cover the 'length of fight issue'.  It's not really a 'length of fight' rather than 'length of fight vs length of slowing time' really.  Somebody previously covered this, but here is our formula for the effective 'Slow %' based on time to slow and time of combat.  Let's repeat it here:<br />
<br />
Let<br />
Ts = Time to land slow<br />
Tt = Time total of fight<br />
Sa = Slow Actual<br />
Se = Slow Effective over total fight.<br />
<br />
Se = (S * (Tt-Ts))/Tt<br />
<br />
As we'd expect, as Ts get's closer to Tt the less S affects the Effective Slow.  And if everything is preslowed (Ts = 0) then ya, the length of the fight doesn't matter, no slows are affected.<br />
<br />
Ah, but we haven't included mitigation yet!  Okay, from another thread, the current though is that the first X percent of slow is unmitigated (perhaps 30%) followed by a fixed percent mitigation after that.<br />
<br />
Let<br />
U = Unmitigated percent<br />
M = Migitation factor above U<br />
S = Slow Percent (75% for shaman, 70% for enchanter, etc...)<br />
<br />
If (S &lt; U) Then Sa = S<br />
Else Sa = U + (S - U) * M<br />
<br />
This Sa we get, get's plugged into the first formula above to get the final Effective Slow.<br />
<br />
Let's give an example.  Say a 30s fight, that takes 10s to slow with a mitigation of 50 mitigated above 30.  Please feel free to try different numbers at home.<br />
<br />
Shaman (75%):<br />
Sa = .3 + .45*.5 = .555 (or 55.5%)<br />
Se = (.555 * (30-10))/30 = .37 (or 37%)<br />
<br />
Enchanter (70%):<br />
Sa = .3 + .40*.5 = .5 (or 50%)<br />
Se = (.5 * (30-10))/30 = .333 (or 33.3%)<br />
<br />
Beast (65%):<br />
Sa = .3 + .35*.5 = .475 (or 47.5%)<br />
Se = (.475 * (30-10))/30 = .317 (or 31.7%)<br />
<br />
Bard (53%?):<br />
Sa = .3 + .23*.5 = .415 (or 41.5%)<br />
Se = (.415 * (30-10))/30 = .277 (or 27.7%)<br />
<br />
Okay, how do we compare all these.  Since we are the best, let's compare to shaman.<br />
<br />
If we just substract the slowing percent (the &quot;5% method&quot;):<br />
Enchanter 3.7% (previously 5%)<br />
Beast 5.3% (previously 10%)<br />
Bard 9.3% (previously 22%)<br />
Unslowed 37% (previously 75%)<br />
<br />
Looking at these raw numbers, I would say that shaman/enchanter/beast aren't significantly changed.  Sure the gap is closer but it wasn't far to start.  On the other hand, the bard/unslowed numbers are reduced by half.<br />
<br />
However, if we compare the extra dmg by using inferior slow compared to shaman (the &quot;20% method&quot;):<br />
Enchanter (66.6-63)/63 = 5.7% (down from 20%)<br />
Beast (68.3-63)/63 = 8.4% (down from 40%!)<br />
Bard (72.3-63)/63 =  14.8% (down from 88%!!)<br />
Unslowed (100-63)/63 = 58.7% (down from 300%!!!)<br />
<br />
And now I hope you understand, comparing using &quot;the 20% method&quot;, you can see JUST HOW MUCH GROUND shaman have lost.  It's massive especially for bard and unslowed.<br />
<br />
One last though if you've gotten this far.  This example, is just that.  A theoretical example.  Honestly, I don't know if ANY of the assumptions (10 seconds to slow for 30 second fight) nor the mitigation amounts are reasonable.  It's seems likely that the 4 slowing classes do NOT take the same amount of time to slow.  Perhaps with Nihil shaman may take much less than 10s while enchanters with aggro heavy tash take longer.  Will the BST even be able to slow at all w/o resist debuff.  As for bards I have no idea.  They might be the fastest to slow of all for all I know.<br />
<br />
Also, if you don't engage until slowed (ie root/mez until slowed) then you can skip the first equation altogether but then you'll likely take much longer to kill everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">5%, 20%, does it really matter?<br />
<br />
In my opinion, we are still the best slowers, and I don't just mean we slow the most. But the relevance of slow itself is not nearly as important as it used to be.<br />
<br />
I think we're the best slowers particularly in areas where mobs are fairly resistant. If you need to debuff it some first, we can Malos/Turgur's much sooner than an enchanter can Tash/Forlorn Deeds it due to the agro on tash. A beastlord may have a faster cast time, but he's still got the same old 5 second recast, so he will struggle to slow in the same situation because he doesn't get a debuff at all.<br />
<br />
If we do get agro from slow, we can take a beating a lot better than the enchanter can, and we can heal ourselves while the cleric concentrates on the tank, which neither enchanter nor beastlord can.<br />
<br />
THESE things are what makes us the better slower, not that our slow is bigger.<br />
<br />
And yes, I agree, the difference is still fairly minimal, and the need to slow at all is diminishing in high end places. I think the balance between the 3 main slowing classes should be in other areas, such that:<br />
<br />
If you want slow + DPS - beastlord (or enchanter with charmable mobs)<br />
If you want slow + CC - enchanter<br />
If you want slow + healing - shaman<br />
<br />
I do think we need a boost in other areas (particularly healing, but DPS also) to remain competitive for the slower spot against the others who bring a lot to a group. Having the best slow isn't enough in itself.</div></div><hr />

Do we take a beating better then a chanter in GoD?<br />
No clue as we will be both at our bind point if we get agro.</div></div><hr />

Bah bs, you don't get onerounded, and a decent tank will retake aggro fast enough for you to live with a good cleric. Now in the Ikkinz raids....<br />

Well, time has EVERYTHING to do with the equation, because DPS is Damage as a function of TIME. <br />
<br />
Here is a good example I like to use on my kids and their friends. <br />
<br />
A car at the bottom of a hill that is EXACTLY 1 mile up, then 1 mile down. If the car travels UP the hill at 30 m.p.h, then how fast must he go DOWN the hill in order to average 60 m.p.h.?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I forgot what the point is ;)<br />
<br />
The point is that &quot;numbers&quot; that are actually ratios are not integers, and cannot be universally applied in math equations as if they are. DPS is Damage Per Second. Its not a number, its a RATIO. <br />
<br />
Personally, I could care less what 20%, or 5% or any of that means. I am just not a guy who looks for inches in a game that is dictated by miles. But some people seem to be interested in such things, therefore I just wanted to point out some of the mathmatical factors that need to be considered. Ratios cannot be manipulated the same way integers can, with %s and multplication etc. You must always consider BOTH sides of the ratio when considering the mathmatical implications of the result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The effective difference between the two is 20%, pure and simple. Anyone who doesn't comprehend this, like Jinheim said, is a complete and utter moron.<br />
<br />
No, not the EFFECTIVE difference, that is only a factor of the duration of the encounter. A 5% difference in ratio has a HUGE differential when you start discussing the TIME portion of the equation. That is what people are trying to say. 5% is a LOT less of a factor in a 10 second fight than it is in a 60 second fight. <br />
<br />
This isnt something new to us, we all know it, its the 2nd biggest reason our slow is being trivialized, because the duration of fights is shorter and shorter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same 5% difference in DPS can vary a lot in absolute numbers depending on total fight time. A 5% difference over 10 minutes can be a dozen additional CHs. That same 5% may only mean half a Tnarg's in a 20 second fight and thus be inconsequential.<br />
<br />
Does that sum up your last post?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Does that sum up your last post?<br />
<br />
Pretty much, yes, and that is also the point that the people who are debating the 5 vs 20 thing are trying to say. Those numbers, 5% or 20%, whichever you prefer, need to be applied slightly differently than just flat rate mitigations when we want to discover the FULL impact of those ratios on a given encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Blazz that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life. Percentages are not even abstractly applicable to time. Where the hell did you get the notion that a 5% difference is more effective as time goes on? Just humor me; is this phenomenon that creates a &quot;LOT less&quot; of an effect of a percentile based on the period of time a linear relationship?<br />
<br />
Nothing bothers me more than an uneducated moron who talks loud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I do believe that what he is saying and you are missing in between the lines is that with a 5% difference in slowing (yes, that means 20% less damage output than the next best one), if the fight is short enough, and the damage low enough, that the only heal cast is a Complete heal near halfway, and another at the end (or anything else that heals more than enough) then that means that overall, the tank still is alive, and full health, and the cleric still only cast those 2 spells.<br />
<br />
  In both cases, a slow was used.  In our case it was a BETTER slow.  In both cases however, when all is said and done, the tank is full health and the cleric is down 2 C heals.   So overall, there wasn't a speck of difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">++++Okay, I think my example was flawed, but still to me, when comparing efficiencies, you compare the rest to the best, not to the worst. ie:<br />
<br />
75% slow = 25dps ...base<br />
70% slow = 30dps ...20% less efficient<br />
65% slow = 35dps ...40% less efficient<br />
0% slow = 100dps ...300% less efficient<br />
<br />
It's the same as with healing, the infamous percentages (100%,64%,47% or something like that) are based on the best case (cleric) not the worst (oh, let's say warrior innate regen).<br />
<br />
Or fuel efficiency or something (for admittedly very inefficient cars... Perhaps the new spring line of Hummers) - If there are 3 cars, one that uses 25 gallons per mile, one that uses 30 gallons per mile, and one that uses 100 gallons per mile, I'd say that the middle car is 20% less efficient than the best one, not 5% less efficient. Would the efficiency difference of the best and second car drop to 4% if the 3rd car used 125 gallons to the mile? If so, that really seems funky to me.+++++<br />
<br />
You made the mistake of using the 70% slow percentage as the base, the base is the original 100dps. so you cant achieve 100% effecieny, turguurs is 75% efficient and chanter is 70% efficient bst is 65%. COMPARATIVELY speaking 75 is not 20% more efficient that 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I would doubt that the AE is not a normal slow.  It didn't show up in Lucy as &quot;Unkown Effect ####&quot;  It showed up as 120% slow from the first moment it appeared, which means it follows the coding already in effect for slow spells.<br />
<br />
  If slow spells also cancel out the worn and song haste, then there is most definately reason to redo parses on slow and find out EXACTLY what 75% means.   I've been on boards so much I still haven't tried to get a rez, but I will posts logs as soon as I get them and look them over.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If anyone is especially eager to get this looked into, you can feel free to post some logs as well.   I am planning to log 5 minutes of an unslowed mob hitting me (preferably one that can't quad).  Then I will slow that exact same mob with Grummus (40%) and log another 5 minutes, followed by Tigir (50%) and Turgur (75%).  Each time I wish to log 5 minutes of swings so that I can establish an exact time between the swings (ideally there won't be any variation at all and it will be pointless to have logged for longer than 3 hits).<br />
<br />
<br />
  With luck I can also find a fairly light dmg mob that slightly mitigates to look at that, but that is an entirely different question for analysis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Think that means that with a 120% slow you get to actually swing every 6th time.</div></div><hr />

If you parse fights please make sure to either stand on to of the MOB or better yet, get the tank to parse.

I wish a question that incorporated that statement was asked at the fan faire.  I seriously doubt that the devs understand percentages, especially since the response to adjusting fight times or slow percentages was that &quot;5% is still a huge factor&quot;.</div></div><hr />

So, if you can buff someone 100 hp, and I can buff them 120 hp, my buff is 20 pct better - regardless of starting hp, right?<br />
<br />
So, if you can decrease mob output to 100 dps, and I can decrease mob output to 80 dps, is that not 20 pct better - regardless of the mob's starting dps?<br />

You cannot judge how much paint you need to paint your walls if you only make the calculation using square footage.  One has to know how high the wall are.  Or better yet the method of application.  A sprayer would save more time on a wall that was taller than the with of the paint roller.  Problem is Shaman are now trying to paint walls that are less than a foot high.<br />
<br />
A fight has to last well over a minute and the slow not be too harshly mitigated for a Slow to be effective.<br />

Time is the missing variable in all these comparisons.</div></div><hr />
