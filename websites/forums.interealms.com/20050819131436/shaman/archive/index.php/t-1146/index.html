<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do you do it? I brought a group there to do dragons and there is always something coming across the path within 8 minutes, even the 'safe' area that is a bit south of Yeldema's spawn. I am sure I could solo him, I just don't know how I could guarantee no adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, adds are the only hard part about Yeldema. I tried him twice, first try I got him to 40% and was winning easily when a crag showed up. Second try pretty much the same. I never bothered trying again after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The hard part about killing Yeldema isn't killing him.  It's not getting killed by an add.  That's what you gotta figure out how to deal with.  The rest is cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very true, yeldema is not the hard part about actually killing yeldema. I have a screenshot from a while back &quot;the first time I attempted to solo Yeld&quot; that shows just how ****ty the adds can be. Yeldema was fleeing and I was going to finish off with JBB, looked around and didnt see any adds ( I kick myself in the ass now that I did'nt Torpor then) but along comes Mr. Badwolf and as soon as I notice I have wolf aggro &quot;im on horse so I cant duck to intrerupt JBB casting to heal&quot; .... well the picture pretty much explains the rest - Link Below, you will laugh =)    (I also binded myself right before I engaged, yeldema was still low when I zoned in)<br />
