<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm going to BoT tonight for the first time.  We will try the mini's, but we will take what we can get.  <br />
<br />
I just dinged 63, should I use Malo, or Malosinia<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malo should be fine on all the normal mobs. Every now and then you will get a resisted slow even after malo, but for the normal mobs it isnt worth malosinia after malos. <br />
<br />
Maybe on the named, which will be harder to slow, you might want to malo then alternate malosinia and slow until slow sticks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree Malo is a no brainer, helps on every mob, and required on most mini's.  However, my philosophy is that since Malosinia and slow have the same MR adjust, zero, if Malosinia lands, then you could have landed the slow.  Sure, landing slow is easier after landing Malosinia, but why take the extra step.  <br />
<br />
Also, some mini's are only partially slowable, so don't be surprised if you get the partially slowed message.  Finally, depending on the wing, (I always forget which is which until I'm there for a couple of pulls, have not been there in a few weeks), mobs may have high MR and if you are pulling singles may be best to Malo each on inc, mana providing of course.  With Canni 5 and KEI I typically Malos everything on incoming just to be safe, never know when you'll get an add.  Sux to have Slow bounce, pull aggro, and get an add, so you have 2 unslowed mobs in your grill.  Ouch.</div></div><hr />

However, alternating slow and malosinia on named mobs post-Malo may not be a bad idea if your tank has a hard time keeping aggro.  Chain casting Turgur's can be a good way to get yourself killed if you don't have a good tank.<br />
<br />
If your tank isn't having aggro troubles though, chain away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Be sure you check the Crucible's slow charts. Some of the Tower bosses are slow immune while others are magic-slowable but are so resistant that disease slow is the best way to go.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In my guild, the mages usually cast Malosinia.  This might be something to think about.  Also, our Chanters usually Cripple mobs.  This removes two spells that I do not have to worry about mem'ing.<br />
<br />
Anyways...<br />
<br />
For the most part, I would start with malo and follow up with slow.  If it is resisted, malosinia.  I would alternate malosinia and turgurs until the mob is slowed.  This is what I used to do when I was in a tower/mini raid, and tower mobs were resistant if I recall.  Been ages since I killed a tower boss or a mini.  <br />
<br />
Expect to get beat on.  I used to die a lot on raids - for the most part, it was do to a mob resisting slow.  As you progress your character, you will be able to take more hits and your survivability will greatly increase.  <br />
<br />
Find a style that works best for you and stick with it.  Some people like to wait a few seconds for the tank to build aggro before malo(x) and slow.  Some Shaman tend to cast Malo(x) on incoming followed by slow.  This could result with the mob making a bee-line to you.  This could be detrimental on a raid if the mob was already positioned for placement by the main tank.  Food for thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First if you are asking which to try first, always use Malo/Malos(when you get it) as these are unresistable. Only use malosina if you need extra debuffing.<br />
<br />
Some more points to think about, the Malo line has very small amount of aggro, so depending how mobs are pull an arrow or such can normally out aggro the Malo line so always land it asap.<br />
<br />
With named, you are going to find slowing them tough, same with there placeholders Krigers (these can be almost as tough as named minus the AoE stuff)<br />
<br />
If you have a Mage get them to Malosina if they can, also tash helps but due to it's aggro chanters don't tend to cast it early. It can help alot to be close enough to the mobs and have the emotes like XXX yawns easy to see as you can then tell if a mage/chanter has debuffed.<br />
<br />
Personally on named, I malos, try a slow if it fails, I tend to either slow/malosina alternate if the tank is ok with aggro, else will stick with malosina if the the mobs not happy with me.<br />
<br />
Learn which spells work on which wing as each has it's own resist set and once you learn which works where you save loads of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks<br />
<br />
Used malo the slow on regular mobs and had very little trouble slowing.<br />
<br />
I was able to land a slow on Eindride (water) after Malo and Malosinia.<br />
<br />
Waste a ton of mana trying to slow Oreen, and never did get it to land, so I just healed and let the tanks do there stuff.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What about using &quot;Cloud of Grummus&quot; on the named?  Pox  worked like a charm on these guys,  but bane of nife, never landed.  Would the diseased base slow be a better option here?</div></div><hr />
