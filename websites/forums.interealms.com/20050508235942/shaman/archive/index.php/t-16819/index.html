<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've looked, and I've looked, but I can't find anywhere where SoE lists commands for chat channels (SoE? not list something? Nahhhh).<br />
<br />
I know that there is a way that you can creat a chat channel, and moderate it somehow that only (for example) you and the puller can &quot;speak&quot; in the channel, no one else has permission.<br />
<br />
Does any wise shaman out there know the command that might let me do this?<br />
<br />
(Alternatively, is there a site out there that lists all the commands a moderator can do in a chat channel?)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Looks like /chat moderate and /chat voice are the two commands you need to restrict your channel to certain people typing.</div></div><hr />

Hope that helps. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">check out <br />
everquest_manual.doc<br />
eqmanual_supplement.doc(this one has the chat commands)<br />
<br />
in your eq folder   has the chat commands along with a host of other usefull info =)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
or read below if too lazy=)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Chat System Command List<br />
<br />
/chat set &lt;channel-list&gt;	Makes you a member of all of the channels listed.  You will be joined to those channels in the order listed (see /join below for details on what 'joining' a channel means).  This will remove you from all previously joined channels.  If you just want to join a new channel, use the /join command<br />
<br />
/join &lt;channel-list&gt;	Allows you to join the channel or channels listed.  If the channel does not yet exist it will create the channel and you will be added as a moderator for the channel (see below for moderator commands).  Note:  You may use spaces when creating a channel.  But when the channel is created those spaces will be removed.  So if you &quot;/join fluffy bunny&quot; the channel created will be &quot;fluffybunny&quot;<br />
<br />
/leave &lt;channel&gt;	This will remove you from the channel.  Note:  You must specify a channel, either by name or by number, or the command will fail<br />
<br />
/leaveall	Removes you from all channels<br />
<br />
/list [channel]	Using this command without the [channel] parameter will list all of the channels that you are joined to, the channel number, and will give a numeric value for the number of people in that channel.  The channel number is specific to individual users, so two people in the same channel may not have the same channel number for that channel.  Using the command with a [channel] parameter will list the members of the channel by name<br />
<br />
/announce [on | off]	Toggles on and off the announcements heard when people join or leave channels.  This is set OFF by default<br />
<br />
/chat #&lt;channel-name&gt; &lt;message&gt;	Sends the message to the channel named.  You must have the # symbol, that is not a hint to use a number<br />
<br />
/&lt;1..10&gt; &lt;message&gt;	Sends the message to the chat channel number listed.  You can discover the number of the channels you are joined to by using /list.  If no channel number is specified the message will be sent to you first chat channel (whichever is your channel number 1)<br />
<br />
/chat help	Displays a list of chat channel commands<br />
<br />
<br />
Channel Moderator Command List<br />
<br />
/chat invite &lt;character-name&gt; [channel]	Sends an invitation to the specified character to join a the chat channel.  If no channel is specified the character will be invited to join your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1).  The invitation arrives as a text message.  If the channel is password protected, the invited person can enter the channel only once without a password<br />
<br />
/chat grant &lt;character-name&gt; [channel]	Grants moderator privileges in the channel specified to the character named.  If no channel is specified the character will be given moderator privileges to your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1)<br />
<br />
/chat password &lt;password&gt; [channel]	Sets the password for the channel specified.  If no channel is specified the password will be applied to your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1).  Note:  A password protected channel is the only type of channel that is semi-permanent.  Such a channel will disappear after it has been empty for 24 hours.  All other channels cease to exist once they are empty<br />
<br />
/chat kick &lt;character-name&gt; [channel]	Kicks the character named off of the chat channel listed.  If no channel is specified the character will be kicked our of your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1)<br />
<br />
/chat moderate [channel]	Sets the specified channel to 'moderated' mode.  This means that only those given 'voice' in the channel will be able to speak in that channel.  If no channel is specified your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1) will be set into moderated mode.  This is a toggle command, so if you execute this command a second time the channel will return to unmoderated status.<br />
<br />
/chat voice &lt;character-name&gt; [channel]	Give the named character the ability to speak in a moderated channel.  If no channel is specified the character will be allowed voice in your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1)<br />
<br />
<br />
Note:  A password protected channel is the only type of channel that is semi-permanent.  Such a channel will disappear after it has been empty for 24 hours.  All other channels cease to exist once they are empty<br />
<br />
Note for advanced users:  /chat and / can be replaced with a semicolon ( ; ) in most cases.<br />
<br />
Associated commands<br />
<br />
Here are a few commands that you can use to make your chat channels even more friendly.<br />
<br />
/autojoin &lt;channel-list&gt;	Saves the channels listed and automatically ;sets you to those channels when you log in.  This information is saved in your eqclient.ini file in the [Defaults] section as ChannelAutoJoin=&lt;channel-list&gt;.  You can edit that setting in the file while out of game if you wish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What I'd like, and doesn't seem to exist, is a way to send a tell to a channel by name, not by number.<br />
<br />
I autojoin 3 channels, 2 are channels for chatting in, the third is my guild's debuff channel for raids. However, sometimes on raids I want to remove one of the chatting channels, and sometimes when not on raids, I want to remove the debuff channel. Both of which mess with the numbering.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice to be able to send a tell to the debuff channel regardless of it's current numbering, so I don't have to leave and rejoin them all to get them in the right order when I start a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try this:<br />
<br />
;#channelname chat text here<br />
<br />
i.e.<br />
<br />
;#debuffs %T is SLOWED.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, interesting, I didn't know you could do that.<br />
<br />
What I have done in the past is to join a dummy channel to hold the channel number.</div></div><hr />
