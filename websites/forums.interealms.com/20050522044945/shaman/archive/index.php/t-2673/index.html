<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas...I leveled 15 -20 in 2 days at Paludal Caverns. I outgrew the Mushrooms there and as the bandits and feinds always add I moved to Kunark at 20. Been in Ill Omen 4 days now and am still only 3 yellow into 20. Now..last time I fought in Kunark I thought experience was much better..but now I'm only getting 1/4 to 1/2 blue bubb for yellow/ red cons solo(fighting at the pillars by lake opposite FM zone). I have good equipment and can take reds successfully. <br />
<br />
So ..I was advised to return to Paludal...or at least to Luclin. Can anyone recommend a good solo spot with tactics that will take me from 20 to 24. At 24 i think I will be more successful with Canni.<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />
Set</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, go to Echo Caverns through the hidden door in the shop beside the Soul Binder in Shadow Haven. There are guards there to help ya you really need it, and many lil alieans that you can kill there. They range from blue to red to my 24 Warrior. Good luck:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Paludal caverns kicks ass through 25 when some of them start to go light blue.  I swear it almost seems like there's a broken ZEM (zone experience modifier).  If you can partner up with a druid for damage shield, you'll be raking in the exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thx guys..can u post what mobs, whereabouts, and tactics used?<br />
<br />
I've only just returned to the game after a year off and dont really know all the new zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A friend of mine enjoyed Netherbian Layer after he left Paludal, but he staye there till 25 cuz exp was great. He was an SK, so you know us shamans could solo there if he did :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I levelled 3 alts in paludal and have to say only two methods I have found so far for camping there with great exp and little hassle.<br />
<br />
Go to second bandit camp with a ranger, monk, sk, or war. If you are careful you can pull with just the two of you for hours. If not get a cleric and trust me you can ding a few times a day with just 3 people. <br />
<br />
Go past the bandits in the tunnels and find an area where there are no roam phungal phiends (sp) and camp a few mushrooms or owlbearcubs. Easily done with a pair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Question, was Lake of Ill Omen exp nerfed awhile back? Friend was telling it was...that it had a neg exp mod. Or is ZEM the same? Can anyone confirm this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOIO used to have an additional experience bonus of thirty percent.  After a while this bonus was removed to make the experience gain match that of a standard zone.   By that time it was too late.  I swear I permanently lose IQ points whenever I enter that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I prefer the Shik'Nar in Paludal over the Bandits. They're rarely camped, don't hit very hard and should not go lt. blue until 23. <br />
<br />
From there, Netherbian is another good area. Head down the hall like you're going to Dawnshroud and there are little caves off to the left. The last cave before Dawnshroud has some nice little critters to beat up, most of them will come solo.<br />
<br />
If that get's boring you can always just go into Marus Seru for a bit since it's right next door. Another good zone though the little centipede looking bugs are annoying ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have spent a good amout in Paludal myself (15 - 25) and I absolutely LOVED the zone.  At 25 I moved to echo caverns.  Echo caverns have two entrances, one through a secret door near the soulbinder (in a room behind him) and the other across the pond near the dwarf, gnome and halfling areas.  The camp I am going to tell you about is in the area behind the secret door.<br />
<br />
Once you enter, turn left, and follow the main path until you come to a massive sliding door.  There are some mobs in the hall behind the door, but if you stay in the middle you should be able to cross without aggroing them. keep going straight until there is a chance to turn right.  Btw, the big tentacles that grow on the wall will randomly root you and suck some live out from you (about 1 bub), but you usually can just run by them.  once you turn right, go straight, following the right wall.   This should get you into a large room filled with Needelites (big mosquitos).   They are blue well into 29, and are really amazing xp.   Loot is decent, and there is a named spawn.   If you got really good gear, you can clear the room easily, and do one or two of the alien looking guys that are nearby.  Be aware that the Needelites hit INCREDIBLE fast, so pull with slow, and then dot.  Luckily, they do not hit very hard ( wis shaman do not need to apply at this camp).  With decent ac, you should see hits going like 2,2,2,5, 13, 4, etc.  As an added benefit, you can be sure that your defense will be maxed within the first yellow in the level (sometimes within the first blue)<br />
<br />
Have fun,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Widda..I could hug ya. This is exactly the kind of thing I am looking for...Good accurate info with locations, mobs, gear required, dangers. As an AC Junkie who maxes Defense, and weapons,  every level before allowing myself to group this sounds just the spot....when I get to 25. Still 20. Great stuff my friend. <br />
<br />
Now...to get from 20 to 25...??</div></div><hr />
