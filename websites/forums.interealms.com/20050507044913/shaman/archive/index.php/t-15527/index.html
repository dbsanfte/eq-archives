<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The only AA's I really want/need left are the Combat Agility/Lightning Reflex Line, and those take a long time. So I decided, what the hell, why dont I get rabid bear to jus mess around with it. I figure it would be a fun hobby to try and maximize my DPS with Rabid bear in an exp group or even on a raid.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm looking for suggestions for weapons. At this point I'm not sure what would benefit me more, dmg/delay or a good proc. I was thinking I would get a good 2hblunt for dmg/delay, or a copper hammer of striking if I wanted a proc.<br />
<br />
By the way I have quite a bit of money to work with, and my guild I just barely starting ssra so elemental loots are out of the question.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">try maximize your DPS in this way :<br />
<br />
white bear + FA + haste item + haste buff = Rabid Bear + str/dex buff<br />
<br />
Rabid bear don't stack with FA, and it max haste already so haste buff won't help, so both give about same haste, and same atk, and about same dps, that is ~20-40dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Incorrect, RabidBear also currently gives quite a sizeable double attack skill, almost on par with a non AA'd 60 paladins I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they let rabid bear stack with the avatar series and coded the haste on it as a bard song (a'la monk whistling fists robe, Quarm earring effect etc), thus in effect bringing us WAY over the haste cap, THEN rabid bear would maybe become viable as a fun dps source.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just get a cple mage summoned procin weapons, give them to the dog, and let HIM do the dps, cause he is going to be better then your rabid bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I have Staff of Eternal Flames, the beauty staff from pofire which procs 400 dd(-300 resist). I am going to say this, there is a MASSIVE difference between rabid bear mode and being hasted and have a haste item. This was my observation today, I thought I would go KC just for fun. I slaughtered mobs with rabid bear and staff in no time but restriction is that lasts only 10 mins(extended duration aa and items). Also I did much more dps than my pet, double hitting for 210 etc. <br />
<br />
With no Rabid bear and hasted with swift like wind, buffed with str of diaku, focus, spirit of bihli, Grim aura(shruiken earring adds like 13 atk or something) and I was wearing a cocw, killing a mob then was very slow and!! I had more procs in non rabid bear mode than rabid bear. <br />
<br />
As another note,  I got parsed on a VT mob one on the first floor that silences. The person parsing only had melee dps on(so no account for procs) and I was parsed at 48dps which apparently was just just around the same lvl as lvl 65 pallies dps. If it had accounted for procs too, I have fury of magic 1(which is 800 dd crits), the dps would have been much higher(although was a mob that silenced).<br />
<br />
In short, if you want to have a fun time meleeing use rabid bear, any mode you try to obtain that mode is nowhere near similar. From this I would like Rabid bear to be a innate ability, that would totally rock or have a much much reduced reuse time.<br />
<br />
As to weapons that are obtainable by means of buying or so there are choices of Dathor Great Hammer(very slow but can hit for 300s sometimes), Hammer of Spirit calling I think. If you are VT able Mace of Dark thought is ok also, or Solro able there is a mob that drops a weapon with effect firestrike that is nice also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use the Mithril battle hammer ( http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=21884 ) but I have also noticed that I don't proc near as much in RB as when just regular meleeing (not that I melee alot anyway =p). Proc on it is a 302 fire based dd, and with Casting Fury 2, it crits quite regularly for 502. I think I will use RB alot more when I get a decent 2hb, like the Staff of Eternal Flames from PoF. It seems like I do alot more melee damage because of double attack, but like I said, it seems I proc alot more while not in RB.</div></div><hr />
