<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While certainly the recent round have patches have caused some aggravation, there has been some bloody funny stuff happening.  Anyone who has seen Seru or Fennin can attest to that.  When we killed him earlier, he literally bunny hopped out of his castle and his wings were stuck flat out.  Halfway through the fight he got a call to go save some halpless maiden in Freeport, and he took flight and was never seen again.  In a rare moment, he was caught as he was launching himself into the air.<br />

The arrow lag is so bad, rangers are reporting they turn off their bows and continue to get damage and crit hit messages for as long as 10 more minutes, heh.</div></div><hr />
