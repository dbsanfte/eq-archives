<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Getting our facts straight, before you brow beat shamans as being such good dps... <br />
<br />
DDs: level - spell name, mana cost, dmg done, casting time<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
62 - Condemnation, 365, 1100, 6.5 (3.01 hp/mana)<br />
(Not undead based, this is a general nuke.)<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
65 - Winter's Frost, 390, 1550, 6.35 (3.97 hp/mana)<br />
65 - Summer's Flame, 355, 1400, 6.25 (3.943 hp/mana)<br />
<br />
Ranger<br />
64 - Brushfire, 220, 612, 3.5 (2.78 hp/mana)<br />
63 - Frozen Wind, 300, 700, 3.5 (2.33 hp/mana)<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
64 - Velium Strike, 300, 925, 7.8 (3.08 hp/mana)<br />
61 - Spear of Torment, 275, 675, 4.2 (2.45 hp/mana)<br />
<br />
Because of the longer casting time on the shaman nuke (7. , a end game cleric can actually nuke just as well as an end game shaman against NON UNDEAD mobs. A druid has a shaman beat hands down. A ranger is slightly behind, but makes up for it by fast casting times.<br />
<br />
Dots:<br />
<br />
Level - Name, Mana, dmg, duration, casting time, resist adj if applicable<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
64 - Vengeance of Tunare, 355, 1500, 30 sec, 5.25, -30 (4.23 hp/mana)<br />
63 - Swarming Death, 350, 1440, 36 sec, 6.0, -100 (4.11 hp/mana)<br />
<br />
Ranger<br />
62 - Drifting Death, 200, 650, 60sec, 5.3, -100 (3.25 hp/mana)<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
65 - Blood of Saryn, 535, 2240, 42 sec, 5.7, 0 (4.18 hp/mana)<br />
64 - Bane, 490, 2100, 30 sec, 5.5, 0 (4.28 hp/mana)<br />
64 - Breath of Ulthor, 550, 3406, 156sec, 5.7, 0 (6.19 hp/mana)<br />
(Yes, not a typo on that duration for Ulthor. It's a 2.6 min duration.)<br />
<br />
Okay the only clear winner is Breath of Ulthor. But... how many fights do you know that last 2.6 minutes? Most fights last around 30 seconds. So looking at the other dots... the top druid dot actually has better efficiency than shaman Bane, in addition to better resist adjustment and it's against fire... bane is against magic which we all know tends to be the highest resist out there on mobs.<br />
<br />
So.... <br />
Shamans clearly lose on the nuke department and druids have them beat on the dot department. <br />
<br />
Just for kicks...<br />
<br />
Necromancer<br />
65 - Blood of Thule, 500, 2345, 42 sec, 5, -50 (4.69 hp/mana)<br />
61 - Dark Plague, 425, 2640, 120 sec, 5, -50 (6.22 hp/mana)<br />
<br />
Both of those spells are clear winners, casting time, efficiency, AND resist adjustment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If shamans want max DPS, they chain cast rains, not dots or DDs.  But on the dot front, your own numbers show ours to be the best of the 30 sec dots, and while the necro dots are more efficient, you yourself claim most fights only last 30 secs, so there goes that advantage.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone has any illusions that shamans are uber at DD.  Were not bad, but certainly far from the top, and I'm just fine with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I appreciate the summary, but nothing new here.  It is common knowledge that Necros have the best dots, and druids have very efficient dots.  As you stated, we have the most powerful dots in terms of total damage, but they are totally impractical due to the low dps and long duration.<br />
<br />
Wizards, Mages and Druids have far better dd's than shaman.  Always have and always will.  Hell, with the new spells, even the cleric and enchanter will have 1200 hp dd's.  Our's still tops out at 925 (sad).<br />
<br />
Let's face it, even with the new pet proc and crit aa's and the dot crits (which many classes are getting) our dps is falling further and further behind the rest.  Especially as compared to the BST, who gets dot crits, pet crits, pet flurry, new pet procs, an upgrade to Ferocity and a 742 hp dd.  I guess I know which class is Sony's favorite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just one of the explanations of shamans being shafted is always &quot;they are good dps&quot;<br />
<br />
Well... how are they good dps?  Yes, slow is great.. but there's several other classes with viable slows.  Heals... okay there's 2 other classes with better heals.  Puppy... puppy sucks unless compared to druid booboo.  I don't know how puppy compares to shadowknight pet.  He doesn't even dual wield unless alpha.<br />
<br />
I just .... get disappointed. I regularly play my shaman with a beastlord and a druid... being surrounded by a slower almost as good as myself, and a class that nukes and dots better, it gets depressing.<br />
<br />
That said, I've started levelling a paladin.  I love the shaman but I just feel a tad redundant.<br />

<br />
Difference being, that our two best dots (Bos, Bane) stack up to 200 more damage per tick than the two best druid ones. Does that make em better than the druid dots? I'd say yes, even given the fact that they get -mr on theirs but it's a pretty close call.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about a little consistancy here, and show a little bit more common knowledge?<br />
<br />
A spell's usefulness is measured by it's magnitude and efficiency. Of course, I'd rather see shaman spells get a resist adjust like necros, but who in their right mind would give up the huge advantage in magnitude from shaman dots in exchange with current druid dots?<br />
<br />
How did you get &quot;druid dots are better&quot; from your own numbers?<br />
<br />
I am actually someone on the side of &quot;shamans can use a bit of tweaking&quot; but people like you are definately hurting my cause. How do you plan to convince anyone of anything by throwing out arguements that are defeated by your own numbers in the same post?<br />
<br />
I appreciate the fact that you want to improve the shaman class, but honestly, let's try not to insult everyone's intelligence by using blantantly false statements, eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
.......... no<br />
<br />
We do not do much damage in anything except the most specialized situations.  The rest of the time, we are pretty much bottom of the barrel when it comes to damage dealing.  It is pretty rare to see anyone claim otherwise.  I don't think I have ever heard a shaman say that we were being shafted because we already do such great damage.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of your post, I really do not see the point.  A cleric is a comparable nuker to us.  So what?  How often is a cleric's main role to do damage?  Even less often than a shaman.<br />
<br />
And about druid dots:  you are missing three very important things.  First of all, by your own calculations, Bane is actually slightly MORE efficient than the druid ldon dot.  Second, is that we make up for slightly less efficient dots by having vastly superior mana regeneration.  The third and most important thing that you left out is that our ldon dot does 120 more damage per tick than a druids.  Shamans still surpass druids when it comes to dots.  We always have and (hopefully) we always will.<br />
<br />
As for necros having better dots than us, well.... they are supposed to.  Whining about necros having better dots than us is like whining about clerics having better heals.  It is what they specialize in, so of course they do it better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Very true, shaman have better dots than druids, no question.  They in turn get much better dd's.  And lets not overlook the fact that Necros get better dots, dd's, better mana regen and a much better pet.  As has been said, when it comes to dps, we are near the bottom of the barrel.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you define 'best' to be how quickly can you kill a mob using only DoTs and be full mana, then shamans are far and away the best DoTters.<br />
<br />
I've been meaning to post a thread with all the numbers because I'm tired of seeing people say that necros are better DoTters than we are.  Their individual spells are better; their ability to stack/sustain them is not close to ours.  All they had on us was the fact they had alteration dots, but, with secondary forte coming, nec/shm will be on equal footing there again (enchancing the shm advantage even more).<br />
<br />
Course we'll have to see what the GoD spells look like once they're finalized, but I don't expect the overall picture to change much, since how much damage you can sustain with DoTs remains largely a function of mana regen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Unlike our nuke, and to an extent, our rain, the problem with our dots is not the magnitude or efficiency per se (except to the extent that the entire dot system is flawed and need improvements across the board).   <br />
<br />
The significant number is the resist modifier.  Druid: neg 30 or neg 100.  Necro: neg 50.  RANGER: neg 100.  Shaman: zero modifier - always.<br />
<br />
And therein lies the problem.  We dot bigger, and better, on the whole, than other classes - when those dots land.  But in every possible circumstance, our dots land less, and that effect is a large hit on our dots in terms of both time and mana efficiency.  I presume that was set up &quot;because shaman get maloxxx&quot;, but denying us the front-loaded resist modifier on the basis of a 5 second cast time/400 mana spell alters the efficiency of our dots to such a degree as to make them substantially poorer choices than other classes.</div></div><hr />

Or better yet stumble through lvls 55~61 as a chanter. both those tasks can be compared to passing a kidney stone while being poked in the eye with a fondue (spelling?) fork. At least we shammys can get groups at the drop of a hat at practically any lvl. <br />

That parse is not a good example and you must know this. (For those who didn't read the thread, it's a screenshot of having 8 dots on Aten Ha Ra, for about 200 dps).<br />
<br />
The long term encounters present in Luclin were good for shaman from a DPS standpoint, in that they gave us the ability to use our DoTs to their full effect. The downside is that many classes found them rather tedious, since hacking away at a boss mob with 10 million HP and massive AC isn't the most entertaining thing in the world. Nonetheless, these fights allowed shaman to shine (at least relative to the current situation) in terms of DPS.<br />
<br />
That style of encounter design is long gone. PoP fights overwhelmingly favor huge burst DPS (Grummus, AD, MB, RD, Bertox, the list goes on and on) over sustained DPS. It's ludicrous to use this as an example of our &quot;great DPS&quot; in the with the current state of the vast majority of PoP-style bossmob encounters.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how you found 8 free slots open on AHR, though. I'm always fighting with necros for detrimental effect slots.    :)</div></div><hr />

Tek, i don't doubt your numbers. But what is the relevance of your post for a look at the whole 60 plus DoT-situation?<br />
<br />
You take one single raid scenario, where you got lucky enough or were just in the mood for some crazy testing  ;) to stack every DoT in your book on a mob and draw conclusions about shaman dps. Is that some situation the AVERAGE shaman faces every day or even once per week? I don't think so. <br />
<br />
Kyrial was trying to make a point about the general situation of shaman DoTs. Sure you may disagree with his view, but the constant 'Woot i soloed Yeldema once, so my class is balanced' doesn't help to get a realistic view on the situation.<br />
<br />
For the record i don't agree with Kyrial completely. As others pointed you have to look at the whole picture. Shabura got it right, our DoTs would be OK, if the chance of landing would be slightly increased together with a look at the loss of efficiency caused by faster and faster encounters and aggro.<br />
<br />
Edit: Calling someone a troll and giving him negative rep bumps, because you disagree with him and he hasn't 1000+ posts is surprisingly low in my book. But whatever /shrug.</div></div><hr />
