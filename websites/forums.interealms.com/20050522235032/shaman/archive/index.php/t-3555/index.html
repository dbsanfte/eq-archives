<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bugged this but thought I would post here.  I was running around in Thurgadin today and wanted to make a few steaks for food.  I buffed up and put my chr gear on and I can buy the steaks for 1silver each... max the counter and get charged 21silver peices... now I didn't get 21 meats, I know that....<br />
<br />
Anyway be aware that the vendors at least in Thurgadin are skimming off you if you buy anything beyond 1 item<br />
<br />
Anyway, here are some pics.<br />
<br />
Bought 20 of the bear and lion meat<br />

<br />
Bought 20 of the spices<br />

<br />
Bought 19 of the sauces... had just realize what they were doing.  I haven't quite figured out a formula how to come up with that exact value yet.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Odd, I bought a ton of alchemy herbs yesterday, no problem using the counter to choose 20 each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*sniff sniff* Ninja patch!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purifyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He means that although the merchant says the meat is one silver each, when you buy a stack of 20 you pay more than 1 silver each... they round up all the pennies obviously..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fezik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This has been around since you could buy stacks of 20.<br />
<br />
Anytime its 1silver they always charge 21silver for a full stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The reason that it is sometimes more to buy a stack then it would be to buy just one is because it is for some reason set at an odd amount.  It's been around forever, and been discussed on numerous other boards if not here.  Basically if an item sells for 1sp but when you buy a stack you pay 2gp 1sp or 21sp it's because it gets rounded down to 1sp ea but is actually 1.05 sp Since they can't really charge that amount it just get's rounded down to 1 sp.  Something like that anyway.  Read about it a few times in the past</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The question is, knowing this... is it worth the extra silver to buy a stack at a time?  :)  Sure is for me !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OMG! Not one silver...that means after I buy 100,000 stacks they will have ripped me off for 1k!  The bastards!<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  Put an ! after bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Like Miyn said, it's just a rounding oddity. You're not getting ripped off buying a stack of 20 for 210 copper. Rather, you're getting a bargain when you buy one at a time because the actual price of 10.5 copper each is rounded down to the nearest copper.</div></div><hr />
