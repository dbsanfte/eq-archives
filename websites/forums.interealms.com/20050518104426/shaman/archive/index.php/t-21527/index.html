<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, well, over on the EQ live forums, we have the thread on what shaman AA we want, so I thought maybe i'd hash out this idea...<br />
<br />
We have general, archetype, and class AA... So why not racial? As it is, the only difference between the EQ races is the models used. Bring back (or enhance) the things that make a race unique.<br />
<br />
For instance, let's say... Barbarians. Wild but honorable animistic people living in the cold reaches of Norrath, right? They don't really have much by way of special abilities, however. So what kind of racial AA could we cook up for these poor bastards?<br />
<br />
- Cold affinity. Rather than a simple number added to your resists, this would reduce damage and duration of cold-based spells by a percentage according to how many points ya spend on it.<br />
<br />
- Wolf's step. Another runspeed AA, but perhaps with a snare resistance modifier. <br />
<br />
- Snowblind Sight. Living in an eternally overcast land blanketed in blinding white snow and cofered by storms, I would think after a while barbarian's eyes adjust to bad conditions, granting ultravision.<br />
<br />
Or, how about, oh, those bastard halflings?<br />
<br />
- Fireside tales. In AD&amp;D and EQ alike, halflings find themselves having to talk their way out of bad situations more often than not. this AA could either be a lull or a faction increaser, depending.<br />
<br />
- Little Sneak. Increases the halfling's innate hide / sneak by a small % per level. OR, it could allow them to hide and sneak at the same time.<br />
<br />
- Stupid Lack of Self Preservation. Okay, I'm not good at naming these... But this would make the halfling immune to fear spells.<br />
<br />
Just a few ideas. Alternately, we could have a branch that enhances what you already have for your race, or grants the ability of another race. Perhaps Ogres would be immune to melee stun from all sides, while other races could buy an AA to give them a better chance of ignoring it from the front.<br />
<br />
A branch off of this idea is Religious AA. Currently religion means jack aside from what imbued items you can wear, and certain factions (Exactly why do Aviaks hate Veeshan?)<br />
<br />
For example...<br />
<br />
- Retribution of the Tribunal. When activated, increases your melee and spell damage output by a level-based percentage, as you smite those who need to be smoted... Or whatever.<br />
<br />
- Shining Glory of Mithaniel. An area effect undead fear and blind. Exactly how big of a train can you make with a button click?<br />
<br />
- Innoruuk's Bile. No-fail taunt + taunt-generating DoT effect. Sometimes ya just REALLY need aggro.<br />
<br />
Or...<br />
<br />
- Apathy of Agnost the Bland. Reduced effects from spells cast by gods and their direct minions<br />
<br />
No, no, it's nothing spectacular, just a few random ideas I popped off my head</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats a great idea!  It would bring back a little diversity in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Other than the snare necklace and frontal stun immunity (and infravision and regen), there should be something that makes a difference among Shamans who are Barbarians, Trolls, Ogres, Iksar, Vah Shir or Froglocks.<br />
<br />
I mean, besides the graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is something unique about barbarian shaman.  They all suck.<br />
<br />
Slamdooley the Troll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just because we can't grow warts on our face doesn't mean we suck.<br />
<br />
Spraggon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was just talking about this with another Iksar -- increased forage ability AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good idea on the racial/religion AA's  :)<br />
<br />
Dunno why you lesser races are arguing anyway; it's quite clear to everyone that iksar are the best race :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">An even better idea would be to abolish race exp penalties. it made no sense for Hybrids to have it, makes no sense for every Shaman race except Vah Shir and Froglok to have 'em.<br />
<br />
I mean, what, Ultravision, already small, wears plate, 150 swimming, high magic resist and stamina, and twice the breath capacity of every other race isn't worth even a 5% penalty, but slam and 2 HP regen is worth four times that much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We got a racial exp penalty for slam?!? What a joke, I never even use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Racial AA's are a great idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I always thought Shaman should get track or forage or both.<br />
<br />
SOMEBODY is rooting though Permafrost / Innothule / Grobb and finding all those herbs.<br />
<br />
And you're trying to tell me that growing up in Oggok, Innothule, Perma, Kunark and Luclin (not the most hospitable environs) you never learned how to track food?<br />
<br />
If not full blow Druid / Ranger track, then once you click on a MOB, unless it goes inviso you can track it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Racial AA sounds relatively good. Religious AA.. Well... I feel sorry for my bretheren(SP?) and all the agnostic folks. Good idea yes, but I know Vah Shir and Wood Elves have no racial armours and such, and allAgs/Kitties would get bent over with religion aa.<br />
<br />
Although, a nifty AA for Vah Shir would be a Sneak AA.  Yeah, we get sneak,but i think it's capped at 50, and only works half the time, and more often than not, it's seen through.  Give us an aa that makes it more effective/reliable. Don't need SOS, but improve it to make it useful to some degree.<br />
<br />
Although, personally, I'd love a double attack AA, and one for bash. (ithink anyone with a shield should be able to bash, except those sissy robe wearers :P )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All Iksar should have the ability to Tail Thwap.  Oh and improved swimming, improved Forage....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like the idea of Racial AAs, but in all honesty, it would be difficult to implement fairly. After all, many of us made our choice of race long ago, and to &quot;punish&quot; or &quot;reward&quot; us now would be unfair. <br />
<br />
Perhaps a better idea, given the large number of playstyles available to the Shaman class, would be &quot;trees&quot;, where you choose a tree and that opens up new AA along the style you wish. If you want to be a better healer, you choose Healing Tree. If you want to have better Nukes, you pick that tree. Only 1 tree per customer, though, so you cannot go back and change your mind. <br />
<br />
I would just hate to be annoyed about my choice as a troll because Frogs got some REALLY cool AA that I reall want, just for being frogs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, as it seems that EQ has turned into a testbed for EQ2, AA trees might not be a bad idea.  It would give players a few more choices in their playstyle and give the devs a chance to see how a situation like that would work.<br />
<br />
Id be more than willing to try that, as Ive been pushing for all healing AA's lately anyway.  I would say that you should be able to max all the trees, but be unable to work on more than one at a time.  So, if you picked the Healing Mastery tree, you would have to finish a requisite number of AA points/abilities in that tree before you could spend points in a Nuke Mastery or Melee Mastery tree.  That way, if you choose a path and decide 30AA in that you arent as thrilled with it, you can still choose a different path but you would have to finish the tree that you began before you would be able to move on.<br />
<br />
Wow, the more I think about that idea the more I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bad idea. They cant balance classes fairly, now they are expected to balance race/class combos?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think this is an EXCELLENT idea.  I've already experienced the pain of being shafted with the introduction of racial armors (curses his agnostic warrior).  But racial armors were an excellent idea.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see this introduced - extend the differences between the races and perhaps even deities.  Add a couple race-specific AAs per race, and a few more for deities.  Include AAs for agnostics - don't leave them out.  Or perhaps even make them innate - not AAs but simple bonuses to the race/deity.  Although given SOE's proclivity for time sinks, I'd assume AAs would be their choice.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they could come up with diametrically-opposed pairs of deities, and improve the effectiveness of spells against those aligned with the opposing deity, while suffering an increased susceptibility to spells from those same mobs.  This makes more sense in PvP, since not all mobs are aligned with a deity, but it would have some relevance even in PvE.  <br />
<br />
Example: my Cazic Thule-worshipping ogre shaman gets a deity AA that grants him a slightly-increased chance to land spells on mobs (and players in PvP) that worship the religious &quot;opposite&quot; of Cazic Thule.  I'll admit, I'm no longer up to speed on the deities enough to speculate who that might be - a better example might be Rallos Zek (god of War) vs Tunare (goddess of Peace).  As a penalty, mobs aligned with my religious &quot;opposite&quot; get a better chance to land spells on me.  <br />
<br />
It would add some freshness and diversity - I really like it.  Have you suggested this in the EQ Live boards?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I like this idea.  They would need to be careful how they implement it and probably make them more flavorfull then useful, but I think it has the potential to bring some more fun into the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I like the idea in that it grounds the game back into its routes and not the current raid homogenuinty. However, as Blazz said it could punish certain races although the aa could be minor enhancements rather than game changing enhancements. I mean a class having higher regen now isn't really that much of a bonus and gives certain grandeurr to certain classes.<br />
To the idea of trees, I think its being used in eq2, don't reckon the eq engine is complicated enough to allow it, I mean with the diversity of ideas eq could have taken on it seems to have stuck to pretty much the same path. I mean if you take like traps and how simple they are in eq, I would have thought that if they could have upgraded them they would have  rather just be a textual thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Racial gear should never be taken into account for aa's. The ability to wear fierce heraldic or what not matters very little after a certain level range.<br />
<br />
Dieties are pretty imbalanced. For my rallos choice i got... a crappy yaulp neck. Barbs get a hammer that a noob would laugh at... Inny worshippers get a snare neck? Umm... yeah.<br />
<br />
I can see it now. MM Frogloks get 97% rez, since they worship mith marr andhes kind of cleric'y. Ogres get a str buff $$.<br />
<br />
The added level fo depth you are asking for may work well in tabletop games, where the gm can personally tweak them. There is such a myriad of problems in eq right now, asking for racial aa balance, relgigious spell balance, etc is just going to screw things up more. Its easy to say &quot;if done right&quot;, but we all know they dont have the testing to ensure it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, my idea was more for &quot;flavor&quot; abilities than actual &quot;Holy cow, look what I can do!&quot; stuff. <br />
<br />
Of course, the way it works, Sony would give Dark Elves death touch, and trolls would get illusion: Halfling...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Of course, the way it works, Sony would give Dark Elves death touch, and trolls would get illusion: Halfling...<br />

WOO WOO!! Then I can stop carrying around potions . . .<br />
<br />
. . . can you make it Gnome instead? There is something about a Gnome SHaman that just . . . I dunno . . . <br />
<br />
heh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">good idea, but one problem: SOE has no desire nor will to actually put more work into AA's then needed.</div></div><hr />

Stop and think about this for a minute. How many times would you be half chewed by some Ogre thinging you were a real gnome, only to be spit out when you didn't taste quite right. Or worse yet weren't spit out since the orge likely couldn't tell the difference.</div></div><hr />
