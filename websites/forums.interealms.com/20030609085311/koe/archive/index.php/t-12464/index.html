I to would like to take the time to thank you for allowing Leoclaw and myself to join you at &quot;meet and greet&quot;.   We have both seen different zones - and parts of zones - that we had never seen before.  I have enjoyed myself tremendously and rather impressed with how well as a group you recover from total wipes - it was a blast. (referring to Acrylia Caverns).  I am also impressed with the gift i received (the face piece) for being a guest.<br />
 <br />
Am looking forward to spending many more hours with all of you (providing of course we are invited to come). :cool:<br />
