Not sure how many of you all remember my original attempt at fan fiction, but here is the updated version.  This is a work in progress, so check back frequently for new installments and changes to existing ones.<br />

Hope you enjoy! :)<br />

Snowreader<br />
<br />
“I am sorry,” said the Hierophant Aelwyl.  “Her life force is not strong enough.  It will extinguish soon.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir reached down to touch his infant daughter’s face with a quivering finger; she grasped it with her tiny hand and smiled, gurgling out a laugh.  He fought back the immense weight of sorrow that was suddenly dropped upon his heart.  A Champion of Faydark was taught to accept the will of Tunare without question and emotion.  Why then was this so difficult?  After all, it was a mere infant – one soul among thousands.  What could the life of one elven child possibly mean to the grand scheme of Nature?<br />
	<br />
“Why do you hide your true feelings, Ioemir?” asked Aelwyl.  “There is no shame in shedding tears for those you love.”<br />
	<br />
“A warrior of Tunare sheds no tears, M’Lady.  Not even for those he loves.  How fares my love, Nao’lya?  Will she recover?”<br />
	<br />
“Yes, in time she will regain her strength.  But it was a difficult childbirth.  She is drained, both in mind and body.”  <br />
	<br />
“Are you certain there is nothing that can be done for my child?  Ymeal, have you no healing magic to offer?”<br />
	<br />
The high elf straightened himself from the doorframe upon which he was leaning and stepped to the bedside.  Chanting quietly to himself, he passed a hand over the cooing infant.  A blue, ethereal glow illuminated his pale flesh and that of the young wood elf.  <br />
	<br />
“Forgive me, Ioemir,” said Ymeal.  “No magic I possess can reverse this.  The healing spell I have cast upon her can only delay the inevitable for a short time – one moon’s cycle, perhaps two.  It’s as if Tunare Herself has embraced your daughter’s soul and is drawing it closer to Her bosom.”<br />
	<br />
For the first time in his life, Ioemir was completely powerless.  He had defended Kelethin for many seasons against scores of foes – Dark Elves, orcs, undead.  But one, tiny infant had rendered him helpless.  The specter of death had no flesh to cut at, no heart to pierce with a well-placed arrow.  Not even the life magic of a high priest of Tunare could mend his child.<br />
	<br />
“Can no one help my daughter?  Can no magic keep her soul in this world?”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl stepped outside and watched the tops of the great evergreens sway to the rhythm of an afternoon breeze.  “Perhaps there is someone who can help.  An old friend –“ the hierophant caught herself – “A former friend.  I only hope there is enough goodness left in his heart to aid you.”<br />
	<br />
“Anything,” Ioemir said forcefully, stepping beside Aelwyl.  “I will give up all the personal wealth I have.  Please, M’Lady!  I beg of you, contact this person.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl’s thoughts wandered briefly to the past.  “Very well, I will do what I can to summon him.  But it may take some time, for he lives far, far from here.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
	<br />
The setting sun’s rays seemed to bathe the great snowy field in a blanket of fire.  Deep blues and purples melted into warm oranges and yellows, reflecting and dancing off of long icicles – remnants of ancient waterfalls that once bore witness to another land, green and fertile.<br />
	<br />
Heldorm Snowreader emerged from his hut, overlooking the frozen village of Halas.  In the streets below, he watched life pass as it had for countless generations – merchants bringing in their goods for the night, hunters returning to their homes with the day’s kill, Old Man McGrinnim would be hauling in his final catch of the evening.  Change in Halas happened very slowly, almost imperceptibly.  Then again, time had little meaning to his people.  In a land of eternal winter, there is no way to distinguish one season from the next.  Even the passage of long time is measured only from one generation to another.  Besides, there were more important things to concern oneself with than what hour it was – such as whether there would be enough food to eat, or whether one would live to see the next day.<br />
	<br />
Heldorm stepped back into his hut and draped a polar bear skin tightly across the threshold.  The small, central fire began to die.  He threw another twig into the flames and pulled his cloak closer around him.  Tonight would come to bear what the elder shamans of Halas had begun to suspect – the days were growing colder.  Some prophesized that the coming cold marked the beginning of the Slow Dying – a time when the final generation of all Norrathians would be born and wither away into freezing darkness.  Yet Heldorm was the Snowreader, he who could read the mysteries of the land by its ever-shifting face.  Everyone looked to him for answers, some kind of absolution that he could not offer.  Only the Tribunal could tender such things, and they rarely interfered with the lives of mortals.<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm!” a loud voice called from the distance.  The shaman stood from his fire and peered from around the bearskin.  At the foot of the hill stood two figures, half-hidden from a snowfall that had begun moments before.  One wore the distinct clothing of the Wolves of the North warrior clan.  The other was much smaller in stature, draped in a hooded cloak.  Heldorm trudged to the bottom of the hill, where the watchman greeted him.  <br />
<br />
“Beggin’ yer pardon for the interruption, Venerable One, but this stranger insists on seeking yer council.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm looked the petite outsider over apprehensively.  He tried to peer under the fur-lined hood, but the stranger shied away.  “Aye, well,” the Snowreader finally said, “no sense in freezin’ out ‘ere in the cold, ‘specially for someone small as ye.  Come in an’ warm up a bit.”  The stranger bowed and continued up the hill.  Heldorm saluted the watchman, who returned the gesture and marched back toward his post.<br />
	<br />
Stepping back inside the hut, Heldorm addressed his visitor, “Ye must have important business to travel to these lands.  My people don’t always take kindly to stran –“ He stopped as the stranger removed her hood to reveal a familiar face.  “Aelwyl!”         <br />
	<br />
The Wood Elf smiled at Heldorm and said softly, “Hail to you, again, old friend.”<br />
	<br />
“Old friend?  I’d say that’s a bit of a stretch.  What do ye want of me now?  Another chance at twistin’ my heart around?”<br />
	<br />
“I see you still have not forgotten the past,” the Heirophant said looking into the fire.<br />
	<br />
“How could I forget it?  An’ I thought traveling ‘ere was against Tunare’s wishes.”<br />
	<br />
“I had to take that chance, Heldorm.  There is much at stake.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm laughed quietly before saying sarcastically, “Aye, I’m sure there is.”<br />
	<br />
“I thought your heart might still be hardened,” Aelwyl sighed.  “I just never knew it was made of stone.  Forgive me for disturbing you; I can see this was all a mistake.  Fare thee well, Heldorm.”  She threw her hood back over her head and walked to the threshold.<br />
	<br />
“Wait,” the shaman said with a deep sigh, just as Aelwyl was pushing aside the bearskin, “I suppose ye would not have risked this if ‘twere not important.  Tell me, what is yer problem?”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl turned her head slightly and let the bearskin fall back in place.  “For what peace of mind it may bring you, what I ask of you is not for my own sake, but for that of an innocent child.  She was born with a weak life force, which diminishes by the day.  A high priest of Felwithe has blessed her to the extent of his abilities.  His magic has extended her life for a moon’s cycle, perhaps two.  But she needs something more permanent, something infused with the healing powers of the earth.  You know of what I speak.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm looked back toward his racks of herbs and vials.  “Ye know that I could never find its recipe.”<br />
	<br />
“Surely after all these seasons you have made some progress?”<br />
	<br />
“Some, aye.  But there’s still somethin’ I’m missin’.  I feel that I’m close, but can never quite get there.”<br />
	<br />
“So will you help her?”<br />
	<br />
“I suppose this child is back in Kelethin?”  The shaman asked after a lengthy pause.<br />
	<br />
“Yes, she is.”<br />
	<br />
“An’ I also suppose ye’ll be wantin’ me to come back there with ye?”<br />
	<br />
“Yes, it would bring her poor father some comfort.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm pushed aside the bearskin and looked down on Halas again.  The streets were now deserted, save for a few patrolling watchmen.  “Well, ye know I have a duty to the people of Halas . . . but I suppose there’r shamans wiser than I that could be watchin’ over things for a bit.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl smiled and softly touched Heldorm’s arm.  “Perhaps your heart was not totally hardened after all.”<br />
	<br />
“Alright, let’s see this child.”<br />
	<br />
The Hierophant called loudly upon the great winds of Tunare.  A great gust, which seemingly came from nowhere, blew into the hut and opened a shimmering portal, through which the two priests of Nature stepped.<br />
<br />
***<br />
	<br />
Meklozanth ran his shriveled fingers over the orb’s smooth surface, briefly leaving five glowing lines of energy.  The gray mist that once hung motionless inside the orb, now churned and collapsed into a swirling maelstrom.<br />
	<br />
“Five hundred years,” the aged Teir’Dal addressed the orb in a raspy, tainted voice.  “That is how long I have searched for the root of life, the very heart of immortality.  And you, my Xanzokek, have brought me to the brink of that discovery.”  Images began to form within the swirling mist – nameless faces of every known race.  “You seek out the dying and reveal them to me.  They mustn’t be too old, however.  The younger they are, the stronger their life force, and the more youth is returned to me.”  The mist slowed and centered in on one specific image – a young child, almost newborn.  “Hail, what have we here?” <br />
	     <br />
The mist diminished somewhat to reveal the child’s features – lightly tanned skin, still darkening to its natural copper hue; pointed ears, not yet their full length.  “Ahhh, a Feir’Dal, and a child at that.  Most excellent.  And tell me, Xanzokek, where might I find this child?”  The misty image panned upward to a rolling canopy of evergreens, above which the first stars of the evening eagerly peeked through the sky’s blue-black veil.  “Kelethin,” the Dark Elf smiled, beckoning in the air with his index finger.  Behind him, three skeletons clad in chain mail and holding short swords clattered to life.  “Perhaps it is time I paid homage to the children of Tunare.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
	<br />
While the Wood Elves of Kelethin were not unaccustomed to hosting other races within their city, a visitor from Halas was a unique experience.  Most Wood Elves had never seen what they called “Barbarians.”  From the moment Heldorm stepped through the portal, he was greeted with stares and excited whispers.  Standing over seven feet tall, the shaman found himself ducking and crouching more than simply walking through the tiered structures of the tree city.  <br />
<br />
Aelwyl led Heldorm to a log house tucked into the south corner of the city.  Outside, Ioemir and Ymeal were talking and drinking from silver mugs.  Upon seeing Heldorm, both elves stood and stared in amazement.<br />
<br />
“Is this the man we seek, Aelwyl?” asked Ioemir.<br />
<br />
“Yes, his name is Heldorm Snowreader.  Heldorm, this is Ymeal Whitesoul, cleric of Felwithe, and Ioemir Enothie, defender of Kelethin.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm bowed to each and turned to Ioemir.  “Yer the father seekin’ help I assume?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I am at your service,” Ioemir kneeled, still craning his neck to see the full height of his guest.  “You’ll forgive me if I seem taken aback, sire, but I have never seen a Barbarian in the flesh before.”<br />
<br />
How Heldorm hated that word – Barbarian – it suggested incivility and ignorance, neither of which were qualities he considered himself possessing.  Nonetheless, he swallowed his pride and motioned Ioemir to stand.  “Please, no need to be kneelin’.  I’m no king, just a servant of the Tribunal.”  He glanced toward the house, a dancing ring of torchlight emanating from its window.  “The child is inside?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, please, come in.”<br />
<br />
The four entered Ioemir’s house and walked to the large bed, in which Nao’lya and the child lay resting.  The burning torch cast a soft, yellow glow upon mother and child, blanketing them in a serene shroud of light.  Nao’lya stirred and slowly blinked open her eyes.  Upon seeing Heldorm, she gasped and stood up with a start, pulling her child to her.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright, my love,” said Ioemir, comforting her, “he’s here to help.”  The champion gently took the child from his wife’s arms and held her before Heldorm.  <br />
<br />
“Hmmm,” the shaman studied the infant.  “Ye have any warm water by chance?”<br />
<br />
“I heated some not long ago for a kettle of spiced ale.  The water should still be warm.”<br />
<br />
“Take these herbs then, and mix ‘em in some water.  Have yer child drink it all.”  Heldorm reached into a small pouch tied to his belt and scooped out a pinch of dark green herb shavings.  As he poured the mixture into Ioemir’s hand, he asked, “Does she have a name yet?”<br />
<br />
The question caught Ioemir off guard.  “Honestly, we were in such a hurry to save her, we never decided.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, ‘tis a shame.  No child should be without a name.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir said nothing, but began to stir the herbal brew.  When the water was golden-brown, he carried it carefully over to his daughter and pressed the bowl to her lips.  The child resisted some at first, but soon began to take tiny sips until the bowl was empty.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Heldorm nodded slowly, “that should help ‘er fend off any illnesses or bad humors, until I can mix up somethin’ stronger.”<br />
<br />
“So you do know of a cure?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I wouldn’ exactly be callin’ it a ‘cure.’  ‘Tis no disease yer daughter has.  I may be able to whip up something that –“ Just then, another Wood Elf entered the house.  She paused for a moment to behold the Barbarian, but quickly turned back to Aelwyl.<br />
<br />
“Pardon the interruption, M’Lady, but there is a matter that requires your attention.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, thank you.  I must take my leave for now, I shall return soon.”  The Hierophant and the messenger left; Heldorm studied the child and stroked his thin, short beard.<br />
<br />
“Ioemir, a word with ye alone, please.”  The two stepped into the brisk night air, the silhouettes of ancient evergreens towering above them like giants.  “Look,” Heldrom said in a lowered tone, “I’m promisin’ ye nothin’.  Truth is, Aelwyl has more faith in me than I do.  There’s this elixir I’ve been workin’ on for some time now.  I’ve gotten close many times, but ne’er could quite get it right.”<br />
<br />
“What is the purpose of this elixir?”<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s another thing, see, I can’t rightly say since I’ve never made it . . .” Heldorm glanced around briefly before leaning in toward Ioemir and continuing in an even lower tone, “But between you an’ me, I’m thinkin’ it extends life . . . an’ more.”<br />
<br />
“More?”<br />
<br />
“Aye, I gave some of the batch that I was testin’ to a wounded mason near death back in Halas.  The next mornin’ he was up runnin’ around and doin’ the work of two men.  That man is still livin’ today, stronger an’ more alive than ever.”<br />
<br />
“This elixir you speak of sounds like the answer!  You say you have not yet perfected it?”<br />
<br />
“I’m still missin’ one ingredient, though, the key ingredient, actually.  And that’s the problem – I dunno what or where it is, haven’t a clue.”<br />
<br />
“Well, can you not give my daughter some of the incomplete elixir?”<br />
<br />
“To be tellin’ ye the truth, I’m not too keen on the idea of givin’ her the complete one even if I can make it.  An’ the ingredients are very potent, even for one a my kind.  The mason I told ye about was a full-grown man.  The effect such a concoction could have on a sick Wood Elf child could be . . . well, could do her more harm than good.”<br />
<br />
“You have to try, Heldorm Snowreader.  You must try!  Please, I beg of you!”  Ioemir knelt before the shaman again.<br />
<br />
“Now see, there ye go again,” Heldorm looked around nervously as curious townsfolk began to form around him.  “Get up, man, yer startin’ to draw a crowd.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir stood and pleaded a second time.  “Alright, alright,” Heldorm sighed.  “I promise ye I’ll do what I can.  When Aelwyl gets back I’ll have her return me to Halas so I can –“<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid that won’t be possible,” Aelwyl’s voice suddenly announced.  <br />
<br />
The crowd parted as she approached the house.  “I have just held council with Mother Tunare Herself.  My use of the sacred winds to travel to your lands has upset her.  She has forbade me further use of them.”<br />
<br />
“What!  Fer how long?”<br />
<br />
“I know not.  Perhaps a few days, perhaps forever.  I do not question the will of Mother Tunare.”<br />
<br />
“Very well,” Ioemir said bluntly, straightening himself, “then we must return to Halas without the aid of the great winds.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, we must,” Heldorm said just as Ymeal joined them.  “I can’t do this alone.  I’ll need yer help, and even that may not be enough.  Like I told Ioemir, I promise ye nothing’, but I do promise ye to do the best I can.”<br />
<br />
“That’s all I ask . . . friend.”  Ioemir extended his arm, fist clenched.  Heldorm hesitantly locked his arm around the Feir’Dal champion’s and nodded.  Ymeal then joined them without hesitation.<br />
<br />
“Alright, we do this together.”  Heldorm then turned to Aelwyl with a look she’s seen before.<br />
<br />
“Stop right there, Heldorm Snowreader!” she said with a start.  “You’ve gone mad if you think I am just going to stay here.”<br />
<br />
“Aelwyl, listen –“<br />
<br />
“No!  You listen!  My people believe we are all responsible for each other.  If I stay here doing nothing, than it is no different than walking away into the forest forever and abandoning that child.  I will do no such thing!”  The hierophant collected herself for a moment and continued, “Besides, what this . . . 'party' needs is woman’s touch.  Allow men to run off on their own designs and Tunare knows what havoc will follow.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm exhaled a long, loud breath.  “I could never stop ye before, so there’s no sense in tryin’ now.  Just try to stay outta trouble, and my way.”<br />
<br />
“Fair enough.  Now that that’s settled, we must prepare for a short ride to Butcherblock.  The fastest ocean-going vessel in these lands docks there.  And we must make haste!  For every moment we spend doing nothing, the more life slips away from the child.”<br />
<br />
The four were given mounts below the great tree city of Kelethin, and rode off into the night toward the land of the Dwarves.<br />
<br />
<br />
(To Be Continued . . .)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Luclin hung shining in the night sky like a silver coin catching moonlight at the bottom of a well.  The moon was approaching its high point as the four travelers arrived at the outskirts of Kaladim.<br />
<br />
“Halt, there!” a guard announced.  “Who seeks to enter the realm of Kaladim?”<br />
<br />
“Watch this,” Heldorm said quietly, stepping down from his horse.  “I’ve seen the elder shamans do this trick.”  He towered over the Dwarf guard, who held his ground, bravely looked back up at the Barbarian.  Waving his hand across the Dwarf’s face, the shaman said, “Our business is none of yer concern.”<br />
<br />
The guard remained still and silent.<br />
<br />
“*Ahem*, we don’t look like we’d cause any trouble,” Heldorm continued, waving his hand again.<br />
<br />
The Dwarf did nothing.  Heldorm looked quizzically back over his shoulder at his companions.<br />
<br />
“Ye will let us pass.”<br />
<br />
“Oh enough of this,” Aelwyl floated down from her horse and strode up to the guard.  “Excuse me, sire, we simply seek sea passage, nothing more.  We will be through your lands as quickly as possible.”<br />
<br />
“Very well,” the guard replied hesitantly.  “Be on your way.  But straight to the docks with you, if that be your only business.  I’ll be keeping an eye on you all.”<br />
<br />
“See,” Aelwyl said re-mounting her horse with a satisfied smile, “a woman’s touch.”<br />
<br />
“’See, a woman’s touch’,” Heldorm repeated in a quiet, mocking voice.  He followed his companions past the dark granite Kaladim gate, where the first soothing scents of the sea reached his nostrils.  As the archway that opened to the docks came into view, a hint of the sea’s rhythmic breathing filled the air.<br />
<br />
The Stormbreaker was already releasing incoming passengers as the four rode up to the port authority.  After all dismounted, Aelwyl muttered something in Elvish to the horses, which soon took flight away from the docks.  Within moments, all were filing onto the ship.  As Heldorm was about to step onto the gangplank, someone draped in dark silver robes nudged into him.<br />
<br />
“Eh, now watch it there –“ the shaman stopped in mid-sentence as the robed figure’s eyes caught his; they flashed bluish-purple, mesmerizing Heldorm where he stood. <br />
<br />
“Heldorm?  Heldorm?” Ioemir shook on the Barbarian’s arm. <br />
<br />
“Wha?!”  <br />
<br />
“You were staring into thin air for a few moments.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, I was just talkin’ to this . . .” But the stranger had vanished.<br />
<br />
“To whom?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, I guess he’s gone now.  He was right there.”<br />
<br />
“I think the salt air’s gotten to you a bit, my tall friend.  Come along, we should get this voyage over with as soon as possible.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, perhaps yer right.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm and his companions settled down into a cozy niche on the deck as The Stormbreaker, with a brief shudder and sharp creak of wood, disembarked toward the Human settlement of Freeport.<br />
<br />
<br />
Luclin had now reached its zenith in the sky.  Aelwyl averted her gaze from the moon and sat next to a dozing Heldorm.  Sensing her presence, Heldorm scooted away and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Do you think there are people like us on Luclin?” Aelwyl asked, returning her gaze skyward.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t know,” Heldorm responded after an intentional silence.  “Probably not.”<br />
<br />
“Well I believe there is.  Tall, slender men and women with flowing hair and elegant dress; great palaces of emerald glass that shine like the sea in sunlight; ageless forests that blanket the land.”  Aelwyl pulled her shawl tighter.  “I do hope someday we will be able to travel there.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm laughed quietly beside her.  “Travel to Luclin, eh?  An’ how would we do that?”<br />
<br />
“A grand ship that travels through the heavens, perhaps.  Or a sorcerer may yet find a forgotten portal.”<br />
<br />
The shaman just let out a short hmph and dozed off.  Aelwyl rose slowly from the deck and walked toward the bow of the ship.  Ymeal suddenly stepped beside her, “Pardon the intrusion, M’Lady, but I sense some tension between the two of you.  Is everything alright?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, yes.  It is . . . a long story.  I would not want to bore you with it.”<br />
<br />
“No trouble at all, M’Lady.  If you do not wish to speak of it, it is not my place to question your past.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl sank for a moment into memory.  “It has been a long time passed.  Heldorm was hoping for something that I could not give him.  My oath to Mother Tunare overshadowed all others, but he still could not come to terms with that.  So, we took our separate paths.”  She paused a moment to watch a shooting star streak briefly through the night sky, slicing the heavens just beneath Luclin.  “Now our reuniting is bittersweet.”<br />
<br />
“Say no more, M’Lady, I understand.”  Ymeal briefly placed his hand on Aelwyl’s shoulder in a small gesture of comfort, then stepped back to his place beside Ioemir.  The hierophant stared into the light-speckled darkness for a long while before sliding down onto the deck in slumber.<br />
<br />
<br />
“M’Lady?”  Ioemir’s voice slowly leaked into Aelwyl’s mind, like a cool spring seeping to life.  “It’s time to wake up.  We’ve arrived.”  With a strong stretch and deep yawn, the auburn-haired Wood Elf rose to behold the bustling docks of Freeport.<br />
<br />
“Where is everyone else?”  Aelwyl asked quietly, still pulling away the soft blanket of sleep.  “I see everyone but Heldorm.”<br />
<br />
“Heldorm is . . . errm . . . negotiating us passage through the Commonlands.”<br />
<br />
“Oh by Tunare, don’t tell me is trying those mind tricks again!”<br />
<br />
“No no, he’s speaking to the local stablemen, I just don’t think he’s getting very far with them.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl sighed and stepped off of the dock steps.  “Very well, I suppose I need to go find him and set things right . . . again.”<br />
<br />
It didn’t take the three long to find Heldorm.  After all, a seven-foot Barbarian arguing loudly with three stable masters tends to attract attention.<br />
<br />
“I don’t get it,” Heldorm fumed, as his companions walked up to him in the stables.  “I offered ‘em a fair price, but still they won’t budge.”<br />
<br />
“Look, folks,” the stable master, a stout, stern-looking fellow, stood up and gestured to the wagons in his possession.  “10 platinum per head is as low as I can go.  I’m trying to run a business here!”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps we should find an alternate means of transportation.  Would you not agree, Heldorm?”  Aelwyl added quickly before he had a chance to argue.<br />
<br />
“Aye, aye, alright.  We’ll jus’ leave.  Wagons looked like buckets o’ rusted bolts anyway.<br />
<br />
“What was that?!” The stable master yelled after them.<br />
<br />
“I said, ‘and ye try to have a nice day’!”<br />
<br />
A large, murmuring crowd of spectators greeted Heldorm and his companions as they entered the open plaza of Freeport’s Western Gate.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm, I wonder what’s going on here,” Ymeal asked trying in vain to crane his neck above the crowd.  <br />
<br />
His question was soon answered, however, as a small, loud voice shouted, “Yes, folks!  Step right up and feast your eyes on the latest mechanized wonders from Ak’Anon!”  The four adventurers were able to squeeze through some of the crowd and catch a glimpse at the source of the spectacle.  There, in the center, were a Gnome draped in a red robe, and, seated next to him, an Ogre – yellow-skinned and green-eyed, smiling gingerly.  The Gnome pulled away the cover of a large table before him, revealing several metallic contraptions, the functions of which neither Heldorm nor any of his associates dared to contemplate.  The crowd ooed as the afternoon sun reflected from the polished surfaces of the inventions.  “Firstly,” the Gnome picked up a T-shaped object with a screw in the middle and small, cupped panels on each end of the two wings, “have you ever come home from a long day out hunting or adventuring, and all you wanted to do is sit down, relax, and have a nice tall glass of cold ale?”  The crowd responded in a mix of murmurs and nodding heads.  “You sit back into your chair to rest, but that cool glass of ale is sitting there on the edge of your table, taunting you.  You try and try to summon the energy to reach for it but you just can’t quite do it?  Well!  No more!  With the help of my assistant, I will demonstrate.”  The Gnome handed the contraption to his Ogre assistant who immediately sank back into his seat.  The Gnome then poured a tall glass of ale and set it on the edge of the demonstration table.  His assistant then reached out with the T-shaped contraption and . . . just missed the glass.  The Ogre squeezed and squeezed on the end of the device, making the two arms open and close with a distinct clicking sound, but never did these arms once touch the glass.  The crowd erupted in laughter.<br />
<br />
“Wait wait, meez got it!”  The Ogre announced suddenly.  And indeed, he did have the glass of ale.  In fact, he had it so well that not only did the glass shatter into several shards, but the device promptly followed.  The crowd’s howls grew louder.<br />
<br />
“A waste of perfectly good ale that was!”  A voice shouted.<br />
<br />
“Yeah and of my time!”  Another followed.  The crowd dispersed in a din of conversation and chuckles, leaving the two salesmen alone and covered in foamy ale.<br />
<br />
“Look what you’ve gone and done!  I swear by Brell, you just always have to mess everything up!”  The Gnome sighed and began to throw the broken pieces of his invention back onto the table.  “Ah well, get the wagon re-packed at least.  We’ll head on to Rivervale.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm quickly stepped up to the small inventor and helped him pick up the remaining pieces of his contraption.  “Pardon me, but uh I did I hear ye say ye had a wagon?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” the Gnome looked up to Heldorm indifferently, “what of it?”<br />
<br />
“Well, ye see, my companions and I ‘ere are lookin’ fer passage to the northern lands.  And well, we were wonderin’ if ye possibly might be havin’ room for us.”<br />
<br />
The Gnome looked quickly at the four travelers and scratched his balding head.  “Eh, I’m sorry, folks.  My assistant takes up enough room as it is, and my inventions take up the rest.  There’s just no way.  Sorry, g’day to you.”<br />
<br />
“Did I tell ye we took a shine to yer inventions?”  The Gnome stopped in his tracks as the words reached his ears.  <br />
<br />
“Really?  You were?”<br />
<br />
“We were?” Ioemir asked with a start.<br />
<br />
“Aye!  Of course we were!” Heldorm shot a piercing look in Ioemir’s direction.  “In fact, I was thinkin’ I liked em so much that I may be a wee bit interested in perhaps takin some of em off yer hands for a fair price.”<br />
<br />
“Well!”  The Gnome’s demeanor suddenly reversed itself.  “Now I can see I am talking to a man of good sense!  Allow me to introduce myself – Ecbus Gearthumbs at your humble service.”  Ecbus bowed just as his ogre assistant stepped up.  <br />
<br />
“Okies, boss, meez loaded da –“<br />
<br />
“And this is my assistant – Blorg!  The smartest Ogre in Norrath!”<br />
<br />
“Heywo,” Blorg waved with a wide, largely-toothless smile.<br />
<br />
“A smart Ogre?” Heldorm looked amusingly at his companions.  “Ain’t that a contradiction in terms?”<br />
<br />
“Oh no no!  He is smart!  Really!  In large part due to myself, of course, but yes he is quite quick to the punch if ya catch my meaning.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, well, my name is Heldorm Snowreader of Halas, an’ these three folks here are travellin’ with me.”<br />
<br />
“Ioemir Enothie of Kelethin.”<br />
<br />
“Ymeal Whitesoul of Felwithe.”<br />
<br />
“And I am Aelwyl Azuremoon, High Priestess of Tunare.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s a pleasure to make all of your acquaintances!  Now, I hate to rush you folks along, but Blorg and I need to get to Rivervale by nightfall or we’ll lose our lodging reservations.  So if you would be so kind as to follow me, we’ll be off!”<br />
<br />
<br />
Heldorm and his companions soon found that the aforementioned wagon was only a wagon in the fundamental sense of the term.  It had wheels (barely), a flat bed, and what appeared to once be a covered top of some sort.  Heaped in the center of the wagon were countless crates, no doubt filled to the brim with Ecbus’s myriad inventions.  From the moment they stepped on to the rickety vehicle, the four travelers thought that at any moment, they would break through the worm-eaten wood to the road below.  But, amazingly, it still supported their weight.<br />
<br />
“Well, Ecbus,” Heldorm said, nervously inspecting ever facet of the wagon, “this certainly is a . . . errm . . . fine vehicle ye got ‘ere.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, you are too kind, my tall friend!  I know it may not be a looker, but it gets me and my inventions from where I was to where I need to go just as well as any of the rest of them!”<br />
<br />
“Aye, ummm, say where’s that large, Ogre friend o’ yers?  Blorg was it?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Blorg?  He’s in front, ready to start pulling.”<br />
<br />
“Ahh,” Heldorm settled back against a crate near his companions, then suddenly stood up with a start.  “Pulling?!”<br />
<br />
“Off we go!” yelled Ecbus as Blorg lifted the tremendous weight of the wagon and began to pull forward.  <br />
<br />
No more than an hour into their journey, Ecbus approached Heldorm and asked, “So, have you had a chance to look through my collection here to see what ya might want to pick up?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, nay, not yet.  I was gonna do that closer to Rivervale, actually.  In fact, probably after we arrived there, so ye know, I would have more room to look at things.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, nonsense!  Why waste any time?  It will still be several hours yet until we reach Rivervale.  Take all the time you want to look through my wares!”<br />
<br />
“Aye, aye, alright,” Heldorm finally resigned.  “What ye got?”<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s see here.”  Ecbus rubbed his tiny hands together briskly as he scanned the mass of crates.  “Ahhh, here we have a nice item I invented a few years back.”  The gnome reached into an already opened crate and produced a round object with a glass face, behind which were set several dials and numbers; a small copper tube extended from the object’s upper cusp.  “It’s a chromo – er chrono – er time of the day telling brass tube thingy.  All you do is hold it up to the sky, and it sends a magic signal to the sun.  The sun then sends a magic signal back to it, and that tells you what time it is!”<br />
<br />
“Errrm, sounds like too much of a hassle.  In Halas, ye can’t see the sun most o’ the time anyways.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” Ecbus tossed the time-telling device aside and scanned deeper into the stack of crates.  “Aha!  Now here’s something I’m sure you of all people could appreciate!”  Ecbus produced a grim-looking pair of scissors, with sharp, crooked teeth.<br />
<br />
“Now that just looks frightenin’ there, lad!”<br />
<br />
“Quite the contrary, my hairy friend!  It’s perfectly safe!  In fact, it has the patented Ecbus guarantee on it!  If any bodily harm results from the use of this product, then I will refund you the cost in full plus another pair of these . . . errm . . . hair trimming, shortening cutting thingies at only half the cost!  And hey, if it’s not really for you, then you can always buy a pair for your lady friend there.”<br />
<br />
“First of all,” Heldorm began sharply, “she’s not my ‘lady friend,’ and second, I like me body hair just as it is, thank ye.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, a tough sell,” Ecbus rubbed his chin, “Good, I enjoy a challenge.”  He quickly disappeared into the dense jungle of crates and began to rummage around, issuing forth the occasional Gnomish curse and unpleasant crashing sound.  Aelwyl, no longer able to contain herself, began to snicker softly.  Suddenly, something blue and gold that had just fallen out of a nearby crate caught Heldorm’s eye.  He looked closer and it found it to be a small book with a locking mechanism.<br />
<br />
“Hail, what have we here?”  Heldorm picked up the book and turned it over in his hand.  Ecbus popped out from inside a large crate and glanced over at what the Barbarian had discovered.<br />
<br />
“Ah that.  That’s just some regular old journal book.  Nothing really special.”<br />
<br />
“Eh, I really am takin’ a shine to this.”<br />
<br />
“Well, of course you are!” The Gnome leapt from the box and scooted up to Heldorm.  “That’s because that’s no ordinary journal book!  That’s a . . . ummm . . . a personalized, magically locking blue book thingy, yeah that’s it.  Ya see that golden lock there?  Just press your thumb up to the little plate on top.”  Heldorm obliged and the lock opened with a quiet click.  “See!  Now whenever you want to unlock it, the magic locking gold thingy will only remember your thumb, so only you can unlock it!  Neat, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Aye, now that is clever!  Ok, I’ll take it.  All’s I got to spare is five platinum pieces, if that be alright with ye.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, that’s perfectly fine with me, my friend!  (Wow, can’t believe someone actually bought these junky things)”<br />
<br />
“What was that?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing!  Nothing at all!  Tell ya what – I like you, Heldorm.  And because I like you, I’ll throw in a journal for each of your friends here, too.  (Need to get rid of these things, anyway)”<br />
<br />
As Ecbus distributed journals to the others, Heldorm opened his completely and a small stylus rolled out of nowhere into his hand.  Baffled from the lack of an ink well, the shaman rested the stylus against the first blank page.  Suddenly, a small black dot appeared on the paper from the stylus’s tip.  Heldorm looked quizzically at the tip for a moment then pressed it to the yellow page again; another black dot appeared.  Laughing at this marvel, the Barbarian began to write in the ancient language of his people:<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not know why exactly I write this, as I do not believe the events of these coming days will soon leave my memory.  Nevertheless, I have never done anything like this before, so I feel compelled to record my experiences for future review. <br />
<br />
This morning, upon arriving in the Human settlement of Freeport, we had the fortunate (or misfortunate, depending on your point of view) of meeting two traveling merchants.  It is perhaps the most mismatched duo I have ever seen – a Gnome, Ecbus, and an Ogre, Blorg.  Ecbus is a fidgety inventor who makes very . . . well . . . interesting contraptions.  Blorg appears to be his glorified pack mule, and totally subservient.  Of course, granted the mental nature of Ogres, I am not surprised of this arrangement.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, here we sit, on the hard back of a shaking, worm-eaten wagon, heading for the town of Rivervale, where I believe the Halflings live.  This will be interesting, as I’ve never seen a Halfling before (but I imagine them to differ little from Gnomes).  I just hope our stay with them will be short, as every moment we waste, the Elfchild slips further into the grip of death.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
From the Journal of Ymeal:<br />
&quot;Here begins the journal of Ymeal Whitesoul, Cleric of the 60th Tier of Tunare:<br />
<br />
My companions and I have set out upon a most grand adventure, and one of the utmost urgency.  The newborn daughter of my long-time friend, Ioemir Enothie, lies dying in her mother’s arms.  A former friend of the Hierophant Aelwyl Azuremoon seeks the final ingredient to a potion that supposedly extends life, and cures all ailments.  This aforementioned friend is Heldorm Snowreader, a shaman of the northern city of Halas.  He is a very proud man, of good heart and (it pains me to say) thick head at times.  I have yet to see his prowess on the battlefield, but I dare say he is quite formidable, and I hesitate to see him angered, as the extent of his wrath is no doubt a force to be reckoned with.<br />
	<br />
As for the specifics of his past relationship with Aelwyl, I can only speculate.  I believe them to be past lovers, or almost lovers.  But as much as the subject intrigues me, I dare not write more concerning it, as it is not proper for a man such as I am to write of such things.<br />
	<br />
Ah yes, this journal would not be complete without taking mention of the curious pair we made the acquaintance of this morning.  Ecbus Gearthumbs of Ak’Anon, and his assistant, Blorg of Oggok (I presume).  They travel from city to city, selling Ecbus’s inventions.  Personally, I see the aforementioned inventions as cheap trinkets, but I suppose some may find them useful.  Nonetheless, they have graciously offered us transportation to the fair town of Rivervale.  <br />
<br />
Ah, Rivervale.  How I long to return there again.  And, perhaps, I will see her again.<br />
<br />
Here I end my writings for this day.  May Tunare bless our journey and keep watch over the innocent one.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
From the Journal of Aelwyl:<br />
<br />
&quot;Heldorm never ceases to irritate me.  Not only is he pig-headed, stubborn, and egotistical, but he continues to shun me like a beggar in the city streets!  I know our past has been less than pleasant, but I thought there may have been something to salvage.  <br />
	<br />
I just cannot say.  I still hold hope that one day Heldorm will look at me and hold me the way he used to.  But with every passing moment of silence between he and I, that hope fades evermore.<br />
	<br />
But I am digressing from far more urgent matters.<br />
	<br />
Ioemir’s daughter is gravely ill, and Heldorm is her only hope at life.  No doubt the pressure he must feel right now is difficult to bear.  But alas, it is his (and ours) to bear.  I do so hope we are not too late in finding the third ingredient.<br />
	<br />
. . . And I think Ecbus is trying to read what I am writing, so I will end here.&quot; <br />
<br />
          <br />
From the Journal of Ioemir:<br />
	<br />
&quot;The condition of my daughter consumes me with every passing moment.  Every ray of sunlight that is lost seems to echo a drop of life running from my daughter’s body.  I pray to Tunare that Heldorm is able to find the cure of which he speaks.<br />
	<br />
Heldorm Snowreader – now there is a man!  He is quite complex, actually.  He seems to be loud and quite sure of himself on the outside, but his inner self seems to be very reserved and contemplative.  I have great faith in him.  He seems to take no action unless he feels it will produce a result of equal worth.  Besides, he holds the key to my daughter’s fate in his hands, and I have no doubt that he will succeed.<br />
<br />
I am sure there is more to write, but my mind and soul are too restless to focus at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The lazy afternoon sun waded slowly across the sky as Heldorm and his companions made their way through the West Commonlands.  A dozing Aelwyl listened contently to Heldorm’s rhythmic breathing, lulling her into slumber.  Suddenly, the wagon jarred to a stop.  <br />
<br />
“What?  Why have we stopped?” Aelwyl lifted herself from the wooden floorboards and dusted off.<br />
<br />
“Dark Elves,” whispered Ecbus, peering cautiously from the wagon. <br />
<br />
“The Teir’Dal?  What would they be doing this far from Neriak?”<br />
<br />
“There’s a couple that have been seen around these parts.  One’s a missionary or something – name’s Kizdean Gix.  He’s pretty innocuous most of the time, never really heard of him causing any problems (still wise not to cross him, though). <br />
<br />
“The other is not so innocuous.  Zytl is his name, a dragoon warrior hell-bent on some tirade against the peoples of the Commonlands.  He seems to lie low during the day (most of the time), but he is one whom we want to avoid at any cost.  Besides, I would . . . much prefer to pass through Kithicor Forest before nightfall.”<br />
<br />
“Kithicor,” Aelwyl pulled her shawl a little tighter around herself.  “It has been many seasons since last I set foot in that accursed forest.  The undead rise from their resting places at night and prey upon the living.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, and there are far worse things that dwell in those woods.”<br />
<br />
“Worse?”<br />
<br />
“That’s right,” Ecbus leaned in close to Aelwyl and lowered his voice to a near mumble, “Rangers.”<br />
<br />
“Looks cleer ta meez, boss,” said Blorg scratching his hind-quarters.  <br />
<br />
“Very well, then we must be off again.  Blorg, I want to clear Kithicor before nightfall.”<br />
<br />
“Youz got it!”  Blorg lifted up the large handles of the wagon as if they were fallen twigs and set the decaying vehicle in motion once more.  No sooner had Aelwyl begun to drift off again when the distant yet very clear sound of metal upon metal snapped her awake.  From behind a cottage near the lake the wagon was passing, came flashes of blue-white light, followed promptly by the clashing.  <br />
<br />
“Now what is going on?” Aelwyl watched as two Barbarians walked briskly from the cottage, weapons readied.  <br />
<br />
“Nothing, nothing at all,” Ecbus motioned spastically to Blorg.  “We’re just moving through, not seeing or hearing anything.”<br />
<br />
“Ecbus!  Stop please!  Someone may be in trouble!”<br />
<br />
Ecbus sighed and motioned for Blorg to stop.  “Alright, alright.  But at the first sign of trouble I’m pushing off again – with or without you.”<br />
<br />
“Eh?” Heldorm stirred back to consciousness.  “Now what’s goin’ on ere?  What’s with all this shoutin’?”<br />
<br />
“Heldorm, don’t you hear the sounds of battle?” Aelwyl floated down from the wagon before it had even stopped.  “Someone is in peril!”  By now, Ioemir and Ymeal had also awakened and were locating their weapons. As Aelwyl began to glide toward the hut, a loud, single clash of light and metal sent an armor-clad figure flying out into plain view, with a loud clank to the ground.<br />
<br />
“I’m telling you,” said Ecbus, shaking his head and looking away, “just leave it alone.”<br />
<br />
As the figure struggled to stand to one knee, a Dark Elf, also clad in shining armor, stepped out from behind the hut.  Some nameless, primal surge of emotion stirred within Aelwyl and Ioemir; the ancient hatred welled up and poured through their veins like boiling oil.  The Dark Elf stopped as he approached the fallen knight and turned toward the two Feir’Dal as if compelled by the same untamable instinct.  Ioemir lowered his sword perpendicular to his body, while to his side, Aelwyl’s skin glowed red with streaks of fire that began to coalesce on her fingertips.  The Dark Elf raised his black, two-handed sword and clenched the handle tightly.  Unable to restrain himself any longer, Ioemir darted forward and swung hard at the Teir’Dal, whom parried the blow with a swift upstroke.  Before either elf had a chance to attack again, a crackling bolt of fire knocked the Dark Elf to the ground.  <br />
<br />
“Aelwyl!  Ioemir!  What in the name of the Tribunal are ye two doin’!”  Heldorm and Ymeal rushed up behind their companions.  Upon seeing the smoldering form of a Dark Elf rising from the ground, the Barbarian reached for something inside of a travel bag slung around his waist.  By now, the Dark Elf had risen to his feet and became acutely aware that he was considerably outnumbered, as the once-fallen knight had joined the fray again unnoticed.  With a chilling smirk, the Dark Elf suddenly vanished from view, leaving a trail of shimmering vapors that lead toward the far side of the lake before evaporating completely.  Heldorm stopped what he was doing and withdrew an empty hand.<br />
<br />
“What . . . who was that!” Ioemir turned to the knight.<br />
<br />
“Zytl,” said the knight, promptly pulling away a chain mail helm to reveal –<br />
<br />
“A woman!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, so?  Never seen a woman before?”<br />
<br />
“Forgive me, M’Lady,” Ioemir bowed, “I never knew Human-folk to knight women.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, well, this is one women who has been knighted.  One who had to work damned hard to do so.  Now are you are just going to stand there and gawk or are you going to tell me who you are?”<br />
<br />
“Of – of course.  Ioemir Enothie of Kelethin.  And these are my companions – Aelwyl Azuremoon, Heldorm Snowreader, and Ymeal Whitesoul.”<br />
<br />
“And meez in wuv!”  Blorg trotted up with Ecbus on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Oh my, so that’s what I smelled,” the knight said flushing out a strand of black, matted hair.  She then turned the gash in her arm toward her, wincing in pain.<br />
<br />
“That looks to be a dangerous wound, Madam knight,” Ymeal took a step toward her.  “Please, allow me to –“<br />
<br />
“No, no, don’t strain yourself.”  The knight’s hand began to glow a faint bluish-white.  She passed her hand slowly over the wound, which in moments closed and faded back into the natural color of Human skin.<br />
<br />
“Beggin’ yer pardon, there, but now that we’ve introduced ourselves, ye mind sharin’ with us who ye are?”<br />
<br />
The knight paused for a moment to regard Heldorm before introducing herself, “Lemira, Lemira of Notting Downs.”<br />
<br />
“Notting Downs,” replied Ymeal, “you are quite far from home.”<br />
<br />
“It is not my home anymore,” Lemira bundled up her hair and replaced her helm.  “Freeport is my home now.  I only choose to retain that title because my knighthood requires that I do so.<br />
<br />
“Back to matters at hand, however, you did help me ward off Zytl, so I suppose I am indebted to you.  I must be on my way back to the Hall of Truth for now, but should you find yourselves in this area again, feel free to seek my aid should you require it.  And with that, I must take my leave . . . safe journeys.”<br />
<br />
Lemira bowed quickly, turned, and began to walk back across the Commonlands toward Freeport.  The six companions filed back into the wagon, the warm glow of adrenaline still burning quietly in their bodies.  The hill-flanked pass into Kithicor Forest yawned just a short distance away; dark-green tops of ageless trees peeked up from the hilltops.<br />
<br />
“Okay, chop chop, Blorg, we’re racing against the sun here.  I for one don’t want to be stuck in Kithicor when night comes.”     <br />
<br />
<br />

The day progressed much as any other day in the village of Nithmiel – uneventful and slow.  Originally constructed as an outpost shortly after Kelethin’s founding, Nithmiel still housed several of the old Feir’Dal bloodlines – the Minaeons, the Sunfires, the Evergreens, among others.  While its stature had somewhat diminished from the days when Kelethin remained largely unprotected, this ancient village was able to retain much of its importance.  It stood only a day’s travel from the capital of the Wood Elves, thus any urgent news that needed to make its way to Kelethin came directly from here.  In a manner of speaking, Nithmiel was Kelethin’s lifeline.<br />
<br />
Sentry Emian Minaeon carefully watched three figures appear from the bend in the road leading to Nithmiel.  At a distance, the central figure appeared to be about the same height as a Wood Elf, but his two companions appeared taller, and much thinner.  Emian’s gaze remained locked on the travelers up until they were only a few paces away.  An overwhelming, sinister feeling suddenly washed over the Wood Elf sentry, as if there was much more to these three than met the eye – something that required extreme caution.  Nevertheless, Emian boldly strode out to greet the three strangers.<br />
<br />
“Greetings, stranger.”  Emian’s voice quivered slightly at the vague, numinous aura that seemed to protrude from the cloaked strangers like an invisible, choking fog.  “The town of Nithmiel lies ahead, what business have you here?”<br />
<br />
“Business?”  A raspy voice answered after a short pause.  “No business.  Just a traveler and his companions on their way to Kelethin.”<br />
<br />
Emian swallowed a lump in his throat.  Something about the man’s voice chilled the Wood Elf’s very blood.  “What is it you seek there?  Nothing illegal, I would hope.  The Kelethin authorities are much less forgiving than I.”<br />
<br />
The stranger laughed in a low, calm tone.  Emian carefully rested his hand on the hilt of his sword.<br />
<br />
“Illegal?  No.”  The stranger pulled back the hood of his cloak to reveal the face of a Dark Elf.  “I just come for a child.”<br />
<br />
“F- Feir’Dal, here . . .” Emian’s voice trailed off and his muscles froze as the mesmerizing shine of bluish-purple eyes ensnared him.  He stood helpless as his hand fell slowly from the hilt of his sword, and as one of the Dark Elf’s hooded companions drew his own sword and struck with a swift, deadly stroke.<br />
<br />
Meklozanth watched coldly as the Feir’Dal’s headless body fell to its knees before slumping over.  He lifted his gaze to the city gates before him.  Beyond, he could see its inhabitants milling about their daily lives, blissfully unaware at what had just occurred.<br />
<br />
“Kill them all,” Meklozanth said plainly, raising his index finger in the air and beckoning to his two companions.  The two undead soldiers swung open the ancient gates, swords drawn.  The aged Dark Elf smiled and replaced his hood before stepping into a horrible slaughter that had just begun.  Screams of torment and the clash of steel echoed throughout the forest for an hour, finally escaping into the sky, where they met their fate.<br />
<br />
**<br />
The Kithicor Woods have stood as long (although some say longer) as the great forest of Greater Faydark.  Countless ages danced through the gargantuan pines, bringing with them a myriad of souls of all races.  But they were also a cursed woods; woods where the remains of all who perished there, rose each night and wandered the vast maze of darkness until the sun’s healing light sent them back into slumber.<br />
<br />
The dark taint of twilight was quickly descending as Heldorm and his companions cleared the small pass leading into Kithicor.  Already, everyone was on alert, weapons close at hand.<br />
	<br />
“Pick up the pace, Blorg,” said Ecbus nervously.  “I don’t need to tell you what happens when night comes.”<br />
	<br />
“Okees,” Blorg huffed out as he lenghtened his stride.  The wagon began to shudder slightly as its speed increased.<br />
	<br />
“We’ll stick to the old cart path that hugs the valley wall.  The undead hardly wander that far.”<br />
	<br />
“They say the ranger of legend, Kithicor himself, still lives in these woods,” Ioemir said watching the trees vigilantly.  <br />
	<br />
“Couldn’t imagine anyone wantin’ to live out ‘ere,” Heldorm pushed on a crate that was inching its way out of place.  “What with all these undead an’ all.”<br />
	<br />
“I’ve heard Kithicor seeks to slay all of the undead in revenge for his fallen friends.  Legend has it, he helps out those passing through on occasion.”<br />
	<br />
“Heh, well let us be hopin’ that we are one o’ them folks, then, eh?”<br />
	<br />
	<br />
The rickety wagon continued to wind its way through the woods as a thin veil of stars gently draped a darkened sky.  Already, the day creatures had found refuge in caves and fallen logs.  It was only a matter of time now before the true horror of Kithicor awoke.<br />
	<br />
“This is no good,” said a jittery Ecbus.  “We’re not going to make it at this rate.  We’ll have to –“ But his words were cut short as a moss-covered skeleton clad in rusted fragments of armor suddenly leapt onto the side of the wagon and let out a loud, hollow hiss. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">“Too late!  They’ve awakened!  Fly Blorg fly!”<br />
	<br />
Blorg let out a roar and pulled the cart as fast as he could, the entire wooden frame shuddering and clanking violently.  The undead warrior tried to push itself into the cart but was intercepted by Ymeal’s hammer, charged with holy magic.  The skeleton shattered into countless bone fragments with a warm blast of white energy.<br />
	<br />
“Here comes more!”  Ioemir clutched the hilt of his sword as two more skeletons run up to the rear of the cart.  The Wood Elf warrior smashed one of the undead with the bottom of his hilt, sending a cracked skull rolling down the hill behind them; it’s headless body kept pace for a few moments before falling in a misshapen pile.  The remaining skeleton began to board the wagon.  Ioemir delivered another smash, but the skeleton was able to hold on.  <br />
	<br />
“Need help here!  One’s trying to get on the wagon!”<br />
	<br />
Ymeal had reached Ioemir’s side and was just about to swing his mallet when the unmistakable whistling of an arrow pierced the air.  The arrow found its mark squarely on the forehead of the skeleton, knocking it off balance and tumbling head over heels behind them, random bones flying off as it rolled.<br />
	<br />
“What the hell?  Where did that arrow come from?”<br />
	<br />
Just then, Heldorm saw movement out of the corner of his eye.  He turned in time to see the silhouette of someone running in the trees on the valley wall beside them.  <br />
	<br />
“I don’t think we’re alone ‘ere.”<br />
	<br />
“Of course we aren’t!”  Ecbus shouted pointing ahead.  “Blorg watch out!”<br />
	<br />
Two zombies had stepped out on the path before the wagon.  Unfortunately for the undead, they chose to obstruct possibly the only wagon in Norrath being pulled at great velocity by a thousand pound Ogre.  Heldorm and his companions watched with great amusement as the gaunt, decaying bodies of two zombies sailed through the air like thrown children’s dolls.<br />
	<br />
Without warning, bone-chilling howls stung the ears of the fleeing adventurers.  Out of the gloom sprinted two black-furred wolves, exposed maggot-filled lesions covering their bodies.<br />
	<br />
“Dreaded wolves!”  Ymeal charged his mallet again.<br />
	<br />
“Allow me,” Aelwyl stepped up to the back of the wagon.  “I have an affinity with animals.”  She waited until each wolf was within a few feet of the wagon then shot a fire blast from each hand, striking the two wolves, whose bodies set aflame.  A horrible yelping echoed from the trees as the burning hounds ran off and disappeared into the night.  “See?  You just have to know how to communicate with them.”<br />
	<br />
“I see light!”  Ecbus strained his eyes and peered into the thinning fog ahead.  “We’re coming up on Rivervale, thank Brell!”  A collective sigh of relief was breathed from the occupants of the wagon as Blorg slowed his pace.  There was a sudden clattering of bone that caused Ecbus to whip around to his right, but it was for naught.  There, still clutching a support beam, was the severed hand of the first skeletal warrior.  Ecbus pried the hand off with a disgusted look and tossed it into the thick of the forest.<br />
	<br />
“Ah, Rivervale.”  Ymeal slid onto the floor of the wagon and exhaled deeply.  “Never have I been so glad to see her.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Blorg set the front end of the wagon down with a soft thud after the last passenger got off.  After several minutes, Ecbus emerged from the inn and approached Heldorm.<br />
<br />
“Ok, I’ve got us some rooms, ‘cept for Blorg, of course.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, you mean poor Blorg has to sleep outside?!”  Aelwyl stood aghast.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, so?  There’s no way he can fit inside the inn, even in one of the larger rooms.  Hell, Heldorm’s gonna have a hard enough time as it is.  Besides, I need someone to watch my things, that stuff in there is way too valuable to leave unattended.<br />
<br />
“But hey, I’m too tired to argue about it, let’s just get some rest, I got a big day of selling tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
<br />
From the journal of Blorg:<br />
“Wut a day!  Meez make all kinds of new frends!  Dere’s dis tall guy, almost as tall as meez!  Hiz name’s Heldorm.  Heez okay 4 a Barbie.  Let’s see, den dere’s Eyeamir (Meez tink dat’s how yooz spell it) and a pretty lady named Alewill – deyz both Woodies, pretty nice tho.  Oh yeah, oh yeah, den dere’s Eemeel.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ymeal sank into the tavern chair with a long exhale, the past day’s events still swimming through his head like a writhing eel of broken images.  A female Halfling cautiously scooted up to the High Elf.<br />
<br />
“Okay, mister, whatya have tonight?”<br />
<br />
“Misty Honey Ale will be fine, please.”<br />
<br />
The Halfling looked somewhat stunned.  “Hey, you’ve been here before.  That’s our owner’s special brew!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’ve been here several times,” Ymeal looked up and around the tavern for a few moments, breathing in the memories.  “But I’ve gone far too long, far too long.”<br />
<br />
The Halfling scooted away, leaving Ymeal to stare at the table, gently running his hand across the worm-tracked wood.  He felt a brief rush of air blow against his back as the tavern door swung open.<br />
<br />
“Ymeal?” A soft, feminine voice asked.  “Is that really you?”<br />
<br />
In reality, he had expected this reunion.  After all, she’d been living here for the past decade, assisting the Halflings with The Sickness – a mysterious illness that seemed to be slowly creeping through Rivervale for the past ten years.  Even the wisest seers had no answers as to the cause or cure of this plague.  The Halflings thought that perhaps outside intervention would help.  So far, very little progress has been made.<br />
	<br />
“Hello, sister,” Ymeal finally responded in a cold, monotone.  <br />
	<br />
“At least you recognize me as blood again.  Can you not find it within yourself to call me by name?”<br />
	<br />
Ymeal said nothing.<br />
	<br />
“I see,” his sister replied disappointedly.  “May at least sit down.”<br />
	<br />
“If you must.”<br />
	<br />
The High Elf maiden took a seat next to her brother and unclipped the golden clasp binding her light blond hair; it flowed down around her shoulders like a multitude of thin, silken lute strings.  A moment later, the Halfling waitress scooted back up to Ymeal and reached his mug to him, clutching the gold piece the High Elf dropped in her hand in exchange.<br />
	<br />
“Still have a weakness for Honey Ale I see.  Come now, Ymeal, is it really proper for a priest of Tunare to be imbibing?”<br />
	<br />
Ymeal sighed and turned to his siter, “How did you know I was here?”<br />
	<br />
“Heh, right to the point as always.  I overheard some of the townsfolk talking about the arrival of a Gnome inventor and his rather . . . eclectic assortment of companions.  I went to the inn and heard the Gnome mention your name, and now we are.”<br />
	<br />
“Indeed,” Ymeal huffed out and took a long drink of his ale, “here we are.”<br />
	<br />
“Listen,” his sister put her hand lightly on his shoulder.  “I know when we last spoke, it was not under the best of circumstances.  But please do not shut me out of your life, Ymeal.  We are the only family one another have left.  If we part ways for good, then we will truly be alone.  Alone, Ymeal!  Can you really accept that, brother?  Because I cannot.  I will not spend the next ten millennia or more living each day knowing that I have a brother who will no more speak to me than a beggar on the streets.”  Her eyes began to water.<br />
	<br />
Ymeal looked away quickly and just stared at his ale mug; he slowly ran an index finger around its lip.<br />
	<br />
“Very well,” his sister puller her hair back into the clip as a warm tear ran down her cheek.  “I shall leave you be, then.  May you live a long, fruitful life, Ymeal Whitesoul.”  She took one last look at her brother and walked toward the door.<br />
	<br />
“Valyrice,” Ymeal called out at the last moment.  His sister stopped and turned back with a shocked expression.<br />
	<br />
“You . . . you said my name . . .” Valyrice began to sob with joy.  She ran to her brother and embraced him tightly.<br />
	<br />
“I already have one life slipping away,” Ymeal said quietly.  “I don’t want to see another do the same, especially when there is something I can do about it.”<br />
	<br />
Valyrice pulled back and looked at Ymeal inquisitively between the tears.<br />
	<br />
“It’s a long story.  Please, sit with me again, I shall tell you.”<br />
<br />
	<br />
Outside the Bixie Inn, Heldorm watched the stars as if waiting for something.  He heard Aelwyl approach from his side and stop right beside him.<br />
	<br />
“What are we looking at?” The Hierophant asked staring skyward.<br />
	<br />
“I dunno what yer lookin’ at.  I’m just studyin’ the heavens.  Don’t get much time to see ‘em back home.  Where are the others?”<br />
	<br />
“Ymeal’s in the tavern; Blorg’s outside sleeping under the cart; Ecbus and Ioemir are sleeping in the inn.”<br />
	<br />
“Hmmm,” Heldorm looked down and glanced quickly the direction of the bank, a couple hundered yards away.  “We’re bein’ followed, just so ya know.”<br />
	<br />
“Followed?” Aelwyl asked skeptically.<br />
	<br />
“Aye.  I noticed whoever it is back in Kithicor.  I didn’t get a good look at ‘em since whoever it was was runnin’ in the woods on the valley wall.  But I saw a shadow.  And that person standin’ o’er by the bank has a shadow just like the one I saw.  Don’t look, though, whoever it is’ll start getting’ a wee bit curious.”<br />
	<br />
“Who on Norrath would be following us?  That Teir’Dal we ran across in the Commonlands?”<br />
	<br />
“Doubtful.”  Heldorm looked back into the sky.  “I have a feelin’ our stalker was also the one who hit that skelley with an arrow.  That Zytl fella would’t want to help us, I reckon.”  Heldorm stood silently watching the night sky for a few moments before sighing and turning back to the inn.  “Anyways, it’s getting’ late.  The sooner we get up the sooner we start off for Halas again.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm took his leave, but Aelwyl remained long enough to take another quick glance at the shadow leaning against one of the bank’s outside walls.  <br />
<br />
<br />
From the journal of Heldorm:<br />
“I’ve come to the conclusion that I just need to never leave Halas again.  These past days have been the most trying in recent memory.  First, we run into a crazy Dark Elf who enjoys picking on the lady folk.  Then we have to ride on a decaying wagon, being pulled by a deranged Ogre, all while batting away undead warriors!  But anyway, here we are now in Rivervale, which seems peaceful enough.  Oh, and I was right!  Halflings are just like Gnomes!  Well, maybe not just like Gnomes, but they’re both short, and that’s alike enough for me.<br />
<br />
What else?  Oh yeah, I told Aelwyl about out stalker.  I noticed this person (I think) running along side us in the woods in Kithicor.  Who this person is, however, remains a mystery.  An assassin perhaps?  Eh, doubtful.  A ranger maybe, Kithicor’s supposed to be some gathering place for them, or something.  I’ve never seen a ranger before, but I hear they’re supposed to be solitary, wandering folks.  Seems odd that such a person would be following us then, let alone helping us.  But hey, not much surprises me anymore.  I’ve had enough adventure in the past two days then I ever care to have.  No, no that’s not true.  The child.  Ioemir’s daughter is what drives me on.  Adventure is not the issue here . . . saving an innocent little girl is.”<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heldorm forced open his heavy eyelids, groaned, and stretched.  He groggily lifted himself out of bed and dressed.  He was just about to leave when he remembered his diary on the nightstand aside the bed.  He quickly turned and grabbed it but stopped dead upon seeing a small note resting near where the diary had set.  The Barbarian’s eyes darted around the room, but saw no one.  Cautiously, Heldorm took the note and folded it open; it read simply:  “Rivervale bank midday.”<br />
<br />
Outside the inn, Aelwyl was inspecting the cornucopia of Gnomish contraptions artfully displayed on Ecbus’s wagon, which, unbeknownst to the Wood Elf, also converted into a display stall.<br />
<br />
“I feel good about today,” Ebcus said rubbing his hands together.  “Something in the air just tells me that I’m gonna hit paydirt.”<br />
<br />
“You do, do you?” Aelwyl eyed the Gnome.  “You have a sense for these things?”<br />
<br />
“But of course I do!  You see, all Gnomes are born with an extra sense of sorts – we just kinda know when inspiration and opportunity are going to knock.  All we have to do is invite them in, hehe.  Anyway, time to open up shop.<br />
<br />
“Yes, folks, step right up!  Fresh from Ak’anon, the Tinker Capital of Norrath, come see the latest and greatest Gnomish inventions!  Get ‘em before they’re gone, folks, because they will go fast!”  Already a few curious Halflings approached the wagon and began to peruse the Gnomish curiosities.  One onlooker appeared especially taken with Ecbus’s wares, as his eyes grew wide and excitedly scuttled off into town.  Mere moments later, a literal horde of Halflings swarmed the wagon.  Magic journals, sun-driven watches, hair-trimming scissors, all flew off the racks as if they had suddenly sprouted wings; Ecbus even had to enlist Aelwyl’s help to keep up with the demand.  When the swarm finally subsided, Ecbus and Aelwyl stood exhausted, trying to catch their breath.<br />
<br />
“That . . . that was . . .”  But the Wood Elf could not finish her sentence.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, what in the name of Brell happened there?!”<br />
<br />
“Never . . . seen anything . . . sell that fast.”  Aelwyl finally caught her breath.  “What do you have left, Ecbus?”<br />
<br />
“Let’s see.”  Ecbus retracted the now empty wooden racks to reveal a much more open storage space.  “Looks like a few journals, a couple crates of hair-trimming thingies, and some of my private stash.  But not just anyone can buy that stuff.  I only break that out in case of emergencies.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?”  The Hierophant’s curiosity was piqued.  “And what do you have in there?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, some how shall I say select items.  Inventions I am most proud of.  Very valuable!  But like I said, I only break those out on special occasions.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The sun reached its reigning seat in the heavens.  Heldorm read the note left for him one last time before balling it up and dropping it in a belt pouch.  He walked toward the bank, all the time glancing around cautiously.  Finally, he reached the small, granite steps to the bank door – but no one was in sight.<br />
<br />
“Well,” the Barbarian said to himself, “it’s midday, I’m at the bank, and neither Halfling nor Human to be seen.  Beginnin’ to think this was all a put on.”<br />
<br />
“No,” a voice suddenly said from behind him, “it was not.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm spun around to behold a shorter than average Human man with strangely Elvish characteristics.  He wore earthen-hued chain armor with a bow and quiver slung over his back; around his waist, hung two sword sheathes, light brown and gold hilts protruding from each.  Other than these few items, the stranger seemed to carry nothing else on his person.<br />
<br />
“So I take it ye are the one who’s been followin’ us from Kithicor?”<br />
<br />
“That’s right.  I’m glad you came.”<br />
<br />
“Not much choice, lad.  Very clever, sneakin’ into my room and leavin’ that note.  Ye did at least have the courtesy not to take anything?”<br />
<br />
“I’m no thief,” the stranger said plainly and adamantly.  “I just wanted to meet with you.”<br />
<br />
“Well here I am, lad.  But first, would ye at least be tellin’ me yer name?”<br />
<br />
“Talis,” the Half Elf replied after a moment.<br />
<br />
“Well, Talis, why have ye been followin’ us?  Are we in some sorta trouble?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Talis seemed to crack a faint smirk.  “I simply came to see for myself.  To see if it was true.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm furrowed his brow in confusion.  “See what fer yerself?  What’s true?”<br />
<br />
The ranger smirked, glanced Heldorm over, and walked slowly in the direction of town.  “Walk with me a moment.”  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ioemir found Aelwyl and Ecbus just as they had finished reassembling the wagon.  Ecbus hopped into the storage area and braced the few remaining crates with rope.<br />
<br />
“Ready to move on, I see?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Rivervale was a gold mine!” The Gnome said excitedly, hopping down from the wagon.  “Must come back here more often.  But alas, a traveling salesman’s work is never done.  Time to shove out.  Ready, Blorg?”<br />
<br />
“Meez ready for more pullin’, boss.”<br />
<br />
“Wait a moment!” Aelwyl interjected.  “What about us?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?  What about you?” Ecbus shrugged.<br />
<br />
“We are in need of passage to Halas.  You said we could find passage with you.”<br />
<br />
“Well, actually, when I agreed to that I never said I’d go as far as Halas.  I believe I stated quite clearly that I was going as far as Rivervale and I’d secure you passage to the northern lands – Rivervale is north of Freeport, so there ya go.”<br />
<br />
“Now wait just a moment . . .” Aelwyl trailed off as she saw Heldorm approach with an expression of concern upon his face.  Accompanying the shaman was a much shorter man dressed in chain mail.  “Here comes Heldorm now.  Heldorm, explain to Ecbus that – are you alright?  You look almost pale.  And who is this with you?”<br />
<br />
“I’m fine, and this here is Talis.  He’s the one that’s been folloin’ us since Kithicor.”<br />
<br />
Talis bowed slightly, facial expression unchanged.<br />
<br />
“You are a ranger, are you not?” Aelwyl studied Talis.  “And a Half Elf at that.  I’ve not seen many of your kind.”<br />
<br />
“That’s right.  I’ve lived and hunted in Kithicor for a century.  Humans and Elves generally don’t take too kindly to half-breeds such as myself.  So we tend to live on our own.”<br />
<br />
“Very well, then, I am –“<br />
<br />
“Aelwyl Azuremoon, Hierophant of Kelethin, yes I know of you.  And beside you is Ioemir Enothie, defender of Kelethin.”<br />
<br />
The two Wood Elves glanced at each other, somewhat frightened.<br />
<br />
“You cut us to the quick, Talis” Ioemir took a step forward.  “You seem to know much about us and we know almost nothing of you.  Tell me, where did you come across this information?”<br />
<br />
“I have my sources, which shall remain mine alone.”<br />
<br />
A short distance away, Ecbus mumbled something unintelligible.  Only the word “ranger” caught Aelwyl’s ears.<br />
<br />
“Ah yes, Heldorm, please explain to Ecbus that we still require passage to Halas.”<br />
<br />
“Tryin’ to skip out on us, eh?  Ye told me that we’d be goin’ as far as the northern lands.”<br />
	<br />
Ecbus sighed, “Must I explain this again?  I already told Aelwyl that I was going to Rivervale.  Rivervale is north of Freeport, so I have kept my promise.”<br />
	<br />
“Now look ‘ere, Gnome.  Ye know bloody well what I mean by the northern lands.  If ye head off without us, how are we supposed to be getting’ there ourselves?”<br />
	<br />
“Eh, I dunno.  Not really my problem now.  There are caravans that pass through here every week or so, one should be due here any day now.  Sorry, I wish I could help you out, but I really do have to get back to Ak’anon.  Come on, Blorg, we need to start off now so we can get through Kithicor early.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm grew hot with anger, but at that moment it came to him.  “Ya know, Halas hasn’t seen many Gnome inventors pass through.  Hasn’t seen any, come to think of it.”<br />
	<br />
“Oh?” Ecbus raised an eyebrow at Heldorm.<br />
	<br />
“Nope, and I’m sure some of my people would love to get their hands on some fine Gnomish goods.  I mean, if I took to yer journals, just think what an untapped market would want.”<br />
	<br />
“Like I said,” said Ecbus, excitedly leaping down from the wagon.  “Cold weather and I go hand in hand.  Hop on, folks, it’s Halas or bust!  Errr, except for the ranger there, that is.  He’ll have to find his own ride.”<br />
	<br />
“Ecbus,” Aelwyl gasped.  “How rude!”<br />
	<br />
“Sorry.  Don’t trust rangers, never have.  They’re like those sneaky little rogues, I can never see em.  No sir, don’t trust what I can’t see.”<br />
	<br />
“It’s alright,” Talis said, followed by a sharp whistle.  “I’ve brought my own transportation.”  From around the corner, trotted a charcoal colored horse with a long, gray mane, a simple leather bridle dangling from its mouth.<br />
	<br />
“A fine steed you have, Talis,” Ioemir admired the horse, patting and stroking its side.  “Does he have a name?”<br />
	<br />
“Gypsywynd.”  Talis lifted himself into the saddle.  “I’ve raised him from a yearling.”<br />
	<br />
“Ye keep a horse in Kithicor?  How ye manage that?”<br />
	<br />
“I have my ways.  There are some places that even the undead dare not go.  Besides, Gypsywynd is more than capable of taking care of himself.”<br />
	<br />
“If you do not mind my abruptness, “Aelwyl inquired, “why do you wish to accompany us?”<br />
	<br />
Talis started to say something in response, but turned to Heldorm instead. <br />
	<br />
“Errm, I’ve spoken with him,” the Barbarian began nervously.  “And he said he was only followin’ us because he’d never seen anyone survive an attack from the undead before.  He was so impressed he just wanted a closer look, ye know.  And I think he can help us make the journey a lil’ safer.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl looked suspicious but finally conceded.  A moment later, Ymeal approached his companions with his sister beside him.<br />
	<br />
“There ye are, Ymeal!  Was about to send out for ye.  Oh, and who might this be?”  Heldorm stepped up to the female High Elf with great interest.<br />
	<br />
“This is my sister, Valyrice.”<br />
	<br />
“A pleasure, lass,” Heldorm bowed to Valyrice and kissed the top of her hand.<br />
	<br />
“Oh, the pleasure is mine,” Ymeal’s sister smiled sweetly, eyes growing wider.  “Tell me Ymeal, who is your tall, handsome friend.”<br />
	<br />
“This is Heldorm Snowreader.  He is the shaman I told you about.”  Ymeal introduced the others, but stopped when he came to Talis.  “I do not believe we have met.  I am Ymeal Whitesoul, High Priest of Felwithe.”<br />
	<br />
“Talis,” the ranger nodded.  “I’ll be accompanying you for now.”<br />
	<br />
“Well then, well met.  There is more safety in numbers.  You appear to be a woodsman of sorts, your skills would be most valuable to my friends.” <br />
	<br />
“Ioemir,” Valyrice said taking his hands in hers, “my brother has informed me of your plight, and I wish for you to know that my greatest sympathies and best wishes are with you.”<br />
	<br />
“Thank you, M’Lady, your words reassure me.  I am confident that Heldorm will prevail.  You are most welcome to come with us, the services of another cleric would be invaluable.”<br />
	<br />
“Well . . .” Valyrice glanced over at her brother.<br />
	<br />
“I shall tell them, sister.  My friends, I have come to a decision.  As much as it pains me to do so, I feel my time on this journey must come to an end.”<br />
	<br />
The others looked dumbfounded, especially Ioemir.  “But, but why, Ymeal?”<br />
	<br />
“Family matters.”  Ymeal turned and smiled at his sister.  “I never told you before, but Valyrice is the only family I have.  We have not spoken in ages until now, and I have much mending to do.”<br />
	<br />
“Where will you go?  Back to Felwithe?”<br />
	<br />
“For now, yes.  Ioemir . . .” The High Elf put his hand on the Wood Elf warrior’s shoulder and grasped it firmly.  “You have and always will be my greatest friend, but this is something I feel I must do.  Words cannot express how difficult it was to arrive at this decision.  Please forgive me if it seems like I am abandoning you and your daughter, for I do not wish it to be so.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir smiled and placed his hand on Ymeal’s arm.  “Not at all, my friend.  Your path lies elsewhere.  Family is the most important thing.  Heh, my quest and I are clear evidence of that.  Return to your home, Ymeal.  To know that you are happy will lessen the burden on my heart.”<br />
	<br />
“Thank you for your understanding, my friend.”  Ymeal said his goodbyes to each of his companions, pausing when he stood before Heldorm.  “Heldorm, words fail me yet again when I try to express my thanks to you for what you are doing for Ioemir.  So instead of wasting the day searching for the right words I will simply say thank you from the deepest recesses of my being.”<br />
	<br />
“Eh, don’t mention it, lad.  All in a day’s work for us shamans.”<br />
	<br />
Ymeal laughed.  “At least you still have your modesty.”<br />
	<br />
“Fare the well, everyone,” Valyrice smiled and raised her hand.  “Especially to you, Heldorm.”  She shot the Barbarian another warm smile; Heldorm’s face grew red, forcing him to just return the smile and look away.  Aelwyl cleared her throat loudly.<br />
	<br />
“May Tunare be with you all!” Ymeal turned and shouted as he and Valyrice started for the inn.  “And when next we meet, I expect to see your daughter by your side, Ioemir!”<br />
	<br />
“You will, Ymeal!”  Ioemir watched sadly as his friend disappear around the corner of a building.  “You will.”   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The hours of the day marched along side Heldorm and his companions as they pushed slowly onward through the stone halls of Highpass Hold, past the ancient wizard spires of Northern Karana and over the grassy expanse of Western Karana.  The early evening air already held a slight chill as the travelers entered the hills of Qeynos and turned off the path toward Blackburrow.  Shortly thereafter, the grotesque head of a man wolf carved in stone yawned before them.<br />
	<br />
“Blackburrow,” Talis eyed the stone canopy with contempt.  “Den of the Gnolls, the man wolves.”<br />
	<br />
“Rumor has it the Gnolls been kinda restless as of late.”  Heldorm craned his neck to see inside the twisted tunnel leading into the Gnoll den.  “Somethin’ about them wantin’ their old lands back.  Been attackin’ just about anyone who gets the least bit outta line.”<br />
	<br />
“They’re no rumors; the Gnolls are practically on the verge of a crusade.  We won’t be too welcome there, so we best watch our step.”<br />
	<br />
“Well, it’s our only path,” said Ecbus shrugging his shoulders, “so we really have no choice.  Bring us on in, Blorg . . . slowly.”<br />
	<br />
The wagon crept quietly through the dimly lit tunnel, Talis riding close behind.  The angry eyes of Gnoll sentries watched the unwelcome guests’ every move, low guttural growls and snarls echoing off the damp, stone walls.  Ioemir kept his sword close at hand should their situation suddenly take a turn for the worst.  Amazingly, the travelers met no opposition as they squeezed through the narrow causeway leading to Everfrost.  Just as they were about to leave Blackburrow, however, a small group of Gnolls motioned the wagon to stop.<br />
	<br />
“Uh oh,” Ecbus said nervously, “be ready, all.”<br />
	<br />
“*Bark* That’s far enough!  No hairless ones pass through Blackburrow without paying our toll!”<br />
	<br />
“Toll?” Ecbus scoffed.  “Under whose authority?”<br />
	<br />
“Ecbus . . .” Aelwyl whispered.<br />
<br />
“*Growl* Under mine, little hairless one.  Now I suggest you hold your tongue before you lose it.”<br />
<br />
“Hey now clam down there, lil doggies.  We’re not lookin’ for any trouble here.”<br />
<br />
“Blech!  A Northman!  We charge you double for that!”<br />
<br />
“Double?!  How much ye askin’ of us?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” the head Gnoll scratched behind his ear and looked at his companions.  “Five hundred platinum.”<br />
<br />
“Five hundred plat?!” Ecbus almost toppled over.  “That’s ridiculous!  We don’t have that much!”<br />
<br />
“*Growl* Well that’s too bad, isn’t it?  We’ll just have to take something else in lieu.  Like . . . your Wood Elf female.”  The pack of Gnolls snickered and licked their chops.<br />
<br />
Aelwyl turned pale with horror and clenched her shawl.<br />
<br />
“The Wood Elf’s off non-negotiable there, fur face.”<br />
<br />
“*Bark* Fur face?!  How dare you speak to us like that?”  By this time, another small pack of Gnolls was slowly approaching the wagon from behind.<br />
<br />
“Heldorm,” Ioemir warned.  “Don’t encourage them.  We really don’t need a fight on our hands.”<br />
<br />
“Now listen up there, lads, I think we can come to some sorta mutual understandin’ here.  Ya see these crates all piled up ‘ere?”<br />
<br />
“Heldorm, don’t you dare!” Ecbus protested.<br />
<br />
“*Yap* Silence, Gnome!  Let the Northman speak!”<br />
<br />
“As I was sayin’, these here crates are full of goodies.  Why not take one in exchange for safe passage.”<br />
<br />
The Gnoll growled quietly, squinting his eyes at Heldorm to a razor-thinness.  He motioned at the approaching Gnoll pack, which cautiously stopped.  “What exactly is in them?”<br />
<br />
Heldorm pulled out a crate he knew was full of hair trimmers and opened it in front of the Gnolls.  Upon seeing the shining scissors, the Gnolls yapped and barked in excitement.  “Now ye can’t tell me yer kind couldn’t be usin’ these.”<br />
<br />
“My fur does get long and hot in the warmer months,” a Gnoll said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” shouted another, “And those would help with the pests that crawl through my hair!”<br />
<br />
The head Gnoll, sensing his comrades’ acceptance, conceded to Heldorm.  “Very well, Northman, you and your friends may pass.  But should we meet again, it is platinum or your lady companion.”<br />
<br />
Ecbus almost burst into tears as he watched one of his crates being lowered from the wagon and into the anxious hands of the mangy Gnolls.<br />
“It’s alright there Ecbus, I’ll find a way ta pay ye back.  Just be glad we got outta here with all out body parts intact.”<br />
<br />
The wagon started up away from Blackburrow and through another dark tunnel.  A waft of cold air stung the travelers’ faces as they emerged from the mouth of the tunnel to behold a field of snow at the foot of a rocky slope.<br />
<br />
“Ahhhh . . . home.”  Heldorm took in a lungful of Everfrost air and slowly exhaled.  “Ain’t the air great?  And lovely weather we’re havin’ for a change.”<br />
<br />
“N – nice we-weather?!” Ecbus shivered, trying to speak.  “It’s freezing!”<br />
<br />
“Eh, only slightly below freezin’ I’d say.  Much warmer than usual.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know how your people do it, my friend.”  Ioemir laughed and wrapped his cloak around him.  “I’m already getting homesick.”<br />
<br />
“I think I’m just getting sick,” said Aelwyl, donning her thick cloak and sneezing.<br />
<br />
“Bah, buncha thin-skins, y’all are.  Just wait till it gets in the dead o’ winter.  Then ye’ll see some real cold.”<br />
<br />
“No offense to you or your people, Heldorm, but I don’t plan on being here that long.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, we should get goin’.  I need to get an audience with the elders as soon as possible.”<br />
<br />
The wagon shuddered and creaked down the slope, crunching through the snow when it hit the frost line.  Ahead of them, shadowed by the twilight, the travelers saw a tall figure holding up a lantern.<br />
<br />
“Arnis McLish!” Heldorm yelled out.  “Ye frostbitten son of a Gnoll!”<br />
<br />
“I know that voice.”  Arnis stepped closer, the lantern light revealing the wagon’s features and those of its occupants.  “Heldorm Snowreader?”<br />
<br />
“In the flesh, my friend.”  Heldorm patted Arnis on the shoulder.  “How ye fairin’ this warm evenin’?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, doin’ alright.  And who might yer friends here be?” Arnis peered across the faces of Heldorm’s companions, stopping and gasping when he saw Blorg.<br />
<br />
“Ah don’t worry ‘bout him, mate,” Heldorm laughed.  “He doesn’t bite.”  The shaman quickly introduced his friends and updates Arnis of their situation.  “So, as ye can see, I really need to be speakin’ with the elders.  And, uh, say . . . ye got any spare bearskins on ye, Arnis?  My friends here ain’t as weathered as we are.”<br />
<br />
Arnis walked out to his post briefly and returned bearing three, large bearskin cloaks.  “I noticed yer Wood Elf lady friend already had a fine cloak.  And sorry, but I don’t have anything big enough to fit yer ogre friend there.”<br />
<br />
“Iz okay,” Blorg said scratching his rear.  “Meez not cold.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Ecbus draped the enormous cloak over himself, covering his entire body and then some.  “His thick head keeps the rest of him warm.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I won’t keep ye any longer, Heldorm.  The path to Halas’s been pretty clear lately.  Gnolls been strangely quiet.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, probably planning somethin’ big.  Will have to address that to he elders, also.  Anyway, good evenin’ to ye, Arnis.  We’ll be off now.”  Heldorm jumped back on the wagon, which Blorg pulled into motion once again toward the welcoming warmth of Halas, city of the Northmen.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
“Lower the lift!” Captain Moonwind shouted to the lift keeper.  Below the Northern lip of Kelethin, a small band of Wood Elves hobbled closer.  By the time they reached the foot of the city, the great wooden lift had reached its base, awaiting them.  Several guards stood cautiously at the ascent, greeting the group of Feir’Dal as they stepped off.<br />
<br />
“By Tunare, what happened?” Captain Moonwind gasped, motioning for a healer.  Before him, five of his kin struggled to stay standing.  Most were covered in blood, oozing from various wounds.  <br />
<br />
“Teir’Dal,” a young man said weakly, coughing in between breaths.  “Killed everyone . . .  but us.  We *cough* escaped.”<br />
<br />
“Escaped?  From where?”<br />
<br />
“Nith . . . Nithmiel.”<br />
<br />
“Nithmiel?  Razed?” The captain reeled slightly as the realization of this sank into his mind.  “What manner of Dark Elf could do such a thing?” <br />
<br />
“Necromancer,” the young Wood Elf was able to gasp out before he fell over unconscious; several guards and the healer rushed to break his fall.<br />
<br />
“Necromancer?” Moonwind pondered in disbelief.  “Impossible!”<br />
<br />
“What do you make of this?” Sentry Fione asked.  “Do you think he’s telling the truth?  About Nithmiel?”<br />
<br />
“I see no reason for him to lie.  And if there is a necromancer out there, then . . .”<br />
<br />
“Then what, sir?”<br />
<br />
“Then we have dire problems.  Sentry Fione, see to it that these refugees’ needs are met, and set our men on the highest alert.  If trouble does come of this, we must be ready!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir!”  Sentry Fione strode off.  Captain Moonwind raised his nose in the evening air and breath in deeply.  “I smell something on the wind,” he said quietly to himself.  “I fear something dire indeed is going to befall this fair city.  Something soon.”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Two dockhands pulled the wagon into the stable area for the night, leaving the six travelers standing at the open entrance of Halas.  Heldorm stepped up to the stone wall before him and ran his hands across the frozen word “HALAS” carved ages ago by the city’s founders.<br />
<br />
“Your city is much smaller than I imagined,” Ioemir said, taking in his surroundings.<br />
<br />
“Aye, tis a tad small, I suppose.  But her heart is big, and her pride and honor are immeasurable.”  The Barbarian paused for a moment before turning from the wall to his companions.  “McAndrew’s Axe ‘n Ale has some rooms.  Y’all should snag em before they’re booked.  It’s just down the west street and to yer left.”<br />
<br />
“Where are you going?” Aelwyl stopped to asked as the others walked toward the tavern.<br />
<br />
“Got someone to see.  Someone I haven’t seen in a long time.”  A faint smile stretched across Heldorm’s lips.  The shaman disappeared around a corner; Aelwyl sensed his destination, and waited a moment before starting off to follow him.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Eh, who in the bloody hell is there at this hour o‘ the night?”  An aged Barbarian rose from his chair by the fire with a grunt.  He slowly turned toward the door and squinted to see a familiar face.<br />
<br />
“Hello, dad.”  Heldorm said softly.<br />
<br />
“Wha?  Son?  Heldorm, my boy, is that ye?”<br />
<br />
“Aye, dad, it is.”<br />
<br />
The old man’s eyes lit up and he wheezed out a laugh.  Limping quickly to his son, the old man grabbed him and hugged tightly.  “It’s great ta see ya, lad!”<br />
<br />
“It’s good to see you too, dad.  Been way too long.”<br />
<br />
“Aye it has.  Sit down, lad and humor an old man a while.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t have too long, dad.  More’s the pity.  Just stopped by to see how ye were doin’.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, well enough to see when yer about to drop yer ‘poor old man’ nonsense on me.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, dad, please don’t be startin’ this again.”<br />
<br />
“Now ye listen to me, lad.  I’m as fit as a polar bear!  An’ no witchdoctor’s gonna feed me his mumbojumbo and tell me otherwise.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, dad, please tell me yer seein’ the shamans fer yer medicine.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm’s father coughed and hacked loudly for a moment before recovering.  “Eh, spit on those fancy herbs o’ theirs.  I still got ten good winters in me, maybe twenty.”<br />
<br />
“Ye won’t if ye don’t get help, dad.  Yer cough sounds somethin’ fierce.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you lecture me, lad!  Don’t ferget who’s the father here.”<br />
<br />
A sudden gust of wind brushed the two Barbarians’ backs.  Heldorm turned to see Aelwyl standing in the doorway.<br />
<br />
“Aelwyl?  What in the name o’ the Tribunal ye doin’ here?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, Aelwyl?!” Heldorm’s father walked slowly toward the Wood Elf and squinted to get a better look.  “Well I’ll be a Gnoll’s hind end, it is ye!  Such a fine lass if ever I seen one!”  The old man held out his quivering hands and took hers.  Aelwyl smiled up at him.<br />
<br />
“It is good to see you again, Borrin.  I knew Heldorm was coming to see you.  He’s always been a procrastinator when it comes to family.”<br />
<br />
“Hey!”  Heldorm objected.<br />
<br />
“Now you shush there, lad!  She’s right, ye know.”<br />
<br />
“I do not wish to keep you two from your reunion.  I simply stopped by briefly to say hello.”<br />
<br />
“Yer welcome here any time, lass.  Anytime.  It does this old man’s heart well ta see such a fresh face.”  Borrin bent down to let Aelwyl kiss him softly on the cheek.  She squeezed his hand before letting it slip away and turning to leave.<br />
<br />
“Aye, now there goes a fine catch, lad.”  Borrin watched Aelwyl’s shadow walk back toward the tavern.  “Are ye two still on shaky terms?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, aye, I suppose.  Just not much there anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t you lie to yer father, son!  Now there’s no reason ye two shouldn’t be settling down together.  Ye used to be head over kilt fer her.”<br />
<br />
“I know, dad, I know.  It’s just . . .” Heldorm trailed off.<br />
<br />
“Now, son, ye listen ta me a moment.  Take it from an old man: bonds like the one’s ye and Aelwyl have are one of a kind.  Some people spend their whole lives waitin’ or searchin’ fer somethin’ similar and never find it.  When somethin’ like that comes along, ye need to reach out and snatch it!  Like when ye accidentally drop yer mother’s jewelry in the fire.  Ye gotta reach in to the flames and snatch before it’s melted away.  If there’s one thing I’ve learned from two hundred winters on this planet, it’s that life’s too short ta whittle away by yerself.  Live each day like there’s no tomorrow; take each breath like it’s your last; and hold on ta yer loved ones fer dear life, cause ye never know when they may be snatched away from ye.  Understand me, lad?”<br />
<br />
Heldorm stood for a moment in contemplative awe.  He’d never heard his father speak with such passion.  He tried to speak a reply, but words would not come to him.<br />
<br />
“Bleh, don’t just stand there drollin’ and starin’ like an orc, get on with what ye were doin’!  This old man needs his rest anyways.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm embraced his father again and started for the door.  Just before he exited his father said, “Remember, lad.  Each moment like it’s yer last.  And write an’ old man once in a while.  My eyes ain’t that bad!”<br />
<br />
“Aye, I will, dad.  Just do somethin’ fer me while yer at it – see the shamans, and take yer medicine.  I want to have a father ta write to.”<br />
<br />
“Eh, just go on, lad!” Borrin coughed out a smile.  “Don’t ye go dyin’ on me or nothin’.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Inside McAndrew’s Axe ‘n Ale, the tired adventurers gorged themselves on mammoth meat and warm berry pie, washed down with something the locals called “Yellow Snow.”  Ioemir took one sip of the concoction and almost suffocated.  Suddenly, from behind him, a Barbarian’s voice slurred out, “Never *hic* seen someone drink *hic* that much.”<br />
<br />
“Ioemir, you’ve got to see this,” Talis said excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Blorg drinking the locals under the table, eh?”<br />
<br />
“Blorg?  Who said anything about Blorg?”<br />
<br />
Ioemir and Talis squeezed their way to the corner of the tavern where a large crowd had gathered.  A rather intoxicated Barbarian staggered up from his seat with a look of defeat on his face; some of his friends patted him on the shoulder in comfort.<br />
<br />
“Yes, folks, step right up!”  Ecbus’s voice announced from somewhere in the pool of onlookers.  “See if you can drink the Gnome under the table!  Got five victories already!  Keep that “Yellow Snow” comin’!”<br />
<br />
The warrior and the ranger burst into laughter.  Ioemir stopped shortly after to behold a sullen Heldorm enter the tavern and head upstairs.  Aelwyl must have seen him enter too, as she followed him up the steps.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Heldorm?”  Aelwyl’s soft voice called.  “Are you alright?” <br />
<br />
The Barbarian sat on the edge of his bed staring into darkness.  Aelwyl sat down beside him and ran her hand down his arm.  “Aye, just . . . thinkin’ on what my dad said ta me just now.”  Heldorm sat quietly for a few moments in thought before slowly standing.  Aelwyl stood also and faced him.  “What did he say, Heldorm?”<br />
<br />
“He said –“ But Heldorm couldn’t finish his sentence.  His eyes suddenly caught Aelwyl’s and everything around him seemed to fade into a blur.  But there in front of him, everything became clear.  He knew now what his own pride was hiding from him.  When somethin’ like that comes along, ye need to reach out and snatch it!  Like when ye accidentally drop yer mother’s jewelry in the fire.  Ye gotta reach in to the flames and snatch before it’s melted away.  Heldorm put his hand on Aelwyl’s cheek and gently ran his thumb across her lips.  The Wood Elf’s eyes glistened and slowly closed, her breath growing rapid.  <br />
“This moment may never come again,” Heldorm whispered before leaning in and passionately kissing Aelwyl.<br />
<br />
<br />
(To Be Continued . . .)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Last call had already come and gone when Ioemir saw Heldorm emerge from the upper level of the tavern; the Barbarian’s earlier glumness seemed to have totally vanished.  Mere moments later, Aelwyl also emerged, beaming and almost gliding down the steps.  They both stepped out into the night, letting a thin curtain of frost blow inward.<br />
<br />
In the streets of Halas, Heldorm held Aelwyl close to him and watched the aurora smile down on them through the stars.<br />
<br />
“Local legend says that the lights in the sky are the spirits of our ancestors, watchin’ down over us.  And as long as we look up to em and pay homage, they’ll guide our steps and protect Halas.”<br />
<br />
“They’re beautiful,” said Aelwyl, completely lost in the moment.  “What are we going to do now, Heldorm?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.  And that’s the great thing about it.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl looked quizzically at Heldorm.<br />
<br />
“Ye see, I’ve been livin’ my whole life like some bard’s play – everything safe and scripted out.  Never really opened my eyes, ye know?  Took a sick ol’ man to open em.  But now that they are, I ain’t never closin’ em again.”  Heldorm looked down at Aelwyl with a smile and kissed her.  He then turned and looked in the direction of the shaman encampment.  “I really must go request an audience with the elder shamans now.”<br />
<br />
“Do you really think they will hold the secret to curing Ioemir’s daughter?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, but there’s not much in this world or the next that can hide from them.  I have to try.  I’ll be back soon.”  The shaman smiled and winked at Aelwyl before walking away.  The auburn-haired Hierophant looked back into the shimmering fire in the sky and imagined the spirits within staring back at her.  A sudden snow shower began to fall, tiny white flakes tumbling silently to the white ground.  Aelwyl stretched out her arms and inhaled the cold perfection of the moment, until her lungs filled with peace.  Soft flakes of snow struggled to dance to earth for a just a few moments longer before melting in the dark flames of her hair.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Approach, Heldorm Snowreader,” a feminine voice from within the encampment announced.  Heldorm obliged and found a single elder, Feodorna the Blessed, seated before a small fire.<br />
<br />
“Ye know why I come?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Feodorna raised her head to Heldorm.  Even the cold chisel of over a hundred winters did little to scar her beauty.  “Your thoughts betray you like your own shadow.  It is not my beauty you seek, Heldorm, it is my council.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, forgive me, Feodorna.  Where are the other elders?”<br />
<br />
“They have retired for the night.  There will be no more councils until the morning.”  The shamaness closed her eyes and searched Heldorm’s soul.  “There is a matter which presses heavily upon your heart and those of your companions – one companion in particular, a Feir’Dal man . . . Ioemir is his name.  Someone he loves is very ill, perhaps even dying.  And something else . . .” the shamaness delved deeper into the recesses of Heldorm’s mind.  “Something very dark, a secret perhaps.  Something concerning one of your companions . . .”<br />
<br />
Heldorm redirected his thoughts and closed off his mind.<br />
<br />
“Why do you shy away, Heldorm?  Have you something to hide?”<br />
<br />
“I have nothing to hide.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed,” Feodorna opened her eyes and smirked at Heldorm.  “Your heart is unusually free and calm.  You have changed in some way recently.  This change has affected you greatly; the wall of ice you erected around your heart has all but melted away.<br />
<br />
“You have a gift unlike any other bestowed upon you, Heldorm.  You are the Snowreader.  The Tribunal has granted you with a unique insight into some of the universe’s deepest secrets.  This is not an ability to be taken lightly, for you must only use it to seek the answers to questions of utmost importance.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, Feodorna,” Heldorm bowed his head.  “But it is also this gift that ultimately drives me away from everyone.  Folks have a bad habit of fearin’ that which they can’t understand.”<br />
<br />
“Your path is not an easy one.  No one has ever said differently.  But the path lies before you, nonetheless, and you must travel down it how you will.”  The elder shaman regarded Heldorm a last time before standing and walking toward an empty room.  “The council will convene at first light.  We will await you here.  For now, rest well, Heldorm Snowreader.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“What did the council say?” Aelwyl intercepted Heldorm at the door to McAndrew’s Axe ‘n Ale.<br />
<br />
“Nothin’, lass.  They’re all asleep now.  I’m meetin’ with em in the mornin’.”<br />
<br />
“Ah,” Aelwyl smiled and exhaled. <br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing is wrong, Heldorm, just the opposite.  This place, this city is so full of music and warmth and good food, and by contrast, it is surrounded by such cold desolation.  Yet, your people still manage to thrive and raise their children.  It is just so . . . perfect in a way.  I cannot describe it exactly.”<br />
<br />
“No need, jah’tun.  I understand perfectly.”<br />
<br />
“Jah'tun.  That means ‘my love’ in your language, doesn’t it?  You haven’t called me that in a long time.”<br />
<br />
“Did I say that?” Heldorm laughed, embarrassed.  “It just kinda rolled off so naturally, I didn’t even notice it.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl lifted herself up for another kiss but was interrupted by Ioemir clearing his throat behind them.<br />
<br />
“I suspected as much,” the Wood Elf warrior said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
“Aye, well I guess our lil’ secret’s out.”<br />
<br />
“No, no, nothing wrong with it at all.  It’s good to see you two back together again.  Heldorm, what have you learned from the elders?”<br />
<br />
“Well like I was tellin’ Aelwyl, there’s gonna be a council meetin’ in the mornin’.  Hopefully I’ll have some answers for ye then, friend.  I know ye been waitin’ long enough.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir stepped up to Heldorm and grasped his shoulder.  “I every every bit of confidence in you, my tall friend.  If there are any answers to be discovered, I am sure it will be you who uncovers them.”<br />
<br />
“Yer faith is humblin’, Ioemir.  I think sometimes ye may put too much in me, though.  I am only one man after all.  And not a very great one at that.”<br />
<br />
“Nonsense!  You are one of the greatest men I have ever met, Heldorm.  Nothing could shake my faith in you.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm did not respond.  He just watched Ioemir return inside the tavern.<br />
<br />
“You see, my love?  There are many who hold you in high regard.  You will never be alone.”  Aelwyl held Heldorm tightly and looked back into the sky at the ancient Northman spirits watching in the heavens.<br />
<br />
<br />
From the journal of Ecbus:<br />
[/i]“What a dumb trend that big oaf started – journal writing.  But ah well, since I started I might as well finish.  Wow, where to begin?  First I meet all these folks who need me to get them to Halas for Brell knows what reason.  So we start off from Freeport and run into a Paladin and a Dark Elf along the way.  Then we almost get chomped by undead in Kithicor and Gnolls in Blackburrow.  Oh, and we met this ranger – blech.  Seems like he might be okay, but he’s still a ranger.  Gonna have to keep my eye on him.<br />
	<br />
Anyway, we’re here in Halas now, freezing our bottoms off.  Ioemir says we need to wait till morning so Heldorm (the aforementioned big oaf) can get some kinda answers from the other shamans or something, I dunno.  I don’t believe in any of that spiritual whatzit hocus-pocus.  I need good old hard science at my fingertips.  Woah yeah!  Speaking of fingertips, I could sure kiss mine right about now!  I cleaned house in Rivervale.  Those sucker Halflings bought almost the whole motherload!  Made a thousand plat in the blink of an eye.  Course I’ll have to write off one crate of those hair trimmer thingies cause Heldorm just gave one to those mangy Gnolls.  Ah well, the big oaf said he’d pay me back (which I will certainly collect on, believe you me) so it’s okay, I guess.  Oh yeah, plus I drank some Barbs under the table tonight.  Man, I was kinda disappointed.  Only ones who are supposed to drink as much as Barbs are Dwarves.  <br />
	<br />
Well, it’s late and I think all that ‘Yellow Snow’ stuff is catching up with me, so I better get some rest.  Maybe these hairy Barbs will want what remaining trimmers I have left.  Another pocketful of plat sure wouldn’t hurt.”[/I] <br />
<br />
	<br />
From the journal of Aelwyl:<br />
“I cannot even begin to describe my feelings at the moment.  Heldorm once again holds me like he used to.  I was looking up into the night sky at the aurora, feeling total peace.  It’s the same way I feel in Heldorm’s arms.<br />
	<br />
Dark Elves, Paladins, Undead, Halflings, Talis, Ymeal’s departure, Gnolls – they all pale in comparison to the events in Halas this night.  Well, there is one other event of note.  I saw Borrin, Heldorm’s father again.  He did not look well.  I hope he takes his son’s advice and seeks medical treatment.  Nevertheless, it was good to see him again, and I hope one day Heldorm and I can return to see him some day.<br />
	<br />
I need to sleep, but my mind is racing and my heart is beating.  All I can think about is that brief, wonderful time Heldorm and I spent in the tavern where it all came back.”<br />
<br />
	<br />
From the journal of Blorg:<br />
	<br />
“Hard 2 write . . . 2 much aile . . . gonna be sik!”<br />
<br />
	<br />
From the journal of Heldorm:<br />
	<br />
“Oh my, where to begin.  I suppose at the beginning.  <br />
	<br />
Well, it turns out our stalker was a ranger named Talis.  Nice enough fellow, I guess, but quiet.  Oh and did he have some news for me!  It turns out that – er, wait a minute.  No, better not write it here, just in case.<br />
	<br />
Anyway, yeah, Ymeal ran into his sister (his pretty sister I might add) in Rivervale and so he decided to leave us to patch things up with her.  Too bad, too, was just getting to know him.  Ah well, perhaps we will meet again after this is all over.<br />
	<br />
Bah, stupid Gnolls!  Had to ‘donate’ one of Ecbus’s crates of hair trimmers to get past them.  No biggie if we had to fight, though, we could of taken them easily.  But ah well, probably for the best that we didn’t.<br />
	<br />
Here we are now in Halas.  I paid a visit to my father, that stubborn mule!  Won’t take his medicine even though his condition is getting worse.  I’m afraid I’ll lose him just like mom, and then I’ll have no family left.  But boy does he have some wisdom left in that old body of his.  Set me straight like he used to.  I let it sink in and I tell ya – everything just seems better now.  Can’t really put a finger on it, just life seems a lot clearer now.<br />
	<br />
I met with Feodorna of the elder shamans and they said that they would hold council in the morning.  I’m kind of excited about that, because I may finally be able to give some hope to poor Ioemir.<br />
	<br />
And Aelwyl.  Hard to even begin to write about what happened there.  I dunno, we were just sitting together in that room upstairs from McAndrew’s and it happened – our lips met and well, we, uh . . . kinda uh . . . relived the past for a little while.  I don’t where we are going, Aelwyl and I, but I hope it is all the way.<br />
	<br />
Anyway, big day tomorrow!  Enough writing, time to sleep.”<br />
<br />
	<br />
From the journal of Ioemir:<br />
	<br />
“I could relate the past couple of days’ events but they would be pretty meaningless compared to the prospect of finding an answer to my daughter’s cure in the morning.  About the only other thing worth mentioning would be my friend, Ymeal’s departure.  It’s a shame not having him here to lean on, but it is good that he has reconciled with his sister.  And we have apparently picked up a new companion – Talis, a ranger.  He is a quiet man who takes to himself most of the time, but I find myself taking to him.  Perhaps we could be friends one day in the near future, or at least acquaintances.<br />
	<br />
I am too excited and nervous to write anymore.  The sooner I go to sleep, the sooner tomorrow will come and perhaps I can then return to Kelethin with the gift of life.”  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Consciousness leapt into Heldorm with a sharp knocking on his door.  With the world still spinning around him in a blur, the shaman walked to the door and pulled it open.  Before him, stood a messenger of the elder council.<br />
	<br />
“Pardon the interruption, Venerable One, but the elders are preparing for council and request your presence.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, aye, of course,” Heldorm yawned and focused his eyes.  “Tell ‘em I’ll be down shortly.”<br />
	<br />
“Yes, Venerable One.”  The messenger took his leave.  Heldorm rubbed his face with his hands, dressed, gathered his belongings, and descended the stairs into the tavern.  There he found Ioemir and Talis sitting at the bar.  Upon seeing the Barbarian, Ioemir quickly stood from his stool.<br />
	<br />
“Good morning to you, Heldorm,” the Wood Elf said excitedly.  “Is the council going to see you now?”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, in a moment.  This is not somethin’ to rush into, though.  These councils can take many hours sometimes.”<br />
	<br />
“However long it takes, my friend.  I will wait here for your return.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, that’d be best, lad.  Have the others wait here, too.  Or ye can look around town if ye like, although not much to see, really.”<br />
	<br />
Just then, Aelwyl walked down the steps and greeted everyone sleepily.  <br />
	<br />
“Never were a mornin’ person, eh, lass?”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl conjured a weak smile.  “Not really.  But I slept well last night.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir raised an eyebrow at Heldorm.<br />
	<br />
“Erm, it’s not what ye be thinkin’ there, Ioemir.  Now if ye’ll be excusin’ me, I’ve got to go meet with the council.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl grasped Heldorm’s hand briefly and squeezed before letting him go.  “Good luck to you, Heldorm.  I hope you find the answers you seek.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm looked at Talis and then at Ioemir.  “So do I, lass, so do I.”<br />
<br />
	<br />
The council of six elders awaited Heldorm at the entrance to the shaman encampment.  The encampment itself was a large complex of animal-hide tents.  The central tent served as the main chamber, where the elders spent most of their time in discussion and meditation.  Surrounding the central chamber, were housing tents, where the elders lived. And in the rear of the complex, stood the council chamber – a cramped tent with a fireplace filled with nameless herbs in the center.<br />
	<br />
“Greetings again, Heldorm Snowreader,” Feodorna said with calm reverence.  “Are you prepared for your council with the Halas elder shamans?”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm took a breath and replied, “Aye, I'm ready.”<br />
	<br />
“Very well, then let the council begin.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm followed the elders into the back tent of the encampment and seated himself in the circle of shamans.  The council members consisted of Feodorna the Blessed, Rodahn Spiritguide, Landorf Steerhorn, Malith McKeran, Leran the Farseer, and Balorm Frosthammer.  Leran rubbed two pieces of flint together and caught the pile of herbs in the fireplace ablaze.  After a few moments, the small tent was filled with intoxicating smoke.  <br />
	<br />
“Breath the vapors of enlightenment into every crevass and empty space of your lungs,” Feodorna began.  “Feel the vapors inside of you until they saturate into your mind and unlock the doors of irrational thought.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm inhaled until the warm burn of the herb’s fumes clouded his eyes.  The outside world faded away into a singular point of light.<br />
	<br />
“Now, Heldorm Snowreader.  What is it you wish to address this council about?”<br />
	<br />
“The daughter of my friend Ioemir was born with a weak life force.  How much time she has left in this world isn’t clear, but it most assuredly isn’t long.  I’ve concocted a mixture of several healin’ herbs that could possibly return her life force, but I‘m missin’ the key ingredient.  I suppose I seek what this ingredient is.”<br />
	<br />
“Hmmm,” Feodorna focused.  “The answer is unclear to me alone.  Rodahn Spiritguide, speak.”<br />
	<br />
“I see . . .” Rodahn strained his eyes.  “The child, and the mother holding her.  I see them in Kelethin.  There is something of great concern there.  Not for the child’s well being, but for the safety of the city.  A mass of Feir’Dal troops is positioning itself around the city.  And that . . . is all I see.”<br />
	<br />
“Landorf Steerhorn, speak.”<br />
	<br />
“I see the girl’s father, Ioemir.  He is both nervous and excited.  He is speakin’ to another man, a woodsman.  Ioemir feels a friendship growin’ between them, but the woodsman has other thoughts, angry thoughts.  I . . . can’t see anymore than that, I am sorry.”<br />
	<br />
“Malith McKeran, speak.”<br />
	<br />
“I see a Gnome, and an Ogre.  The Gnome is counting his platinum.  In fact, platinum seems very important to him – no, there is something else.  Monetary gain is not that important.  He only uses that as a shield.  There is something that gives him more satisfaction – the need to do good, the need to do something that matters.  <br />
<br />
“And the Ogre, he is wise, very wise.  But he is also sad, sad that the Gnome will not listen to him.  But nonetheless he sees a good friend in the Gnome, and continues to offer himself as a beast of burden to please him.  But no, no it is growing cloudy again . . . it is gone.”<br />
<br />
“Leran the Farseer, your visions are the most intense and trusted of all.  Speak.”<br />
<br />
Leran let out a short breath and began speaking in his raspy voice.  “I see images from another time and place.  Where this place is, is unknown, but it is most assuredly not on Norrath.  I see mechanical beasts of steel waging war on great cities that touch the very sky.  I see a sea of men, soldiers.  They march and ravage innocent peace loving people with cruel and indescribable weapons of death.  Flames and great flying weapons of fire turn the day into night.  A long period of darkness creeps over the land, slowly freezing the surviving peoples to an ultimate end.”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps you breath in the sacred vapors too deeply, Leran.  Expel the excess and return now to this time, this place.  But now is the time for Balorm Frosthammer to speak.”<br />
<br />
“There is another Feir’Dal, a woman.  She shares a deep bond with Heldorm.  Her heart is full o’ passion, yet, at the same time, sadness.  She feels helpless that she can’t save everyone, fer that’s what she wants more’n anything – to save all those who need savin’.  She won’t tell anyone this, of course, she’s too proud.  Also, there’s some anger there – anger toward Tunare, fer denyin’ her the use of the great winds.  She feels it’s all unfair, especially when Ioemir’s daughter’s life is on the line.  But I see no more than that.”<br />
<br />
“Very well.  The elders have all spoken, Heldorm, but I feel an answer has not been reached.”<br />
<br />
“Nay,” Heldorm still saw only a pinpoint of light before him.<br />
<br />
“I feel you know what you must do, Heldorm.  You must use the gift the Tribunal has blessed you with.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, I feel I have no choice.”<br />
<br />
“Be at ease, Heldorm.  No one here shuns or looks down upon you for this gift.  You will not be judged by us.”<br />
<br />
The pinpoint of light in Heldorm’s mind began to move, as if driven by some obscure part of his subconscious.  It told him to stand, which he did, the other elders following suit.  The light led them all outside, where a fresh blanket of snow was beginning to form.  The light then slowly expanded into a vision of endless drifts of snow.  Inside these drifts of the subconscious, Heldorm found himself roaming freely.  Voices from the snow called to him form all directions.  The shaman scanned the boundless expanse of white until he saw movement.  The spectral snow before him formed into a swirl of black liquid, smaller streams of liquid branching off from the main vein.  Beside it, a mirror image formed, but this time of a white liquid, almost as white as the snow itself.  The two branching swirls slowly pooled together, causing a luminous blue liquid to meander down away from its conjoined parents.<br />
<br />
“Mo-acht!” said Heldorm in realization.  “Of course!  The twisted root that only grows in times of sustained twilight.  When it’s boiled in water, it secretes a bluish liquid.  Never knew it had healin’ properties, though.  That means that we’ve gotta –“ But out of the corner of his eye, Heldorm saw someone move.  He quickly turned to behold a darkened robed figure, holding a tall curved staff.  Beside him, another dark figure suddenly appeared.  This one held a sword, which he lifted to strike the figure.  Just as their weapons clashed, Heldorm’s mind ripped itself out of the vision.  The shaman gasped as the real world returned once again.<br />
<br />
“Welcome back, Heldorm Snowreader,” Feodorna steadied him from falling back.  “What did the snow tell you?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Mo-acht” Heldorm told his companions as he downed a quick pint of “Yellow Snow.”<br />
<br />
“Mo-acht?” Ioemir asked, puzzled.  “What is that?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a root, lad.  A root that only grows durin’ the times of twilight in Everfrost.  Lucky fer you, we just came outta one of them, so there should be a few roots still around.  That is, if the ice goblins haven’t snatched em up already.  They forage em, too, for some stew er soup er something they make.  Stuff smells like the backside of a mammoth.”<br />
<br />
“Well what are we waiting for?!”  Ioemir slammed his hands on the table and started for the door.  “Let’s find this root and save my daughter!”                      <br />
<br />
<br />
(To Be Continued . . .)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">“Alright,” Heldorm started, scanning the snowy foothills.  “The root’s out ‘ere somewhere, if there are any still left.  Talis, yer the best forager of any of us ‘ere.  What we’re lookin’ fer is a dark brown root with lotsa tiny roots comin’ off it.  Looks kinda like some sorta freak spider.”<br />
<br />
“Like Owl’s Bane,” Talis said turning the mental image over in his head.  <br />
<br />
“Aye, kinda, cept larger and this grows out in the open.  They only grow near the roots of trees, and as ye can see, this ain’t quite Kelethin, so that’ll make it a tad easier.”<br />
<br />
“It would probably be best if we split up, then.”  Talis immediately squatted down and began examining a nearby tree.  “We’ll cover more ground.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, what I was thinkin’, lad.  Meet back ‘ere when dusk sets in.  Trust me, ye don’t want to be in Everfrost when it’s dark.  Oh, and if ye be seein’ any ice goblins huntin’ for the roots, as well, give em a lil’ somethin’ to maybe discourage em.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” Ioemir uncovered his sword, “I’m not letting anything come between us and the cure for my daughter.”<br />
<br />
The four companions began to pan the snowy plains and valleys of Everfrost.  They moved from tree to tree, searching for some sign of the root.  By midday, the situation was not looking optimistic.  <br />
<br />
“Woo, I need a rest.” Heldorm sat on a large boulder at the foot of a steep, ice-covered hill with a long exhale.  Aelwyl joined him and scooted close next to him.<br />
	<br />
“I dunno, Aelwyl,” Heldorm said as he watched Ioemir frantically searching a small group of trees some distance off.  “I just can’t shake the feelin’ that I may be givin’ Ioemir a false sense of hope.  I mean, look at him out there – runnin’ around all excited, bustin’ himself to find a root that may or may not be there for the takin’.  I just . . . I just hope I haven’t mislead him.”<br />
	<br />
“You cannot blame yourself, Heldorm,” the Wood Elf rested her head against Heldorm’s shoulder.  “You are only doing what you think is right.  At least now we know the answer, whether it be out there or not.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, aye yer right, of course.  It’s just that –“<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm?!”  Talis’s voice suddenly yelled from over a distant hill.  “Heldorm I think I found something!”  Ioemir heard the call, also, as he took a quick look at Heldorm and Aelwyl before sprinting off over the hill.  Once on the other side, he saw Talis kneeling beside a tree.  <br />
	<br />
“Did you find it?” Ioemir asked excitedly.  <br />
	<br />
“I believe so.”  Talis gestured at the roots of the tree.  Ioemir knelt beside the ranger and leaned in to get a closer look.  A moment later, Aelwyl and Heldorm met them.<br />
	<br />
“Aye that’s it, lad!  Good eyes ye have there!” <br />
	<br />
Just as the Barbarian began to reach for the plump, brown root, however, a low hiss caught everyone by surprise.  The party turned to behold a short, hunched goblin pop out from behind the tree.<br />
	<br />
“Four ugly creatures do my eyes see,” the goblin said drawing a twisted dagger.  “And a fat, scrumptious root for me!”<br />
	<br />
“Touch it and the only thing you will be carrying home is your hand,” Ioemir drew his sword and pointed its tip at the goblin.  Talis loaded and readied his bow with blinding speed.<br />
	<br />
“Ooh, shiny blades do the creatures wield, yet not until the root is mine will I yield.”  The goblin made a slow motion toward the root.<br />
	<br />
“One inch closer,” warned Talis, pulling back the string on his bow, “and you’ll taste my arrow for your supper.”<br />
	<br />
“Heh, now now, fair strangers, no need for threats.”  The goblin sheathed his dagger and took a slight step away from the root.  “You see, my dagger now in its sheath sets.”  Ioemir and Talis hesitantly put away their weapons, yet maintained a close eye on the ice goblin, now grinning a jagged, yellow smile.  “This root to you I now concede, for there are others on which I can feed.”  The goblin began to hobble away.  Heldorm pulled the root from the ground as his companions backed away slightly to give him room.  As the Barbarian turned, however, the goblin suddenly charged back toward him, dagger drawn.  “Fooled you have I, now root stealer, you shall die!”<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm!  Look out!”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm turned to face the goblin just in time to see the blade of its dagger come down, but stop as an arrow drove itself into its target’s neck.  The goblin gurgled and coughed up a mouthful of dark red blood, before staggering back and slumping down lifeless.  The shocked Barbarian turned to Talis, who was just lowering his bow, free hand still in the grasped position.<br />
	<br />
“Nice reflexes ye got there, too, lad.  Another moment and I’d have a goblin dagger in me back.”<br />
	<br />
“Don’t mention it,” said Talis, slinging his bow back over his shoulder.  <br />
	<br />
“The root.”  Ioemir took the root and examined it in awe.  “I hold my daughter’s life in my hands.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, hurry now, Ioemir.  Let’s get this back to my house and whip up a lil’ somethin’ somethin’ for ye.”<br />
<br />
	<br />
“This is where you live?” Ioemir asked, looking at the cramped hut in astonishment.  Rolled up pieces of parchment littered the floor; a countless assortment of vials and potions lined makeshift shelves and around the base of the hut’s interior.<br />
	<br />
“Aye, it’s not much I know, but it’s home.  It holds my alchemy supplies and my research, not to mention myself, so it serves its purpose.”  Heldorm put some fresh branches into his empty fireplace.  Lighting a flame with two large pieces of flint, the shaman rested a small pot on the spit above the now growing fire.  He quickly stepped outside and returned with an armful of snow, which he promptly dumped into the pot.  A few more armfuls of snow were added, then Heldorm waited as it melted away into a small pool of water.  <br />
	<br />
“When the water boils I’ll throw in the root.  After it’s been in there a bit, it’ll start to bleed out a glowin’ liquid – that’s what we want.  Oh, and I’ll warn ya, stuff stinks a bit when it’s boiled, too, so hope ye got some strong noses.”<br />
	<br />
Several minutes passed before a ripe stench began to emanate from the pot.  Heldorm stood and peered into the boiling water.  Swirling into the water, a luminous blue liquid leaked from the root’s flesh.  <br />
	<br />
“Aye, there we go.”  Heldorm watched patiently as he let the remaining drops of liquid seep from the root.  He grabbed a pair of tongs resting on a nearby table and removed the shriveled root before tossing it in a large bin setting on the floor.  “Now we separate the water from the root’s liquid.  Then comes the hard part.”<br />
	<br />
“Hard part?”  Ioemir raised an eyebrow at the shaman.<br />
	<br />
“Aye, seein’ as most of this is new to me, I’m not exactly sure how much o’ this to mix with the other ingredients.”  Heldorm paused a moment after pouring the mixture into a strange funnel-like object, then recollected the strained water into the pot.  “Which reminds me, I need to be savin’ this water to boil the other herbs in.”<br />
	<br />
“Do you have any idea as to how much goes in at least?”  Ioemir asked, visibly nervous.<br />
	<br />
“Well, I got my ideas, but they’re just that – ideas.  I’m kinda makin’ this up as I go, lad.”<br />
	<br />
“Oh, I see.”  Ioemir stared at the ground for a moment before standing and walking outside; Aelwyl followed him.<br />
	<br />
“Ioemir, you’ve got to have faith in Heldorm.  You have before, quite easily I might add.”<br />
	<br />
“I know, Aelwyl,” Ioemir peered far out across the tundra, whose vista stretched endlessly from his vantage point.  “My doubt just seems to grow stronger as of late.  You heard him, he’s making this up as he goes.”<br />
	<br />
“Yes, Ioemir, but you must trust him.  He’s been an alchemist for over forty seasons.  I’m sure he will mix the potion correctly.”<br />
	<br />
“Very well, Aelwyl, for your sake and my daughter’s I will trust he is taking the right steps.”<br />
	<br />
<br />
By evening, Heldorm looked up from his alchemy table and sighed.  “Alright, everyone, it’s ready.”<br />
	<br />
The shaman’s three companions gathered around him as he held up a small vial of faintly glowing, purple liquid.<br />
	<br />
“So that is it . . .” Ioemir watched the liquid slowly turn and settle inside the vial.<br />
	<br />
“Aye.  I figured just a few drops should do the child well.  Stuff’s potent enough as is, let alone in large quantities.  I only used about the same of the other ingredients, most of what ye see ‘ere is water.”<br />
	<br />
“Now we return to Kelethin?”  asked Ioemir with some relief.<br />
	<br />
“Aye, lad, we best not waste any time.  We’ll return to Halas and prepare to leave.  The sooner we can get this to yer daughter, the sooner ye’ll be bouncin’ her on yer knee.”     <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">“Ah, so there ye’all are!” Heldorm knocked firmly on the side of the wagon, sending reverberations through the wood and into Ecbus’s and Blorg’s swirling heads.<br />
	<br />
“Ohh, man,” Ecbus groaned awake.  “I feel like someone dunked my head in the Qeynos sewers.”<br />
	<br />
“Ah had a wee bit too much ale last night, eh?”<br />
	<br />
“I . . . I don’t get it.  I drank everyone under the table . . . and now I get hit with it all?”<br />
	<br />
“Heh, that’s what ye get fer showin’ up us Northern folk.”  Heldorm took a brief look inside the now completely empty wagon.  “Say, erm, where’d all the rest of yer stuff go?  Did ye sell some more while ye were here?”<br />
	<br />
“Eh?” Ecbus struggled to his feet and focused in on his wagon.  “What the?  Where’d all my stuff go?!”<br />
	<br />
“Joo solds it a few hours ago, remember?” Blorg said in a slur.<br />
	<br />
“Ohhh, yeah, I guess I did.  Hmm, I wonder how much I got for it.  Ah well, at least they didn’t touch my . . . my special stash!”  Ecbus suddenly broke into a panic and frantically searched the wagon.  “Ah whew, here it is!”  In a small, hidden compartment underneath the floorboards of the wagon, a few chained-wrapped boxes peeked out.<br />
	<br />
“Yeah, I hid dem dere when we saw da Barbies comin’ dis way, remember?”<br />
	<br />
“Umm, no not really.  But thanks, Blorg.  I dunno what I’d do without those.  So, um, Heldorm, did you meet with your old guys or whoever?” <br />
	<br />
“Aye, I did,” Heldorm withdrew the vial of liquid and waved it gently in the air.  “And I got what we be needin’,”<br />
	<br />
“Ah, what is that stuff?”<br />
	<br />
“It’s the medicine that . . .ohhh, that’s right.  Ye know, I don’t think we ever told ye what we were all after did we?”<br />
	<br />
“No, no not that I recall,” Ecbus shrugged.  “Course, I never really asked, either.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm proceeded to explain their situation to Ecbus.  When Heldorm finished, the Gnome leaned back into a support beam of the wagon with an expression of morbid awe on his face.<br />
	<br />
“Why . . . why did you never tell me before?”<br />
	<br />
“Well, I, uhh, dunno.  I suppose I figured ye didn’t really care, long as we paid ye fer the ride.”<br />
	<br />
“How can you say that, Heldorm?  I never knew a child’s life was at stake.  I would never have gone through all of this town-to-town traveling if I had known.  We would have just shot straight to Halas!”<br />
	<br />
“Well, I’m sorry, Ecbus, never knew ye had a soft spot there.”<br />
	<br />
“Of course, I do, how can you even say that?  I’m not a profit-driven, heartless monster, you know.”<br />
	<br />
“Ecbus, I . . .”<br />
	<br />
“I just wish ye could of told me, sooner.  Maybe I could have whipped up something to help save her – a life saver, extender thingy.”<br />
	<br />
“Trust me, Ecbus,” interjected Ioemir.  “What my daughter requires goes well beyond Gnomish technology.”<br />
	<br />
“Just once,” said Ecbus leaning his head back and looking with utmost seriousness into the sky.  “Just once, I want to invent something real.  Something that really matters.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm searched fruitlessly for a response, but before he could find any words, someone approached from behind him.<br />
	<br />
“Venerable One,” a Barbarian clad in the armor of The Wolves of the North clan announced, “Kylan O’Danos has requested an audience with you immediately.&quot; <br />
	<br />
“Oh, erm, aye, aye of course I’ll meet with him.”  Heldorm shot Ioemir a quick, wide-eyed glance.   “Tell him I’ll be there shortly.”<br />
	<br />
The Wolf Clan messenger took his leave.  Ioemir leaned closer to Heldorm and asked, “Who is Kylan O’Danos?”<br />
	<br />
“He’s the Co-Pack Leader of the Wolves of the North.  An invitation from him means somethin’ big is up.  We better get there quick.  Kylan’s not a man ye keep waitin’.”<br />
	<br />
	<br />
At the entrance to The Pit of Doom, a shaman, surrounded by several bloodied Wolves of the North members, were huddled, looking down mournfully at something. <br />
	<br />
“What in the name of The Tribunal happened ‘ere?” Heldorm asked walking quickly up to the huddle. <br />
	<br />
“It’s Boris, Heldorm,” the shaman said in a low tone.  “He’s . . .”  But he stopped and just sighed.<br />
	<br />
“Boris?!” the Snowreader pushed his way through the small crowd and looked down at the broken body of Boris McLerran.  Upon seeing Heldorm, Boris coughed out a bit of blood, reached up with his hand and grabbed the shaman’s tunic, pulling him closer.<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm *cough*  It’s good ta see ye, old friend.”<br />
	<br />
“Boris, ye old goblin lover, what kinda trouble ye gotten yerself into this time.”<br />
	<br />
“They’re comin’ fer us all, Heldorm.  *Cough* Comin’ in waves.  Too many . . . *cough* too many of em for me ta fight off.”<br />
	<br />
“Too many of what?”<br />
	<br />
“Gnolls, old friend! *Cough* Gnolls are . . . risin’ up.  No mercy . . .  Ye have to . . . *Cough*  Ye have to . . .”  But Boris’s eyes just continued to stare straight ahead, the firm grip he had on Heldorm’s tunic slackened, causing his hand to flop lifeless by his side.  All Northmen present lowered their heads.  Lysbith McNall, the other Co-Pack Leader began to wail a traditional song of death, guiding Boris’s soul into the heavens.<br />
	<br />
“What he was sayin’,” started a severely injured Arnis McLish, “Was that the Gnolls aren’t quiet any longer.  They’re comin’ outta Blackburrow in great numbers, entire legions almost.  Like a never endin’ sea of fur with fangs.  Boris was in the patrol out near the Blackburrow entrance when all hell broke loose.  A large pack o’ them lil buggers stormed outta nowhere and overpowered the patrol.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, this ain’t good, lads.  Not good at all.”  Heldorm ran a hand through his hair.<br />
	<br />
“No, it is not.”  Kylan O’Danos stepped up from inside the Pit of Doom.  “Gnolls are weak alone and in small numbers.  But in great waves, as Arnis said, they are a force to be reckoned with.  That is why I have summoned you, Heldorm.”  Kylan took a brief look at Heldorm’s companions.  “This is not for the eyes and ears of outsiders, come with me alone.”<br />
	<br />
	<br />
Accompanied only by Lysbith, Heldorm and Kylan trekked by torchlight into a forgotten recess of the Pit of Doom.  They ventured into a long corridor, stopping at a point Heldorm guessed was underneath the very heart of the city.<br />
	<br />
“Where are we?  I never knew this place even existed.”<br />
	<br />
“The city of Halas holds many seceret, Heldorm,” Lysbith said quietly.  “This tunnel is almost as old as Halas itself.  It was built as an escape route in case Halas were to ever fall to our enemies.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm nodded.  “So ye’ve brought me down here to show me the escape route we’ll be usin’ when the Gnolls invade?”<br />
	<br />
“No, Heldorm,” Kylan handed his torch to Lysbith.  “The ancient builders of Halas hid one more secret.”  The warrior slowly removed a section of the interior wall to reveal a large niche.  Inside of the niche, something faintly glowed with ethereal light.  Kylan reached in and extracted a large maul; glowing runes covered its smooth, silver surface.  <br />
	<br />
“Do you recognize this war hammer, Heldorm?”  Kylan asked.<br />
	<br />
“Aye,” Heldorm said in a revered, hushed voice as Kylan handed him the maul.  “Invictus.”<br />
	<br />
“That’s right.  Handed down from Pack Leader to Pack Leader since the days of Halas’s founding.”<br />
	<br />
“But, why give me this?  I am no Wolf of the North.”<br />
	<br />
“That’s right, Heldorm.”  Lysbith handed Kylan back his torch.  “Which is precisely why you are the only one who can wield it.  It is not meant for a warrior’s hands; only a Shaman of Justice can wield its power.”<br />
	<br />
“Again, though – why me?  Why not one of the elders?”<br />
	<br />
“Ehh, the elders are too stuck in their ways.  They all but dismiss the need for combat and prefer instead to hide in their tents and conjure up visions.  You, however, Heldorm.  I’ve watched you.  You’re not like the others; you are a man of action.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm studied Invictus, judging its weight and reading the ancient runes.  “These runes – they’re in the ancient tongue.  I can barely understand them.”<br />
	<br />
“There are few who can.  It is said that Invictus was forged by The Tribunal themselves and given to the first Pack Leader.  The Tribunal seeks to bring justice to injustice; order to disorder.  They forged this war hammer to do just that.”<br />
	<br />
The shaman eyed Kylan and Lysbith suspiciously.  “Somethin’ tells me ye’re not givin’ me this just to slay some Gnolls.”<br />
	<br />
Kylan looked and Lysbith and then turned back to Heldorm.  “Indeed you are very perceptive, Heldorm.  No, we have not entrusted you with Invictus for the mere combating of Gnolls.  I shall tell you our reasoning, but you must never repeat it outside of these walls.”<br />
	<br />
“I will not.”<br />
	<br />
“Very well.  There are whispers among the elders of visions of a dark man, always standing silent, casting an ominous presence over everything around him.  I dare say you have shared this vision?”<br />
	<br />
“Aye,” Heldorm returned briefly to his vision earlier in the day.  “I have seen this man.”<br />
	<br />
“We suspect that this man represents something that all Norrathians have feared for ages.”<br />
	<br />
“What do ye mean by that?”<br />
	<br />
“We fear that . . . no, I should not be discussing this openly.  The eyes and ears of darkness reach father than we dare say, perhaps even into this very tunnel.  All I shall say is that Invictus serves a much greater purpose than the slaying of invading Gnolls or the defense against the average foe of Halas.  It is a bane, Heldorm – a bane of the most terrifying evil ever to walk this world.”<br />
	<br />
“And ye feel this evil walks among us today?”<br />
	<br />
“It may very well, Heldorm, it may very well.  But that is why we grant you this, to defend against such an evil, if it truly does exist.  The ultimate question now is:  are you willing to take it up and strike at the very heart of darkness itself if need be?”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm held Invictus up once again in front of him; the glowing runes softly projected themselves on his face as he slowly turned the maul around.  “Aye, I am.”    	 <br />
	       <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As Heldorm and the two Co-Pack leaders emerged from the pit, three Wolves of the North generals stood to attention.<br />
	<br />
“Yes, General O’Riordan?” asked Lysbith. &quot;What is it?”<br />
	<br />
“Lady McNall,” the general bowed, “returning scouts have reported a massive Gnoll invasion force leaving Blackburrow.”<br />
	<br />
Lysbith and Kylan glanced at each other, justifiably concerned.  “How many?”<br />
	<br />
“Five, maybe ten thousand strong.”<br />
	<br />
Kylan nodded slowly before saying, “Lysbith, a word with you a moment, please.”  Lysbith and Kylan retreated to the side and began to converse in lowered voices.  Heldorm took the moment to return to his companions.  	<br />
“What’s going on, Heldorm?” Ioemir asked, watching various Barbarians walk quickly to and from the pit area.<br />
	<br />
“May have a wee bit of a war on our hands here, lad.  Seems the Gnolls’ve got themselves an army – I’d wager headin’ in our direction first.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir suddenly looked away for a moment.<br />
	<br />
“Ye alright there, lad?”<br />
	<br />
“What?  Yes, yes!  Forgive me, I was just . . . pondering the situation.  Have any plans of attack been made?”<br />
	<br />
“Not yet.”  Heldorm glanced back at Kylan and Lysbith, who were still quietly talking in the distance.  “But knowin’ those two, and my people, we’ll see those filthy doggies in the netherworld before we let em set foot in Halas.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir smiled slightly and nodded before firmly putting his hand on Heldorm’s shoulder.  “Well, my services are here and ready should you need them, my friend.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye,” Heldorm returned the gesture.  “Thank ye, my friend.  We may yet need em . . . we may yet need em.”<br />
	<br />
“Generals!”  Kylan suddenly announced.  “Stand to attention!”  The three generals strode quickly to their commanders and stood stiff.  Kylan paced slowly before them, looking each man over with a kind of accomplished pride.  “We’ve seen many battles together; fought side by side and watched our men fall bravely at our feet.  But never in those times have we faced a direct threat to our home as we do this night.<br />
	<br />
“If the Gnolls come . . . and they will . . . we shall meet them head on.  Since its founding, the city of Halas had never fallen, and nor shall it now, not while I live!  Not while you live!”<br />
	<br />
The three generals responded excitedly, their morale beginning to well up inside them.<br />
	<br />
Lysbith stepped up and unfastened a large, hollowed-out mammoth tusk from her hip.  “For Justice!”<br />
	<br />
“For Justice!” the generals shouted in unison.<br />
	<br />
“For the Kol-Hurn!”<br />
	<br />
“For the Kol-Hurn!”<br />
	<br />
“For Halaaaaaas!”<br />
	<br />
“For Halas!” the generals broke into a frenzied cheer.  Lysbith raised the tusk to her lips and blew out three, long blasts.  The notes reverberated off every stone and icicle in Halas before continuing to ricochet from cliff to cliff, all the way out into the frozen expanses of the Everfrost Peaks.  The Gnolls undoubtedly heard the trumpet blasts; in fact, the Wolves of the North hoped they did hear it . . . and trembled in the wake.<br />
<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Meklozanth was never one to rush into a situation; sometimes he would lurk silently in the shadows for several days before taking action.  This situation was no different.  Then again, perhaps it called for even more caution than usual – after all, utmost care must be taken before the infiltration of the Feir’Dal capital city.<br />
<br />
“She’s in there somewhere,” the ancient Dark Elf said to his skeletal minions, “the child – innocent soul waiting to be plucked from its vine, like a ripened melon.”  Above him, a sea of torchlight writhed and pulsed as Kelethin’s defenses readied themselves for an unknown assailant.  <br />
	<br />
“It appears our presence has been foretold.  A survivor from Nithmiel, perhaps?  Ah, no matter, they would never harm one of their own kind . . .” Meklozanth produced a small vial of amber liquid and quickly drank its contents.  In a shimmering halo of light, the Dark Elf’s body suddenly became that of a Wood Elf.  He turned to his skeletal minions and gave a final order:  “You are to remain here, in case I am pursued.  Kill anything or anyone that interferes.”  With the creaking of decaying bones, the skeletons bowed and held their place in the shadows.  Meklozanth looked up at Kelethin once more, before starting out toward its main lift.<br />
<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
	<br />
Dawn broke above the white-haired trees of Everfrost; the waking morning sun, still weak from its night’s slumber, shrouded everything in a gentle, blue hue.  After a sleepless night of battle preparations, the armies of Halas assembled at the mouth of the snowy valley leading into the city.  Among the Northman warriors were Ioemir, Alewyl, Talis, and Blorg.<br />
	<br />
“Are you sure about this, Blorg?” Ecbus tried very hard to hide himself behind the Ogre’s legs.<br />
	<br />
“Uhh, yah, meez guess.  Deez skinny Barbies looks like dey needz me.”<br />
	<br />
“Okay, well, I’ll ummmm just wait back here and watch.”  Ecbus scooted behind a large boulder and peeked his head out.  “Ya know, root for you guys and all.”<br />
	<br />
“Your bravery is overwhelming, Ecbus,” Ioemir said sarcastically.<br />
	<br />
“Hey, I’m short!  I’d just get stepped on out there.  Besides, look at me – nothing much I could really do.”<br />
	<br />
“Eh, leave the Gnome alone there, lad,” Heldorm said looking out toward the pass leading to Blackburrow.  “We got plenty of muscle ‘ere.  Besides, I got a good feelin’ about this.  We should all be home in time for a midday ale.”<br />
	<br />
“I see the Shamans of Justice have chosen not to join us,” Kylan said to Heldorm after scanning the ranks.  “Too busy meditating in their tents, I dare say.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm said nothing in response; he just looked at Kylan a moment before looking down and away, perhaps with a small amount of shame.  Had the elders truly withdrawn into themselves?  Could the events of the waking world be so unimportant to them?  No, they couldn’t, and they weren't.  Heldorm shook such thoughts away and refocused on what was happening before him.  <br />
	<br />
Just then, a Wolves of the North scout came running from around the distant pass.  Upon reaching the gathered army, he addressed Kylan and Lysbith.  “They’re close now *pant* a whole sea of em!”<br />
	<br />
“Do they carry with them any markings or banners of war?” Kylan asked.<br />
	<br />
“Aye, they do *pant* a large banner with a black paw on it.”<br />
	<br />
“Hmmm, black paw . . .” Kylan turned to Lysbith.  <br />
	<br />
“Clan Darkpaw, perhaps?”<br />
	<br />
“Clan Darkpaw?” Talis steadied Gypsywynd.  “I thought they were extinct.”<br />
	<br />
“You know of this Gnoll clan?” Kylan eyed Talis in amazement.<br />
	<br />
“Just stories mostly.  I’ve heard that the Darkpaws were originally smiths that rose to become respected warriors.  One of the patriarch Darkpaws supposedly overthrew the ruling clan of the time and took the seat of power for himself.  After a long, tyrannical reign, however, Clan Darkpaw itself was overthrown.  I’ve heard no mention of them since in my travels, so I assumed them to be all but extinct.”<br />
	<br />
“As have we,” said Kylan.  “But there have been rumors of a surviving Darkpaw rising to power once again.  If this is true, then perhaps I have underestimated the ease of our victory.  The Darkpaws were said to be vicious and incessant – even the bravest of our forefathers feared them.”<br />
	<br />
Kylan’s words were suddenly drowned out as a cacophony of barks and growls filled the frozen valley.  From around the Blackburrow pass, came the first line of Gnolls.  Moments later, the man wolves began to flood into the valley by the hundreds, until the once white expanse was now densely freckled by dark furred warriors.  From within this mangy mass, two flag-bearers made their way to the front of the line; they both held tall poles, upon which flew a blood-red flag with a large black paw print in the center.  From behind these flag bearers, emerged a particularly tall, muscular Gnoll with a long scar running down he side of his neck.<br />
	<br />
“*Bark* Infidels of Halas!” The large Gnoll shouted.  “A thousand years of oppression and thievery ends this day!”  The rest of the Gnoll army responded in excited barks and howls.  &quot;I am Tranixx Darkpaw!  And I stand before you all to reclaim what is rightfully ours!&quot;	<br />
	<br />
“Ioemir,” Talis said, hopping down from his horse as the Gnoll leader’s tirade continued, “take Gypsywynd.  You will need him more than I.”<br />
	<br />
“What?  Are you sure?”  Ioemir began to mount the saddle.<br />
	<br />
“Yes, take him.  A ranger fairs better with both of his feet on the earth.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir obliged and Talis slipped back into the ranks.  Across the valley, the Gnolls had worked themselves into a loud, barking frenzy.  <br />
	<br />
“The time is near.”  Kylan pulled down the visor on his horned helmet.  “Sons and daughters of Halas!  Prepare yourselves!”  One by one, the ranks of the Northman army readied their weapons and armor.  Heldorm let a ghostly, amber aura of protective magic seep from his skin into those warriors around him.  Ioemir drew his long sword and awaited an all too familiar moment.  Beside Heldorm, Aelwyl mumbled a silent prayer to Tunare, causing the Wood Elf’s skin to begin to shimmer.  A short distance away, Blorg regarded his borrowed sword with disdain.  <br />
	<br />
“Eh, diz sword too tiny.”  The Ogre tossed the sword into the snow and walked up to a nearby tree, still young.  With a short roar, Blorg ripped the tree from the ground, much to the amazement of those near him, and carried it back to the line.  “Yeah, diz much better.”<br />
	<br />
From the Gnoll side of the battlefield, there came the sudden sound of a great rushing of air, as if an enormous flock of birds had just taken flight.  <br />
	<br />
“Arrows incoming!”  The Northman scout shouted.  But before anyone could respond, the arrows were beginning their descent upon the unprepared army of Halas. <br />
<br />
(To Be Continued . . .)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">With blinding speed, a shower of wood and pointed steel rained down; several Barbarian warriors fell where they stood.  Fortunately for Heldorm and his companions, the Gnolls’ aim was not very true, as the first volley had overshot the first few rows of the line.  Peeking out from his spot behind a boulder, Ecbus was greeted by a stray arrow landing with a loud, reverberating twang inches from his head.  With a yelp, the Gnome quickly darted back behind the boulder and pressed himself to the rock.<br />
	<br />
“Get your shields up!” commanded Lysbith.  A majority of the Army quickly obliged, just in time to deflect a second volley.  Afterwards, a great howl arose from the Gnoll army, followed shortly by several lines of their ranks charging across the snowy valley.<br />
	<br />
“Return fire!” Lysbith shouted again, promptly followed by the sharp sound of hundreds of arrows shooting straight out across the battlefield.  Moments later, a large chunk of the oncoming Gnoll line fell lifeless, but hundreds still swiftly closed in.<br />
	<br />
“For the Kol-Hurn!” Kylan shouted, commanding his horse to carry him across the valley floor.  Behind him, the defenders of Halas followed, summoning forth a deafening thunder that the valley had never before heard.  Northman armor and flesh hit that of Gnoll, bursting the floodgates of carnage.  From his steed, Kylan sliced through a dozen Gnoll warriors then skewered two on his long sword, before effortlessly flinging them off.  Elsewhere, in the sea of battle, Heldorm swung Invictus as if it were an extension of his arm; crushed bodies of Gnolls flew in all directions as the war maul hit them with a disembodied shrieking.  Joining Heldorm in the swinging of blunt objects, Blorg batted away yelping Gnoll warriors like thrown rubber balls in a child’s game with his newly acquired “weapon.”<br />
	<br />
“Hehe, hey diz kinda fun!” Blorg mused to himself as he sent ten more Gnolls flying.   <br />
  <br />
During a rare pause in the battle, Heldorm caught Aelwyl out of the corner of his eye.  On all sides of her, Gnoll warriors were closing in.  Just as the shaman was about to come to her aid, a wreath of thorns sprouted from around her body.  Unfortunately for the attacking Gnolls, they realized this just as they lunged at the Wood Elf.  The wolf men yelped in pain as thousands of razor-sharp thorns dug into their flesh – Ioemir rode up on Gypsywynd moments later to put them out of their misery.<br />
	<br />
In speaking of Ioemir, some sort of transformation began to overtake the Feir’Dal champion.  Each Gnoll that fell to his blade seemed to further awaken something that had lain dormant within him, as if the once sheathed claws of a fearsome predator began to sink themselves in once again.  Upon every blow he delivered, Ioemir drove himself deeper and deeper into an unwelcome state of bloodlust.<br />
	<br />
From behind the front lines, there suddenly came a low rumbling sound.  Combat had come to a temporary stand still, as both armies matched one another strike for strike.  Aelwyl and Heldorm took the moment to deliver healing magic to several groups of Northman warriors.  From the settling powdered snow, there emerged an enormous wooden device on wheels.  A team of Gnolls pulled the construction to a stop just behind the back lines of the Blackburrow offensive.<br />
	<br />
“What in the name of our ancestors?!” pondered Kylan.<br />
	<br />
“I don’t know,” Heldorm responded with concern, “but if it’s made by Gnolls, I’m willin’ to bet it’s somethin’ nasty.”<br />
	<br />
A distance flash of fire sprang to life in the vicinity of the Gnoll contraption.  There arose a short outburst of yapping and barking from around the machine, as Tranixx himself assisted two other large Gnolls with something.<br />
	<br />
“Erm, Kylan, ye might want to pull yer men back.  I got a real bad feelin’ about this.”<br />
	<br />
“Yes,” Kylan nodded, taking a quick survey of where his troops were positioned, “I agree . . .  Pull back men!  All forces pull back!”  <br />
<br />
Slowly, and with some hesitation, the Halas forces began to pull back toward Halas.  But it was too late.  There came a great snapping sound from the rear of the Blackburrow lines.  A gigantic arm attached to the wooden Gnoll device sprang forward, hurling a huge, flaming mass toward the Northman army.  Kylan wanted to shout out some kind of order, but nothing came to him.  Instead, he could only watch helplessly as a large group of his men exploded in flame when the fireball struck, almost knocking everyone to their knees.  The agonizing screams of dying Northman could barely be heard over the vehement howling of victory rising from the wolf men.<br />
	<br />
“Damn them!”  Lysbith brought her horse up to a better vantage point, overlooking the Gnoll army.  “We need to destroy that monstrosity before it kills us all!”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, couple a archers with good eyes could pick those big Gnolls operatin’ it off.  Hmmm, speakin’ of which, where’s Talis?  Haven’t seen him the whole fight.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir trotted up to find his companions searching from something.<br />
	<br />
“Ioemir, ye seen Talis by any chance?”<br />
	<br />
“Not since he let me borrow Gypsywynd.”  The Wood Elf warrior joined the search.  “Talis?!” he shouted.  “Where are you?!”<br />
	<br />
He was shortly answered when the sharp whistle of an arrow tore through the air in the direction of the Gnoll encampment.  All those on the ground followed the arrow from behind a nearby hilltop tree, fly out toward the enemy lines at an unnatural speed, leaving a smoke-thin corkscrew trail of energy behind it.  The arrow found its mark a mere moment later in the chest of one the large Gnolls preparing to reload the war machine.  Before the other large Gnoll could react to what had just happened, he too was felled by another arrow.  Now it was the Northman army’s turn to cheer.<br />
	<br />
“I’d say we found the ranger, lad.”  Heldorm took his place beside Kylan and Lysbith.<br />
	<br />
“Alright!”  Kylan redirected his celebrating troops’ attention.  “Now’s our chance!  Their lines have thinned in the chaos, and the machine is unprotected for now.  We need to get to it before they reform!  Follow me!” <br />
	<br />
The Halas offensive started their charge.  The Blackburrow front lines, thinned by panick, were easily mowed down.  As the Gnolls regrouped, however, the charging Northman seemed to run into a wall of opposition.  Then begun the most intense battle yet.  Gnoll and Northman alike fell in alarming numbers.  Far above and behind the carnage, Talis continued to pick off any Gnoll brave enough to wander up to the siege weapon; soon, they got the hint and stayed well clear of it.<br />
	<br />
“This is not good!” shouted Kylan as he watched the fall of one of his men, stuck full of arrows and with two Gnolls clutched onto him with their teeth.  “We are losing too many men, and the ranger can’t hold them off from their machine forever.”<br />
	<br />
“Should we fall back?” asked Lysbith.<br />
	<br />
“No!  If we fall back now, we may as well lay down our weapons and let the mangy bastards have Halas.”<br />
	<br />
No sooner had those words left his lips, than a ropy tendril of green energy swiftly wormed its way above the Halas line and into that of the Gnolls.  Dozens of man wolves began to choke and vomit before falling lifeless to the ground.  <br />
	<br />
“What in the name of –“ Kylan turned swiftly behind him to behold a group of hazy figures standing where his army was mere moments before.<br />
	<br />
“It’s the Shamans of Justice, sir!” the Wolves of the North scout shouted.<br />
	<br />
“I knew they’d show,” said Heldorm with a satisfied smirk.  “We shamans have our own timing, and it’s always just right.”<br />
	<br />
Amidst the cheers of their fellow Northmen, the shamans let forth a small army of spectral wolves, flesh-tearing teeth exposed and red eyes blazing like tiny fireballs.  The ghostly hounds leapt swiftly and mercilessly upon their Gnoll targets, biting and scratching many down within moments.  Inspired so much by the display, Heldorm reached down into a seldom-opened bag and withdrew a pale yellow bracer.  He quickly snapped it on, the bracer seemingly shaping itself to fit the girth of his wrist.<br />
	<br />
“What is that?” Ioemir asked after cutting down an attacking Gnoll.<br />
	<br />
“Just a lil’ gift from a friend who visited Kunark.  I’ve been dyin’ to try this thing out.  Was gonna use it on that Dark Elf back in the Commons, but never got the chance – more’s the pity.”<br />
	<br />
After a second wave of sickening magic from the shamans, the remaining Blackburrow army began to retreat.  Tranixx barked and slashed at some of his retreating comrades in anger, but it was of no use, the Gnolls had had enough.  Heldorm picked out a solitary fleeing Gnoll and held the bracer up in its direction.  The surface of the bracer shimmered briefly before shooting out tiny spirits of frost and ice that slammed into the Gnoll’s body, knocking it lifeless and covered with frost, to the ground.    <br />
<br />
The Northman army let loose a deafening cry of victory as they finished off the last few, overly-brave Gnoll warriors.  Kylan dismounted and turned to greet the newly arrived shamans.  Before he took his second step, however, Tranixx suddenly pounced upon his back, knocking him off his feet.  The two wrestled for a moment, but Kylan was able to shrug the Gnoll off and get to his feet.  Nearby Northman warriors began to step in to Kylan’s aid.<br />
	<br />
“*Bark* What’s wrong, Kylan?” Tranixx asked mockingly.  “Are you such a coward that you have to have your bodyguards finish off one poor, little Gnoll?”<br />
	<br />
Kylan motioned for his encroaching comrades to halt.  “I’m no coward, you mangy curr.  I’ll have your head for that.”<br />
	<br />
“*Growl* Ohhh?  Words, words.  They sound so brave.  But that’s all they are . . . words.  Or are you man enough to act upon them?”<br />
	<br />
Kylan calmed the tempest that was brewing inside him.  His blood still burned slightly from the adrenaline rush of battle, but the attack on his honor ignited it once again.  “Very well, Tranixx, we’ll play it your way.”  Kylan turned his head, still looking at the Gnoll leader.  “No matter what happens, no one is to interfere!”  The Northman army apprehensively backed away to give Kylan room.  Heldorm’s companions, including Talis (whom had just returned from his perch), gravitated around him to watch the spectacle.   <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">(Long overdue, but nevertheless, here it is!  Hope you enjoy! :) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Tranixx snarled before laughing quietly and raising his right hand high enough for all to see; on each of the Gnoll’s fingers, were silver covers.  With a sudden, metallic sliding sound, six-inch claws sprang from his fingertips.  Kylan remained unshaken.  The Barbarian dropped his two handed sword into the snow and produced two dueling blades from his waist.  With a swift and vicious motion, Tranixx leapt toward Kylan.  The two met and grappled for a moment, Kylan pushing the Gnoll away from his body as drool-covered fangs snapped and barked at his throat.  Tranixx slowly pressed his razor covered hand toward Kylan’s neck, but was thrown down at the last moment.<br />
	<br />
This time, Kylan led the attack; he cut at Tranixx with two, air-slicing slashes that left thin ribbons of bright silver behind them.  But the Gnoll deflected each attack with ease.  Seizing the brief moment after a parried attack, Kylan kicked out at Tranixx, who was knocked head over heels some distances away, landing on his knees.  The Northman warrior sprinted to the dazed Gnoll and raised both blades in preparation for a finishing down stroke.  Before he could deliver such a blow, however, Tranixx suddenly lashed out and swiped hard at Kylan, tearing five long gashes up his chest.  Kylan let out a cry of sheer agony as he felt warm blood pump from the wound.  Lysbith gasped slightly and started toward Kylan, but stopped herself as per her comrade’s wishes.<br />
	<br />
Tranixx chuckled quietly once again and flung off tiny strips of Kylan’s flesh from the claw tips.  In his delight, the Gnoll bit as hard as he could into the Northman’s leg.  Kylan reached a point beyond normal pain; the world around him flashed white for a moment before becoming shaky and blurry.  An omnipresent surge of heat flowed through his veins, as the Barbarian staggered slightly.  By chance, Kylan looked down to see Tranixx clutched to his leg by the jaws.  Anger momentarily overcoming him, Kylan stabbed down as hard as he could with one of his dueling blades into the Gnoll’s back.  Tranixx released his grip to let out a loud cacophony of yelping.  His dagger still planted firmly in Tranixx’s back, Kylan lifted the Gnoll up to eye level and sunk the other dagger into the beast’s throat.  The Northman caught a last flickering light emit from Tranixx’s eyes as the dying man wolf gurgled out his final breath.  With strength quickly fading, Kylan let Tranixx’s body slide off of his blades and slump onto the ground, stirring up tiny eddies of snow.  Kylan stared speechless at his foe’s corpse before slowly turning to his comrades.  The world around him faded in and out, finally draining all consciousness.  Kylan collapsed and blacked out just in time to see his brethren rushing toward him.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
“Hey,” Heldorm’s voice sounded like it was coming form leagues away.  “Kylan?  Ye okay?”  The world came back to Kylan O’Danos much as it had left him – in a faded blur.  This time, however, his surroundings rushed into him instead of away; the force of their impact hit the Wolves of the North Co-Pack Leader like an avalanche. <br />
	<br />
Kylan groaned as he sat up from his bed, but an immense pain coming from his bandaged chest knocked him back down.  Taking a quick look around the room he was in, Kylan determined that he was back in his personal quarters.<br />
	<br />
“Good to see ye up and runnin’ again.”  Heldorm examined the bandaging, intermittently rubbing thin coatings of a balm-like substance.<br />
	<br />
“How much do you remember?”  Lysbith asked, coming up to her comrade’s side.<br />
	<br />
“Everything,” Kylan groaned.<br />
	<br />
“Well, it’s good that you are alright.”  Lysbith smiled and firmly squeezed Kylan’s wrist; the warmth of her body sent a slight soothing wave through his body.<br />
	<br />
Heldorm cleared his throat.  “Pardon to be interruptin’ anything, but ye need to take it easy for a while.  The other shamans and I’ve been healin’ yer wounds all we can, but the nasty one on yer chest’ll take a lot more time.  Ye may even have it the rest of yer life.”<br />
	<br />
Kylan lifted his head and carefully removed one of the long bandages covering his chest.  The portion of the wound it revealed was a healthy, bright, pinkish-red.  “There’s no infection?”<br />
	<br />
“Nay, that was the easy part.  Still gotta take it easy fer the time being, though.”<br />
	<br />
“Well,” said Kylan grunting and struggling to his feet, “if it’s not infected, then it’s just fine.”<br />
	<br />
“Kylan!” Lysbith helped support him.  “You really should listen to Heldorm.”<br />
	<br />
“I am, and his advice is greatly appreciated.  But I have men to see, and a battlefield to tour.”<br />
	<br />
“Oh, by the Tribunal!”  Heldorm stood, sighing.  “I know it’s tradition and all, but ye really shouldn’t goin’ anywhere too far in yer state.  Hell, ye probably shouldn’t even be standin’.”<br />
	<br />
“I feel my strength returning quickly, Heldorm.”  Kylan put his hand on the shaman’s shoulder.  “Thank you, my friend.  I am indebted to you and to the shamans of Halas.  But trust me, I know my limits.  When I feel overcome, I swear to you I will rest.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm slowly conceded with a nod.  He and Lysbith followed Kylan out of his chamber and into the courtyard of Halas, where the surviving members of his army awaited him.  As soon as Kylan beheld his troops, the entire company stood to attention and saluted him. <br />
	<br />
“We knew ye’d never listen to our advice, so we arranged a lil’ somethin’ for ye – kind of a ‘welcome back’ salute.”<br />
	<br />
Kylan said nothing for a few moments.  Instead, he just scanned the crowd and smiled.  “So many . . . so many brave sons and daughters to be blessed with.”  The wounded warrior took a few, slow steps forward and nodded to his surviving generals – there were two.  General Fyvus McGuire stepped forward, holding a large sword.  <br />
	<br />
“Sir, we retrieved your sword from the battlefield after you collapsed.  I return it to you now.”  <br />
	<br />
“Thank you, General McGuire.”  Kylan took the sword, its weight bearing down on him painfully heavy.  “How many of our brethren fell?”<br />
	<br />
“Not sure exactly.  We haven’t toured the battlefield yet, not without you.  But I suspect two thousand . . . at least.”<br />
	<br />
“Two thousand,” Kylan pondered the number in his head a moment.  “Two thousand brave souls dead . . . and for what?”<br />
	<br />
“Sir?”  General McGuire asked, somewhat dumbstruck by the question.<br />
	<br />
“Oh, oh nothing.  I was just pondering to myself the loss.  We shall tour the battlefield shortly, General.  Make the preparations immediately.”<br />
	<br />
“Yes, Sir!”  The general saluted and stepped back into the crowd.<br />
	<br />
Kylan turned to Lysbith and handed her his sword.  “Still not ready to carry it just yet.  Please return this to my chambers.”<br />
	<br />
“Of course, Kylan.”  Lysbith smiled warmly and granted his request.<br />
	<br />
“Hey,” Heldorm approached Kylan.  “So what was that ‘and what for?’ remark about?”<br />
	<br />
“It’s just that –“ Kylan sighed and closed his eyes.  “When I killed Tranixx, I looked into his eyes just as he died.  And . . .and I didn’t see a blood-thirsty Gnoll.  I saw a living, breathing being that I just . . . slaughtered.  I let my honor and pride blind me with rage.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm listened intently, but was speechless.  Here, the co-leader of the warrior clan of Halas was unburdening himself of regrets that, heretofore, would not have even been an issue.<br />
	<br />
“So, ye wished to have let Tranixx live?”<br />
	<br />
“I don’t know, Heldorm.  If you would have asked me in any other time, I would have enthusiastically said no.  But now?  There was just something so . . . afraid and mortal about the look in his eye when I sunk that blade into his throat.”  Kylan turned to Heldorm and summoned a faint smile.  “I don’t know anymore, Heldorm, I just don’t know.”                           <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
“Are ye gonna tell Lysbith about this?”<br />
	<br />
“No, no, no, I could never do that.  Not now, at least.  She’s so fierce in her convictions.  No one believes more fully in the honor and defense of Halas as she . . . not even myself, I dare say.  No, telling her this now would crush her.”  Kylan grew silent for a moment.<br />
	<br />
“Ye have feelins fer her, don’t ye?” Heldorm asked bluntly.<br />
	<br />
Kylan regarded the shaman as if he had just blurted out a criminal accusation.  <br />
	<br />
“If ye do, it’s nothin’ to be ashamed of.  A wise man once told me not to bottle up yer feelins.  If ye see an opportunity for love, ye need to snatch it up before it’s taken away from ye.”<br />
	<br />
Kylan sustained his shocked expression.  “Heldorm, I –“<br />
	<br />
“Kylan O’Danos,” a calm, female voice said from behind the warrior; he turned to behold the soft face of Feodorna.<br />
	<br />
“Oh, greetings, Venerable one,” Kylan saluted the shamaness.  “I was hoping to meet with you again so I could properly thank you for your help on the field earlier.”<br />
	<br />
“No thanks is needed, Kylan.  However your gratitude is most welcome.  What I really wanted to discuss was this generations-old rift between the priests and warriors of Halas.  I, and the other shamans, feel that it has remained an obstacle before us for far too long.”<br />
	<br />
Warmed by these words, Kylan smiled and nodded.  “As do I, Feodorna.  As do I.  I have not discussed these feelings with Lysbith or my generals yet, but I am confident an alliance of our powers could benefit this fair city greatly.  It is time we set aside our differences in philosophy and focused on unity for the greater good.”<br />
	<br />
“Well spoken, Kylan.  There is much to discuss . . . but at another time.  For now, we should tend to the wounded and honor those whom have fallen.”  The shamaness took a bow, and then her leave.  A moment later, General McGuire informed Kylan that the preparations had been made for the touring of the battlefield.  Lysbith had by then emerged and accompanied her comrades back to the place of slaughter.<br />
<br />
<br />

	<br />
“Are you sure you don’t want something to eat?” Captain Moonwind pushed a bowl of herb soup before his guest.  “After all you’ve been through, I’d think you’d want to keep your strength up.”<br />
	<br />
“No,” the guest said weakly.  “But I thank you.  My appetite still has not returned.”<br />
	<br />
“I’d imagine.  Seeing your hometown destroyed like that would drain much of my desires as well.”  The Wood Elf captain sighed and started for the door.  “Well, if there’s anything at all you need, just ask me or one of my men.  For the meantime, though, get some rest.”<br />
	<br />
The guest said his name was Gaelin.  The Elves of Kelethin found him stumbling up to the main lift the night before.  He told the guards that he was a Nithmiel refugee, but, apart from obvious emotional damage, he escaped unscathed.  While he refused any food, the refugee more than welcomed secure lodgings, and seemed to bear an unusual curiosity of the Feir’Dal capital.<br />
	<br />
The tired refugee stood and turned to the guard watching over him.  “Have there been any other survivors?”	<br />
<br />
“Only a few.  One died the other day, and the others are still bed-ridden.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve heard of an ailing infant here.  Was she too a survivor of Nithmiel?”<br />
<br />
“Who, Ioemir’s daughter?  No, she was born sick, the poor child.  Her mother had a difficult childbirth, but is recovering.  The child’s still gravely ill, however.  Her father’s out now, trying to find a cure; I only pray to Tunare that he succeeds.  <br />
<br />
“Actually, that large house in the west corner just outside is where she lives.”  The guard pointed to the outside and slightly to his right.<br />
<br />
“Ah,” the refugee seemed quite fascinated.  “Speaking of the outside, I feel the fresh air would do me well.  I shall step out for a few moments.”<br />
<br />
“Very well,” the guard replied apprehensively, “but be careful out there.  One false step and it’s a long way to the ground.”<br />
<br />
The weakened Wood Elf stepped out and immediately turned toward Ioemir’s house.  Cautiously he approached, mindful of any guards or priests that may be standing vigil.  When he saw no one, Gaelin quietly slipped in through the doorway.  In a sturdy-framed bed before him, lay a Feir’Dal woman clutching a resting infant.  Smiling with sinister satisfaction, the visitor’s image shimmered and wavered, finally revealing the true form of Meklozanth.  The Dark Elf walked quietly up to the side of the bed and knelt slightly to examine the child’s features.  <br />
<br />
“Excellent,” the Teir’Dal mused to himself.  Awakened by this statement, the mother sleepily opened her eyes.  She wanted to scream upon seeing the dark blue face looming over her, but a flash of bright purple arrested every movement in her body.  <br />
<br />
“Shhhhh,” Meklozanth put his index finger up to his lips.  “There’s no need for that, my dear.  You should rest.”  The Dark Elf blew out a thin stream of green vapor into the mouth of the Wood Elf woman, who suddenly began to choke and convulse.  “Forever.”<br />
<br />
Meklozanth watched with cold indifference as the Feir’Dal woman gasped out her last breath and sank lifeless back into the bed.  The Dark Elf then scooped up the infant, which, after realizing that it was no longer in its mother’s arms, began to cry.  As if summoned by the child’s call, a priestess carrying a small pile of cloth suddenly entered the house.<br />
<br />
“M’Lady Nao’lya, I’ve brought you some –“ but the priestess gasped in horror when she saw Meklozanth.  Before the Dark Elf could lunge to stop her, the priestess darted from the house yelling for the guards.  As soon as he stepped out of the doorway, Meklozanth was greeted by three Feir’Dal champions.<br />
<br />
“Return the child,” snapped Captain Moonwind, drawing his sword.  “Now!”<br />
<br />
Meklozanth stood his ground a moment before smirking fiendishly.  He outstretched his hand and shot forth a swift cloud of blackness that engulfed the oncoming guards.  Choking and blinded, the Wood Elf guards held their ground, allowing Meklozanth to transform himself into a floating, hooded specter.  With a short cackle of delight, the specter glided over the nearby railing and down to the forest floor, where it returned to its true Teir’Dal form.  As he strode away from the Wood Elf capital, Meklozanth glanced over his shoulder from time to time to watch for pursuers – none yet, but soon enough they would come.<br />
<br />
Minions, the necromancer called telepathically, to me!  Moments later, two skeletal warriors clattered up to him.  Meklozanth turned one last time to behold the main lift of Kelethin lowering to the ground; upon it, stood a small squad of Wood Elf champions.  <br />
<br />
“Deal with them.  Aid my departure from this place as long as possible.”<br />
The undead warriors obliged, clattering toward the approaching Feir’Dal squad with mindless ferocity.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The mournful howl of Northman ceremonial horns shook the very cold from the evening air.  The horns then fell silent, casting an invisible blanket of stillness over the valley of fallen warriors.  Kylan and Lysbith slowly made their way down the snow-lined Halas ramp toward the valley leading to Blackburrow.  All along the way, Kylan counted every lifeless face he saw, each one taking small bites out of his soul as he passed.<br />
	<br />
Some distance behind Kylan, Heldorm and his companions also made their way through the frozen sea of butchery.  All around them, the families of fallen warriors wept and sang as they recovered personal possessions.  Aelwyl kept her attention locked on the ground, not daring to look at anyone or anything.  Curiosity finally got the better of her, however, and she lifted her head for only a moment – long enough to observe an older Barbarian woman, sitting in the snow beside a corpse of man.  The old woman just sat motionless, staring blankly ahead with small streams of tears reflecting the sun’s final rays.  No artisan of any race in any age could possibly attempt to reproduce the feeling of empty sadness and loss that the canvas of this woman’s face painted.  Aelwyl averted her gaze just as she caught the old woman’s attention.<br />
	<br />
“The fires’ll burn bright tonight,” Heldorm said to Ioemir as they continued on the tour.<br />
	<br />
“What’s that?”<br />
	<br />
“The Kol-Hurn burn their fallen warriors.  The flames help carry their souls into the heavens.”<br />
	<br />
“The Kol-Hurn, is that the name of your people?”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, tis our true name; it means ‘from the forge.’  We believe that we were creations from The Tribunal’s forge, and the first Humans on Norrath.  ‘Barbarian,’ ‘Northman,’ these’re all outsider names we’ve kinda adopted.  There’s been talk of gettin’ back in touch with the old ways recently, though.  Will be good for us, I think.  Moral and cultural pride’s all but hit rock bottom.”<br />
	<br />
A short distance behind Heldorm, Talis watched Ioemir intently, as if waiting for some specific moment.  When the party reached the opening of the main valley, Ioemir branched off slightly from the others to survey the open battlefield.  The Wood Elf champion likened the scene before him to a frozen white sea, spotted with innumerable islands of corpses.  Ioemir had many times before seen this landscape.  The faces changed, but the ends were always the same.  The Feir’Dal inhaled a lungful of the evening air, catching every familiar scent, every reminder of a life long since left behind – but not entirely forgotten.<br />
	<br />
“You know that scent well, don’t you, Ioemir?” Talis asked walking up behind him.  Ioemir turned to the ranger and gave him a quizzical look.<br />
	<br />
“The scent of death; the nameless corpses piled around you.  Just as if you were walking into the past.”<br />
	<br />
“What are you implying?” Ioemir asked defensively.<br />
	<br />
“I imply nothing but the truth.”  Talis walked up to the body of a nearby Northman warrior.  “You see this man’s face, Ioemir?  You don’t know his name, nor care . . . much like at Surefall, wouldn’t you say?”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir shook his head, the memory of Surefall leaping back to him like a stalking predator.  “No . . . not the same.  Why?  Why are you doing this?”  By this time, Heldorm and Aelwyl had picked up on the conversation and approached.<br />
	<br />
“Blue skies with only a hint of clouds whispering through them,” began Talis.  “The weather was warm, but the treetops provided cool shade for those below.  The council had just finished its daily forum; further living quarters were to be built soon for a recent influx into the community.  For the first time in a long time, Half Elves felt safe from the cold hearts of others.<br />
	<br />
“But then it came, like a thunderbolt, sudden and swift; twenty men on horseback stormed through the hillside passage.  What few guards we had were struck down before they could draw their swords.  The druids and rangers in the town proper were able to slay a few of the invaders, but they too were soon overcome.  And some distance away, in a more secluded part of the glade, a father was teaching his son how to fire a bow.  The man was gentle, yet firm.  He was a proud man – proud of his accomplishments as a woodsman, and especially of his family.  Nevertheless, this man suddenly heard the sound of heavy hoof beats coming nearer.  From out of the woods, came the invaders, lead by a man clad in red and gold armor and carrying a spear.  The father told his son to run as he drew his bow.  The young man began to flee, looking over his shoulder the entire time.  He watched his father fell some of the riders with his arrows, but eventually the invaders caught up to him.  The brave man fought them off as long as he could, but his son turned back once last time to see his father speared in the back by the lead rider.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir stood silent, eyes wandering between Talis and the ground.<br />
	<br />
“The young man escaped,” Talis continued.  “He hid in the recesses of the falls until the riders left.  But when he re-emerged, he saw a scene of matchless barbarism, slaughter in its purest form; all he knew, all he loved . . . lay bleeding on the ground before him.  The young man walked through the dead, much as we do now, and saw the faces lying there – friends, relatives, shopkeepers . . . his father.  And the other face, the face burned into his mind – that of the lead raider who speared his father.”<br />
	<br />
“Ioemir?” Aelwyl asked in hushed disbelief.<br />
	<br />
“Yes,” Talis nodded as he approached Ioemir with a sour look, “Ioemir.  But the Half Elves had another name for him – Vien’luaei, ‘the butcher’.”  <br />
<br />
The ranger’s anger peaked, prompting him to draw his swords from their sheaths.  Blue-white electricity arced and snaked its way across the gleaming steel surfaces of the blades.  “You see these, Vien’luaei?  They have names, as well – Swiftwind and Earthcaller.  And they vow, as I do, that you shall not draw blood from another half-breed.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir instinctively drew his sword and parried two vicious blows from Talis, each sword fall striking with the distant sound of thunder.<br />
<br />
“Enough!” Heldorm shouted, pushing off both swords with Invictus.  “Have ye two lost yer minds?!”  Talis and Ioemir slowly relented, lowering their weapons.  “Fer the love of all that’s right, just look around ye!  Thousands died earlier today, on both sides!  When I was young, I always loved comin’ out here and watchin’ the fresh snow cover the whole valley.  Now just look at it!  Ye can barely see any white – it’s all covered with blood and the dead.  Can’t ye see past yer hatred to realize what’s really goin’ on?  Hasn't enough blood been shed here already?”  Heldorm sighed and threw his hands up briefly in frustration.  “But if ye must carry through with this futile display, then so be it, I’m not gonna stop ye.  Talis, I hope killin’ Ioemir satisfies yer thirst for vengeance.  And Ioemir, ye’ll surely be seeing yer daughter soon.”  The shaman turned his back on the two elves as not to stand witness.  “Carry on, then.”<br />
<br />
Talis and Ioemir regarded each other and slowly sheathed their weapons.  Upon hearing metal on leather, Heldorm turned back to see the peaceful resolution.  “Alright then, let’s get back to honorin’ the dead – Tribunal knows we’ve already insulted them enough.” <br />
<br />
Down in the great valley, near the former Gnoll front, Lysbith and Kylan stood over the piles of freezing bodies like cemetery effigies.  <br />
<br />
“All for what?” Kylan mumbled quietly to himself.<br />
<br />
“What was that?” Lysbith turned her attention toward the ice-covered body of Tranixx.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” Kylan walked toward the fallen Gnoll commander.  “Nothing at all.”  The Co-Pack leader knelt beside Tranixx’s corpse and fought the overwhelming instinct to look at the gaping wound he had caused in the Gnoll’s neck.  But his instincts overcame him.  As he stared at the wound, a small voice from inside him began to creep into his mind, like some insect of the conscience ascending from the soul's foundations. <br />
<br />
It had to be done, the small voice consoled.                  <br />
	<br />
Did it? Kylan asked the voice.<br />
	<br />
Yes.  Search your heart.  You know it to be so.<br />
	<br />
So innocent, continued the warrior, staring into Tranixx’s dead eyes, so peaceful and harmless lying there.<br />
	<br />
He was a monster.  Only death would stop him.<br />
	<br />
Kylan offered no rebuttal; he knew the voice spoke the truth, but was still struggling to accept it.<br />
	<br />
How many?” the voice finally asked.<br />
	<br />
How many what?<br />
	<br />
How many of your men and women died this day?<br />
	<br />
I have no number for you.  Too many.<br />
	<br />
Yes, and how many more would have fallen had you not slain Tranixx?  A thousand more?  All of Halas?<br />
	<br />
No, we would have beaten them back.<br />
	<br />
Would you have?  Would the walls of Halas have stood up to the power of their siege machines?  And the Gnoll warriors – you saw their numbers.  You would slay one and a half dozen more would take its place.  Six Gnolls for every soul in Halas.  Is that what you wished to die for, Kylan?  The destruction of Halas?  The genocide of the entire Kol-Hurn race?<br />
	<br />
No, replied Kylan, his mind becoming clear.  Halas will never fall as long as I live.<br />
	<br />
Do you see now? asked the voice, beginning to drain away like cool stream water slipping through the fingers.<br />
	<br />
Yes, I see now.  Kylan said and stood tall.<br />
	<br />
“See what now?” a puzzled Lysbith asked her comrade.  “Do you speak with ghosts?”<br />
	<br />
“No, no.  I was simply . . . receiving the answer to a question that had vexed me of late.  But it’s alright now.”  Kylan smiled and clasped Lysbith’s hands in his.  “I know my purpose once again, and that’s all that matters.  For now, however, we have many souls to aid.”<br />
	<br />
Lysbith nodded and returned Kylan’s smile.  Together, they began to sing the ancient song of the fallen warrior as the bodies of the slain were collected onto enormous funeral pyres and set ablaze.  Others soon joined them in the lament.  Far above them, the aurora shimmered brighter than it had in generations, almost outshining the great fires below.  The evening sky echoed with the rushing sound of thousands of souls, passing through the prismatic gates of the aurora, and into the endless Halls of Justice, where the Tribunal stood as eternal sentinels.     <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Later in the evening, Ioemir was found staring down into a tall ale mug at McAndrew’s Axe ‘n Ale.<br />
	<br />
“Was about to send out a search party after ye, lad,” Heldorm said, pulling up a stool beside the Wood Elf.<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm,” Ioemir muttered, shaking his head slowly, “please.  I don’t feel like talking to or seeing anyone right now.”<br />
	<br />
“Ioemir,” Aelwyl said in a half-disgusted, half-shocked voice.  “How could you?  I – I never knew you were capable of such things.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir took a deep swallow of his ale and sighed.  “Keep the bloodlines pure at all costs.  Those were my orders.  The fidelity of the Feir’Dal race took precedence over everything else – even the life of another.  We’d been trying to eradicate a large group of half-breeds for some time, but they were always one step ahead of us.”<br />
	<br />
“Who is ‘we’?” asked Aelwyl.<br />
	<br />
“The Order of the Red Pine.  A secret sect of Kelethin champions that my father helped found long ago.  Only the elite of the elite are able to join, and only then by personal invitation.  Anyway, along with elitist status came elitist ideology – purity of heart, purity of mind, purity of body, and most important of all, purity of bloodline. <br />
<br />
“When we first learned of half breeds, everything we stood for was in jeopardy.  There were already some small groups of Humans in the Qeynos region opposing the Half Elves, so in our delusion we saw this as all the justification we needed to start our crusade.  Season after season, we hunted down as many as we could.  We’d only managed to eradicate a handful of half-breed families, but then we discovered the location of their sanctuary – Surefall Glades, mere miles from the Human opposition in Qeynos.<br />
<br />
“Victory lay right before us, so close we could practically reach out and touch it.  So we struck . . . or rather, I was ordered to strike.  Blinded by pride and power, I arrogantly donned the red armor of our order.  I wanted the half-breeds to see who their executioner was before they could see no more.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir finished his ale and continued.  “After the deed was done, my men and I returned to Kelethin, where we were greeted by the Order as heroes.  The seasons passed, and I returned to my normal duties as a Champion of Tunare.  Then the inevitable happened – our order was discovered.  Actually, the timing proved quite serendipitous.  Around that same time, a long-buried secret was unearthed concerning one of the Order’s current members, as well as one of their former.  Had this secret uncovered itself at any other time during the Order, this person would have been stripped of his status immediately, and no doubt exiled . . . or worse.  But as it happened, the true origin of this person and his bloodline was discovered just as the Order was being dissolved by the Kelethin hierarchy.”<br />
<br />
“True origin?” Aelwyl studied Ioemir.<br />
<br />
“Yes.  As it turns out, one of the Order’s original members was, of all things, a half-breed.  And so too was his son.”<br />
<br />
“Ye mean, yer father . . .”<br />
<br />
“Was a half-breed, that’s right.  And thus, his son also carried Half Elf blood in his veins.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl and Heldorm regarded each other in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Ironic, isn’t it?  The one thing that I had been taught to hate and to destroy for so many seasons, stared back at me whenever I looked into the face of a mirror or into a pool of clear water.  All that time, I could never kill the demon, because he always rode and walked right beside me.”  Ioemir let out a short chuckle.  “So I suppose Talis and I were long-lost brothers after all, or something to that effect.”<br />
<br />
“Say where is Talis?” Heldorm made a quick scan of the tavern.<br />
<br />
“Gone,” Ioemir stood from his stool.  “He rode out with Gypsywynd only an hour ago.  And I don’t blame him.  There is no way we could stand and fight together now.  Why should he help me save my daughter when I have taken so much from him?”<br />
<br />
“Ioemir, I . . .” but Aelwyl could only shake her head and give the Feir’Dal champion a sad, distant look.<br />
<br />
“There’s no need to say anything, Aelwyl.  There’s nothing to say.  I am very tired, my friends.  I must bid you both goodnight for now.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl and Heldorm watched in silence as Ioemir slowly ascended the stairs to his room.<br />
<br />
<br />
The glimmering ivory face of Luclin had just begun to wane – a small, black blemish on otherwise perfect skin.  Far below, another face looked up from across the small gulf of empty space.  It was the face of a Northman, proud yet contemplative; his thin, closely-shaven beard and mustache began to collect tiny flakes of snow.<br />
<br />
“Heldorm?” Aelwyl asked, as she joined the Northman on the balcony of McAndrew’s.  “What are you doing out here in the cold?”<br />
<br />
“Just thinkin’.  Thinkin’ about that business between Ioemir and Talis.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, it is quite disturbing, isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“Aye, almost as disturbin’ as when Talis told me the first time.  Still kinda jarrin’ to hear it all come out so bluntly.”<br />
<br />
“You knew?” Aelwyl asked in alarm.<br />
<br />
“Aye, Talis told me when I first met him back in Rivervale.”<br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you say something sooner?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, why should I’ve?  No need to go and open ol’ wounds if there wasn’t any need to.  It seemed like Ioemir and the ranger were becomin’ friends, but I guess it was just Talis watchin’ Ioemir as some sorta test or somethin’.  Besides, quite frankly I had more pressin’ matters on my mind.”    <br />
<br />
Aelwyl joined Heldorm in gazing up at Luclin.  “What are you looking for up there?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno.  Answers maybe.”<br />
<br />
“Answers to what?”<br />
<br />
“To this whole mess we’re all in.  To why the world works the way it does; to why folks act the ways they do.”  The shaman shrugged.  “Answers to anything.  Maybe bring some hope to those needin’ it.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure everything will turn out for the best.”  The hierophant smiled and pressed herself to Heldorm’s side.  “We have the cure, we’ve fought our war.  All that’s left is to return to Kelethin.”<br />
<br />
“Aye,” Heldorm sighed.  “To Kelethin.  Half a world away.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl remained a few moments before returning inside to the warmth of her bed.  Heldorm took one last look up at Luclin in hope of finding a stray answer, but returned inside as well when he found none.  <br />
<br />
<br />
From the journal of Aelwyl:<br />
<br />
”It never ceases to amaze me what twisted roads life leads one down from one day to the next.  This was the first war I had ever been part of, and do not care to be part of another.  Looking into the eyes of that lonely old woman on the battlefield I dare say will be with me for the remainder of my days.  So much death, so much blood.<br />
<br />
And Ioemir.  Who are you truly?  I thought once I knew the man, but now I doubt such thoughts.  Could the man who gently coddles his sick infant daughter be the same man who slaughtered innocent Half Elves?<br />
Talis, wherever you are, I pray to Tunare that you find the peace and resolution that you so deserve.” <br />
<br />
<br />
From the journal of Heldorm:<br />
	<br />
”I could write at length about the battle with the Gnolls earlier today, and the secrets Kylan shared with me, but I feel there is no real need.  I have already come to terms with these events, although I must admit seeing my brethren fall around me in battle has darkened my soul more than I care to admit.<br />
	<br />
“Speaking of coming to terms, I can’t imagine what weight must be upon Ioemir at this moment.  As if knowing the very life is slipping more and more from his daughter every moment is not burden enough, the reminder of a life best forgotten must be suffocating.  And Talis, wherever he may be now, no doubt has his own demons to face.<br />
	<br />
But soon enough, morning will come, and we will start back to Kelethin with haste.  My only comfort this night is knowing that seeing Ioemir’s daughter return to health will return a small light of happiness to this often dark existence, however far its cold reach extends.”             <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">(Sorry this is late, guys -- holidays and their backwash kept me busy.  Anyway, better late than never.  Enjoy! :) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Ioemir was already waiting in the cart when Aelwyl and Heldorm approached the Halas stables.<br />
	<br />
“Ah, there you guys are,” Ecbus said to the new arrivals as he scuttled about the cart, readying it for the road.  “We’re almost ready to leave, and not a moment too soon, either.  I think I have frostbite in places I don’t care to imagine.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm chuckled quietly.  “Eh, I think ye’ll be fine there.  And how ye holdin’ up, Blorg?”<br />
	<br />
“Meez okay.  Da cold not too bad.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm nodded and turned to survey his home city once more.  “Alright then.  I guess it’s time for us to be departin’.”   <br />
	<br />
The adventurers took their seats in the cart as the last of their belongings were secured.  A Halas stable master helped guide them through the narrow roads of town, and to the raft leading to the cold insecurity of Everfrost.  As the raft pushed off, Heldorm turned back to the ancient stone face of the Halas sign just at the moment Kylan and Feodorna appeared to wave farewell.  Heldorm smiled and returned their wishes until all he could see were two faint images, blurred by distance and gently falling snow.<br />
	              <br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
	<br />
<br />
The realm of Butcherblock drew ever closer as Meklozanth moved through the shadows with a renewed, sinister determination.  Already he could feel new life and energy begin to flow through his body.  He had feasted well on the souls of Nithmiel, but the prized feast lay sleeping quietly in his arms.  The Dark Elf kept a silencing spell on the child to detract unwanted attention.  By now, word was undoubtedly spreading through the realm of the child’s abduction, and a party of elite Feir’Dal already tracked the necromancer’s footsteps.  Stealth and swiftness were of dire essence.<br />
	<br />
As he approached the outskirts of Butcherblock, Meklozanth was forced to stop his advance and further press into the shadows by a large company of Dwarven warriors marching toward Kaladim.  At another time, the Dark Elf could have easily decimated the Dwarf army’s ranks; but despite his renewed life, restless days of walking and the weaving of dark magic had begun to take their toll.  Ah, but what’s this?  A lone Dwarf in the rear of the line breaks formation and heads to a small stone structure, mere yards from the concealed Teir’Dal.  The Dwarf ascends a short flight of steps to a perch, filled with hay; he strikes two pieces of flint together, setting the large clump of hay ablaze.  In the distance, as if by response, another fire sprang to life near the entrance of Kaladim.  <br />
	<br />
“Weak,” Meklozanth muttered quietly to himself.  “But I must keep going.”<br />
	<br />
One more feasting of soul matter could restore enough strength to make it to the docks.  The necromancer watched the lone Dwarf begin his descent.  Nestling the child carefully in the twisted branches of a nearby tree, Meklozanth crept closer to his prey.  One final scan of the area sealed the Dwarf’s fate.  For no one was near enough to witness a doomed Dwarf rounding the entrance of a small stone building and being violently snatched into the shadows by unseen hands.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
	<br />
“Well,” sighed Heldorm, as the cart slowed to a stop in the fields of Everfrost.  “I suppose the way we came is our best route back to Kelethin – through the Karanas, Kithicor, the Commonlands and all o’ that.”<br />
	<br />
The expanse of the field and valley around Heldorm bore little resemblance to the blood-soaked sea of carnage the previous day.  Scattered across the landscape, stood a few large funeral pyres, still quietly smoldering.  The occasional fragment of armor or broken weapon lay half-exposed in the earth, but all else was white with freshly fallen snow. <br />
	<br />
“Hmmm,” Ecbus rubbed his chin in quiet thought.<br />
	<br />
“What is it, Ecbus?”<br />
	<br />
“Maybe we won’t have to go back that way.  Qeynos has a shipping route to Erudin, does it not?”<br />
	<br />
“Yes, it does,” Aelwyl responded, eyeing the Gnome.  “What of it?”<br />
	<br />
“Well, I have some . . . connections in Erudin.  They may open their portals of travel for us.  Will make things a lot quicker.”<br />
	<br />
“Eh, I suppose,” Heldorm said skeptically.  “But if yer wrong, we’ve wasted precious time fer nothin’.”<br />
	<br />
“Well,” Ecbus shrugged.  “It’s just a thought.  Either way, we’ve got a sea voyage ahead of us.  And who knows what could happen on the open sea.”<br />
	<br />
“I agree with Ecbus,” said Aelwyl.  “The Erudites can be somewhat haughty, but they can also be quite reasonable.  It’s worth trying.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, aye okay.  What do ye think about it, Ioemir?”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir turned to Heldorm with a blank, defeated expression, nodded quickly, then turned his face away.<br />
	<br />
“Alright then.  It’s decided – we sail to Erudin.”<br />
<br />
	<br />
The entrance to Blackburrow stood unguarded for the first time in Heldorm’s memory.  The once overpowering stench of Gnoll fur now hung as thin as a fleeting phantom in the air.  Once inside the Gnoll dwelling, Heldorm and his companions kept their weapons ready, but to their surprise, they encountered only desolation.  Quick glimpses of faintly glowing eyes could be seen from time to time in the shadows, but otherwise the tunnels and corridors of the city were empty.  Far below, in the depths of Blackburrow proper, distant, mournful howls rose into the air.  <br />
	<br />
“So it appears that even the Gnolls feel a sense of loss and mourning,” said Aelwyl, trying to block out the wailing.<br />
	<br />
“Aye, so it would seem.”  Heldorm forced himself to look straight ahead at the exit.  Eye contact with Aelwyl would mean stirring up emotions that he dare not explore.<br />
	<br />
The remainder of the short travel through Blackburrow passed without incident; all breathed a deep sigh of relief once the warm, grassy fields of Qeynos Hills stretched out their arms in welcome.  Taking the dirt road southwest, Heldorm and his companions slowly made their way toward Qeynos.  As midday approached, the crumbling remains of a stone structure appeared on the horizon.<br />
	<br />
“Take us around, Blorg,” said Ecbus, eyeing the ruins carefully.<br />
	<br />
“What is that?” asked Heldorm.<br />
	<br />
“The ruins of an old druid altar or something like that.”<br />
	<br />
“Yes,” Aelwyl affirmed in a dark tone.  “The Circle of Green Earth was its name.  In the earliest days of the Druidic Order, it was one of our most sacred sites.”<br />
	<br />
“What happened to it?” Ecbus fixated on the decaying structure’s distant silhouette.  “I heard the Druids abandoned it in quite a hurry long ago.”<br />
	<br />
“There was a betrayal.  Torrican, a highly respected hierophant, embraced the dark powers of the earth.  He twisted the natural forces into sources of personal amusement, creating a growing natural imbalance and the poisoning of the area’s food and water.  The other hierophants tried to reason with Torrican, but he had slipped too far into darkness.  In a fit of rage, Torrican smote his fellow druids during morning worship at the Circle.  So angered and disgusted by this act was Karana, that He desecrated the Circle of Green Earth and summoned great bolts of lightning to destroy it.  To make sure that the Circle was not re-consecrated, so that more evil could be committed there in His name, Karana cursed the area around it; now only the undead and disease-ridden animals dwell there – guardians against the very forces they represent.<br />
	<br />
“The sooner we pass this place, the better.  The memories here are dark and cold.”<br />
	<br />
The cart was already making a wide sweep of the ruins by the time Aelwyl had finished her story.  A few, shambling undead regarded the travelers with a simultaneous sense of indifference and scorn.  But they made no motions to attack the trespassers, no matter how sweet their life force smelled.  Instead, the withered abominations simply returned to their endless lumbering, seeking shade from the sun’s life-giving rays.        <br />
	<br />
Ioemir could almost sense their approach to Surefall.  Sure enough, as he turned his head to look, the opening to the sanctuary city came into view.  Outside, flanking both sides of the entrance, stood guards clad in the armor of Qeynos, after it had annexed Surefall Glades many years ago.  Had Ioemir attempted his assault on the city in recent times, the outcome would have been much, much different.<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl sat beside Ioemir and put a hand on his shoulder; the Wood Elf warrior cringed slightly at first, but eventually let down his guard.<br />
	<br />
“You don’t have to let the past consume you, Ioemir.”<br />
	<br />
“I have no choice,” Ioemir responded after a pause.<br />
	<br />
“There’s always a choice.  We can either choose to let the past consume us, or we can choose to learn to accept it and become stronger as a result.  You don’t have to suffer anymore, Ioemir.  Look.”  Aelwyl pointed straight ahead as the cart turned south, placing the Surefall entrance directly to the rear of the vehicle.  “Look at it, Ioemir.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir hesitantly raised his head toward the entrance, carved into the side of the sheer cliff wall.  He stared intently at the opening, turning Aelwyl’s words over and over in his mind.  Finally, just as the entrance slowly faded from view, a realization began to overcome him.  Surefall suddenly didn’t seem quite so menacing as he had remembered.  For a moment, some of the shame and regret that he had felt for so long seemed to soften and fade.  It was as if the very act of riding away from the city began the healing process.<br />
	<br />
“Riding away,” Ioemir mumbled, almost incomprehensibly.<br />
	<br />
“What was that?” Aelwyl leaned a little closer.<br />
	<br />
“Nothing, I was just saying . . . I was just saying that one day I would very much like to return there.  Unarmed, unashamed, guiltless.”<br />
	<br />
“I think that is a very good idea.” Aelwyl smiled and squeezed Ioemir’s shoulder.  The hierophant stood from her seat and returned to Heldorm’s side, watching the stone causeway to Qeynos grow nearer. <br />

	<br />
“Whatever.  Come back to Qeynos to panhandle more of your ‘wares,' no doubt?”<br />
	<br />
“If you must know, we are actually seeking passage to Erudin.”<br />
	<br />
“Erudin, eh?”  The gatekeeper eyed the rest of Ecbus’s companions wearily before continuing.  “Alright, I suppose you’ll be their problem at least.”  He turned back to two guards clad in golden armor standing next to the main gate.  Within moments, the large wooden gate groaned open, revealing a lively scene of merchants and common folk going about their daily affairs.  Blorg started the wagon on its way, allowing Ecbus and the gatekeeper to exchange parting glances, mainly consisting of extended tongues and choice hand gestures, at one another.<br />
	<br />
“Well that was a cheery fella, there,” Heldorm said quietly to Ecbus as they entered the gate.  “I take it ye two have some sort of history?”<br />
	<br />
“Eh, not really,” Ecbus shrugged, “I just didn’t have a good showing in Qeynos once and word spread quickly.  Course, Ol’ Mort back there is notorious for never letting you live down anything.”<br />
	<br />
As the adventurers entered the streets of Qeynos, the suspicious eyes of passers-by fell up them, specifically on Ecbus.<br />
	<br />
Heldorm chuckled, “Ye just seem to make friends wherever ye go, ya little rascal.”<br />
	<br />
“Hey, what can I say?”  Ecbus proudly dusted off his thin, baggy robe.  “My reputation precedes me.”<br />
	<br />
“Heh, it certainly does,” Aelwyl said sarcastically.  <br />
	<br />
“Oh hush, both of you.  To the docks with haste, Blorg.  We got a boat to catch.”<br />
	<br />
<br />
The Sea King was sailing behind a large cliff face when the cart arrived at the docks.<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Aelwyl slumped down on the floor with a sigh.  “We just missed it.”<br />
<br />
“Was that the last ship going to Erudin for the day?” asked Ecbus.<br />
<br />
“No,” a gruff-looking middle-aged man said a short distance away.  He stood from the barrel he was stocking full of something rank.  “We’re expectin’ another one in about four or five hours – assumin’ the weather holds, o’ course.”<br />
<br />
“Four or five hours, eh?” Heldorm looked up at the midday sun with shielded eyes.  “That should put us in Erudin well into the night.”<br />
<br />
“Well, folks,” the grungy dockhand said with an exhale, “no sense in just standin’ here waitin’.  I suggest ye take advantage of what Qeynos has to offer – we got pubs, inns, shops, just about everything here.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, guess we got no choice at the moment.  We could use this time to restock on some food and supplies, I suppose.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir stepped up to the front of the cart suddenly and spoke in private to Ecbus.<br />
<br />
“Eh,” said Ecbus rubbing his chin.  “I suppose it wouldn’t be a problem, especially since we got all this free time now.”<br />
<br />
“What’s going on?” Aelwyl asked.<br />
<br />
“Just taking the opportunity to attend to some old business,” said Ioemir somewhat evasively.  “I should be back before we have to depart.  Blorg, you sure you don’t mind?  I know you’re probably tired already.”<br />
<br />
“No, meez not tired.  Pullin’ da cart iz wut I’m good at.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, then, we’ll meet back ‘ere in four hours.  Aelwyl’n I’ll do some shoppin’.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir agreed and set off with Ecbus and Blorg back out of town.<br />
<br />
“Where ye suppose he’s goin’?” inquired Heldorm as he watched the cart disappear around the street corner.<br />
<br />
“To bury some old skeletons,” Aelwyl replied with a smile.  “Something that has been needed to be done for too long.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The guards of Surefall eyed the cart’s approach carefully, paying special attention to Blorg – Ogres, after all, were not the most welcome visitors in the realm of Humans.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, I don’t like the look those guards are giving us,” said Ecbus motioning for Blorg to stop the cart.  “We’ll wait out here for your return.  Remember, it’s an hour trip either way, so don’t be too long, or we’ll miss our boat again.”<br />
<br />
“I won’t, Ecbus.”  Ioemir set down his sword, hopped down off the cart, and turned to the Gnome with a smile.  “You know, Ecbus, you’re not a bad person, regardless of what the others say about you.”  The Wood Elf winked and rubbed Ecbus’s balding head.<br />
<br />
“Blech!  Hey, stop that!  And just what do the others say about me?  Hey, wait!  Come back!  What do they say?!”<br />
<br />
But Ioemir just turned back to the cart briefly and waved with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Hold there,” commanded one of the guards as the Feir’Dal visitor approached.  “State your name, please.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir froze.  One of two things could happen, he thought to himself.  Either they recognize my name and attack, or the Humans of Qeynos have short memories and let me pass.  Well, here it goes.<br />
<br />
“Ioemir Enothie,” the Wood Elf warrior said boldly, “Champion of Faydark, defender of the realm of Kelethin.”<br />
<br />
The inquiring guard turned to his comrade and the two regarded each other for a few moments.  Had they recognized the name?  Ioemir swallowed hard, struggling to hold his posture.<br />
<br />
“What is your business in Surefall, Ioemir?  Are you armed?”<br />
<br />
“No, I come unarmed,” Ioemir raised his arms, allowing one of the guards the opportunity to search him.  After finding nothing, the guard nodded to the other and returned.  “And Surefall was a town I visited in my youth.  I simply wish to return and see how things have changed.”<br />
<br />
“Very well, Ioemir,” one of the guards finally said.  “You may enter.  Just make sure your intentions remain peaceful.”<br />
<br />
“They shall remain peaceful.  I have no desire for bloodshed.”<br />
<br />
<br />
As soon as he crossed the threshold into the sanctuary city, an army of familiar scents and sounds charged their way through Ioemir’s being; this time, however, these familiarities seemed warmer, almost welcoming.  The distant roar of the waterfall sounded as the playful music dancing from a bard’s lyre.  Ancient pines looked down from their distant perch to greet the champion as he passed humbly beneath them.  The sudden twang of a bowstring snapped Ioemir’s attention as he beheld two Human men taking shots at a straw target in the distance.  It seems that Surefall was still a training ground for rangers and archers alike.<br />
<br />
This place is no former battlefield, Ioemir thought to himself.  There is life and quietude here.  This fact further revealed itself as the Wood Elf continued his stroll through the city.  Many new houses and stores had been built along the stream’s edge.  Ioemir could see the occasional family coming out of their homes to fish or to picnic in the warm afternoon air.  <br />
<br />
It’s as if no one knew what happened here.  As if my attack has never taken place at all!  Could the memories of the peoples of Surefall be so short?  Have all the generations of Men since that day passed on?<br />
<br />
In small, nearby clearing, something curious caught Ioemir’s eye.  When he approached it, he discovered the curiosity to be a small, stone pillar crowned by a metallic plaque.  The squat marker had clearly not been properly maintained, as a small band of ivy began to worm its way around the crumbling, water-stained stone.  Brushing aside some moss and thistle remains, Ioemir read a weather-faded inscription, written in both the common Human tongue and the language of the Half Elves:  This monument was erected on the morning of the 15th day of the Seventh Age of Karana in memoriam of the two hundred innocent souls that were slain at the hands of unknown invaders during the 341st day of the Sixth Age of Karana.  May their lives, loves, and dreams never be forgotten.<br />
<br />
The words carved into the aging bronze slab stung Ioemir deeper than any blade crafted by the races of Norrath could ever dare to.  But in an ironic way, the words were also vindicating.  Not vindication for Ioemir’s actions, but for the honor of those he had slain.  For many generations of Man, this marker stood as a reminder that evil had left its mark here.  And here this marker would stand to remind future visitors until its structure has crumbled into dust, or its inscription washed away by the ravages of Karana’s rain.  In a way, Ioemir was glad this monument stood for all to see.  Although no names were mentioned, it was reassurance that his deeds would not pass quickly into oblivion.<br />
<br />
“Hey, mister,” a small, young voice greeted from beside him.  Ioemir turned to behold a young girl looking up at him.<br />
<br />
“Hello, there,” the Wood Elf said, kneeling down with a smile.  “And who might you be?”<br />
<br />
“My name’s Melania, what’s yours?”<br />
<br />
“Ioemir Enothie.  I’m from Kelethin, do you know where that is?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s the tree city in the forest.  It’s a million miles from here.  That’s where my mommy’s from, you know?”<br />
<br />
Ioemir regarded the child quizzically for a moment.  She had clearly Human features, yet her mother was from Kelethin?  A quick glance at the child’s ears revealed the truth – a Half Elf.<br />
<br />
“So you’re mother is an Elf and your father is a Human, you say?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” she replied looking at the ground and gently swinging her body from side to side, “that’s why people call us Half Elves, because we’re half Elf, half Human.”<br />
<br />
“Oh really?”  Ioemir chuckled slightly.  “You learn something new everyday, I guess.”  He stood and motioned over his shoulder with his head.  “Hey, do you know what this monument is for?”<br />
<br />
Melania shrugged and said, “My daddy told me about it once when I was little.  I think he said it’s where some bad things happened a long time ago.”<br />
<br />
“But no one remembers what happened?”<br />
<br />
“Not really, I guess.  No one ever talks about it, even the old people.  And they talk about old stuff all the time.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir turned back to the crumbling pillar.  Perhaps time had not offered the vindication his victims deserved after all.  Not yet, at least.  He looked at the monument for a moment then turned back to Melania, who just smiled up at him with a look of pure innocence, granted by some nameless, benevolent god to each child at birth.  Something of the child’s expression, combined with the serenity of a Surefall afternoon, and the weight of the past created just the right mixture within Ioemir’s soul.  The Champion of Faydark, slayer of hundreds, proud father, began to sob.  Warm tears fell in tiny streams, washing away spots of dust and decay on the monument’s bronze plaque.<br />
<br />
“Hey, don’t cry, mister,” Melania said meekly, tugging on his pant leg.  “I got this flower from out in the woods today.  Here, you can have it.”  <br />
<br />
Ioemir calmed himself and took the small, pink flower from the child.  He gently stroked the silky petals, a few stray tears falling onto them, forming tiny droplets.  “Thank you, Melania.  This means a lot to me.”<br />
<br />
“Melania?” a woman’s voice called from nearby.<br />
<br />
“I’m here, mommy!”<br />
<br />
A Feir’Dal woman emerged from the clearing’s entrance.  Upon seeing Ioemir, she stopped and approached cautiously.  <br />
<br />
“Hail,” the woman said quietly, her eyes never leaving the stranger.<br />
<br />
“Hello.  You must be Melania’s mother.”<br />
<br />
“That’s right.  I don’t see many other Feir’Dal here.  Who are you?”<br />
<br />
“Mommy, this is Ioemir Eno – Enu –“<br />
<br />
“Enothie.  Ioemir Enothie.”<br />
<br />
“Melania, come here now, we’ve got to go back home.”  The child’s mother quickly took her daughter’s arm.  She looked back at Ioemir, noticing the red around his eyes.  “Are you, alright?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, yes, I’m fine.  Melania was just telling me about Surefall.  It’s been a long time since I’ve been here, and I wanted to see how much things have changed.”<br />
<br />
“Ah,” the woman nodded, still somewhat apprehensive.  “We really have to go now.  Thank you, though, for watching Melania.  She likes to run off on her own little adventures and explore sometimes.”<br />
<br />
“It’s no problem.  That’s a good quality to have.  I wish you a good day, madam.”<br />
<br />
The woman smiled slightly and nodded again before briskly guiding her daughter with her.  Before disappearing back toward town, Melania turned to Ioemir one last time and waved goodbye.<br />
<br />
“Bye,” he said, smiling and waving gingerly with his fingers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ecbus watched Ioemir emerge from the Surefall entrance and walk back to the cart with a renewed vigor.  <br />
<br />
“Well, you decided to return, I see,” said Ecbus motioning Blorg to begin the trip back.  “I was about to come in looking for you.  So, how did it go?”<br />
<br />
“It went well.  Better than I thought, in fact.”<br />
<br />
“That’s good.  We’ve got about an hour to spare before the boat arrives, and I’d like to get back in plenty of time.  Was afraid you were going to spend all day there.”<br />
<br />
“No, no.  But I could have . . . easily.”  Ioemir produced the flower Melania had given him and inhaled its sweet fragrance.<br />
<br />
“Where’d you get that?”<br />
<br />
“Oh just from someone I met inside.  Someone who helped me finally put it all in perspective.”  He took another long whiff of the flower before wrapping it up in a small strip of bandaging and tucking it away safely in his travel pack.          <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">“Ah, about time!” Heldorm huffed, setting down two large sacks at the cart’s wheels.  “Was beginnin’ to think ye all had run off on us.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, we didn’t, so don’t go getting your kilt in a bunch.”  Ecbus hopped down off the cart and peeked curiously into the contents of one of the sacks.  “Get anything good?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, just the essentials – food, water, dried batwings.”<br />
<br />
Ecbus looked up at the Northman and raised an eyebrow.  “Dried batwings?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, erm, well, they were on sale, okay.  And ye never know when yer gonna need batwings.  I mean, yeesh!  I thought everyone knew that.”<br />
<br />
A short distance away, Aelwyl approached Ioemir, who was still lost in thought.  “How do you feel, Ioemir?”<br />
<br />
“I feel well,” the Wood Elf warrior looked up at Aelwyl with a smile.  “It’s like the bonds are broken.  I can look back on my past for once and see something besides darkness.<br />
<br />
“And . . . thank you, Aelwyl.”<br />
<br />
“Thank me?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, without your support I would have never returned there.  I would have simply watched it ride away from view, a dormant flower in my soul, waiting to bloom again someday.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Aelwyl smiled contently, “you are most welcome, Ioemir.  Now you can refocus on the task ahead of us – returning home and healing your daughter.”   <br />
<br />
The sharp clanging of a bell suddenly reverberated through the late afternoon air.  <br />
<br />
“Ship coming to dock!” a man perched high in an observation basket yelled to those below.<br />
<br />
Heldorm squinted and peered out along the harbor cliffs.  Sure enough, a large ship was quickly making its way toward the peer.  The shaman raised his view slightly and spotted something more ominous lurking above the vessel.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm, those dark clouds ahead don’t look too invitin’.”<br />
<br />
“Aye,” the swarthy dockhand confirmed.  “And they’re comin’ this way.  Good news is, that means there’s a strong wind comin’ in to help the sails.  The Siren’s an ol’ salty lass, but she’s quick.  Heh, surprised she’s held on for as long as she has.”<br />
<br />
“Lovely,” Ecbus sighed.  “Out at stormy seas on a ship that’s falling apart.”<br />
<br />
“Bleh, I wouldn’t worry there, mate.”  The old dockhand began to head back to the dock house.  “We haven’t lost anyone to that ship yet . . (this month).”<br />
<br />
“Umm, huh?” Ecbus asked nervously.  “What was that?  What did he say?”<br />
<br />
“Eh?  Oh I dunno, lad, wasn’t really payin’ attention.  But the boat’s pullin’ in now, so we better get that cart ready.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Black, billowing clouds already began to swallow the skies above The Siren.  High winds kicked up cold, salty droplets of water that stung the flesh.  And there was the rocking, the incessant rocking of the massive boat.<br />
<br />
“Uuugh,” Ecbus moaned, holding his stomach.  “One day . . . one day I’ll invent some mode of transportation that will bypass the sea altogether.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, bah, ye just need to get yer sea legs there, lad.”  Heldorm took a quick look around the cargo hold.  “Hey, where’s Aelwyl?”<br />
<br />
“She’s . . . uuuuuggh . . . up on deck – *uurp*”<br />
<br />
“Up on deck?!”<br />
<br />
The Gnome had not lied.  Out on the open deck, stood Aelwyl, arms raised, chanting something in an ethereal, resonating voice.<br />
<br />
“Aelwyl!” Heldorm yelled, followed immediately by a flash of lightning and loud peel of thunder.  Struggling to keep his balance on the slick, swaying deck, Heldorm made his way to the Wood Elf.  “What in the name of the Tribunal are ye doin’ out here?!”<br />
<br />
“Trying to buy us some time!” Aelwyl’s voice was almost drowned out completely by that of the thunder.  “Perhaps some magics in Karana’s name could ease our journey.”<br />
<br />
“Hate to break it to ye,” Heldorm waved around with his arm, “but it ain’t workin’.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl looked around at the violently churning sea, then at Heldorm.  “Perhaps you’re right,” she agreed with a slightly embarrassed laugh.<br />
<br />
“C’mon, let’s go inside.”<br />
<br />
Perhaps what happened next was inevitable – another whim executed by the same cruel Fates that had followed Heldorm and his companions like a shadow.  The two priests of Nature turned to go below deck just in time to see Ioemir opening the hatch.  A moment later, the boat began to pitch starboard.  After what seemed like an eternity, the boat leveled again, but not before a monster wave heaved itself up from the sea and lashed down on the boat.<br />
<br />
“Look out!” Ioemir futilely yelled.  Heldorm turned to be greeted by a wall of water that slammed into him and Aelwyl like an elephant.  The two were thrown against the ship’s wooden railing, and, for the moment, spared the gaping maw of the sea.  <br />
<br />
“Hang on!” yelled Ioemir.  “I’m coming to help!”<br />
<br />
Blorg suddenly appeared behind Ioemir to investigate the source of the yelling.  <br />
<br />
“Blorg!  Help me get to them!”  Ioemir battled with the thunder for voice.  “If you hold on to the frame of the hatch, and I hang on to your arm, I think I can reach them!”<br />
<br />
Blorg obliged and, with Ioemir, helped to form a living arm that stretched within a foot of Heldorm and Aelwyl – but no closer.<br />
<br />
“This is no good!  I can’t reach far enough!  We need some rope or a stick or something to reach all the way!  <br />
<br />
“Just hang on a little longer you two!  Keep holding the railing!”<br />
<br />
Blorg glanced around quickly before spying the wooden beam that supported one of the boat’s exterior lights.  With a grunt, the Ogre ripped the beam loose and handed it to Ioemir.<br />
<br />
“This will have to do!”  The Wood Elf warrior reached out again with the broken length of wood.  Heldorm clung on tightly to Aelwyl with one arm while trying for the wooden support with the other.  Blinded every other moment by waves and pushed out of reach by the rocking of the ship, the shaman pressed ever closer toward Ioemir.  Finally, with a last push of effort, Heldorm grasped the splintered beam.<br />
<br />
“Alright!  Now pull us back, Blorg!”<br />
<br />
But no sooner had the words left Ioemir’s lips than a terrible cracking sound arose from Aelwyl’s feet.  Blorg and Ioemir watched in horror as the time-rotted railing of The Siren gave way, releasing Heldorm and Aelwyl into the churning drink.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The dry, hot winds of the desert of Northern Ro felt like dragon’s breath on Talis’s face.  Ever since that day on the killing fields of Everfrost, he rode wherever his fancy took him.  He swore to ride until all the rage and thirst for vengeance had burned itself from his body.  For the moment, however, the ranger pauses his travels to rest Gypsywynd and take a long drink of cooling water.<br />
	<br />
“How are you holding up, Gypsy?” Talis patted the horse’s flank.  His steed simply responded with a snort.<br />
	<br />
“I agree,” the Half Elf took another drink, “I agree.”  He scanned the endless, golden expanse of the desert, listening to the voices on the wind and smelling the scarce, wandering scents.  “What are we doing here, Gypsy?  Why are we running?  To hope that the feelings of anger and revenge fly away with the winds that whip through our hair?  Ha!  Unlikely.  Even sleep cannot erase such feelings – it offers only temporary solace.”<br />
	<br />
Gypsywynd nudged lightly at Talis’s hip.<br />
	<br />
“Heh, I’m sorry, my friend,” Talis ran his fingertips across the horse’s snout.  “I do not mean to vent my frustrations so candidly.  It’s just as if there is something blinded to me that will not let me release these emotions, and I can’t quite seem to place a finger on it.”<br />
	<br />
Talis’s mount nudged him again. <br />
	<br />
“It’s alright . . . there, I am calm again.  We should ride further south, into the swamps of Innothule.  The air there is more like Kithicor, which could do us both some good.”<br />
	<br />
Gypsywynd clutched something hanging from Talis’s belt with his teeth before dropping it in the sand.<br />
	<br />
“Gypsy what are you doing now?”  The ranger knelt down and picked up a strip of hardened leather with a Half Elven rune carved into it.  “Ah yes, the charm my mother made for me when I was young, very young, a mere child barely able to walk.  It was supposed to protect me from demons and dragons.  Heh, a lot of good this did me, eh?”  Talis’s mind suddenly wandered to Ioemir and his daughter.  “Ioemir’s child: just as innocent as I was, also confronted with death’s shadow.  Should she suffer as I did?  After all, it would be fitting – one stolen childhood for another.<br />
	<br />
“But no,” the woodsman shook his head, his mind finally clearing, “it would not be fitting.  Where is the justice there?  It would be better served by allowing her to live, and see her have a chance at what I did not.  I’ve got to go back to them!  I’ve got to clean this putrid lump of bitterness that’s been festering inside me all these years.”<br />
	<br />
Talis looked over at Gypsywynd, who was starting right back at him.<br />
	<br />
“So this is what you were trying to tell me while I was rambling on.  You knew it was about the child all along.”  <br />
<br />
The horse remained silent.  <br />
<br />
“You are indeed an amazing companion, my good friend.  Are you sure you are not really a wizard or wise man under some enchanter’s curse?”  The ranger placed the charm back into his belt and quickly sprung up on his steed’s back.  “Ride like you have never ridden before, Gypsywynd!  We must find their tracks before they grow cold!”  Talis summoned forth a ghostly, blue aura that enveloped his and his steed’s feet; the aura departed with the disembodied howls of many wolves.  “No demons or dragons shall harm your child, Ioemir.  Not while breath still remains in my lungs.”  Talis lightly kicked Gypsywynd’s side, and with the spirit of the wolf, they bound forth with the speed of three horses toward the Commonlands.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">“Stay above the water!”  Heldorm gasped out in-between waves.  He clutched onto Aelwyl like life itself, not daring to let the sea wrestle her from him.  In the distance, the Sea King bobbed ever farther away.<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm!” Aelwyl yelled, spitting out salt water every couple moments.  “If the sea can just settle for a moment, I may be able to get us out of here!”<br />
	<br />
“What?!  How?!”<br />
	<br />
“A small wind tunnel!  Large enough for just you and I to slip through!  We’ll settle on the nearest piece of land!”<br />
	<br />
The shaman looked back up at the ship’s ever-shrinking image.  Through the mist of seawater, he thought he saw two figures scrambling toward a lifeboat.<br />
	<br />
“Aelwyl!  Just hold on!  I think they’re comin’ in the lifeboat!”<br />
	<br />
A moment later, however, a large wave washed over them both, submerging them completely.  When they finally surfaced again, Heldorm could feel Aelwyl’s grasp beginning to slacken.<br />
	<br />
“No, Aelwyl!  Don’t ye dare give up!  Fight the sea!  Swim upwards!”<br />
	<br />
But the sea would not be outdone.  It lashed yet another large wave at the two, this time breaking their grasp briefly.  In sheer panic, Heldorm lunged toward Aelwyl and was able to recapture her.<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm!”  The hierophant yelled, her voice growing very weak.  “I can’t . . .”<br />
	<br />
“Aye!  Aye ye can!  Aelwyl!  Just look at me!  Focus on my eyes!  We can do it!  Just breathe and swim together!  One deep breath!  Fill yer lungs completely!”<br />
	<br />
They inhaled a lungful of air just in time to be pulled under the waves once more.  Time seemed to slow as the two priests hovered in the sea’s liquid skin.  Heldorm kept his gaze locked on Aelwyl, whose eyes suddenly grew wide with panic.  She began to thrash and struggle, clawing at Heldorm’s clothing.  Then, after a few moments, the hierophant’s grasp slackened completely, her eyes rolled up into her eyelids, and she opened her mouth, letting out a tiny stream of bubbles.  Heldorm opened his mouth wide to shout out, “Nooooooooo!” but all that came out was his lungs’ remaining air, which the sea gladly took advantage of.  As burning salt water rushed down his throat, Heldorm saw the wooden bottom of a boat suddenly appear above and to the side of him.  Before the darkness of unconsciousness swept in a moment later, the shaman could see two giant arms plunging into the water.<br />
<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm,” a soft, feminine voice called out.  “Live.”<br />
	<br />
Oxygen filled lungs; lungs sent oxygen to the heart; heart pumped blood to the brain.  And with a gradual awakening, Heldorm slowly rejoined the conscious world, greeted by a grinning, largely toothless face.  The Northman gasped loudly before croaking out, “Ah, Blorg, it’s just ye.”<br />
	<br />
“Heywo.”<br />
	<br />
“Yer no Elven nymph maiden, but right now yer face is a welcome sight – uuuugh.”  Heldorm coughed up a bit of seawater.<br />
	<br />
“Careful now,” the same feminine voice from moments earlier said beside his ear.  “The sea dealt you quite a blow.  You need to rest for now.  You’ve still got some sea water in your lungs, but it will drain away soon enough.”  Heldorm felt the warm touch of hands being placed on his shoulders.  He turned to see the soft, serene face of an Erudite woman looking back down at him.<br />
	<br />
“Erudin.  We made it after all.”<br />
	<br />
“Yeah,” said Ecbus, scurrying up beside Heldorm’s bed, “barely.”<br />
	<br />
“What happened?” Heldorm asked weakly.<br />
	<br />
“After you went overboard, I came above deck to see what all the shouting was about.  Ioemir told me what happened, so I stayed onboard to make sure the captain stayed within range while the others commandeered the lifeboat.  After Blorg rescued you, we put you right into the sick bay until we reached Erudin.”<br />
	<br />
“Blorg, eh?”  Heldorm looked at the Ogre.  “So that’s who those giant arms belonged to.”<br />
	<br />
“Yeah and without him getting all that water out of your lungs, you probably wouldn’t be here right now.”<br />
	<br />
“You mean . . .” Heldorm looked at Ecbus nervously.<br />
	<br />
“Yep,” the Gnome responded with a slight chuckle.  “Only one way for one person to get the water out of another’s lungs – gotta be sucked out.”<br />
	<br />
“Uck, I always thought that lips that’ve touched an Ogre woman’s would never touch mine, but I guess I was wrong.  But I thank ye, big guy.  Just don’t start thinkin’ this’ll lead to anything.”<br />
	<br />
“Hehe, don’t menshun it.”  Blorg shied away and blushed slightly.<br />
	<br />
Then, the realization struck Heldorm like a bolt of lightning.  “Aelwyl!”  He stood straight up, only to be knocked down by a wave of pain.<br />
	<br />
“Careful!”  The Erudite woman pressed on his shoulders again.  “Relax a moment, please.”<br />
	<br />
“Where is she?  Is she alive?  In the name of The Tribunal, please tell me she’s still alive.”<br />
	<br />
A grave look shadowed Ecbus’s face.  “She’s alive . . . but barely.  The next few hours are . . . uncertain.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm sighed heavily, tears welling up in his eyes.  “I can’t imagine goin’ on livin’ if she can’t as well.”<br />
	<br />
“Raline, can Heldorm stand long enough to see Aelwyl?”<br />
	<br />
“Well, I don’t know.”  The Erudite seemed very apprehensive.<br />
	<br />
Ecbus approached Raline and whispered, “As much as it hurts me to say this, this may be his last chance to see her.  Please.”<br />
	<br />
“Alright,” Raline finally resigned.  “But at the first sign of trouble, he’s back in his bed.”<br />
	<br />
“Thank you, M’Lady.  Okay, Heldorm, I’ll take you to see Aelwyl.”<br />
<br />
	<br />
The loud whir of machinery filled the room Aelwyl was lying in.  The Wood Elf was almost swallowed completely by a noisy, bulky contraption seemingly attached to her like a parasite.  A series of restraints held her safely in place, while, strapped to her face, was a mask with two long tubes coming out of it; one tube terminated into a tall, cylindrical piece of steam-powered machinery, while the other terminated in a large cistern.<br />
	<br />
“What on Norrath is all that junk on her?”  Heldorm asked, staggering to Aelwyl’s bedside.<br />
	<br />
“It’s a . . . lung water pumper-outer, air pumper-inner thingy,” said Ecbus, struggling for words.  “Sorry, it looks crude, but I had to build it fast.”<br />
	<br />
“Ye built this?!” Heldorm turned to the Gnome in amazement.<br />
	<br />
“Yeah, weeelll, it was actually sorta Blorg’s idea.  He thought up the design for it, I just kinda put it together, with a little Erudite, magical tweaking.  Basically, one tube pumps out the water from her lungs, and between each pumping out, the other tube pumps in fresh oxygen from that air-producing doo-hickey over there.  Quite ingenious, actually.  You know that ‘private stash’ I’m always talking about hidden in the wagon?  Well, that’s what all this is made from.  I was going to save it to sell in case I was broke one day, but this just seemed . . . more important.  And like I said back in Halas, I just, ya know, wanted to make something that . . . something that . . .”<br />
	<br />
“It mattered, Ecbus,” the shaman said with a smile.  “It mattered.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm turned back to Aelwyl.  “Ye can’t leave us just yet, lass.  We still got a job to do.  Our friend, Ioemir – he’s got this sick daughter, see?  And we kinda said we’d help him cure her.  So ye can’t skip out on us yet.  Not for years and years.”  But Heldorm’s voice was starting to crack as he struggled not to cry.  “I’m here for ya, Aelwyl, no matter what happens.”  The shaman grasped her hand slightly.<br />
	<br />
“And I’m here, too.”  Ecbus walked up to the bedside and grasped the Wood Elf’s other hand with his.<br />
	<br />
“And meez, too!” Blorg bounced up to beside Ecbus.  “Erm, well she ain’t got anudder hand to hold, so meez just here.”<br />
	<br />
Ecbus and Heldorm both laughed.  “It’s alright, big guy, we know ye are.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl slowly opened her eyes.<br />
	<br />
“Hey!  Look!” Ecbus pointed down excitedly.  “She’s awake!”<br />
	<br />
“Ah, thank The Tribunal!  Aelwyl, can ye hear me?”<br />
	<br />
“Who can’t?”  Aelwyl mused weakly.  “You’re louder than an Faydark evergreen falling to the ground.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm laughed until he began to cry.<br />
	<br />
“By Prexus, she’s come to,” Raline said shortly after entering the room.  “We still need to get the remaining seawater out of her system.  After that, our clerics can do the rest.  She should be back on her feet within the next couple of hours.  And you should be resting, too, Heldorm.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, I should, I suppose.  Aelwyl, I’ll see ye when we’re both rested up and healed.  We should be on our way again by the morning.”  Heldorm leaned over and kissed Aelwyl on her forehead.<br />
	<br />
The Wood Elf nodded with a smile and closed her eyes to rest.<br />
	<br />
Walking back through the courtyard, Heldorm and company spotted a small crowd gathered around someone.<br />
	<br />
“Hail, what’s goin’ on here?”<br />
	<br />
As they approached, the crowd became more recognizable.  <br />
	<br />
“Lemira!” <br />
	<br />
“Ohhh, it iz Lemeera!”  Blorg blushed, his heart beginning to race.<br />
	<br />
Around Lemira, were gathered several Wood Elf warriors.  And in the center of the crowd, stood Ioemir, a look of great concern on his face.  <br />
	<br />
“Hail there, folks.”  The crowd all turned to the approaching Northman and his companions.<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm Snowreader, was it?”  Lemira asked with a nod.  “I see the Fates have crossed our paths once again.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, so it would seem.  What brings ye and yer friends here?  Ioemir, what’s wrong?”<br />
	<br />
“Lemira and Captain Moonwind tell me that my daughter . . . Heldorm, my daughter’s been kidnapped!”<br />
	<br />
“What?!  By who?!”<br />
	<br />
“By a Tier’Dal invader.  He snuck into Kelethin and took my daughter, killing my love, Nao’lya, in the process.”<br />
	<br />
“Ioemir.  I – I don’t know what to say, lad.  I’m so sorry.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir just raised his hand and shook his head.  “Please, Heldorm, there will be time to grieve later.  Besides, you have enough troubling you at the moment.  I know Aelwyl is not doing well.”<br />
	<br />
“Actually, she’s awake now.  She just opened her eyes before we got here.”<br />
	<br />
“Really?  Well, there is some good news for a change.”<br />
	<br />
“If you don’t mind me asking,” began Ecbus, “how does this concern the Knights of Freeport, Lemira?”<br />
	<br />
“The Tier’Dal invader was last seen fleeing with the child back toward Nektulos forest.  This incursion into The Commonlands makes it our concern, whether we like it or not.  The Knights of Freeport have been watching Dark Elf activity for generations.  Besides, I have . . . personal reasons for volunteering for this mission.”<br />
	<br />
“Mission?”  Heldorm raised an eyebrow at Lemira.<br />
	<br />
“To aid the Wood Elves of Kelethin in the safe return of Ioemir’s daughter, and the bringing to justice of her kidnapper.”<br />
	<br />
“Now yer speakin’ my language, lass.  Glad to have ye with us.”<br />
	<br />
“Woah woah,” Ioemir started, waving his hands in front of him.  “Slow down.  We can’t do anything until morning.  And even then, it’s at least another two day’s journey back to The Commonlands.”<br />
	<br />
“Not to worry about that,” Ecbus stood tall and puffed out his chest proudly.  “I’ve made all the necessary travel arrangements.”<br />
	<br />
“Eh?  What are ye up to now, ye little devil?”<br />
	<br />
Ecbus looked up at Raline, who explained, “Ecbus has told us of your situation.  And since we of Erudin owe him a favor, we have decided to open our portals to you and your friends.  It sounds as if you will be needing the Commonlands portal opened.  I can tell you that that portal has not been opened in a very long time, and will most likely require our scholars to work through the night.” <br />
	<br />
“Pretty impressive there, lad.  I don’t know what on Norrath ye could have done to have the Erudites owe ye a favor (nor do I care to think of what it was), but anything to save time is a blessing.”<br />
	<br />
“Yeah, and I’m glad I ran into Lemira before they opened them, or we would have been on the opposite side of where we needed to be.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye, it’s our old friend serendipity again . . . erm, sorry, Ioemir, don’t mean to make light of yer loss.”<br />
	<br />
“It’s okay, Heldorm.  Like I said, time to grieve later.  For now, we need to rest and gather our wits.  Besides, like Raline says, we can’t go anywhere until the morning, which should put our arrival in Nektulos around the same time as the Tier’Dal.”<br />
	<br />
“Alright then.  I, fer one, am exhausted.  I’ll see ye all in the mornin’.”<br />
<br />
<br />
From the Journal of Heldorm:<br />
”This may perhaps be the last journal entry I write.  I feel a sense of darkness and finality looming as we near the beast we seek.  Ioemir has suffered so much these past several days, it will be good to see him finally receive some solace.  Nonetheless, we need to find and catch this rogue Dark Elf, whoever he is.  I only pray that the child is unharmed.  It’s not right that one so innocent should be placed so close to the breath of evil.  Regardless, I need sleep.  With Aelwyl rested, we’ll be in full force to face this Tier’Dal snake.”<br />
<br />
From the Journal of Ecbus:<br />
”I did it!  I finally made something that mattered!  Well, okay, okay, I can’t lie to myself anymore – Blorg actually came up with it, but still I put the damned thing together!  And tomorrow, we’re gonna kick some Dark Elf butt!  Man, forget all that bad stuff I said before, this is the best adventure I’ve ever been on!”<br />
<br />
From the Journal of Blorg:<br />
”Me saw pretty lady again, yayz!  Pretty lady!  Pretty lady!  And sheez gonna be comin wit us 2morrow!  Hmm, 2morrow.  Dat makes meez tink about time.  Duz time reely onlee go in won direcshun?  Letz say yooz get an egg and roll it off yur table onto da floor.  Now yooz got a broken egg, rite?  All splattered in a bazillion peeces.  So hooze 2 say dat yooz can’t reverse dat egg to make it un-splatter?  If yooz look at da hole process of dat egg fallin’ and splatterin’, yooz gotta take into account all da little details, like wind rezistence and imperfecshuns of da table, and how little currents of air move all da peeces of da egg dat splatter.  So 2 reverse time and make dat egg unsplatter, yooz gotta take all dem little details I wuz just talkin’ about and do em in the eggzact oposit order.  No room for earors.  So if yooz do all dat in eggzactly the oposit order, den yooz just ‘rewound’ da splatterin’ of dat egg.  Oh man, meez brain reely hurtin’ now.  Ya no, maybee da noam iz rite.  Maybee meez shudn’t think about diz sorta stuff.  Evree time meez do, meez brain starts to hurt like win I drank 2 much dat one night in barbieland.  Startin’ now, I ain’t gonna tink about nothin’ cept wut an Ogre shuld be tinkin’ about.  Come ta tink about it, wut should an Ogre be tinkin’ about?  Hmm, meez gonna have ta tink about that.  Anywayz, now 2 sleep.  Da sooner meez get ta sleep, da sooner meez sees pretty lady again!  Yayz!”<br />
<br />
From the Journal of Ioemir:<br />
”I have lost my love, and am in danger of losing another.  What more could Fate possibly do to me?  Kill me?  Ha!  I should be so lucky.  But then again, perhaps death is not such a bad thing.  After all, it will only hasten my journey to see my wife and my daughter again.  <br />
<br />
Then again, there may be hope.  I have the support of Kelethin and the Knights of Freeport now.  Perhaps some shred of light still shines in the blackness of these past few days.<br />
Enough writing for now.  Tonight I sleep, and tomorrow I get back my daughter, one way or the other.”    <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sadinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Loving the story, can't wait for more :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Heldorm was awakened by the feeling of someone sitting down on the side of his bed.  With a start, the Northman looked up to see the smiling face of Aelwyl sharpening into focus.  With a sleepy laugh, Heldorm pulled the Wood Elf to him and kissed her repeatedly.  <br />
<br />
“Welcome back from the dead, lass.”<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t leave you when you needed me the most, Heldorm.  You know that.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, aye I did.”  Heldorm stood from the bed and shook the lingering sleep from his head.  “We got a big day ahead of us.  I wonder if the portal’s ready yet.”<br />
<br />
“Not yet,” Raline said, stepping into the room.  “I was just about to wake you and you companions.”<br />
<br />
“Eh, what for if the portal’s not ready?”<br />
<br />
“There is someone who wishes to speak with you.  He awaits you in the library.”<br />
<br />
“And who is this –“<br />
<br />
Ioemir, Blorg, and Ecbus suddenly made their entrance.<br />
<br />
“I assume Raline has summoned you to the library as well?” asked Ioemir.<br />
<br />
“Aye, ye know what all this is about?”<br />
<br />
“No, but we aren’t going to get any answers standing around here.”  Ioemir approached Aelwyl.  “Good to see you up and around again.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Ioemir.  I’ve been informed of your loss and I am sorry.”<br />
<br />
“I appreciate that, but we really shouldn’t waste any more time.  We have an invitation at the library, so let’s not disappoint.”<br />
<br />
A scholar of Erudin met Heldorm and his companions at the library’s entrance.  Together, they twisted through the great maze of shelves and tomes into some of the oldest parts of the building, finally coming to a small door tucked into a forgotten corner.  The scholar mumbled a brief chant and the door silently opened.<br />
<br />
“This is where we keep some of our oldest, most prized texts,” the scholar said, pointing down a narrow, stone staircase.  “He is awaiting you at the bottom.  You will be summoned when the portal preparations are complete.”  With that, he took his leave.<br />
<br />
As the stairwell opened into its adjoining chamber, a familiar, primal feeling of dread washed over Ioemir and Aelwyl.  The small, sparsely lit room that stood open before them had a single wooden table with a small, glassed-in bookshelf next to it.  At the table, sat a lone figure, hunched intently over a large book.  He slowly turned toward his guests, as if sensing their approach.  <br />
<br />
“A Tier’Dal?!  Here?!” Ioemir exclaimed as he drew his sword. <br />
<br />
The Dark Elf stood from the table and made calming motions with his hands.  “Please, calm yourself.  I am a friend.”<br />
<br />
“Ioemir!”  Heldorm grabbed the Wood Elf’s wrist.  “Have ye lost yer head, man?  Why would a Dark Elf be here if he wasn’t a friend of the Erudites?”<br />
<br />
Ioemir thought on this for a moment, before reluctantly backing down.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Ecbus squinted in the low light to get a better look of the Dark Elf, “I’ve seen you before . . . Kizdean Gix?”<br />
<br />
The Tier’Dal nodded with a half-smile.  “Yes, Ecbus.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa!  How’d you know my name?”<br />
<br />
“You’re that Gnomish inventor, aren’t you?  There are not many who don’t know of you.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Ecbus stood straight, puffing out his chest.  “But of course they know of me.  I mean, come on.”<br />
<br />
“Oh brother,” Heldorm groaned, “please don’t be makin’ his head get any bigger.  He’s already about to be floatin’ away.”<br />
<br />
Ecbus hmph-ed.<br />
<br />
“My guests,” Kizdean held his half-smile and opened his arms with a bow, “I have called you down here to share with you the nature of the danger you face.”  He took his seat once more and motioned his guests toward him.<br />
<br />
As Heldorm and his companions gathered around, Kizdean continued, “This tome before me is the Vek Ty’Vul, the manifesto of an ancient, Tier’Dal cult, whose name died with its last member.  All of their works were thought to have been destroyed many years ago, but this one somehow survived and found rest here in Erudin.<br />
<br />
“The subjects covered in this book are mostly cryptic religious rites, that even after centuries of studies, I and my fellow scholars have yet to translate.  There are, however, some passages that speak in great clarity.”  Kizdean flipped back a ways in the book to two pages filled with numerous figure drawings.<br />
<br />
“Tunare; The Tribunal; Karana; Brell Serilis; Rallos Zek; all the gods of Norrath – mere pawns on an endless gaming board.  For the universe we dwell in houses many gods, some whose power and influence reaches across the immense gulfs of space to countless worlds . . . including our own.<br />
<br />
“The man you seek is Meklozanth Xolasus.  He is the son of Velin Xolasus, a poor soldier who died sick and nearly asset less.  Meklozanth vowed he would never grow to be as poor and weak as his father, for Velin was also a follower of the nameless cult who wrote this very book.  Meklozanth pillaged his father’s personal possessions, before finding a small journal, which his father had written the secrets his brotherhood has bestowed upon him.  Through the black teachings journal, Meklozanth’s eyes were opened to arcane powers he could never have imagined.  As he grew to adulthood, Meklozanth perfected and further harnessed his newly discovered dark arts.  It was shortly thereafter that he meshed these powers with the lost art of necromancy, forbidden even by Innoruuk Himself.  This quickly made him many enemies throughout Neriak.  The Tier’Dal, already being a naturally suspicious race, quickly moved to banish Meklozanth from their city.  Now a pariah, he delved deep into Nektulos Forest, coming at last to an abandon temple erected by the cult of his father to their god . . . whose name I dare not say aloud.<br />
<br />
“These events all took place over five hundred years ago.  It appears that Meklozanth has somehow found a way to extend life, no doubt thanks to his practice of necromancy.  Find the source of his life, and you find the black heart which needs to be cut.”<br />
<br />
“Why do you tell us this?” asked Ioemir.  “Why do you help us?”<br />
<br />
Kizdean turned to Ioemir with another half-smile.  “Because, even though we may be a suspicious race, not all of my people are evil and cold hearted.  Some of us have learned to tolerate, even love, those other than ourselves.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir let out a short chuckle.  “Had I not heard it directly from the lips of a Tier’Dal, I would never have believed it.  Nor would I have believed that I would be thanking one.”  The Wood Elf placed his hand on Kizdean’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Not wait a minute,” Ecbus interjected.  “How come I see you out in the West Commonlands preaching about the Brotherhood or something if you’re supposed to be a good Dark Elf?”<br />
<br />
Kizdean laughed.  “Well, you see that snake, Zytl, I’m sure keeps an eye on me.  He’s in league with Meklozanth somehow.  I’ve got to put on an act or I’ll spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder for one of Zytl’s blades in my back.” <br />
<br />
From the stairwell, Raline suddenly emerged.  “Pardon the interruption, Kizdean, but the portal is now ready.  We need to make haste, the gate will only be open for a short time.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm and his companions thanked Kizdean and turned to take their leave.<br />
<br />
“Ioemir,” Kizdean said just as the Fier’Dal approached the stairwell.  “Go with Tunare . . . and with my thoughts.”<br />
<br />
“I will,” Ioemir smiled and nodded.  “Thank you again, Kizdean.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The gaping portal to the Western Commonlands shimmered with the color of clouds against a royal blue sky.  Around the mystical opening, stewards of Erudin held tight the reins of six horses.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on here?” asked a concerned Ecbus.  “Where’s my cart?”<br />
<br />
“That decaying monstrosity of a wagon?”  Raline responded.  “It’s still docked in our stables.  That old rickety thing will just slow you down.  We’ve brought six of our finest horses for you – they’ll be of much more aid.”<br />
<br />
“But –“<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, your wagon will be returned to you upon your return.  But you really must make haste; the portal will not remain open long.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, so you’ve said.”  Ecbus sighed.  “Okay then, are we all ready?  Where’s my horse?”<br />
<br />
“Ah yes,” Raline began, somewhat reluctant.  “Well you see, we breed only the strongest, tallest steeds here, while shipping off the ponies, but under the circumstances . . .”  Raline stepped aside to reveal a pony, a mere three-feet high.<br />
<br />
The others snickered as Ecbus hopped up on the tiny horse.  “What’s so funny?  This horse suits my needs perfectly.  Does he, she, it, whatever, have a name?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Raline said stifling a laugh, “it’s all yours.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, I’ll call it . . . Clockwork Squeaker!”<br />
<br />
“Ummm, eh?”  Heldorm eyed Ecbus.<br />
<br />
“Hey, that’s a very proud name, thank you very much!  It was the name of my pet clockwork rat when I was young.”<br />
<br />
“Oookay, whatever ye say.”<br />
<br />
“Bah, I have a lot of fond memories of Squeakers so thhhhpt!”  The Gnome waggled his tongue at the Northman.<br />
<br />
Nearby, Blorg was having some difficulty mounting his horse – namely, the steed kept moving to avoid being crushed by the tremendous weight of the Ogre.<br />
<br />
“Diz not working.  Guess Lemeera and meez gonna have ta stay here,” Blorg said innocently, smiling hopefully at the lady paladin.<br />
<br />
“Ha!  Dream on, Ogre!”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, what will Blorg do?”  Aelwyl asked with concern.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure.”  Raline pondered for a moment.  “You need to come to a decision soon, however.&quot;<br />
<br />
“As much as I’d hate to say it,” Heldorm said moving his horse toward the portal, “Blorg may have to stay here.”<br />
<br />
“Eh, I suppoze dat’s okay.  I can look after da cart.”<br />
<br />
“Blorg . . .” Ecbus began.  The Ogre had transcended the role of assistant for Ecbus; he had become like a brother – one that had stuck with him through insults, shelter less nights, and endless hours of pulling a heavy cart.  “I . . .”<br />
<br />
“Iz no need ta say nothin’,” Blorg plucked Ecbus up and held him to eye level.  “Meez no wut joo gonna say . . . joo like da brudder I never had.”  The Ogre squeezed a helpless Ecbus to his chest.<br />
<br />
“GURK!  Mmmph, mrrrph, rmmph!”<br />
<br />
“Joo said it, noam!”  Blorg gingerly set the frazzled Gnome back onto his mount.  “Ermm, doz meez get hug frum Lemeera, too?”<br />
<br />
“Hmph!  Perhaps when we get back from this,” Lemira playfully winked.  The Ogre blushed in response and looked away with a giggle.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t tease him there, lass.  He’s a good guy once ya get to know him.”<br />
<br />
“I dare say, but we’ve wasted enough time already.  Yah!”  Lemira kicked her horse’s side and rode through the portal, her passage followed by the sound of a brief but violent rushing of air.<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess that’s our cue.  Be safe, Blorg.  We should be back in a jiffy.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm, Aelwyl, and Ioemir rode through.  Ecbus got right to the threshold, but stopped long enough to turn back to Blorg and wave farewell.<br />
<br />
“Come back in one peece dere, naom,” mumbled the Ogre as Ecbus disappeared into the portal.  “I’ll beez waitin’ fer ya.”           <br />
       <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Moments after Ecbus rode through, the West Commonlands portal collapsed with a low rumble and gust of wind.  Heldorm and his companions sat and surveyed the top of the squat, step pyramid in awe.  <br />
<br />
“This platform must be at least thirty meters on all sides,” Ecbus mused.<br />
<br />
“Fifty meters,” corrected Lemira.<br />
<br />
“You’ve been up here before?”<br />
<br />
“No, this is the first time.  But when I was a child, my family and I traveled to Freeport regularly.  And every time we passed through, I’d make him stop by this pyramid.  I’d always ask him what it was, and he’d always say the same thing: ‘It’s a Dark Elf temple to Innoruuk.’  I’d always follow that up with:  ‘But if it was made by the Dark Elves, why is it outside in the daylight?  Don’t they live their lives in the dark’?”  The lady paladin laughed.  “Of course, he’d never have an answer for that and just took me along back toward the city.  But anyway, when I was older, I studied this place more and found that it was really built by the Arch Wizards as a portal gate.  Took some of the romance and mystery out of it, I suppose, but . . .” Lemira shrugged with a smile.<br />
<br />
“It seems as though you have quite the nostalgic side of you, Lady Lemira,” said Aelwyl.<br />
<br />
Lemira cleared her throat and immediately returned to her proper, regal posture.  “Yes, well, it’s all in the past.  But for now, we have the present to attend to.  We should be off to Nektulos.”<br />
<br />
“Aye,” said Heldorm looking at Ioemir, who returned the Northman’s determined look.  “Time’s of the essence.  We can’t let Meklozanth slip into Neriak.  We’d be served up in wine sauce a few steps into the First Gate.”<br />
<br />
The small squad of rides descended the ancient, crumbling stairs of the pyramid, finally coming down to the flat, rolling plains of grassland.  With the midday sun shining warm overhead, the riders set out at speed eastward.  Within a half of an hour, the tollbooth where two guards of Freeport stood vigil on the road to the East Commonlands came into view.  From the other perspective, Guard Vallon groaned and exited the guardhouse upon seeing several mounted figures approaching quickly.  His partner, Guard Colin soon followed suit.<br />
<br />
“Halt!”  Vallon began his routine command as travelers drew near.  “By order of the Freeport – Hey!  Stop!”  But the horses simply leapt over the barricade with stunning agility and speed; a few moments later, a pony carrying a Gnome galloped gingerly by.  Without stopping, the Gnome reached into his robe and flung a platinum piece at Vallon’s feet.  A quick bow and grin later, the Gnome and his valiant steed passed clear underneath the barricade in an attempt to catch their fellow riders.<br />
<br />
Colin walked up next to a stunned Vallon, still trying to grasp what had just occurred.  Looking down at the shining platinum piece, Colin said flatly, “Well, at least they actually paid.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Eh, where’d that Gnome go?”  Asked Heldorm, trying to sit steadily on the horse and scan the immediate area at the same time.  Turning to look behind him, the Northman spotted Ecbus some distance off.  “Ye all keep ridin’, I’m goin’ back for the Gnome!”<br />
<br />
A short backtrack later, Heldorm met with Ecbus, who was dutifully coaxing his horse on.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Squeakers!  Let’s go get em!  Yah!  We’re almost caught up!”<br />
<br />
Heldorm choked back a laugh.  “Alright, Ecbus.  Hop on, or we’ll never get there.”<br />
<br />
“But . . . but what about . . .”  Ecbus glanced down with a concerned look at his horse.<br />
<br />
“Heh, he’ll be fine, lad.  Erudin’s sendin’ a recovery party after us, anyway.  They’ll get him then.”<br />
<br />
Ecbus looked up at Heldorm hesitantly before finally agreeing.  The shaman reached down and scooped Ecbus up, plopping him down in the front of the saddle.  The Gnome turned and waved to his noble steed, who trotted up to the nearest clump of grass and began gnawing away.  <br />
“Be careful, Squeakers, you wait for the Erudites.  They’ll be here soon enough.”<br />
<br />
“He’ll be fine, Ecbus.  But we need to catch the others, before that snake Dark Elf slithers past.  Yah!”  Heldorm’s horse pressed forth with a sudden burst of speed.  Minutes later, he arrived at the others, waiting at the wooded opening to Nektulos Forest.<br />
<br />
“Any sign so far?”<br />
<br />
“None.”  Lemira slowly scanned the forest clearing.  “This place looks like it hasn’t seen any traffic in weeks, perhaps months.”<br />
<br />
“The Tier’Dal rarely set foot in this area,” said Ioemir.  “Mercifully.”<br />
	<br />
“Aye.”  Heldorm nodded, followed by a sigh.  “Well, I suppose the only way to know fer sure is to go into Nektulos itself, eh?”<br />
	<br />
“Yes!  Definitely,” Lemira responded enthusiastically.  <br />
	<br />
“Heh, a lil eager there are we, lass?”<br />
	<br />
“Forgive me, I . . . have been taught to hate the Tier’Dal all my life, much as I am sure Aelwyl and Ioemir have.  As uncouth as it may sound, I thirst for feeling Dark Elf flesh under my sword.”<br />
	<br />
“Hmph,” interjected Ecbus.  “And I’m sure impressing a certain order of Freeport has nothing to do with your motives.”<br />
	<br />
“If you must know, the thought had crossed my mind, briefly.”<br />
	<br />
“Alright, now.  Lemira’s reasons are her own.  We all have our own reasons.”  Heldorm shot a quick glance at Ioemir, who looked back at him with a fleeting smile.  “But ain’t none of us gonna be able to fulfill em if we stand around here banterin’ back and forth.”<br />
	<br />
“Right!”  Lemira led her horse toward Nektulos.  “Let’s go in and say hello to our Dark Elf neighbors.”<br />
	<br />
<br />
As soon as they crossed the threshold into Nektulos, the adventurers felt a cold, invisible hand grip their very souls.  The dark, slimy trees seemed to watch their every move, reporting back to some nameless master.<br />
	<br />
“I think . . . I see something shining up ahead,” said Aelwyl, squinting through the hazy gloom.<br />
	<br />
As the riders pressed on into the fog, Heldorm mumbled something in his native tongue, triggering his eyes to glow with a pale, purple light.  Everything in his field of vision sharpened into unmatched clarity.  “Aye there definitely is somethin’ up there.  Several somethins, maybe.  It almost looks kinda like . . . armor?”<br />
	<br />
No sooner had he made that statement, then an ominous voice chanted loudly in a harsh voice, causing the fog to part in all directions.  Surrounding Heldorm and his companions were ten Dark Elf dragoons, armored for battle.  The riders dismounted with blinding speed, drawing their weapons.  The Erudite mounts, as if trained for this situation, instinctively trotted to a safer location, some distance off.<br />
	<br />
“Well, well, the Fates must be smiling upon us today.”  A Dark Elf commander stepped forward.  “Master Meklozanth ordered no interference from the outside.  I just never thought there’d actually be some.  It’s been ages since I’ve spilled blood.  What about the rest of you men?”<br />
	<br />
A murmur of anticipation swept over the other dragoons.<br />
	<br />
“So Meklozanth has already passed through?”  Heldorm asked, breaking the tension.<br />
	<br />
“Yes.”  The commander approached the Northman looking fearlessly up at him.  “Not more than a half an hour ago.  But why do you care?  You will not live to see him.”  The Tier’Dal chuckled confidently, inspiring further laughter in his dragoons.  All those armed, gripped their weapons nervously, preparing their minds and bodies for the inevitable conflict.<br />
	<br />
From off in the distance, the sudden whinny of a horse arose.  The sharp whistle of an arrow cutting through the stale air, before landing in the side of the commander’s neck, put a firm stop to the laughter; the lead Dark Elf staggered back a few paces with a gurgling, choking sound.  A moment later, the mournful howl of a wolf echoed off of the trees’ cold skin.  All present turned toward the fog still lingering near the forest entrance just in time to behold a large wolf leaping through the mist in a high arc.  In mid-air, the wolf’s imaged shimmered slightly before morphing into a Half Elf, wielding two swords, which he drew together in a scissor-like motion to decapitate the stunned commander.<br />
	<br />
Heldorm looked over at Talis with a mixture of delight and shock.<br />
	<br />
“Miss me?”  Asked Talis, standing straight again.<br />
	<br />
Then, all hell broke loose.<br />

More comin' soon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The circle of dragoons closed in on Heldorm’s party like a pack of jackals upon wounded prey.  The enemy reached Lemira first, who, upon seeing the attack, chanted a quick prayer to Mithaniel Marr.  A holy aura of pale blue surrounded her blade, which she used to strike down the Dark Elf in a quick, decisive slash.  With a yelp, Ecbus ducked behind Heldorm after the first blow had been delivered.<br />
            <br />
Nearby, Talis defended against two attacking dragoons, matching them strike for strike.  The Dark Elves gradually pushed the ranger back against a large tree, preparing for a double finishing blow.  Waiting for the slightest ghost of an opening, Talis watched each dragoon with hawk-like vigilance.  At last, one came.  The nearest dragoon raised his arms to deliver the final cut, but before he could react, Talis ran him completely through, swiftly blocking an incoming blow from the other dragoon.  Without hesitation, Talis kicked the impaled Dark Elf off of his blade and dealt a swift lateral slash to the torso of the remaining dragoon.  With the sound of lightning slicing air, Earthcaller cut through the armor and flesh of the Teir’Dal as a warm knife through butter.  <br />
            <br />
“No!  Get off of me!” Aelwyl shouted some distance off.<br />
 <br />
Talis turned to Aelwyl’s cries and began to sprint off toward his comrades, the severed halves of the Dark Elf falling to the ground behind him.  A dragoon had grabbed a hold of Aelwyl and was trying to force her to the ground.  Heldorm and the others were busy in combat, so Talis had to move quickly.  His advance was stopped however, when it became apparent that Aelwyl could take care of herself.  The hierophant grasped the Dark Elf’s neck as best she could and summoned a coat of thorns that sprouted from her skin.  The dragoon howled in pain, but was quickly silenced as his foe shot forth two, great bolts of fire from her hands.<br />
            <br />
“I swore never to draw blood again,” Ioemir told the dragoon before him.  With a quick, forward thrust, the Wood Elf warrior drove his two-handed sword into the chest of his enemy.  “But in your case, I’ll make an exception.”  Ioemir winked at the Teir’Dal and withdrew his sword, black blood clinging to the once polished blade.<br />
            <br />
Invictus shrieked with each swing, just as it had done on the killing fields of Everfrost.  The dragoons proved more agile than Heldorm had given them credit for, for each of his swings found only stale air.  After one such swing, the Northman left his right side exposed long enough for a Dark Elf to get a quick slash in, leaving a deep cut across his ribcage.  With a howl and quick burst of magic, Heldorm lifted Invictus high and drove down atop his attacker’s head, driving him straight into the ground like a nail into a wooden plank.  The shaman turned to survey the remaining battle just as Lemira finished off another dragoon.<br />
            <br />
“Two left,” Heldorm muttered to himself.  “But, wait, where is –“<br />
            <br />
The Snowreader’s thoughts were cut short, however, as a dragoon charged him, sword within a moment of striking.  In a rapid motion, Heldorm flung out his hand in the direction of the attacking Teir’Dal.  Out of the Barbarian’s hand, flew a ghostly swarm of insects, which sunk into the Dark Elf’s flesh with spectral stingers.  Each sting caused the dragoon’s movements to grow more sluggish, as if time was slowing down for him.  This allowed the perfect opportunity for Ioemir and Talis to simultaneously cut down the doomed warrior.<br />
            <br />
“That’s nine dragoons down.  I counted ten, so look lively, lads.”<br />
            <br />
Without warning, a dark shape darted out from around a small tree behind Ioemir.  Sword drawn back in preparation for a decapitating strike, the last dragoon closed in on the Wood Elf.<br />
            <br />
“Ioemir!” Talis shouted.  “Behind you!”<br />
            <br />
Ioemir turned, and, upon seeing the Dark Elf bearing down, instinctively began to duck.  This was a most fortunate move, as a moment later, an arrow screamed past him, a fraction of an inch from his head.  The arrow found its mark in and through the base of the Teir’Dal’s neck, pinning his body to the tree from which he emerged.<br />
            <br />
“I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again – nice reflexes ye got there, Talis.”<br />
            <br />
“Thanks.”  Ioemir rose to his feet and apprehensively approached the woodsman, who nodded with a faint smile in response.<br />
            <br />
“Just, how on Norrath did you track us down across two continents, an ocean, and open grass lands?”<br />
            <br />
“Ranger,” responded Talis in a half-sarcastic tone.<br />
            <br />
“Oh . . . oh yes, of course.  Well, I’m glad you’ve returned to us.  Although, if I may ask, why?  What caused your change of heart?”<br />
            <br />
As Talis opened his mouth to respond, a loud, slow clapping rang out from the surrounding mist.  From the fog, emerged a familiar Dark Elf.<br />
            <br />
“Zytl,” Lemira said with a sneer.<br />
            <br />
“I applaud you and your comrades on the fine show, Northman.  Indeed I underestimated you.  Ahhh, and Lemira, my sweet.  You are so ravishing when you’ve got that bloodthirsty look in your eyes.”<br />
            <br />
“Your flattery is as empty and vile as you, Zytl.  You and I have unfinished business.”  The lady knight gripped her sword tightly, eager for the chance to sting her nemesis.<br />
            <br />
“You know, my sweet, you’re absolutely right.  Allow me to finish it!”  In a flash of armor and midnight-hued flesh, Zytl thrust forth his hand, charged with a pale purple energy.  Lemira gasped out a scream as she fell to the ground in pure agony.<br />
            <br />
“Filthy snake!”  Talis drew his bow and shot at Zytl, who sidestepped and caught the arrow.<br />
            <br />
“Lemira!”  Aelwyl and Heldorm ran to the fallen paladin.  The shaman leaned over Lemira and propped up her head.  <br />
            <br />
“Heldorm.”  Lemira’s voice was shaken and weak.  “You’re hurt.”<br />
            <br />
Heldorm looked down at his bleeding, gashed side.  “Aye, it appears so.”  He channeled healing energy into the wound, but it did little.  “I’ll worry about that later, but what about ye?  Where’re ye hurt?”<br />
            <br />
Lemira chuckled.  “Everywhere.  Zytl *cough* focused his hatred into a single point, and hurled it at me.  Oldest . . . *gasp* oldest trick in the shadow knight book.”<br />
            <br />
A few small streams of blood from Heldorm’s wound began to drip on Lemira’s armor.<br />
            <br />
“Eh, sorry about that, lass.  Looks like that one’ll bug me for a while.”<br />
            <br />
“No, here, allow me.”  Lemira closed her eyes, sucked in a deep breath, and focused all of her healing powers into her right hand, which took on a brilliant white aura.  She placed her hand on Heldorm’s wound and released the energy.  The Northman’s body tingled with a warm, peaceful heat.  A moment later, Lemira lowered her hand, revealing completely healed flesh.<br />
            <br />
“The laying of hands,” Aelwyl said in a hushed, almost reverent tone.  “Lemira!  That could kill you in your state!”<br />
            <br />
“It appears *cough* that that is inevitable.  I just wish . . .” tears began to stream down the lady knight’s face.  “I just wish that I could have slain that snake Zytl, and brought his head back to Freeport.  But . . .”<br />
            <br />
“Ye may yet, lass.  Ye may yet.”  Heldorm rested Lemira’s head back down on the ground and stood to face the last dragoon.  “Aelwyl, watch over her.  Don’t ye dare let her die.”<br />
            <br />
Aelwyl nodded and began to mumble quiet prayers to Tunare, summoning forth as much healing magic as she could.  <br />
            <br />
Zytl laughed quietly to himself, delighted in the display of suffering.<br />
            <br />
“Shut up, ye beast!  Shut up!”  Heldorm snapped and, aided by the swords of Ioemir and Talis, charged Zytl.  No matter how precise and powerful their strikes, the elite dragoon parried them with ease.<br />
            <br />
Back at Lemira’s side, Ecbus approached.<br />
            <br />
“Ecbus,” Lemira smiled up at the Gnome.  “When you get back to Erudin, tell Blorg that I am sorry for what I have said to him, and that I regret not getting to know him better.”<br />
            <br />
Ecbus swallowed a lump in his throat, his cheeks growing flush.<br />
            <br />
“You’ve got a great friend, Ecbus.  I envy you.”<br />
            <br />
Something welled up inside of Ecbus, some primal seed of rage that all living beings on Norrath had buried deep within themselves.  The rage boiled so hot and fierce, he could not control himself any longer.<br />
            <br />
“Ecbus?”  Aelwyl watched the Gnome stride in the direction of the battle.  “Where are you going?!  Get back here!”<br />
            <br />
“Everyone!  Back away!”  Ecbus commanded.<br />
            <br />
“What?”  Heldorm looked back briefly.  “Stay back, Ecbus!  We’ll handle this!”<br />
            <br />
“No . . . I will.”<br />
            <br />
At this, Zytl stopped his attack and stepped back.  His three foes looked at each other and stepped back as well.<br />
            <br />
“Please,” the Dark Elf laughed.  “Please show me your prowess in battle, little one.  Would you like to borrow a sword?”<br />
            <br />
“No.  No swords.”  Ecbus raised his arms and shouted something in Gnomish.  From nowhere, a great, cold wind blew across the faces of all those present.  Ethereal spheres of blue-white energy coalesced on the Gnome’s arms, quickly building into an intense proportion.  Zytl, realizing that he may indeed be in some danger, raised his sword and prepared to throw it at the conjurer.  But a moment before he could actually execute the attack, an enormous comet of magical ice slammed down on him from the heavens, shaking the earth as it landed.  When the spray of snow and ice subsided, only a frost-covered figure of Zytl remained, frozen in the same position as when he was about to release his sword.  The figure cracked slightly, and then fell to pieces with the sound of a thousand metallic rings being dropped on a stone floor.<br />
            <br />
Ecbus’s comrades slowly turned toward him with a look of pure shock.<br />
            <br />
“Well,” Ecbus began, dusting off his robe, “what’s so surprising?  They don’t call me the ‘Wizard of Cogwheel Street’ for kicks.”<br />
            <br />
“Wait just a moment!” Heldorm barked.  “Ye mean to tell me, that we went through all o’ that travellin’ back and forth on the rottin’ cart when ye coulda just teleported us and saved us days?!”<br />
            <br />
“Well . . . ummm . . . not exactly, you see I uh, heh, yeah real funny story behind that.  I, uh, I uh . . .”<br />
           <br />
“Ye what?”<br />
            <br />
“I kinda sorta never . . . researched that spell.”<br />
            <br />
Heldorm’s eyes shot open wide and he began to rant in his native tongue.<br />
            <br />
“Heldorm!  Heldorm!”  Talis tried to calm the Northman.  “You’re just wasting your breath and energy.  There’s no need to go off like that.  Zytl is defeated, and that’s all that matters, alright?”<br />
            <br />
Heldorm took a deep breath and calmed himself.  “Aye, aye yer right.  We need to move on.”<br />
            <br />
The shaman returned to Aelwyl and Lemira.  “How’s she doin’?”<br />
            <br />
“She’s still very weak.  I’ve done all I can, but . . . I just don’t know.  We need to get her somewhere that has greater healing facilities than I can offer . . . and quickly.”<br />
            <br />
From the Nektulos entrance, the sound of clanking armor suddenly arose.  The battle-weary adventurers readied their weapons once again.<br />
            <br />
“Not again,” sighed Ioemir.<br />
            <br />
“Wait.”  Talis squinted through the fog.  “They’re not Teir’Dal.”<br />
            <br />
“I would hope bloody well not,” a Human voice responded.  Through the misty veil, a man clad in armor bearing the insignia of Freeport stood before Ioemir.  Behind the newcomer, an entire squadron of knights emerged.  <br />
            <br />
“Valcar,” Lemira gasped out.  “I’ve never been so glad to see you in my life.”<br />
            <br />
“Lemira?”  Valcar craned his neck to see the lady knight lying on the ground.  “By the gods what happened to you?”<br />
            <br />
“Had a little run in with Zytl.”<br />
            <br />
“Zytl?  In the name of Mithaniel Marr, woman, you will not rest until that Dark Elf is dead, will you?”<br />
            <br />
“Ye don’t have to worry about that anymore, lad.”<br />
            <br />
“You mean he is as last slain?  Where is he?”<br />
            <br />
Ecbus pointed to the large puddle some distance away.  “Over there, although there’s probably not much left to take back to Freeport, that is, unless you’ve got an empty flask or water skin with you.”<br />
            <br />
Valcar laughed.  “Jolly good news.”<br />
            <br />
“Valcar.”  Lemira weakly grasped her fellow knight’s hand.  “How did you know we were here?”<br />
            <br />
“Lady Lemira, you should know by now – we’ve got ears and eyes all over this region.  Nothing goes on here that we don’t know about.”<br />
            <br />
“And for that *cough* I am grateful.”  Lemira squeezed Valcar’s hand tighter and smiled as much as she could.<br />
            <br />
Valcar stood and faced Heldorm.  “Thank you for taking care of her before our arrival.  I will escort her back to Freeport where she can receive medical treatment from our clerics.  My men will stay here and secure the area.”<br />
            <br />
Two of Valcar’s men brought out a stretcher and gently lifted Lemira onto it.<br />
            <br />
“Wait,” Lemira insisted before they carried her off.  “My friends, please, come to me.”<br />
            <br />
Heldorm and his companions gathered around the paladin.<br />
            <br />
“Thank you all for saving me . . . a second time, as I recall.  I am unaccustomed to having such friends, if you can believe such a thing.”<br />
            <br />
“Well,” said Ecbus, “as a matter of fact – OW!”  His words cut short by Aelwyl’s firm step on his foot.<br />
            <br />
Lemira laughed.  “It’s okay, I know my manner can be a bit off-putting.  But I just want you all to know, you have earned a place in my heart.  And anytime you should be in need, just call on me, and I will do whatever I can to help you.  All right, that’s all I wished to say.  I’m ready to go.”<br />
            <br />
The Freeport knights, led by Valcar, carried their comrade off toward the forest’s exit.<br />
            <br />
Heldorm looked intently at each his remaining friends.  “We ready to finish this?”<br />
            <br />
Aelwyl and Ioemir nodded, taking a place by the Northman’s side.<br />
            <br />
“Well,” Ecbus rubbed his chin nervously.  “I’ve been thinking about this since I saw Lemira injured and since I slew Zytl, and . . . I must say, I’m just not cut out for this.  Ioemir, I’m sorry, but I just can’t go on.  I need time to take a step back and recollect myself.”<br />
            <br />
“It’s okay, Ecbus, I understand.”  Ioemir knelt down before the Gnome and rubbed his head.  “Thanks for all your help, shortie.”<br />
            <br />
“Bleh!  I thought I said to quit doing that!”<br />
            <br />
“Where ye gonna go, lad?”<br />
            <br />
“Oh, probably hang back here with the knights until our Erudite friends return.  Then, back to Blorg, I kinda miss the big guy.”<br />
            <br />
“Talis?”  Ioemir asked, seeing the ranger talking to the lieutenant of the knights.<br />
            <br />
Talis approached Ioemir and pulled something from his belt.  “I’ve been asked to stay here and aid with the Commonlands defense.  They need my eyes and ears to keep watch for any retaliatory forces.  Ioemir, I hope you understand, my friend.”<br />
            <br />
“Yes, it’s alright, Talis.  This fight is for Heldorm, Aelwyl, and I now.  We started this, and now we finish it.  What is that you have?”<br />
            <br />
The ranger handed Ioemir his old leather charm.  “Take it.  It was given to me many years ago as a protective charm.  I can defend myself now, so I think your daughter could use it more.  That’s why I returned to you all – it would not be fair to your daughter if she was not given the chance that I was denied.”<br />
            <br />
Ioemir embraced Talis.  “Thank you so much, Talis, for everything.  I’m glad we could put that ugliness behind us.”  <br />
            <br />
“So am I, Ioemir.”  The ranger looked toward Aelwyl and Heldorm and continued, “Meklozanth has most likely taken the child to an old temple built in honor of the god he worships.  It lies only a few miles due west of here.  May the gods be with you all, and strike down that foul snake for me as well.”<br />
            <br />
Talis took one last look at his friends and then returned to the Freeport company.  <br />
            <br />
“Heldorm?” Asked Ioemir.  “Do you still have the elixir?  Is it safe?”<br />
            <br />
“Aye, I do, it’s in here.”  The shaman reached into a side pouch, but immediately withdrew his hand in pain.<br />
           <br />
“What in the name of . . .”<br />
            <br />
Aelwyl and Ioemir gathered around the open pouch, which was now filled with a caustic brown substance.  Ioemir’s heart sank.<br />
            <br />
“Is that the elixir?”<br />
            <br />
“Aye,” Heldorm was finally able to get out.  “It must’ve gone acidic somehow and ate right through the vial.”<br />
            <br />
“That . . . would’ve eaten right through my daughter’s innards had she swallowed it.”<br />
            <br />
“Ioemir, I’m so sorry, I don’t know what to say.  I’ve failed ye and yer daughter.”<br />
            <br />
Ioemir stood silent for a moment before inhaling deeply.  “No, Heldorm, it’s not your fault, and I don’t blame you.  Right now, we have a job to finish.  If my daughter is destined to die, then I’ll be damned before I see her die in a filthy place like this!”<br />
            <br />
“Yes,” Aelwyl said with grave determination, “let’s finish this.”<br />
            <br />
“Alright.”  Heldorm nodded to his companions then turned to face the direction in which Talis pointed.  “Due west we go.”<br />
            <br />
         <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Meklozanth knelt before the wall length mirror of black, alien glass.  Beside him, lies Ioemir’s daughter, restrained in the Xanzokek’s spider-like clutches.<br />
            <br />
“The Glass of Leng,” Meklozanth addressed the mirror, “I must speak with my Lord.”<br />
            <br />
The ebony glass rippled for a moment before displaying a pulsating, dark blue mass of chaotic energy.  The mercurial shape hung silently, taking on many forms – sometimes a great blob of chaos, other times a circular being from which countless tentacle-like appendages protruded.<br />
            <br />
“My Lord, Hastur, it is done.”<br />
            <br />
“You have the child in your possession?” An ethereal, guttural voice asked.<br />
            <br />
“Yes, she is here.”<br />
            <br />
“Good.  My hour draws near.  But there is one obstacle that still stands in my way.”<br />
            <br />
“Obstacle?”<br />
            <br />
“Yes, look.”<br />
            <br />
The image of Hastur faded away, only to be replaced by a view from deep within the forest.  There, three outsiders made their way toward the temple.<br />
            <br />
“Hmm, two Feir’Dal and . . . a Northman.  Why, in fact it’s the same Northman I had a run in with at the Butcherblock docks.”  The Teir’Dal’s features slackened.  “So, Zytl and the others have failed.”<br />
            <br />
“Yes,” said Hastur, his image returning to the mirror.  “They have perished.”<br />
            <br />
“Lord Hastur.  Forgive me for showing my weakness, but I alone have not the power to defeat these three.”<br />
            <br />
Hastur let out a low, mocking laugh.  “I know, my child.  I have rained misfortune upon misfortune down upon them – undead, gnolls, dissension among themselves, even the sea itself.  Yet still the Fates of your world conspired to keep them alive.  I feel a more . . . personal intervention is necessary.”<br />
            <br />
“What do you ask of me, M’Lord?”<br />
            <br />
“I have two gifts for you, Meklozanth.  Gifts from my world that wield great power in yours.”  From the other side of the glass, something began to emerge; a great, slimy tentacle slowly pushed its way out of the mirror.  Uncurling itself, the tentacle dropped a heap of cloth on the floor before the necromancer.<br />
            <br />
“The first is a cloak, the Cloak of Dark Prayer, woven from my own flesh.  Put it on.”<br />
            <br />
Meklozanth picked up the dark brown cloak and began to put it on.  Before he could, however, the cloak wrapped itself around his body and seemed to form onto its wearer, as if a living parasite.  The Teir’Dal raised the hood, hearing a cacophony of otherworldly whispers in his ears.<br />
            <br />
“The voices you hear are the prayers and litanies honoring me from countless beings throughout this universe.  They will give you power, as long as you continue to wear this robe.”<br />
            <br />
Another tentacle emerged, dropping something that hit the floor with a metallic clang.  Meklozanth picked up the second gift and held it before him with a fascinated smirk.<br />
            <br />
“A scythe?”<br />
            <br />
“Yes, The Scythe of the Ebon Sun – its blade made from my very bone.  It can slice through anything, and is unbreakable.<br />
            <br />
“But Meklozanth, my child.  I have put my faith in you before, and you have failed.”<br />
            <br />
“Please, M’Lord, forgive me.”<br />
            <br />
“Do not despair, you are forgiven.  But I want to make sure these three . . . obstacles are dealt with.  Nothing must stand in my way.  Norrath will be mine!”<br />
            <br />
“Of course, M’Lord.  What will you have me do?”<br />
            <br />
“You already have all you need, Meklozanth – the cloak, the scythe, the Xanzokek.  I have placed two guardians from my world outside of this temple.  They will ensure that our enemies find you.  All that remains for you is to kill them and drink the soul of the child.  Her life force is all that is needed for you to reach your true power and usher in my age – The Age of Pain.<br />
            <br />
“For now, however, I must rest.  The interaction between our worlds requires tremendous power, even from myself.  Go now and finish this, Meklozanth Xolasus.  Soon the universe itself will be in my – will be in our grasp.”<br />
            <br />
“As you wish, M’Lord.”  Meklozanth knelt before the fading image in the mirror, which soon returned to an empty blackness.  The Dark Elf turned to the Xanzokek with a smile.  Rubbing his hand across the surface of the crystal sphere, the evil machine sprang to life and began to drain the very life from the Wood Elf child.<br />
 <br />
* * *<br />
 <br />
“I’ve seen more of this forest than I’ve ever cared to see,” said Ioemir, brushing away long, drooping vines of ivy.<br />
            <br />
“Aye, and with any luck, we’ll never have to see it again.”<br />
            <br />
“Look,” Aelwyl pointed to a spot some distance ahead of them, “a stone path.  That must lead to the temple.”<br />
            <br />
After a few moments of walking, the three adventurers came face to face with the temple entrance. <br />
            <br />
“Ye know, there’s somethin’ about that temple that just doesn’t seem right.  Can’t really put a finger on it.”<br />
            <br />
“Yes, I have the same feeling.”  Aelwyl pulled her shawl tighter.  “It’s as if the angles of its architecture are . . . wrong somehow.”<br />
            <br />
Ioemir inhaled a breath of air with an expression of repugnance on his face.  “Something smells more vile than normal here.”<br />
            <br />
“Shhh,” said Aelwyl, “listen – do you hear that?”<br />
            <br />
The three stood in silence for a few moments.<br />
            <br />
“Aye, it’s almost like . . . breathin’?”<br />
            <br />
Suddenly, from behind them, two of the forest’s trees sprang to life and grabbed them with wormy, branch-like appendages.  Heldorm struggled to free himself, but to no avail.  He managed to turn his head enough to see the other creature.  It was about the size of a small tree, with black, rubbery skin.  Where branches should have been were multitudes of thick tentacles, and in place of roots were short, stump-like legs.  The beings emitted a chilling, insect-like chittering sound as they tightened their grip around their captives.  A tentacle was wrapped around the mouth of each of the intruders, and a green, noxious fume sprayed into their nostrils.  All three then lost consciousness. <br />
 <br />
            <br />
When the conscious world returned to Heldorm, a dimly lit chamber of pale stone greeted him.  Looking around, the shaman saw Aelwyl and Ioemir shackled to the two surrounding walls; the Northman tried to move, but found himself also bound.  As his eyes adjusted to the low light, Heldorm began to see large figures and what appeared to be letters painted onto the walls.  The images depicted events that he could not even dare to fathom – large figures of hoary-headed beings doing battle against a myriad of grotesquely-shaped creatures; a spherical creature with many, long tentacles being cast into the depths of space; and a sunken, impossibly-angled city, where in the middle stood a tall, humanoid figure with the head of an octopus.<br />
            <br />
“Amazing tale, is it not?”  From the shadows, out stepped Meklozanth.  “It speaks of a cosmic battle that took place eons ago, when the universe was not quite as old as it is now.  It depicts names and places, most of which hurt my tongue to say.  This large man with the head of a sea creature appears to be a very important figure in the story.  He was banished, or so it would seem, by these elder gods, under the waves of a great ocean on this distant and . . . curious little planet, surrounded by eight other worlds.  Fascinating . . .”<br />
            <br />
Ioemir stirred awake.  The first thing he saw was the Xanzokek, holding his daughter in its spidery fingers.<br />
            <br />
“My daughter!”<br />
            <br />
The child turned to her father’s voice and weakly smiled, gurgling out a laugh.<br />
            <br />
“Ahhh so you are her father,” said Meklozanth, walking to the child’s side, caressing her cheek.  “Ioemir, as I recall.  Such a lovely young daughter you have here.  I know it must pain you to see her like this, but fear not, you’ll be reunited with her soon enough.”<br />
            <br />
“Don’t you touch her, you devil!  Release her!  She’s only a child, for the love of Tunare!”<br />
            <br />
“Ha!  Tunare.  Is that truly the limit of your vision, Ioemir?  There are so many more powerful beings out there.”<br />
            <br />
“So Kizdean says.”<br />
            <br />
“Blech!”  The necromancer recoiled in disgust.  “Kizdean Gix – one of my most promising disciples, but ultimately my biggest failure.  He could have shared my power, but instead took the path of peace and tolerance.  The mere thought of it all, churns my stomach.”<br />
            <br />
“I won’t let you harm my daughter, snake.  I promise I shall cut you down.”<br />
            <br />
Meklozanth laughed.  “Words, words, words.  I tremble so.  Have you forgotten your current situation?  You couldn’t break those chains, even if you had your full strength.  But you know, I am quite sentimental.  Three thousand years of live does that to you.  So I grant you your opportunity to strike me down, Ioemir.”<br />
            <br />
The Dark Elf waved his hand and Ioemir’s shackles fell open.  Meklozanth walked over to a small, nearby altar and picked up Ioemir’s sword, before tossing it to its owner.  The Faydark Champion barely caught it, struggling to keep it upright.<br />
            <br />
“Ioemir,” Aelwyl pleaded.  “Don’t do this.  You cannot fight him in your condition.”<br />
            <br />
But the Wood Elf warrior did not listen.  Instead, he charged Meklozanth with a pathetic slash that found nothing but the stone floor.  He attempted to spin around to catch the Dark Elf off guard, but instead was intercepted by a scythe blade.<br />
            <br />
“Noooooo!”  Heldorm screamed.<br />
            <br />
“Ioemir!”<br />
            <br />
Meklozanth grinned in delight as he extracted the blade.  Ioemir stared, stunned at his victor before staggering over to his daughter’s side.  He ran his index finger down his daughter’s soft cheek for one last touch.  The child smiled widely and grasped her father’s finger with her tiny hand, just as she had done mere days ago.  The remaining life slipped from Ioemir, and he quietly slumped to the floor.<br />
            <br />
“Ye bastard!” Heldorm charged forth, but was snapped back by the chains.<br />
            <br />
“That must eat away you, Northman.  Seeing your friend dying on the floor before you, touching his daughter for the last time.  Why, it almost warms my heart.”<br />
            <br />
“Ye have no heart, you sick freak!”  The Northman spit in Meklozanth’s face.<br />
            <br />
The Dark Elf wiped his face, anger welling up inside him.  Slowly holding out his hand, Meklozanth summoned a red orb of energy around Heldorm and violently siphons out some of his life force.  The shaman fell to his knees with a gasp, as if an Ogre has punched him in the stomach.  <br />
            <br />
“Took the fighting spirit right out of you, yes?”<br />
            <br />
But Heldorm raised himself up and stood defiantly.  Meklozanth looked shocked for a moment before life tapping the Northman again.  With a hoarse cry, Heldorm fell to his knees again, coughing out a small spray of blood.<br />
            <br />
“Heldorm, stay down, please,” pleaded Aelwyl.<br />
            <br />
“You should listen to her, Heldorm.  There’s no reason to –“<br />
            <br />
And with that, Heldorm was on his feet again.  Anger welling up more furiously, Meklozanth hit the shaman again with the grim spell, and again, until Heldorm fell with only the chains around his wrists supporting his weight.  The Northman’s breath grew erratic and weak.  <br />
            <br />
“If you even think about standing again, I will do the same to your Wood Elf female.  I doubt she has the stamina you do, my friend.  In fact, I wonder how long yours can hold out.”<br />
            <br />
“Go ahead,” Heldorm began to laugh in a quiet tone, “and find out.  I’ll march right up to the gates of the Hall of Justice with Aelwyl.  I know she loves me, and I love her . . . more than life itself.”<br />
            <br />
“Love – ha!  What a pathetically weak emotion.”  Meklozanth looked over at Aelwyl with a sinister grin.  “But let’s see how much life she has to offer, shall we?”  The Teir’Dal approached Aelwyl and ran his finger slowly down her lips, before life tapping her.  The hierophant crumpled in on herself, gasping and coughing for air.<br />
            <br />
Tribunal, Heldorm petitioned, please hear me.  I have not spoken to you like I suppose I should have, but please listen to me now.  Just this once, give me the strength to help the ones I love.  One last chance at greatness, one last chance to strike down your enemies.<br />
 <br />
            <br />
Far away from the reality of Heldorm and his plight, in the Plane of Justice, stood The Tribunal, six incarnations of justice itself.  Around them, the planar heavens turned endlessly, as they stood guard over the portals to deeper planes of understanding.  <br />
            <br />
Every day on the timescale of the mortals, The Tribunal is deluged with the prayers and petitions of those who worship the path of justice.  Most of these prayers are trivial, and as such, go ignored.  However, once in a great while, there comes a request that makes them listen.  One such prayer from a Kol-Hurn shaman reached their collective ears.<br />
            <br />
A petition for power said The Tribunal.<br />
            <br />
But what kind of power? asked The Tribunal in response.<br />
            <br />
The power to protect the ones he loves.<br />
            <br />
Who is this shaman?<br />
            <br />
He is the wielder of Invictus.<br />
            <br />
So, its time has finally come.<br />
            <br />
Who is this enemy we supposedly share?<br />
            <br />
Meklozanth Xolasus<br />
            <br />
The Tribunal stood silent for a moment at the mention of this name.<br />
            <br />
I know this name.  A judgment must be reached immediately.<br />
            <br />
The guardians of justice raised their hands, and all of their plane and all of the Halls of Justice fell silent.<br />
            <br />
Meklozanth Xolasus.  You are charged with the crime of worshipping powers beyond the realms of Norrath; for the crime of practicing the forbidden art of necromancy; for the slaying of children and other innocence; and for countless other acts of blasphemy.  How does The Tribunal find?<br />
            <br />
Guilty!<br />
            <br />
In unison, The Tribunal slammed their enormous gavels onto the planar floor, shaking the very foundations of the planar fabric.  From the combined impact of their gavels, a small point of energy formed, an infinitely small particle of The Tribunal’s power.  This particle traveled from the foundations of the Plane of Justice, through timeless space, and down into the mortal realm of Norrath, to one specific crumbling temple deep in Nektulos forest.<br />
            <br />
Heldorm looked up at the ceiling above him, as if compelled by an unknown force.  On the ceiling a tiny, glowing drop of energy seeped in and hung there for a moment.  Finally, gravity pulled it down and onto the shaman’s forehead.  Immediately upon contact, the drop of divine energy saturated every fiber of Heldorm’s being.  A feeling of infinite strength and stamina expanded from Heldorm’s body like a wave, shattering the chains that bound him into dust.  Meklozanth turned just in time to see Invictus fly into the hands of Heldorm, whose body glowed with the pure light of Justice, for he had become the living avatar of The Tribunal.     <br />
              <br />
            <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Great story, Rodahn.... good use of dialog to keep the narrative flowing; excellent portrayal of the personalities of several classes....Talis the Ranger, Aelwyl the Druid, the elder shamen of Halas....  I think it's really effective the way you use magic sparingly but at the exact moment.... loved the way Ecbus swelled with rage and smote the Shadowknight with an Ice Comet.  You've got the idea spot-on by drawing the reader in emotionally, like the moment in Surefall, with the evening sunlight and the innocent half-elf girl, whem Iomer was overwhelmed and sobbed...  I've long considered whipping up some EQ storyline myself....this is a huge untapped market with an instant global fan-base, and I'm very proud that you've chosen to give this short story life as seen thru the eyes of our great class, the Shaman.  Obviously, Heldorm is a Battle Shaman as well as an alchemist, and the picture of the shaman council in Halas you painted shows there are many sides to the age-old shaman traditions....woohoo!!  You go, and keep it coming it coming, bud.  Hopefully we'll see Iomer resurrected, but I know that the supreme buff from The Tribunal will allow Heldorm to use Invictus to smite down the evil Necro!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The Scythe of the Ebon Sun found its master’s hand, just as Heldorm lunged at Meklozanth.  And so at last they clashed – the lion and the great serpent; planar steel of Invictus met alien bone of the Scythe, and the sound of their union echoed throughout the universe.  Matching each other’s strikes, the Dark Elf and the Northman battled the breadth of the chamber.   A missed strike of the Tribunal’s hammer disintegrated a nearby pillar, etching its burning dust into the wall behind it.  Heldorm could feel Meklozanth’s power waning.  Focusing this hope, he summoned its power into one final blow, which shattered the Scythe’s blade into countless fragments.  He had the necromancer cornered now.  Grinning menacingly, Meklozanth pulled the hood of the cloak his master had given to him over his head.  A twisted opera of prayers and songs to the Unnamable deluged the Dark Elf for a moment, but soon meshed with the very inner dimensions of his mind.  Heldorm struck out with Invictus, but the blow was harmlessly deflected.  Again and again the shaman struck out, but to no avail.<br />
	<br />
“You see,” Meklozanth laughed in pleasure, “even the feeble powers of The Tribunal are no match for that of Hastur.  Face it, Barbarian, the time of the gods of Norrath has ended!”<br />
<br />
Casting everything aside – life, love, pride, anger – Heldorm dropped Invictus and grabbed onto Meklozanth’s cloak with his bare hands, the power of the Tribunal still glowing throughout him.  For all he was, he began to pull the cloak apart.  Meklozanth’s laughs soon diminished when he could feel the very fabric of the cloak begin to give way.  <br />
<br />
And suddenly, just as it had come to him, the blessing of The Tribunal left Heldorm’s body.  But still he pulled.  The power of the gods no longer drove him, nor did some otherworldly force; only generations of breeding and the very foundations of his race, continued to give Heldorm strength.  Eyes locked into those of his foe, the Northman let out a roar that turned the Dark Elf’s blood even more frigid than it had already been – and the cloak gave way, tearing into two halves, with putrid streams of dark brown ichor oozing from the sheered stitches.<br />
<br />
Meklozanth, visibly shaking, began to back into the Mirror of Leng with a nervous laugh.  “What now, Heldorm?  Both of us are stripped of our advantages.  Oh, except, I still have one.”  The Dark Elf glanced hungrily over at Ioemir’s daughter, still being drained of life in the Xanzokek.  “Soon, she will be drained of life, and my Xanzokek will channel it into me.  And then, nothing can stop me from summoning Hastur into this world.  I will live forever!”<br />
<br />
Heldorm crouched down and picked up Invictus, then turned a quick look at the Xanzokek behind him.<br />
<br />
“Ye’ve lived long enough.”<br />
<br />
“NOOOOOOOOOO!”<br />
<br />
But Meklozanth’s cry was drowned out by the sounds of thousands of shards of glass being shattered, as Heldorm drove Invictus down onto the crystal ball of the Xanzokek.  The evil machine sputtered and shook violently for a moment, before a stream of milky white vapor erupted from the crystal ball’s broken aperture.  The vapor coalesced high in the air, taking on the forms of hundreds of lost souls – souls of whom Meklozanth had feasted upon via the Xanzokek.  The souls turned to the Dark Elf necromancer and plunged into his body.  Meklozanth let out a cry of utter agony, as the undead within him pressed their way out.  Moments later, Meklozanth Xolasus exploded in a shower of blood and viscera.  Heldorm watched with glee as the struggling, milky spirit of his former enemy was restrained and carried off by two of the freed souls.  Those spirits that remained hovered around Heldorm, humming excitedly.  The shaman understood every word they had said perfectly – they were thanking him profusely for their freedom.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of his eye, Heldorm saw movement coming from Meklozanth’s dark mirror.  The Northman approached it, watching a nebulous, alien shape form on its surface.  The shape writhed and swayed silently for a moment, before trying to speak directly to Heldorm through his mind.  Heldorm shook out the dark speech and raised Invictus one last time.  The ensuing blow shattered the mirror’s surface, sending great cracks in a spider web formation in all directions; the alien figure on the other side quickly faded, never again to return.  Invictus, its duty in this world fulfilled, began to crack and crumble in Heldorm’s hands.  Soon, it was no more than a collection of dust and brittle chunks heaped on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Thank ye, my friend.  Ye did incredible.”<br />
<br />
Behind him, the spidery restraints of the Xanzokek opened with a quiet hiss.  Inside, the very weak form of Ioemir’s daughter looked up at the Northman and smiled as best she could.<br />
<br />
“Hang on there, lil one.”  Heldorm gently grasped the infant’s hand, making her as comfortable as possible.  “Hang on just as long as ye can.  Ye’ll see yer father soon.”<br />
<br />
“Heldorm,” Aelwyl’s weak voice called for him.<br />
<br />
Heldorm walked over to Aelwyl and pulled open the restraints, which lost much of their strength after Meklozanth’s defeat.  The shaman and the druid walked solemnly over to Ioemir’s body and to his dying daughter.<br />
<br />
“What now?” Aelwyl asked, tears welling up in her eyes.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, lass.  I don’t –“<br />
<br />
Something glowing suddenly caught Heldorm’s eye.  Below him, a blue luminescent liquid began to pool together.  It was coming from –<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Heldorm said with a hoarse laugh that almost made him cry. <br />
<br />
“What?  What is it?”<br />
<br />
“In my vision back in Halas.  A source of light and darkness met to form a blue, glowin’ liquid.  Look, a stream of Ioemir’s blood and Meklozanth’s blood are meetin’ together.  Light and dark –“<br />
<br />
“Feir’Dal and Teir’Dal,” Aelwyl finished.  “Elven lore has always held that the light and dark Elven races were one being in the beginning.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, and so now it seems they are again.  Please tell me I have one left.”  Heldorm fished around in his various belt pouches until finally, he stopped with a sigh of relief.  “Always keep an empty vial stashed away from the other ones . . . just in case.”  The shaman scooped up some of the blue liquid and tightly secured the vial cap.  “Well, at least we can save the child.  But as for Ioemir . . .”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps we can help him,” said Aelwyl, looking up at Heldorm.<br />
<br />
“Eh? How?  Yer not thinkin’ . . .”<br />
<br />
“Resurrection.”  Aelwyl nodded as she stood.<br />
<br />
“I’m no scholar, but as I recall there hasn’t been a recorded resurrection performed in centuries.  It’s dangerous and only done for a damned good reason.  Besides, I don’t know of any cleric in these parts who would even know how to do it.”<br />
<br />
“There is one who knows.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm gave Aelwyl a quizzical look for a moment before smiling.  “Ymeal.”<br />
<br />
“We’d better get him to Faydwer soon, however.  A soul cannot leave its body for too long before it becomes irretrievable.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, ye get the child, I’ll get Ioemir.”   <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">(Well, here it is, the final installment of my story.  Just want to take this time to thank all of you who took your time to read, and hopefully enjoy the story.  Also, I want to add here, that all of the events and character names in this story were totally made up by me, so any similarity to actual EQ events and names is purely coincidental.  Anyway, enjoy the final chapter, and thank you all again for reading :) )<br />
<br />
“Someone’s coming, Valcar,” Talis whispered to the ground below him.<br />
<br />
“Stand ready.”  Valcar drew his sword, his company of men behind him following suit.<br />
<br />
“Wait.”  The ranger squinted to get a better look, then smiled wide.  “It’s them!  They’re alive!  But –“ Talis’s face suddenly grew long.  “Oh no.  By Karana, no.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm and Aelwyl stepped into the clearing that led to the Commonlands; Aelwyl carrying the shawl-wrapped child, and Heldorm carrying Ioemir’s body, slung over his shoulder.  Within moments, Talis was sprinting up to them.<br />
<br />
“What happened?” Talis asked in horror.<br />
<br />
“Meklozanth got the better of him, but there’s no time fer that now.  We need to be getting’ him to Felwithe . . . now!”<br />
<br />
“His daughter . . .” The ranger looked down at the resting infant.<br />
<br />
“She’s weak,” said Aelwyl distantly, “but Heldorm has the proper cure now.  All we need to do is get back to Halas so he can make more medicine, but the travel to Halas will take a day or more, even by horse.”<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s at least get Ioemir on his way to the Faydark.”  Talis called for another stretcher.  “I understand that the portal to Erudin is still open.  We can send him back through there and then to the spires just outside of Felwithe . . .”<br />
<br />
But for Aelwyl, all outside voices faded into silence.  A sudden wave of pure warmth and love washed over her, as a calm, angelic voice spoke within her mind.<br />
<br />
“Aelwyl,” the voice said wi****lly.  “You have done magnificently.  I am so proud of you.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Mother Tunare, but Ioemir, his daughter, I have failed.”<br />
<br />
“No,” Tunare’s infinite voice said with a slight laugh, “do not greave them yet.  For soon, both shall be reunited  . . .” <br />
<br />
“Aelwyl?” asked Heldorm, waving his hand in front of the hierophant’s face.  “Aelwyl!”<br />
<br />
The Wood Elf finally came to, eyes watering and blinking furiously.<br />
<br />
“What on Norrath happened.  It’s like ye were a zombie for a few moments there.”<br />
<br />
“I was speaking with . . . with Mother Tunare Herself.”<br />
<br />
Many of those in earshot gasped and performed the sign of Tunare at this revelation.  <br />
<br />
“Tunare Herself?”  Talis stepped forward.  “What did she tell you?”<br />
<br />
“Talis, listen to me:  you have to take Ioemir back to Felwithe now.  Seek out Ymeal Whitesoul.  He is the only one who can perform the resurrection.”<br />
<br />
“Resurrection?!” Valcar croaked out, slightly awestruck.  “Even our wisest clerics can not perform such a dangerous procedure.”<br />
<br />
“But Ymeal can!  Talis, go now!  Please!  Heldorm will return to Halas with the child and I will meet you in Felwithe.”<br />
<br />
“But how?” Heldorm looked around in confusion.  “Ye said yerself it was a day or more by horse.  Aelwyl, what did Tunare say to ye?”<br />
<br />
“She said . . .” Aelwyl trailed off, almost unable to control her delight.  “She said there’s a faster way.”  The master druidess called out in a booming voice as great winds summoned forth and opened a portal of air before her.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ymeal stretched his tired bones after slumping into the welcome embrace of a red, velvet chair.  Ever since returning to Felwithe with his sister, he had poured almost every moment of his spare time into the research of a disease plaguing the Halflings known as The Sickness.  It was a horrible disease that greatly accelerated the aging process.  Clerics and healers form all over Norrath came to Rivervale to study the phenomena, but they were no nearer to a solution.  All that was known, was that if this disease could not be eradicated soon, the entire Halfling population of Rivervale would die out in a few generations.<br />
<br />
“Master Ymeal!” someone shouted, wrenching the High Elf from his dozed thoughts.  “There are visitors on urgent business with you!”<br />
<br />
“Urgent business?  Who is it, Moreal?  What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“It’s . . .” Moreal struggled for words of description.  “He’s been . . .”<br />
<br />
“Send them in, Moreal,” Ymeal finally said, waving his hand.<br />
<br />
The great oaken doors of Ymeal’s chambers burst opened with surprising force, and there in the threshold stood Aelwyl and the ranger he had met mere days ago, holding the limp body of someone Ymeal knew.<br />
<br />
“Ioemir?” Ymeal’s heart sank and throat went dry.  “Set him down here!”  The cleric brushed away the few trinkets setting atop his desk to make room.<br />
<br />
“Ymeal,” Aelwyl embraced the High Elf in tears. <br />
<br />
“What in the name of Tunare happened?”<br />
<br />
“The Dark Elf necromancer we were pursuing killed him.”<br />
<br />
“Dark Elf necromancer?  Are you sure?  After all, necromancy was –“<br />
<br />
“Ymeal, please!  He killed Ioemir, but it’s not too late.  Please say it is not too late!”<br />
<br />
“How long ago did it happen?”<br />
<br />
“Two hours,” said Talis, clutching the arm of his fallen friend, “perhaps a little more.”<br />
<br />
Ymeal’s sister, Valyrice, suddenly stepped in.  “Ymeal?  There were some people running and –“ she stopped and gasped at the scene before her.<br />
<br />
“Is there still time?”  Talis asked impatiently.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps,” Ymeal nervously nodded.  “But to resurrect someone is a feat that has not been attempted in many ages.  I don’t know if I can . . .”<br />
<br />
“You’ve got to try, Ymeal,” Aelwyl pleaded.  “He’s your friend.  He’s all of our friend.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.”  Ymeal conceded and inhaled deeply.  Placing his hands above Ioemir’s chest, the master cleric began to chant quietly.  Thin, ghostly wisps of energy appeared around Ymeal’s body and soon traveled down to swarm around Ioemir’s.<br />
<br />
“Ioemir Enothie,” Ymeal called out, “hear me!”<br />
<br />
<br />
Somewhere far between existence and non-existence, a lone soul walked through utter emptiness – his destination unknown to him, but oddly predetermined.  Around him, the wandering soul saw other distant figures, all walking in the same direction.  After what could have been a moment or an eternity, the lone soul began to see something immense shimmer into view.  It was a great city of polished ivory and emerald.  The wandering spirit somehow knew its name – Vanadowyn, and somehow, he knew he had to go there, although he was not quite sure why.  The gargantuan city grew nearer and nearer.  Soon, distinct figures began to appear, and standing right at the entrance, was another soul he knew.  It was a female of the same race, face like an angel, arms open in a warm welcome.<br />
<br />
But then from somewhere in the endless expanse of nothingness, a familiar voice called out.<br />
<br />
“Ioemir!” It called.  “Ioemir!  Hear me!”<br />
<br />
Ioemir.  Yes, that name.  Ioemir was the wandering soul’s name.  But this revelation soon faded, as Ioemir turned back to the beautiful figure waiting for him at Vanadowyn’s entrance.  But the voice suddenly grew much louder, and Ioemir’s spirit could feel a warm light shining behind him.  He turned to behold a “cut” in the darkness – a slice of pure light.  And beyond it, another familiar face, that of a High Elf man.  Ioemir stood transfixed in the light and the warmth it emitted.  The same inexplicable force that had driven him toward the city was now pulling him toward the shining tear in the fabric of nothingness.  He took a few steps toward it, but then turned again toward the city and the angelic figure beckoning him.  <br />
<br />
<br />
“Valyrice,” Ymeal whispered on the other side of death, “I’m losing him.  I need your help.”  His sister stepped up to Ioemir’s body and mimicked her brother’s magic.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Ioemir,” Aelwyl said softly through her tears.  “Come back to us.”<br />
<br />
Talis tightened his grip on Ioemir’s arm and prayed for his return.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back in the void, Ioemir turned to face the tear in the dark, which was growing exponentially larger.  But this time, he saw more familiar faces – a High Elf female, a Wood Elf female, and oddly enough, a Half Elf man.  Their names were still unknown, but Ioemir knew them as friends, and the warmth they poured forth was overpowering.  The High Elf male suddenly reached out with his hand.  Ioemir hesitated, turned back to take one last look at the angelic woman and the gorgeous face of Vanadowyn, then returned to the outstretched hand; he had to take this hand – all the forces of life and death told him so.  With a quick lunge, Ioemir grasped the glowing arm and let himself be pulled into the light.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gasping violently, Ioemir stood up briefly and then fell back onto the table in pain.<br />
<br />
His surrounding friends exploded in joyous relief.  Talis and Aelwyl broke down into tears, embracing Ioemir and laughing.<br />
<br />
“What – what’s going on?”  Ioemir asked weakly.  <br />
<br />
“Welcome back, my friend,” Talis patted him on the shoulder and sucked back a deluge of tears.<br />
<br />
“Back?  From where?”  The Wood Elf champion looked up and around him at all the happy faces staring down at him.  “Ymeal?”<br />
<br />
“I’m here, Ioemir,” the cleric smiled widely down at him.<br />
<br />
“Ummm, why am I lying on a table in your office?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“So I was killed by Meklozanth and resurrected?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Aelwyl said grimly, as Talis dressed his friend’s wounds.  “We barely got you back.  Had we waited just an hour later –“<br />
<br />
But she was spared the contemplation of this thought by a small, angry voice approaching quickly from the great hall.<br />
<br />
“Where’s the snake that hurt Ioemir?  I’ll kill em!  I’ll take my hands and wring their filthy neck!  I’ll rip em –“<br />
<br />
“Woah!  Woah!” said Valyrice, greeting Ecbus at the office door.  “Spare yourself the trouble, he’s right here.”<br />
<br />
“Ioemir!” Ecbus ran to his friend and leapt up on the desk.  He laughed and danced around, all the time clinging to Ioemir’s neck.<br />
<br />
“Good to see you, too, Ecbus,” Ioemir said laughing and patting the Gnome on his back.  “And where there’s Ecbus, there must be . . .”<br />
<br />
“Heywo!” Blorg waved gingerly after stepping inside. <br />
<br />
“Hello, Blorg.  Good to see you again.  No hugs!”  Ioemir stopped the Ogre just as he was about to deliver a critical hug.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Blorg,” said Ecbus sarcastically.  “Or we’ll be performing another resurrection.”<br />
<br />
“Oh please, by Tunare no!” Ymeal groaned mirthfully.  “The first was painful enough.” <br />
<br />
“I suppose I could try to perform it,” a familiar feminine voice announced.  In the doorway, Lemira limped forward, supported by a sturdy cane.<br />
<br />
“Lemira!” Aelwyl stood with concern.  “You’re alright?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” the lady paladin embraced Aelwyl.  “My bones will take a while to heal, but I’ll live.  When I heard what happened, I insisted on coming to see Ioemir.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, and I’m sure you wouldn’t take no for an answer on that one,” teased Ecbus.<br />
<br />
“No, as a matter of fact I would not have.”  Lemira rubbed the Gnome’s balding head, much to Ecbus’s annoyance.<br />
<br />
“And weez glad joo did!”  Blorg said with sudden delight.<br />
<br />
“Hey there, big guy,” Lemira leaned over and kissed Blorg on the cheek.  The Ogre squealed softly and shrunk back in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Well,” sighed Ioemir, “I guess all my friends are back, except . . . where’s Heldorm?  And –“ Ioemir suddenly gasped.  “My daughter!  Is she alright?”<br />
<br />
Everyone in the room simply smiled and remained silent.  Turning to the door in unison, they watched as Heldorm stepped through, carrying a cooing, fidgety infant in his arms.  Ioemir broke down with an intensity that made his tears in Surefall seem insignificant.  <br />
<br />
“Good as new, Ioemir,” said Heldorm handing the Wood Elf his daughter.  “And from the looks of it, so are ye.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Heldorm.  And I cannot thank you enough.  You’ve done for me something I can never repay in an eternity of lifetimes.”<br />
<br />
The Northman grasped Ioemir’s shoulder and smiled.  “By the look in yer and yer daughter’s eyes, I’d say ye just have.”<br />
<br />
“You know,”Aelwyl said, taking a seat next to Ioemir.  “I do believe this child still needs a name.  Perhaps now is as good a time as any.”<br />
<br />
“Ah yes,” Ioemir sighed away the last of his tears, “a name is indeed in order.  Well . . .” Ioemir ponder this task for a moment.  “If there’s one thing that the past week has taught me, it’s that life is a gift.  And you never know how much of a precious gift it is until it’s taken away from you.  So,” Ioemir hoisted up his giggling daughter, “your name shall be Saranaea – ‘the gift’.”<br />
<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
	<br />
“And so that’s how I got my name?” Saranaea asked, looking up at the seated Aelwyl.<br />
	<br />
“Yes,” the aging hierophant replied with a smile.  “You were indeed a gift to everyone, especially your father.”<br />
	<br />
“So, what happened to the others?  Lemira, Blorg, Ecbus . . .”<br />
	<br />
“Well,” Aelwyl leaned back and sighed.  “Let’s see, Lemira returned to Freeport and became the first female to achieve the rank of Consular.  She married Valcar, and together they started a long, noble line of holy defenders, which still exists to this day.”<br />
	<br />
“Ah, I was kind of hoping she and Blorg got together.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl laughed.  “Well, that certainly would have been an . . . odd union.  But speaking of Blorg, he went on to his own bit of fame.  He used his unusual wisdom to aid in the development of many new understandings of the universe’s inner workings.  Quant – quint – something physics.  Anyway, it really helped open the eyes of many of Norrath’s finest scientists.”<br />
	<br />
“So Ecbus finally let him stop being his slave?”<br />
	<br />
“Oh, Blorg was never really Ecbus’s slave.  Ecbus, though, went on to establish an academy for tinkerers in Ak’anon.  Technology really flourished (with some frequent outside aid from Blorg, I might add), and, in a way, Norrath itself became a little more convenient place.<br />
	<br />
“Let’s see, who else?  Ah yes, Ymeal and Valyrice.  Both still live to this day, as you may imagine.  The Koada’Dal live for several millennia.  Ymeal and his sister eventually discovered the cause of the Halfling disease.  The specifics went way over my understanding, but needless to say, the Halflings were extraordinarily grateful.”<br />
	<br />
“That’s good.  What about that ranger man?  Talis?”<br />
	<br />
“Talis remained your father’s good friend up until the day he died.  They met from time to time in the forest and relived their adventures together.  When Talis finally passed on, no one except your father knew where he was buried.  And you know Ioemir, a secret stays a secret with him.”<br />
	<br />
Saranaea’s next question was inevitable:  “And what of Heldorm?”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl was immediately flooded with emotion.  “Oh,” the Wood Elf elder said brushing her hair back.  The years did little to diminish her beauty, only a few streaks of gray hair and faint facial lines.  “He’s been gone for many seasons now.”<br />
	<br />
“So you didn’t have much time together, then?”<br />
	<br />
“Oh yes, we had many seasons, actually.”  Aelwyl leaned down and smiled at her goddaughter.  “And they were good seasons – full of life and happiness.”<br />
	<br />
“And what are my two favorite ladies conspiring about?” Ioemir suddenly walked into his house.  Time had begun to take its toll on the Defender of Kelethin – his eyes and face were cut by deep, yet noble lines; his hair faded into a gray-white hue.  Yet he still maintained much of his strength and vigor.<br />
	<br />
“Father, Aelwyl was just telling me about how I got my name, and about how you and Heldorm and the others fought that Dark Elf.”<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm Snowreader.”  Ioemir smiled and looked deep into the evening sky.  “Now there’s a name I have not heard in ages.”  He continued to peer into the sky as the memories marched one by one past his mind’s eye.<br />
	<br />
“Five hundred years,” Aelwyl shared Ioemir’s stare before finally snapping out of it.  “Saranaea, it’s getting late.  I think I should be going.”<br />
	<br />
“Ohhh, do you have to?  I want to hear more?”<br />
	<br />
“There’s nothing left to tell,” Aelwyl laughed.  “That was the whole story.  So one day, when you have children, you can pass it down to them.”<br />
	<br />
“Well, okay.  Good night.”  The young Wood Elf sprang up and hugged her godmother tightly.<br />
	<br />
“Good night, Saranaea.  I’ll see you in the morning.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl bid Ioemir good night as well and took her leave.  Back at her house, Aelwyl opened a large trunk at the foot of her bed and pulled out an old, dusty blue book from beneath a pile of aging clothing.  The book’s original blue had faded to the color of a cloudy, summer’s day.  The magical, golden lock stopped functioning long ago, so Aelwyl simply opened the book and flipped through several pages of journal entries.  Skimming through the fading, black letters, warm memories of Heldorm seized the Wood Elf’s heart.  Accidentally, flipping too far, Aelwyl came upon a marked page that she had never seen before.  With excited curiosity, the hierophant began to read:<br />
	<br />
”And to Aelwyl, I promise you only this:  When the world grows cold from endless winter, I will be there to warm you in the night; When the stars have burned out into dying embers and plunge into the sea, I will be your only light; Neither man nor beast, nor the whim of any living god can diminish what I feel for you.  If all the forces of this universe conspire against us, I will fend them all back, until you are safe with me.  For if all other memory fades from you, remember this and this alone – you were loved.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl, warm tears streaming down her face, closed the yellowing book and stepped outside.  She looked far to the north, where the aurora undoubtedly glimmered a brilliant multitude of color.  In its beautiful face, deep within the endless Halls of Justice, she knew in her heart that Heldorm was looking down at her, and watching over her as the rest of Norrath slept.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I'm planning on writing 2-3 more that follow Norrath through critical stages of its technological development.<br />
<br />
The next one I write will take place about 1000 years after the main events of the first story, and focus on Saranaea (as a young adult) as the main character.  The other two will most likely only mention the characters from Snowreader in passing.</div></div><hr />
