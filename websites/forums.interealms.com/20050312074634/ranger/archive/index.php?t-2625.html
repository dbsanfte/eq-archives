<br />
It got me thinking, Sunmoon, Anyway to link or setup a Real Time Chat board?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong here, just a suggestion. I love the glade.<br />
<br />
Just thought it would be cool to Talk real time with everyone.<br />
<br />
Also might avoid some clutter threads, since they can be talked about in chat instead of taking up a thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great, just what I need, ANOTHER way to waste time at work. Please don't do this! I'll get fired!<br />
<br />
Just kidding ( mostly ). Sounds like a fun idea to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about the administrative and usage load issue this might cause on the servers themselves... but it would probably cause a lot of useful information to not be recorded for others to use.  Tons of information would be presented chatting that would never get cross-posted into an actual thread for others to reference later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krux</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Braslo, I thought about that,<br />
<br />
but I think it may help clutter in the long run.<br />
<br />
Anything usefull will still more than likely be posted for all to see and comment on.<br />
<br />
Just thinking more how nice it would be to chat and discuss things real time. Easier to do free flow thinking that way *L*<br />
<br />
I think it would also give people a better feel for who there fellow ranger is.<br />
<br />
The chat sight could be setup somewhere else, and just linked to from here, should help with server load.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
LOL Just saw your tag line, thats great. I'm suprised GFay isn't flooded by now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarlyn</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IRC works wonders. Why load The Glade down even more with proprietary live chat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krux</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats was my point, Alot of the glade General Chat is taken up by General chat *L*<br />
<br />
IRC would be cool, if we could get a offical room.<br />
<br />
Only thing though is a sight connected to the glade or linked to would be more likely to be used, than just a Chat room in IRC that someone needs another program to get to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunmoon</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Real time chat has never been a favorite of mine for this community for a number of reasons. More work, more overhead, having to watch out for all the kiddies trying to take over chat rooms, bots, loss of information, arguments breaking out because people read too quick....<br />
<br />
The list goes on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krux</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I understand your points sunmoon, we get too much of that here as it is.<br />
<br />
Well was just a Idea.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any IRC channels they frequent, that have a EQ or Ranger flavor. could you please post them?<br />
<br />
I'm on Seventh Hammer Server, if anyone wants to say Hi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarkaukar</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This board has been a pleasant place to visit since the cleanup.  Before if there were more than 80people on it would bog down, but now there is 180+ with very little errors at all.<br />
<br />
Nice job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krux</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sarkaukar, I agree with you completly. <br />
<br />
My thought was more of just a way to get to know your fellow ranger better, since chat rooms are more Chatty.<br />
<br />
Nothing to do with The Glade itself.<br />
<br />
By cleaning up clutter I only ment that some of the post , like &quot;I just got swiftwind or Yeah I'm a pathfinder now&quot; might go there instead where the person can get back the instant congrats.</div></div><hr />

I've been auto joining, Rangers and TheGlade but I'm the only one ever in them.</div></div><hr />
