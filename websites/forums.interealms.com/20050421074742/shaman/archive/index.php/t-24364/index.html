Seems it's random drop, as rare as the random zone drops you get once in a while, maybe on the same loot table.<br />

Heh, slugworms were selling for 150k+ on my server. I doubt people were buying at that price though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have seen the slugs and scoriae on sale for 60+K, augs up for up to about 400K. Been tracking the more expensive augs to see if / when they sell, but they're not budging. Reckon if folks had that kind of cash they'd spend it on runes or kit or summat. Whatever they're doing with it, they don't seem to be wasting the pp buying top end augs.</div></div><hr />

Quite funny coz it starts out with folks complaining that only jewellers, poisonmakers and alchemists can make these, but rapidly turns into the rogues and shaman saying they can't make them either coz bits are stupid rare.</div></div><hr />

A friend upgraded an FT1 aug to radiant - FT3; no further augments.  Sold it in 1 night for 300kp (more cash than I have ever seen in EQ).  All I can do is shake my head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far I've seen it drop or a guildie has, in every OOW zone except MPG &amp; Dranik's Scar.<br />
<br />
Best rate seems to be Dranik's hollows instances. &amp; then the drop-rate still sucks.<br />

I've grouped a bit in WoS and hunted everywhere in Harbringer's Spire ( killed dozens of nameds ) and have yet to see either one of these drop.  Have had about 5 Discordling Dust (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=72065) drop in that time -- but I have no use for that.<br />
<br />
I had heard that the worms might only be a rare additional drop from nameds ... anyone care to add in on this?<br />
<br />
How about the frequency in the Dranik's Hollows expeditions?  Do they seem to drop rarely from anything, or only nameds?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info =)</div></div><hr />

They can drop from anything in the zones where they drop.  However, named mobs have a rare chance of dropping an additional item after the regular drop, so they may drop slightly more often off of named.</div></div><hr />
