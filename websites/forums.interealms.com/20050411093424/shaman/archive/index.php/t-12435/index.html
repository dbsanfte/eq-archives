<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have zero knowledge of computers really.... kinda surprised I got the first magelo to show the way I wanted it :)<br />
<br />
So now I want to add my rogue too... anyone know what newb mistake I made?  I'll tell you that all I did was prettymuch copy the first and change the address to my rogue.  Then for what should show up I just used &quot;Gargas&quot; where before there was &quot;Googear&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm. GooGear shows up as a shaman and Gargas shows up as a 60 rogue. <br />
Not sure what the problem is? Did you try purging your cache? (Under IE go to Tools menu, Internet Options, and on the General page (should be first one that pops up) select Delete Files. <br />
I've also heard that holding down control and clicking reload will force a re-download of the page from the server. Might try that before you purge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks for the reply... yeah i got it figured out.  it was all screwed up but i think it's right now :)</div></div><hr />
