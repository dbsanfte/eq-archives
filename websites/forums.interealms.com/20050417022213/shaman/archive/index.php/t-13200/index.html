<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now i know what the first thing your going to say is, go look at other threads! well i have tried most if not all of the things said. I'm a 55 iksar shaman on cazic and was wondering is there anywhere i can solo and get 1% every 2 kills? I've did hhk til 54 and its just no good anymore, i've tried dulak and its like 5-6 kills for 1%! I've tried the torigina mines and its super hard to single pull there (any tips?) never tried chardok or skyfire, and planes solo just seems to hard for me. Well if you have any suggestions on where to fight or to change any of my gear (magelo at bottom) plz post. I'll try anything dont be afraid to post lol! Thanks ahead of the time for the help =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm.  That's kinda tough.  Don't know your playstyle, but...  First I'd improve your HP and melee skills, otherwise it's gonna be tough to solo stuff.  At 55 I was soloing in maidens.  I did it like this.  Get a pet kit for rover, and outfit him.  Might be a good idea to have a spare just incase you have to run for the zone or rover bites the biscuit.  Next have all your buffs up to maximize your HP's, or donate and get aego/virtue, and KEI would be a must.  Got to maidens zone in just to the right is a big boulders this is where you want to pull to and park your doggie here.  Now look for any goranga gatherers, lookout, or followers, these are what you want to pull.  Pull with slow run to rock, sick pet, and root/rot his sorry butt!  Rinse and repeat until dead.  Second alternative is PoJ prisoners.  At 55 i didn't get rat adds, or aggro.  You need to insure that the iskar Sralm is not in his cell if you are pulling near zone out.  He will aggro if you pull another prisoner or sentry.  If he is up you can root/rot him by zone out.  Once he's dead you can pretty much pull anything by zone out without additional aggro.  What I do though is run to the cell tgt a prisoner, then move to max distance away and pull with slow.  These both can be done solo, it's not easy but it is doable.  As a side note, while I soloed in maidens I maxed all my melee skills.  When I got there at 54, pierce was 190, 1hb 101, and 2hb was 161.  Left maidens at 55 with all maxed at 200!  Good luck and let me know if this works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">personally I like doing Goo's in PoD.<br />
<br />
the rotting piles of flesh and biles, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
It was possible at 52.. not effecient though, hard fight.. but at 55 the fight wasn't too bad.  and after I dinged 56 it goes perty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok i think ill try the ME stuff there and try and max piercing, but any suggestions on making hp better? once i get about 9kish im going to get a earring of sollestic or tae ew shield. But anything else that has decent hp that wont take to much of my other stats away?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okayz, I tried ME and well.....thought it was horrible hehe. No offense but it took me around 10 minutes (4 Ebolts 1 plague and pet attacking) to kill one and it didnt even give me close to 1% exp in regular. Maybe .5% per kill so thats about 3% an hour. Not really that great in my option. I guess ill just stick to PoN/PoI/PoD groups since i get .5% a kill not much downtime and kills are fast if your in good group. Thanks anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try PoD.  i'm getting 1% a kill there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can you all post some PoD tactics? Like where are you pulling from, where is you camp set up?<br />
<br />
Tia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PoN yard trash was giving me 1% a kill (all but ravens and young bats) until 58. but imo pop solo takes too long to be worth it. I only root rot when im LFG or can only play for a short time. which is happening more and more these days =\<br />
<br />
anyway... at 55 I dont remember much being 1% every 2 kills. you could try poj prisioners. Katta is nice because of how easier they are, not .5% a kill but you can wipe them out fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yea some PoD tactics for the goos would be nice. Like where you set camp up how you kill them (pet or rot) what they hit for how many hp etc. Also tryed katta guards and there really hard to single pull. i was taking the ones at the entrance tho. If this isnt a good spot where is? Also there pretty hard for not even giving .5% a kill in my option when i could do something like PoN trash i could kill one by the time i kill 2 katta guards and the exp would be easier and faster in PoN, put i know people that know katta well (which i dont) that could solo pretty well there.</div></div><hr />
