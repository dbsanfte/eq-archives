<br />
Gore the dragon is DL has an AE which is 750 and 70% slow. It also last 3 minutes. Can Radiate Cure and DAura remove the slow effect of the spell?<br />
<br />
Also do you have to be in melee range for DD spells to be fully effective?<br />
<br />
Also if you know any little tricks to the guy Please feel free to share.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The dragon died so fast there was no real strategy.  I think she lived for like 30ish seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be careful because Gore is LOS aggro.  If you can see her and she is facing your way, you are now on her aggro list.  Once she takes care of those closer to her, she WILL come clear across the zone to find you.<br />
<br />
We fought her near the west zone wall at around 5000, -1000 or so on a frozen ice lake.  There's a nice hillock there for the casters to hide behind.<br />
<br />
Gore is kiteable but because she summons you have to aggro with proximity or a spell, then just keep ahead of her.  She won't summon until she takes a certain amount of damage.<br />
<br />
By POP standards her HP and AOE are laughable, just keel her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, get a bard with Lost Composition of Erjav or whatever it's called and have him kite her for a couple of minutes.  It's a mana drain, and once you take cheals out of the picture any mob gets easier.  <br />
<br />
Gore only has 32k hp, so we just have everyone nuke like crazy.  Don't bother with cheal chains on a MT or anything, just fast, group heals and nukes away.  <br />
<br />
I think Gore is probably the easist of the Kunark dragons actually.  Possibly Trak I guess.  Tale is easy, but his fear is pretty hard on folks below 60.  Get folks over 60 and Tale gets a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Freezing Breath (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=845&amp;source=Live). There are no counters on this spell. Duration is 5 minutes. RC2 and RC3 will have a better chance to remove it than RC1. But since she will just recast it anyway, your best bet is high cold and magic resist. Bring in the Bards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gore the dragon is DL has an AE which is 750 and 70% slow. It also last 3 minutes. Can Radiate Cure and DAura remove the slow effect of the spell?<br />
<br />
Also do you have to be in melee range for DD spells to be fully effective?<br />

<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />
<br />
My advice:<br />
<br />
1) If you have low 50s on your raid, don't depend on them for ANYTHING. They will spend most of the fight feared.<br />
<br />
2) I usually have a Bard kite her before engaging and if the Bard has the above mentioned Lost Composition, takes about 1.5-2mins to drain her dry (if that). Otherwise, the Bard eats her weak cleric nukes and when she starts casting low level spells (like Strike and Furor and Smite), she's ready to be owned.<br />
<br />
3) If you're 65 with less than perfect resists, you'll still resist her AEs more often than not due to level.<br />
<br />
4) She dies FAST usually. People xp on PoP mobs who have more hp than she does.<br />
<br />
I usually engage her near BW zone in that flat, clear area. A lot of times, the clerics can melee and nuke since her dps is so abysmal. Defensive is NOT NEEDED by any stretch of the imagination. Gore is 1 or 2 grouped a lot on Torv from what I've seen, but these are usually level 65 characters with Luclin+ gear.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't know if cures will work for her slow. She usually died so fast (I'm talking like 15-30 seconds, depending on how many wizards/mages were present) no one even thought to try :)</div></div><hr />

I never bothered to worry about it, but I'm fairly sure I tried radiant1 and it didnt clear it the first time we took her out.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Yes, although poison nuke spear of torment is the only nuke type that we can land on her.<br />

Thank you for your time.<br />
<br />
Easily one grouped, even done it with clr/shm/druid/pal/necro.  (all level 65 but druid though). Long as you have a confident-capable cleric, you should be able to mostly nuke with some patch healing here and there..<br />
<br />
Pull her to BW just inside the valley there, I always snagged her with the druid, and malos'ed just as she got in range.  If you have a high cr/mr, its mostly a nonissue on her ae's.</div></div><hr />
