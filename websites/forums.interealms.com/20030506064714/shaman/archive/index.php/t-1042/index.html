<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sometime a little while ago someone asked if the FG's in solb could be soloed.  A number of shaman said yes, all but the ones in Naggy's lair due to being unable to single pull.  Fair enough, last two nights i thought i'd give it a shot. <br />
<br />
Two nights ago, killed first two (the ones that most raids skip over by going through lava), single pulled, np at all.  To my disappointment, everything else was dead.<br />
<br />
Last night, tried again, and again many were killed.  However, king was dead but others in his room were there, i single pulled/killed.  Now, i wasn't sure if Warlord Skarlon was up, so i walked around and saw an FG in his area.  After about 2 secs, proximity aggro kicked in and both that FG that could see me and Skarlon came barreling out.  Being partly unprepared as i didnt even think they'd be there, i died.  Got res but had to log for the night after that. <br />
<br />
Question is this.....how do you single Skarlon area since i can't see to cast without getting into aggro proximity range???  <br />
<br />
Having asked this question, i'm going to log on now and try again before i see a response to this :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am lvl 60.  Last night i tried again, and yet again some wankers went in - killed a few FG's (including king) and left, however, they did leave 2 up in king room and Skarlon + 1 in his room.  I single pulled all of them, however, the previous night there was a FG warrior right by the window out into the lava in Skarlon's room.  Since it was again partially cleared, it looks like the previous group may have gotten that one guy this time, allowing me to single skarlon.  Having said that, and i'm guessing there are normally 2 + skarlon in his room, my question about single pulling still stands.<br />
<br />
P.S. I pulled skarlon, pet attacked, skarlon on pet, i malo'ed, tried to slow twice but was resisted both times, tried a malosini (between torpor's) and finally got it to stick on second malosini, then slowed.  Way back when i used to do fg's in low 50's (and i never pulled then so i was never sure exactly where all the spawn points were then)....resists didn't seem to be as much of a problem as now, shrug.</div></div><hr />
