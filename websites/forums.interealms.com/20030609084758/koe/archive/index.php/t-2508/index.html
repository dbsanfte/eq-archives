<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dalnirs will the location of hunt for this week.<br />
<br />
Calon and I have talking about this for awhile now.  When we were about this same level with Bear and Klydon, Dalnirs was one of our favorite dungeons.  It has a great xp bonus and even in Lv 30 hell lv the xp seems to fly here :).<br />
<br />
We will gather at the FM OT zone line at our normal time or a little earlyer if everyone can make it.  From there will head over to WW.  One of the nice things and a problem at times also is that Dalnirs is far way and hidden from areas.  Because it is hidden away there are not many players there usally.<br />
<br />
The first night there we will explore the 1st lv and give everyone a feel for the dungeon.  Depnding on the how everyone likes it we will then try the 2nd floor at some point in the near future.<br />
<br />
The first floor of Dalnirs is easy to get in and out of.  But to get to the 2nd floor you must drop down a long hole with no way back.  To exit the 2nd floor there is a teleporter out, but it is back in a ways from where you drop down.  This makes CR a little bit hard here but the xp bonus is worth it we feel. <br />
<br />
To get to the 3rd floor is another drop down with no way back up.  We will not be visiting it for some time as the mobs on the 3rd floor are higher lv and mostly casters.  Also to get out from the 3rd floor requires you to go past the main big mob who nukes very hard.  He used to like to nuke Ice Comet alot not sure he if still does or not, but being nuked by 1000+ dam is not my idea of fun.<br />
<br />
Mobs we will encounter here are evenly split between melee types and caster types, so some MR gear is helpful if you have some.  As you have seen with the Gob casters in Nurga being nuked on can hurt ).<br />
<br />
Calon and I will post more on this dungeon later.  He has written a good walk though for the KoE newsletter in the past that was based on the time we spent there.  I will see if he can repost it here.  There are certin helpful hints to know for Dalnirs.  1 example is if you cast S heal the mob will turn from agroed tank and go straight for you.  With SKs here they may or may not use HT right away but a S Heal will get the HT everytime.  This makes this a good place to practice small fast heals and agro management.<br />

Hammr is currently level 34 and is bound in FV, if you have the room I would love to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will most certainly be there with Aeriela if you'll have me :)  Always wanted to take my monk to Dalnir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, Dalnir *Sighs with happy memories*<br />
<br />
My earliest grouping with KoE was in Dalnir while I was still a petitioner at roughly 30th level.  Had some epic battles there, and most of KoE at the time would switch to alts to come to Dalnir.<br />
<br />
For quite a while Dredwind (ryu's SK) and myself were often to be found grouped here, causing mayhem.<br />
<br />
Good XP, Good Pay.  It does not come cheap however.  You should expect a good fight at all times.  Now some background.<br />
<br />
Dalnir is officially The Crypt of Haggle-Baron Dalnir, a former 'Chief Economic Advisor' of Cabilis.  It has since become the home of an escaped sarnak called The Kly.  The Kly was, during the days of the creation of the Sarnak, apprenticed to an Iksar who was executed for Heresy.  He was found practicing the forbidden arts of magic.  (Only Necromancy is allowed)  Dalnir contains a special forge, called the Grand Forge of Dalnir, (or 'Always Works').  This forge was used by our heretic friend to create a special dagger, the parts of which drop in Dalnir.  So it was here that The Kly fled, upon his escape.<br />
<br />
The Kly has formed and trained a legion of Sarnak in the arts of magic, and has begun enslaving every single passerby he can get his hands on.  These poor sods have a controlling device called a 'coersion implant' put in them, forcing them to do the bidding of The Kly.<br />
<br />
Here you will fight goblins, iksar, dwarves, gnomes, erudites, tier'dal, goos, and of course sarnak.<br />
<br />
These coerced types hit hard for their level, cleric keep that heal ready.  They are fairly spaced, but with respect to pulling adds are common.  Most PC classes are represented here as well, expect to fight warriors, monks, shadowknights, shamen, necromancers, paladins, clerics, mages, and unfortunately ---&gt; gnomish wizards.<br />
<br />
In particular watch the female gnomes - if they are with pet, they are mages, without pet they are wizards.  The wizards hurt for this level, but can't take the abuse in return, so watch out.<br />
<br />
FACTION: I'm sure this is a big concern to you goody-goody types by now, so rest easy.  The only faction hit here is ThrallofKly (Thrall is the next step 'up' from slave - a slave could be said to be someone 'controlled' by someone else, a Thrall would be someone owned 'lock-stock-and-barrel' by someone else, as the saying goes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes Hammer you can come our Tues night groups are usally 30 to 34 or 35 now ).  I love Dalnirs and think it will be a blast here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aseid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd love to bring Dexail to Dalnir to help out tonight.  He's level a lvl 36 rogue now and I've had some prior experience in Dalnir, so count me in if you need me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Would like to offer my services as a bard, as well.  Fallanthas is level 30 now, and will most likely be 31 or 32 by the time the Dalnir fun begins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bard charm handles caster add very handily, and Dalnirs is a lot of fun until you reach the third level drop down.  After that it becomes a painful place.  :( <br />
<br />
Anyway, I usually play Tuesdays and Thursdays from around 6 CST till everyone drops.  Hoping to see you there next week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's a bit of a move, but you might consider Crystal Caverns a another level 30 ish dungeon for a DoTW ( Dungie o' The Week ).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Located off of the Eastern Wastes in Velious, Crystal Caverns is full of nasty orcs and some pretty decent mid level loot.  Not too far a run from either a bind point ( Thurgadin, unless you have been down there dwarf-hunting already) or a port ( both Great Divide and Iceclad Ocean are nearby )<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nice overview Ss.. :)<br />
<br />
This is a fun dungeon with wandering mobs and a chance to hone some tactics. It is easy to get two mobs at once and coerced clerics are murder.. especially two of them. <br />
<br />
The biggest thing is the pain in getting to it. Just getting there will not be a lot of fun for a lot of people, but worth it we feel.<br />
<br />
I will be digging up my old guide to this place and (hopefully) posting it here as an over view. <br />
<br />
See everyone there.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dalnir: (In Warsliks Woods) Level 25-45. (Best is 28-34)<br />
<br />
This is a much easier dungeon to get to than Kurns and it is between Cabilis, FV, and Overthere, so everyone can get there. Warsliks Woods is no picnic to navigate with many wandering mobs and terrain. There is a shortcut to Warsliks from the Lake of Ill Omen through the Goblin tunnels. Just invis and make a run through the tunnel from the Lake and you come into Warsliks. I recommend that some of the preparation (especially if no 29 or better cleric) include a couple of sow potions and invis potions for melee types if they have to make the run back to the zone. This will save a lot of time (and perhaps unecessary deaths), should a CR be required. While there are melee in the dungeon, I rate the casters more dangerous here. The dungeon has 3 levels and unique ways to get from level to level. 1st level is like any other, you go in the zone, you exit the zone in the same place. To go to the lower zones, you must go down a pit (lev works wonders here) and it is a one way trip. There is an exit on the second floor that will take you back to the entrance and also an exit on the third floor (right behind the hardest mob in the place). I rate this dungeon as one of the funnest I have been in. The action can be intense and a lot of fun and you will learn to work as a group. <br />
<br />
 Mob make up: 1st and 2nd floor have coerced mobs of varying types, the toughest being the cleric. 2nd and 3rd floor also have Kly. These are higher level and also consist of casters and melee. Goos and nibblers are present in the dungeon as well. The only thing that sees invis are several of the goos. Creatures will con like they see invis, but they don’t.  This dungeon is rather unique in that the goos and nibblers can be non-agro. Don’t automatically assume that they are aggressive, but be prepared. Aggressive and non-aggressive con the same. Some of the coerced are SK types and have HT. I can tell you from experience that they are deadly against non melee types, particularly healers. Pets (mage, SK, and Necro) are present, allowing mages and druids to have some fun against summoned. There are wandering mobs here and the respawn rate is a blistering 13 minutes in the whole place.<br />
<br />
Loot: Some good stuff drops here including the Sap of Piety, Practice Sword, and Monk Batons. You will likely see a large number of monks here as there are several monk items that drop here. Some guides show that the Necklace of Superiority drops here. That is no longer true.<br />
<br />
Group makeup and tactics: Very hard to solo, even at the zone line. I do not recommend it. A well balance group is recommended and I recommend 4 at least with two being melee. The group should include 2 stunners (cleric/pally/chanter) to help deal with casters. If you don’t have them and happen to get two clerics, you will be toast as they will heal each other while beating the crap out of you. You don’t have enough firepower to kill both as fast as they can heal themselves at this level. You will either need a monk or a chanter for crowd control. If a monk is used, they should put in magic resist gear and MR buffed as they will get zotted a lot. This should even be done at the expense of AC. An evacer is also handy here as well, especially on the lower levels, given the problems of getting in and out.  Pets can safely be used once a camp is established. You can pretty much camp anywhere on the top floor (away from the entrance is advisable) and I would camp near the exit on the 2nd level. There is little reason to go the 3rd level now that the necklace no longer drops. Where it was is an especially nasty place with multiple casters that like to nuke enchanters for bothering them. There are several statics near the exit on the second floor and what we used to do was to invis, lev down, head back to the exit. Once there, we would drop invis to see if the mobs were agro or not if they were nibblers. If they were non-agro, we would leave them in place. After that, we would work our way up to the room we would pull to and then pull the second floor. We would continue to check the spawns between us and the exit and keep wiping them out until they were non agro and it was much easier to exit the dungeon. The good news is that they will stay that way unless someone else attacks them or the server repops. That area was seldom camped and I think we went 3 nights in a row with the same non-agro statics back there. A 29 cleric is very handy if you plan to go to the 2nd and 3rd level as it will be hard for party members to reenter and go to the camp spot. If you don’t have this, all is not lost. Simply have a party member that is capable of casting invis and lev exit out the dungeon, meet the incoming member, do invis and lev and rejoin the party at the pull spot. One final note: many classes will have just gotten a big heal spell. The mobs in this dungeon hate healers. If you heal your tanks early, expect the mobs to throw a fit and attack you. This could be very dangerous if it is a coerced mob with a HT. If you are hurt a bit, you could go from 3 bubbles to dead from a HT.</div></div><hr />

If I can I will swing by to drop them off before you head in ;)<br />
<br />
I think I might have what you need for Sieve... I know I have the unfaded one... but haven't checked the faded pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Terackia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I should be able to make it tonight, but I have a few things to do around the house first, and probably wont be on till 8:00 central.  I will send you a tell when I logon and you guys can let me know whether or not to head over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, the night went well for those who were able to make it. Lot of people had other things to do, so we wound up with 6. (Cleric, Chanter, Bard, 2 Shaman, Monk)<br />
<br />
We elected to stay on the top floor of Dalnir's this week to learn the mobs. The mobs were all BTM at 30. We had several wild fights and manage to avoid death this night (big one was 5 at once). I did not get a ton of resists there and could mez wiht ease and also stun for the most part (something I am not able to do on a regular basis/reliably in Nurga). Beridian got a Sap of Piety out of it (nice 1hb). <br />
<br />
I will post it later, but I believe Dalnir will be the target next week. The xp was awesome here. Depending on group makeups, I can see us going for the second level. <br />
<br />
I would also like to see what everyone's feeling is on making Dalnir something of a &quot;KoE and Friends&quot; zone that night, rather than a big harry raid.. Dalnir does not lend itself well to multi group action in very many places because of the small size of many of the rooms. It is entirely possible to have groups close to each other, pulling from different directions and doing their own thing, yet still be close enough to help each other and lend support if need be. (Zone usually has a low population and I don't think using /ooc or /shout would be a problem). <br />
<br />
See you next week.. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Very nice time. Harryfooty played Shamashin tonight and had fun with his wolf pet (and learned a little). I was very happy to have received the sap of piety. I remember the zone as having mainly Monk and quest items and did not expect it to drop. It works much better than the forest giant hammer I had. :)<br />
<br />
We had one whopper of a fight where no one died. Wew. Was fun. At the end I started playing a little with my mezz song. It works really good. I just can't fight while mezzing it seems. I could twist 2 other songs but no way I could target the mob we were fighting, then switch back to the one I wanted to mezz and back and forth. Maybe other Bards can? Also need to play with charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">isnt the raid tonight?? 8-29 or did i miss it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Had a great time in Dalnir...the pulling was easier than it appeared initially.  Breaking rooms full of gnawers was a piece of cake, because as we learned, about 50% of them don't aggro, despite the fact that they're scowls.  Rooms with more than one of the coerced mobs were kinda tough, because they chain cast enough to where feign is pretty useless.   What I would like to know is where all those mobs came from that one fight...we were fighting a goo, and three coerced mobs ran into the room out of nowhere.  That was fun :)  And it wasn't the monks fault!  Looking forward to next time.  <br />
<br />
There was only one bad part to the evening...<br />
<br />
I had to kill a gnome!  :(<br />

Bem, if the whole world has fallen in on ya on a pull, try using Kelins, AE mez.  it gets resisted quite a bit, but better odds than trying to single mez mobs on a big pull.</div></div><hr />
