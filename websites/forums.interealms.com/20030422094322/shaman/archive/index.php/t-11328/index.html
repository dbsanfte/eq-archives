The cost for a 10 dose Shrink (component price) given no failures is about 510pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Out of all the new potions, from a selling standpoint, I actually think this potion could be the best seller.  It's a pain to get your whole raid shrunk when needed.  Passing around a 10 dose shrink potion would be a huge help.  Any info on what peeps are selling these for &amp; how much it costs to make?  Also a list of the vendors would be good too.  Any seen feverfew for sale any where else?  How about the lighthouse in Gunthak?<br />

...we already have ant's potion, which is single.  Why spend 510pp on a single? <br />
It's 510 for a 10-shot, 51pp for a single.<br />
<br />
Each shrink is 9pp (our cost), so for the convenience of not having to cast shrink 6 times (or for a no shaman group, passing a bottle around), we save 3pp and time. That and we don't have Donlo's as a castable spell and it's a pain to swap groups for shrink since the spell is group-only.<br />
<br />
Much like the majority of alchemy, there's reasons and opportunities to use this potion, but they aren't very compelling or frequent. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gmork, <br />
<br />
No.  Donlos Dimentia (Group Shrink) is not MGBable.  <br />
<br />
This is pretty sweet though, the first group potion spell.  Now all we need is group gate and group port potions, maybe evac potions, hehe...ok, I know that is asking too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, for mgb you have to use spells that leave a buff icon.  No icon, no MGB</div></div><hr />
