<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm in a guild easily capable of the Rak fight at the end of the Epic. However I have tried repeatedly and I just cannot kill Neh'Ashiir. Yes she's a much easier mob but havn't been able to get a small group together mainly because people are busy. <br />
<br />
So what I'm wondering is, if I get my tear and just do Neh and Rak ashiirs together at the same time (turn in ring, then give diary to spirit, then return and kill rak) is there any reason not to do this?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay and now for my second question. supposedly, the final tear turn in to rak must be done at max ally faction for the turn in to be successful, correct? So, if you do all the steps for the epic, at the instant you turn in Neh'Ashiir's Diary to the Spirit (the last faction hit you recieve before giving the tear to Rak) you will be at Max Ally Faction. When I do that turn in, if all has been done correctly, will I recieve the &quot;your faction cannot possibly get any better with True Spirit&quot; message? If I have somewhere screwed up and my faction is insufficient, will I not recieve that message?</div></div><hr />

This is a very common way of doing it.<br />
<br />

<br />
You won't get that message until you do the Rak turnin. The message means &quot;If your faction wasn't already maxed, you would have gotten a hit&quot;. For you to get it on the Diary turnin, the message would have to mean &quot;The faction hit you just took put you at the max&quot;. So, unless you did something multiple times you will just have to assume that you have sufficient faction.<br />
<br />
Since you are doing everything in order, the only way your faction could possibly be to low is if you had somehow killed something that gave you a negative TS hit and if you had done that then a)you would presumably know about it and b)somewhere along the line previous to Rak you would get a turnin eaten.<br />
<br />
Worrying about your exact faction level is something that only people doing the faction-bypass method really need to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, makes perfect sense about the faction thing. I just havn't ever gotten a max ally faction before heh.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly how I did mine. I bound at the shore next to the lake the spirit is in. Got diary, gated and did turn in and ran back while the rest of the gang moved down to prepare for Rak. Did Rak then gated over did turn in, got Spear  :D  and got rezzed back ( I died in Rak fight).<br />
<br />
Worked like a champ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I'd killed that stupid wandering spirit in WK (&quot;gee, that guy was kind of an undercon, huh?&quot;) I'd never even HEARD of an epic.  And I definitely didn't pay attention to the myriad of goofy faction messages I got back then (&quot;Vox?  Nagafen? those sure don't SOUND like gnoll names&quot;).<br />
<br />
Those who started the game in true and honest noobdom have had ample opportunities to innocently trash important faction.  :)</div></div><hr />
