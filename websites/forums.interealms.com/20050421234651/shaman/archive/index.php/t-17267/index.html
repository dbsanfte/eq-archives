<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, i got pretty good plat in Dulak, when i had a 50+ Shammy fruiend with me. in 4-5hours (withh 58Shammy at my side and grouped) i walked away with 400+pp. now i use LDoN for most of my money. onetime, grp walked awa with 100+pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I get nice coin from LDoN splits and occasionally get plats selling something I get from 'all' rolls on drops nobody can use or wants from LDoN.  I'm an LDoN junkie.<br />
<br />
However, until I get higher level and can collect high level sellables, I can get way more money collecting various tradeskill drops killing green cons with my 12th ranger alt (good to have tracking and SoW for fast collecting).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LDoN is a wonderful supply of XP + Cash.  If you're out soley for the purpose of cash there's a few things you can do - one of which Zhahz nailed.  Collecting tradeskill stuffs, spider(ling) silks, foraging if you can, basically anything that says 'can be used in tradeskills' keep and see what it sells for.<br />
<br />
Another thing to do that will net you at least 100pp an hour if you can handle it is killing halfling guards in Misty Thicket.  I remember as a young rogue I took my dwarf to Misty Thicket to team up with a friend in this 'wonderful n00b zone' as he put it.  Well while we were there this Ogre shammie was pullin all 3 of these buggers rooting one, off-tanking one with his loyal dog and in the process of rooting the other.  He let me and my friend take the shields; sheilds are only worth a couple pp.  The spears tho, are worth about 8pp.  Sure it doesn't sound like a lot, but they pop quick, 6 or 8 minutes if I recall right.   And as such are hard to keep on a continuous pace at our level.<br />
<br />
Don't let your dog die, use him as a distraction to get hit less.  But dot the buggers to death instead.  One of them (the highest level one) is slighlty MR and will resist roots and dots without a malais (casting malais on him saves you mana in the end).<br />
<br />
If you find that too difficult (can't blame you if you do, it's not the easiest way to make cash) you can do things like go to the Gorge of King Xorbb and kill mudmen for their bricks of ore.  This falls in line with the tradeskill thing, but I'm just naming places to go - just know your way to a vendor near by ;).  If you're evil like me it's a serious pain in the ass here (invis to get through RunnyEye and Misty to the PoK book), if you're a goodie two shoes Misty Thicket and vendors in East Karana aren't too far away.<br />
<br />
Quickest and Easiest spider silks would be Upper Guk I think, or East Karana; but Crag's can be a bit tough on the dog and you don't really wanna be casting constantly when farming stuff like this.<br />
<br />
Other than that, Dwarf Guards work too.   But I'm not sure what level you'd be able to do that, they have 8pp-10pp selling things too.<br />
<br />
If you can slaughter things in Dulak that's gonna be your best bet though.  The frequency with which they drop fire emeralds and the like is relatively high for the level of mobs they are (talkin about yard trash here, not the boats...just the shacks along the dock and what not).  That is great cash, and not bad xp if you wanna solo spot.<br />
<br />
I'm sure others will pipe in with their ideas.  Basic rule of camping for cash is camp things that aren't rare.  You could camp in a spot for a week straight and get nada but crap loot.  Much better to go for trade skill things or straight gems/cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sandadarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Everyone is saying Ldon today but actually I have found out that you should go to Ek thats right East Karana. Kill the crag and carron spiders. Get like 10 stack of spider silk then becoem a trader.

<br />
Aye, spider silks are decent and on Xev they sell for more like 5-15p ea, although I rarely have the patience to sell stuff at the highest prices.  On Xev I've found that spiderling silks are better for me because they sell for 5-8p ea easily and since they drop from level 2-4 critters you can mow them down faster.  All of my alts are spiderling killing machines when they're first growing up!<br />
<br />
A couple of other potentially more lucrative tradeskill farmables are:<br />
<br />
&quot;Swirling Shadows&quot; from lesser shades in Shadeweaver Thicket - decent concentration of them near the tunnel that leads to paludal - very green to a 12th but not sure of exact level.  The swirlies aren't a common drop but they sell for 50 plat minimum each and sell fast so that's 1k of easy money per stack mininum.  It's such good money that I see 50+ on them quite often (and still get them to myself often enough).  Depending on the luck of the drop I can get 1k per 1-2 hours and that's a conservative estimate.  I usually will just log my ranger a little bit here and there over time to build up some swirlies rather than go insane from marathon mindless farming.  You also get piles of shadeling silk which sells for 0.5-1p per and bone chips from killing placeholders - so almost everything you collect is sellable.  One would think that as more people become aware of this farmable that prices would drop, but so far that hasn't been the case.  If you farm the lesser shades, be sure to slaughter any other critters in the area as they can be place holders and surpressing all critters in the area speeds up repops (or so it seems).<br />
<br />
Again, I'm using my ranger alt with SoW (potions) and his tracking (he's 24th now and mows them down fast).  I could wipe them fast with me and my pet but tracking makes locating them must faster and beats running all over the place seeking the next target.<br />
<br />
Also in Shadeweaver Thicket, and even better in MSeru where you may visit for xp - you can get low quality rockhopper hides.  In MSeru the LQ hides drop on almost every hopper kill and few people loot them.  Even the baby hoppers (a saurek hopper, I think it's called) drop LQ hides way more often than I've ever seen from any noobie bears (like everfrost).  You can combine a LQ hopper hide with shadeling silk thread (from combining two shadeling silks) and produce the same leather backings for smiths as you can from LQ bear hides - only LQ hopper hides drop WAY more often.  On Xev backing is selling for 40-50p per right now which is above normal (I think 25p-ish is normal).  Making paddng is a low skill tailoring combine.  I think the swirlies are more efficient to farm, but if you happen to visit mseru to xp you may as well grab every hide you can and convert them to easy plats.<br />
<br />
I get good splits from LDoN, but even so my highest split so far has been around 300p grouped with mid 50's.  Occasionally I win some LDoN drop from a greed roll and sell it for plats in the bazaar.  I try to ML to make sure stuff is sold at max charisma and that everything, like smithing skill up drops, si fairly distributed - so sometimes I may get a few extra plats from a goblin bone or something.  But, I still can produce way more plat spending a few hours farming tradeskillables with my ranger alt.<br />
<br />
I look forward to the day that I can rake in 1000's of plats through normal hunting with my shaman...but that day hasn't arrived.  I much prefer to hunt and xp with my shaman, hoping that by some miracle a worthy item that I can use will drop from my group's efforts - but this rarely happens.  So, when I really need cash for upgrades and spells, tradeskill farming works for me!<br />

Tradeskill Item Pharmer of Xev</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lots of good ideas folks, but some obvious ones missing...<br />
<br />
1) Mammoths in Everfrost drop 10p tusks.<br />
2) Mammoth meat (also from calfs) sells well to trade skills folk<br />
3) Shaman with focus gear and c1 CAN solo Ice Giants in everfrost at lvl 35 up... slow though, and specialised skill. Just ask to join higher levels farming these blue boys. Drops are up to 40p or so, gems, Fine Steel weapons. Pick up Ice Giant toes and sell for trade skills (15p or more each). <br />
4) Hopper hides sell well, drop from greeenies all the way up to nasty fellows in DawnShroud.. which also drop the much coverted Flawless Rockhopper hide.. sold one for 300p today.<br />
5) BTW know your vendor prices. Every now and then you will see Forest Loops or Jaundice Bone items in bazaar on traders for LESS than you get from Vendore.. easy cash there!<br />
6) Hill Giants in Rathe are hard kill for lvl 34, but gets easier, and drop gems, FS weapons and up to 33p <br />
7) SoW potions can be sold for profit once you are getting control of the fails.<br />
8) While this depends on deity, as a barb shaman I can imbue ivory.. which i get free from Ice Giants. Pay a chanter to enchant (is that the word?) gold bars, and donate for a high level jeweller to combine 1 enchanted gold and 1 imbued ivory. The 4 wis ear piece I can always sell eventually for profit (but slow to sell 'cause its Tribunal only). I just keep a few up for /auction or /trader.<br />
9) By level 40 or so you can go back to the much ignored old world dungeons and hunt named mobs for drops.. RunnyEye for BAM, for instance. <br />
10) Acrylia blocks sell to both vendors and trade skills people... Tribals in DSP drop a bit.<br />
11) Spectres in Feerroot (entrence to Plane of Fear) run really slowly, can be kited without much trouble at 40 up, and drop a little cash.<br />
12) For free cash at lower levels, all sorts of tricks... eg Rathe mountains, stay invis and out of the way, but wait till someone leaves a Hill Giant rotting on the ground. Often it has a &quot;Lambent Gem&quot; which is 4p to vendor... but is lore item so only 1 at a time. Sell at camp and come back for more.<br />
13) Know your prices... at times in bazaar folk sell good items for half price or so... invest, and resell. If you have made a good call, you will STILL be selling cheaper than others in the bazaar, but will profit as you have time to wait for a sale.<br />
14) Keep a notebook. Often I am told &quot;if you get any more..... whatever it is...... send a tell&quot;. If you write this all down, you may have a guaranteed sale for your next stack of silk or IG toes.<br />
15) be patient. If the item you want allways sells for 6k, make a vow that you will ONLY buy it for 5k, or some such figure. Send tells, negotiate, wait. In effect, you just &quot;made&quot; 1k! Just for waiting!<br />
16) research hard... some items are questable at reasonable levels (or combo quest and bazaar for items). This puts good enough gear in slots for not too much money. The &quot;antique&quot; line of quests in PoK are open to level 20 up, and get you focus effect gear. All items (i think) are NOT no drop.. so balance buying and fetching yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bitzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just to add to the suggestions others have made:<br />
<br />
1.  If you are hunting swirling shadows in SWT, run inside the tunnel to PC and clear the two alien camps (first right and straight ahead) of the black aliens only.  They drop shade silks (sells for 1pp on my server) and condensed shadows (sells for 25pp on my server).  Then run back outside and clear the shades (skels) again.<br />
<br />
2.  At 46, you should be able to hunter poachers in Jaggedpine for xp.  They drop (or at least they used to) lots of quality hides that can be sold in the bazaar or turned into leather padding and sold in the bazaar.  On my server, padding goes for 25pp each and the tailoring skill required to make it is low (27ish).  Inny swamp is a good place for good aligned races to hunt spiderling silks, the other component in padding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye, spider silks are decent and on Xev they sell for more like 5-15p ea, although I rarely have the patience to sell stuff at the highest prices.

<br />
the thing thats so great about spider silks is that its on the cheaper end of skillups in the tailoring arena, thus most people who are dabbling in it will buy silks, so they move very fast. For the time invested farming silks in off hours in east karana, or in upper guk was always the best bet for the time invested. east karana is the best spot for it, but often there will be contention for spawns if you don't go in off hours. <br />
<br />
upper guk will average you about 5 stacks of silk an hour (doing both spots of spiders). I spent an hour keeping dandolak cleared last night and walked away with about 800pp. You do the math :)</div></div><hr />
