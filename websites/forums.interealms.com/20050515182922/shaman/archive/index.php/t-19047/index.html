<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after getting the non-glamorous AAs that improve my performance but are kinda boring (ie. run3, regen3, mc3, canni5, scr3, scrm, qb1)...  I decided I wanted to take a break from them and get a few &quot;fun&quot; AAs, even if they don't really do much hehe.<br />
<br />
So I maxed out Spirit Call.  Pure fun factor.  So that every 12 mins I could &quot;Unleash the dogs of war&quot; and get a wow factor.  So yeah, I'm easily amused.<br />
<br />
I love this AA!  Moreso than I thought.  I mean, it really spices up a long grind of buffing, slowing, DoTing...  /yawn.  Every few mins I can watch as a small army of dogs swarms a baddie and pummels him into the ground, and know that I brought them into the world, and it amuses me.<br />
<br />
I know, it doesn't add an insane amount of DPS, and those 5 dogs are not hasted or alpha'd...  so individually, they don't do much DPS.  But 5 of them together... and I'm surprised at how much &quot;spam&quot; they make.  When I cut them loose, between those dogs and my regular pet, and a DoT.... I'm one of the top DPS people for that fight.  I mean, they can really spam!<br />
<br />
But they actually do serve a real purpose here and there.  Against big-time casting mobs... those dogs are great at interrupting via melee push and via bashing.  6 dogs, all bashing, is bound to interrupt a caster.  This applies to duels too.... the casters in my guild hate those dogs.<br />
<br />
They also prove to be valuable for &quot;mob push&quot;.... when we need to position a mob for a raid.  I make sure I am positioned right... unleash the dogs... and that mob straightens right up.  :)<br />
<br />
So all-in-all... I'm pleased with AA, if only for amusement factor.  I hear a lot of folks say how it really is a worthless AA... and I say &quot;how can you say that!?!?  it's fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Although... there was a noticeable difference going from SC1 (3 dogs) to SC3 (5 dogs).  Much more spam and some serious interrupting/bashing/push power.<br />
<br />
Anyway, for 9 AA, I enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Also got VP1 and so far I've been disappointed in how often it gets resisted... and when it lands... doesn't seem to last long.  5-10 secs tops.  Perhaps I need VP2 for it to improve.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna get 1 point in Radiant Cure, and then go back to keep working on the boring-yet-necessary Archetype AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a side note...  I wonder if anyone has tried any tactics by getting together a crowd of shamans/mages who have their &quot;spirit call&quot; AAs and just summoning hordes of pets on a big mob.  I have a mage friend with his equivalent AA, and it's fun during our xp grinds for us to both hammer the AA at the same time... 10-15 pets all smacking a mob down.  It's just too fun.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nanuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On the Aten blobs in VT, the guild would call for 'pet zerg' and all the mages and shamans in the guild, usally 4 mages and 6 to 8 shaman, all with maxed or near maxed pet zerg AA, would unleash thier pets on the mob at the same time for craps and giggles.  Then everyone would laugh at the 60 sec lag from so many pets at once.  Quite a humourous sight to see.  Screenshots of amazment abounded.  Luckily we never lost anyone to LD, but we'd sure try!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I stopped at level1.  Everyone was praising it so much, but the long cast time really kills it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wish I would have stopped at level 1.  The uncontrollable push of the dog pack really decreases the usefulness of this AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My poor dogs just end up dead in a few seconds, but it seems to keep the mobs happy.  Definitely a handy AA if you are looking for some push.<br />
<br />
Dissapointed with VP1??  Get VP3 and be amazed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Where are you using VP that it gets resisted so much?<br />
<br />
Only time I get it resisted often is vs undeads.... same as all our disease spells.<br />
<br />
Toss a mal decay on the mob and vp works wonders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dissapointed with VP1?? Get VP3 and be amazed.  <br />
<br />
Fully agree. Hated VP1. Love VP3. And I'm STILL getting /g wow who booted the add back?  when I group with new people. <br />
<br />
Are the rest of you keeping it a secret or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt;3 SC1<br />
<br />
<br />
RC1 &gt; VP1 ya think guys?<br />
<br />
im prolly gonna grab one or the other next</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd say RC1 then VP1,2,3<br />
<br />
the near instant cure of RC is just too good to pass up for only 2 pts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aye Baldkin a Mal Decay before VP makes it practically unresistable and the root holds forever. If tank in your group has a DD proc on weapon the root may break .<br />
<br />
Anyways this thread was about Spirit Call. What I like to do (unless the mob is already cornered) is cast it then run a fast tight circle around the mob. It encircles the mob with puppies. Less push and I just like the look of it, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Level 3 in VP and RC are what you want to have. Level 1 and 2 are decidedly weak as all hell but when you hit level 3 they are just total ownage.  BTW Spiritcall is an utter waste of time and &quot;petPush&quot; to interrupt gating is a total myth because i haven't seen a mob yet that can't channel right through it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">SC is neat, i bought level 1 a couple days ago.  It's kinda usefull sometimes, long cast time kinda sucks.  If it was instant it would be a really nice aa.  I dont think i'll bother getting the rest untill i have nothing left to buy lol :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the pet push from SC3 is a very good thing in certain situations.  If you notice, when you cast SC3, all 5 dogs don't just pop out and go, they come outta ya 1 at a time.  So let say you wanna pin a mob in one particular spot.  Start casting SC3 in front of mob, let 1 dog pop, then run in a semi-circle around the mob popping out dogs till you pop the last dog on the mob's ass.  Instant-mob pinage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wish I would have stopped at level 1.  The uncontrollable push of the dog pack really decreases the usefulness of this AA.<br />
- Swarm pets are very useful to us. Time gods are always positioned with swarm pets (at least we use them for it). And once mob is pinned, it doesn't matter if it pushes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">for sure Zorlac.  I should have said decreased the usefulness of this AA for me.<br />
<br />
My guild, we rarely corner pin, but when we do, we all pop swarm pets.  Raids where we corner pin, or on permarooted mobs are really the only time I use them regularly.  I'm raiding at a whole different, much lower, level than Zorlac is though and in different circumstances.   Some mobs that other people corner pin, we do differently because much of our DPS is archery.  <br />
<br />
There is some utility to their push, but I find it to be detrimental far more often than beneficial.  You can help decrease the push on a mob that is being held pretty still if you push spirit call then quickly run around the mob.  The dogs will pop out at ddifferent points while you run around the mob and kinda surround it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I use SC3 when puling a tough room in LDoN. 5+ mobs I SC. By the time the dogs die I can have 3 - 4 of those mobs slowed and I am still alive. I love SC3 and I would never refund those points. Especially useful when going against LDoN cleric mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I circle the mob as the hounds release as well, with minimal practice you can get a very tight and even circle around a mob that actually decreases group melee push-the downside is, if the mob is pushed even a hair outside the circle, the whole group is going for a little ride in the direction of push, it's a fun aa anyways and I use it all the time, fun for fear kiting at picnic tables in PoF too. I call it my EPZF aa and it's another lame excuse for yet another lame hotkey)<br />
/g Elite Puppy Zerg Force ATTACK!<br />
but wth, it's a game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">SC:<br />
<br />
LOVE it, even if its only to piss of the raid leader by pushing the mob around.<br />
<br />
VP:<br />
I find it very useful even VP1 was worth alot to me, maybe im just a bit slow but i dont realy see the big difference between vp1 and vp3. i mostly use it for soloing and ldon, and to piss of the raid leader. btw it was another shaman i stole the idea from about pissing of the RL. i just wanted to thank him it has made raiding sp much more fun  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't find them to be an important part of my arsenal.  I usually only use them for the hell of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">yes i loved this aa too it great fun, but guys after and including vt named you look at the messages you get it does<br />
pet missed<br />
pet missed<br />
pet missed <br />
etc<br />
<br />
i given up using it on any named as damage. and on trash in elementals the damasge cause is alot lower ,ie the hits dont max for 60 atall, with alot of misses too. i would lke to see an u/g to this  like an u/g to our pet is needed. but thats just for the highest end. for the lower planes it does work nicely.<br />
<br />
when i got this in pov, it was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I wish I would have stopped at level 1.  The uncontrollable push of the dog pack really decreases the usefulness of this AA.<br />
<br />
<br />
My trick is strafing around the mob as i set it off. Meaning if i run in a circle sideways as i let slip the hounds of hell, then you get them pushing from all sides. If you do it right the only way the mob gets moved is if everyone else moves it.  Its tricky for sure, but i dunno, maybe you never thought of it so i thought id share.<br />
<br />
Also on raids i always found that if a mobs needed to be pushed, i just told all the shaman to let it loose and believe me, when 10 shaman all click their SC AA, that mob is getting moved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Get a Ring of Stealthy Travel (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5733). If the dog push gets out of hand, click it. <br />
When I use SC as a pushing tool, I can control where I want the mob and how much I want it pushed with it, since it allows me to get rid of the dogs at any time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I got SC1, its great fun.<br />
<br />
Combined with &quot;Cry havok and let loose the Dogdogs of war!!&quot; its breaks the monotony of the grind.<br />
<br />
Very fun AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I use it for added DPS and control on Multi pulls when my pet gets and holds aggro on a caster (LDoN - normal), then pulling the melee mob with slow and root it behind the party for the melees to get later.  SC isn't game changing, but it's fun and the pets do help some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My guild can be weighted down with a lot of members to a raid.  Not exactly Zerg but a healthy number.<br />
<br />
With the possible advantage this AA promises for damage I for-see HUGE AMOUNTS of pets everywhere and more often... <br />
<br />
I bet we will make the zone go down even more.<br />
<br />
*sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Off topic but, where does that ring of stealthy travel drop.  I know in chardok, but can you tell me where or what mob?</div></div><hr />
