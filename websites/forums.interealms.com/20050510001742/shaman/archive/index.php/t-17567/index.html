<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hullo all. Subjects like this may have been posted  before but I feel that this may be a slight bit different. My roomate wants to dou with me in EQ, he is currently a 43 Ranger and cons blue to me so we  were killing stuff to get  him to level so we could kill harder stuff that gave me more than a rathair of exp at 54. <br />
He has since got bored of the Ranger and was looking at a Necromancer, Magician or Beastlord. I told him he should become a Beastlord because  he likes to solo when I'm not on but he views Beastlords as just whimpy Shaman. I don't think this is the case and think if he was a Beastlord he could solo semi-effectivly as well as be a nice addition if we doued and if he sought a group he could get one. He was also thinking of a Necromancer because he likes the idea of a &quot;power house&quot; but is worried about DoTs  stacking and yada-yada-yada. He wanted to be a Magician since no worries about DoTs, awsome pets as well gate. I am looking for advice on what he should be. What do you think would work the best with a Shaman? Your reasons why to...or explain the ups/downs of all three so I can have many different options. <br />
Just FYI,  we are on the FV server, so only one character and that is why this has become difficult to decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any of the above would be good ... and my main idea on this is that the shaman can duo well with any class.<br />
<br />
One point that you made is worth addressing .. he like to solo when your not around .. I am sorry to say but the necro is the only one that can solo well enough to make a difference ... yeah yeah mages can chain pets .. and heal and a BL can do the same as well as slow .. but neither of these two classes can really say .. I make more exp soloing than in a group.  Maybe when KEI was castable on everyone ... also if they are twinked beyond belief ..  <br />
<br />
Necro do it all .. in their own way .. a good necro is hard to find. &lt;edit&gt; and if he picks a necro ... he will catch up to you quickly and you all can duo mobs =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is just plain wrong. period.<br />
<br />
I will say necros are probably easier than a beastlord because of FD and gate (and fear/snare), but beyond that--beastlords hold their own when it comes to soloing.  I'm not sure how mages are when it comes to soloing as i've never done a mage past level 10, but i assume its quite well also.<br />
<br />
I think your friend has some misconceptions about the classes as well..it would do him well to do a little research.  Otherwise it wont be long before he drops the class he thought was so great for yet another class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BL's do NOT solo as well as Necro's.. I know quite a few Necro's who easily solo PoFire with little difficulity.  End game soloing comes down to damage output and not coming into melee range of your targets.  Back to the point of this trhread though, Necro and Shaman make one of the best duo combos around. Necro pulling, snaring and pure dps, Shaman slow, malo with heals and cures just in case.   Sure, the Shaman will die once in a while, but the necro will rez you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For what its worth, I duo with a Necro but he dual boxes a Druid with us so we have a bit more power than you would with just the two of you. However, when the machine the Druid is played on has issues it isn't like we have to stop or anything. We keep plugging along, just means I have to regen the Necro :)<br />
<br />
The combo works well and things die incredibly fast (particularly Velious and Kunark mobs). All our DoTs stack (the ones that we have in common too). Downtime isn't exactly an problem either. <br />
<br />
In the end, though, you play an extremely adaptive class. Regardless of what your friend picks you'll be able to find a way to work with it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My personal choice would be necro.  I love to team with necros. Your regen and their subversion lines means you both have more mana than you know what to do with.<br />
<br />
There is no problem with stacking DoT's.  None.  They will all stack.  A good shaman paired with a good necro is so overpowered it ought to an exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok beastlord soloability and necro soloability are very, very different.<br />
<br />
There are 2 different kinds of soloers. Those who take the damage mobs put out but can deal with it, and those who avoid mob damage.<br />
<br />
The former includes things like warriors at level 2, when you dont exactly need support heals to kill an orc pawn, yet it still yeilds exp. Another example is us shamans who solo in teh face, we take the damage of mobs, but deal with it by slowing said mob and with our mediocre heals.<br />
<br />
The latter are kiters. People who solo by running out of melee range and killing their opponent.<br />
<br />
Now, kiters are usually high DPS or high utility classes, IE bards and necromancers. That's all great and fantastic. They are great at soloing for quick exp because they make fast kills.<br />
<br />
However, those who take the damage have more versatility in what they can solo, even if it is slightly less efficient in execution. A kiter cannot solo a mob that summons, or a mob in very close quarters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, I as a shaman have soloed giants in Bastion of Thunder. I have seen Beastlords solo giants in Bastion of Thunder. We can do this because we slow, take the damage, and kill the mob. Kiters cannot do this, because they cannot handle unslowed mobs, and the giants summon.<br />
<br />
A beastlord can solo just about anything a necromancer can, but if the mob does not summon (or if the mob is undead), the necromancer will be more efficient in soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Necro all the way.  They solo amazingly well and a well played Necromancer is AMAZING in a group.  When looking for damage dealers in a group, I always include necromancers in with rogues, monks,etc.  They can add a lot of damage and utility to a group. I'm lucky to have a couple of very well played necromancers in my guild.  I've duo'd with one necromancer that is a founding member of the guild (as am I) so often that we sometimes forget to ask others to join us.  There is a husband and wife that chose to play a necro and shaman because of how well they solo and duo together.  They fit so well by either shaman tanking, necro pet tanking, fear kiting or aggro kitting.  They can virtually share one giant hp/mana pool through the use of heals/regen/necro compacts/taps/etc.</div></div><hr />
