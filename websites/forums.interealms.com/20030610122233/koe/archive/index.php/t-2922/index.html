We call forth the Light of God as in the Light of a Thousand Suns to enfold America, Her People and Her Resources, to protect her in her hour of need. We call upon the Goddess of Liberty and the Ascended Jesus Christ, the Archangel Michael and his Legion of Angels to descend over America, Her Cities and Her People and protect her from the hordes of evil.<br />

We join our hearts in calling forth Uncountable Legions of Angels and Cosmic Forces of Light to descend into the world and remove the sinnister force, the evil and all those who engage in acts of terrorism. We call forth 'God's Eternal Flame' to enfold all of those who have passed through the change called death as a result of the terrorism against America.<br />

America shall be free and we stand with America. America we love you, we bless you, we enfold you in Love's Eternal Presence.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It truly is something so deadly and tremendous that it cannot be simplified into lanuage.  It's hard to grasp the magnitude of it even with feeling, but after reading such concern and ties of affection between you guys and some people there, I've never felt my heart so heavy...  I literally cried after reading some of these posts, and I just can't concentrate on anything else.  It's so sad to see this happen and then go back to our regular lives, where we remember when we did this and that, and those thousands of people were still alive then... Like going back to some earlier posts, I remember posting there, and when I posted there all those people were still alive and the buildings were still there.... TTTT_TTTT     (my crying face, if you see it)<br />
/sob sob sob sob<br />
<br />
I can't express my grief and I wish I could be behind every one of you to comfort you and to hold you.  I personally did not know anyone who died or was hurt, so I do not have the same perception of the magnitude, but I so wish that I could be right behind every single one of you that has ties of affection with this, and even those without..  I want to comfort anyone who needs it, and I am always open for discussion, I will try to be as comforting as possible to anyone who needs it here, I'll try my best over text :(<br />
