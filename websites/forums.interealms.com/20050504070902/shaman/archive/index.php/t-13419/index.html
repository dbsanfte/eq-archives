<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious, whenever you are grouped with a cleric, do you offer (or insist, or go ahead and do anyway, whatever) to heal non-tanks or everyone but the MT to help save the cleric some mana?<br />
Also, do the clerics you group with get upset about this, or are they pretty cool about it?<br />
<br />
Personally, I am so paranoid about others' health that I will be constantly healing group members (save for the MT, as I don't want to step on the cleric's toes).  Can't think of a cleric that has gotten upset about it, but I always make sure it's ok with him/her first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I rarely heal in exp groups, I just let the cleric do their thing.  Of course if things look shakey or cleric says lom you heal, but I say just let them heal everyone and throw in a spot heal here and there.  Rather be pulling constantly letting melee's kill than worrying about healing.  My 0.02</div></div><hr />

<br />
I start healing when either the cleric asks me to, or if things look like a mess, or if the cleric is letting people die here and there.<br />
Sometimes I do too much though, like dropping Quiescence on the MA on INC message ... and the cleric is like &quot;***, why isnt his HP bar dropping?&quot; :cool:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I have mana, I heal.  I avoid the MT, except for Quiescing him.  The Cleric's mana is to save the group from getting killed, so it's good for him to be as FM as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In most situations I wait for them to give us the lom message (usually after rebuffing Virtue on the groups) before I take over healing the MT.  I then offer to cover the next couple fights and they are usually back in business after that.<br />
<br />
I usually heal the puller if they were hit and try to keep the cleric healed as well as anyone else in the group that took damage, a lot of times I end up ducking out of heals (depends on the cleric and how quick they are).  If I know a tougher pull is Inc or I am covering the MT for those couple of pulls, I start of Q'ing them on Inc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I keep Chloro up for the robe types.  <br />
<br />
If anyone besides the MT falls below a bubble I hit with Chloro.  When the cleric calls a CH inc on the MT I spot heal during the 10 seconds if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree Geddar.  I'd much rather be dotting or DDing, as appropriate.  I'll Torpor myself if I'm cannibalizing a lot and find the cleric healing me more than they should have to.  But I very rarely heal anyone else unless we get in trouble or the cleric is having problems keeping mana up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My main is a cleric (level 57) and personally I would rather the shammys do their thing and leave the healing up to me.  The main reason is because I heal over time on almost anyone who doesnt have full life.  HoT's cost little mana and usually keep everyone alive.  On the other hand it is nice when a secondary healer watches and when they notice the cleric is having trouble keeping casters alive they provide backup heals.  But if agro is managed properly (unless its an aoe mob) there shouldnt be a huge need for a cleric to require backup cause most of the time only the main tank and secondary assist are taking damage.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question it really depends on the situation and preference of the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I mostly keep Chloroblast up and stay prepared keep the casters (including the cleric) somewhere near full health while the cleric heals the tank. If the cleric's getting low mana, I'll offer to cover with a Kragg or two while they med up.<br />
<br />
It's mostly down to common sense and communication though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I feel like its all about your classes role in the group: if you have a cleric in the group, HIS job is to heal.  Your job, as a shaman, is to slow, buff, debuff and do damage...none of which the cleric can do (except a few buffs).<br />
<br />
Do what your class is built do do: if you have extra mana you could be (should be?) contributing more to the group's DPS.<br />
<br />
Leave the healing to the cleric: its pretty much the only thing they DO, and they have the tools to do it very well!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When I play my Cleric, I concentrate on healing MT with Cheal and Shaman/Enchanter with what ever is appropriate. I tend to let the other healers take care of healing others. One reason for this is that sometimes things go bad and I have choose between healing two tanks. If the other healers are already used to healing then I can rely on them to keep one tank alive till I get around to hitting them with a big heal.<br />
<br />
When I play Getan there normaly ain't a cleric around. Currently the only heal Getan uses is Stoicism. I'm very big on mana concervation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Back around 62 when I was still not flagged...I found I had to heal alot in PoN and PoD groups...because a mid 50s cleric can't seem to keep up, so I would take over to let him med.<br />
Besides that...I almost never heal if a cleric is in the group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Caster takes damage, they eat Torpor.  Secondary melees get some Tnargs loving if cleric hasn't dropped a heal on them after 5-10 seconds.<br />
<br />
I don't want the cleric to have to worry about who to heal first if two poeple get low health.  I still feel guilty when a cleric will heal me after I take a couple of rounds of slow aggro - their mana's too important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Most groups I have ever been in assign me to one person to heal. usually a bleeding caster but that one caster is my reponsibility. So asside with buffs and the occasional Dot's I focus on my one bleeder. Lol and sometimes it's myself but I rarely am able to heal myself when I get aggro and slow resist 3 times in a row...Stunned can't move mob chomping on me...dead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I do very little healing (comapred to a cleric) but I will, in the interest of group success, heal anyone who gets below 40 percent and is not the MT.  I will also heal the MT if the cleric appears to have called the heal late.<br />
<br />
Also, sometimes the cleric has to choose between two people who will be healed -- if the loser of that choice is still alive after malo/slow, I will make every effort to keep him/her alive.  <br />
<br />
I also heal when it gets ugly.  If the entire group is taking damage (either due to AE or multiple mobs) then a quick Quiesseance on everyone can make an amazing difference.  The cleric HoT spells are good, but they have a dreadful mana cost to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If the cleric's called a CH and somebody else is getting beaten, they get a heal.  Casters &amp; priests get Torpor.  If they complain, they are advised that their options are (a) to die, (b) to be healed later by the cleric and thus cause the group more down time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If there is a cleric in my group, I assume they are healing, and stay out of it.<br />
<br />
If the cleric says they are low mana, I offer to heal for a few pulls while they med.<br />
<br />
If the cleric gets hit, I heal them.<br />
<br />
I keep myself torpored, so they dont have to worry about me.  Everyone else in the group is the clerics problem, unless they ask me to help.<br />
<br />
Of course, except on raids I rarely group with a cleric.  I usualy wind up with a few melee or casters, but no clerics or druids.  I would much rather have a cleric or druid to heal... but it doesnt seem to happen often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Related Topic:  What do you do about loot whore clerics?  <br />
<br />
In BoT yesterday for several hours in the same group we had three different clerics circulate through.  One actually split plat before she left--not that much, but she hadn't been there long.  The last one was there the longest.  I watched him pick up a dozen or so blue diamonds, several raw diamonds, and regular diamonds, as well as plane specifice stuff the value of which I have no idea.<br />
<br />
I understand clerics ought to be compensated for the dots they use, but this guy got a fabulous return on his dot investment just on the diamonds alone.<br />
<br />
After a few hours of this, suddenly he had to get to a raid.  No one else said anything about splitting when he left, so I didn't either.  What do you guys do?<br />
<br />
As for healing etiquette--I top off people other than the MT with Q, though I'll throw a heal his way if I'm feeling iffy about the cleric.  I'll also pick up the slack when the cleric is going lom.  If he gives me grief about it, I tell him to med up because no one likes waiting around for the cleric.  But usually they're grateful for the help--most don't like to slow down the group and aren't too egoistic about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In most groups, whether EXP or RAID, I am given the task of primary healer of the secondary melee's and the casters for all but the life savings .  Usually the cleric is responsible for the life saving heals (the 900 hp insta-cast heals) while I'm responsible for the longer casting higher hps heals for everyon else.  The Cleric is ***ALWAYS*** responsible for the MT and usually ends up healing me while I cann to heal everyone else.<br />
<br />
If I'm told not to heal I don't.  Usually the cleric's are pretty happy with this arrangement as they get to occasionally wack a few MOBs.<br />
<br />
Please note, however, that I'm not flagged so I don't have any experience in zones where the mobs quad for 800.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As for healing with a cleric in the group . . . let em handle it unless they seem shaky.  I will toss a Q on people who are not the MT and are damaged, and will save anyone whose life is dangerously low, but otherwise I let the cleric handle it.  If they are a lousy cleric and can't heal worth a crap, i'll heal and won't rely on them at all.  Then I'll get made group leader and actively look for another cleric or druid who is LFG in the level range, get them there, and /boot the lousy cleric to invite the new one.  FUN FUN FUN!  I get to hear people scream it's kewl.  See, the thing is . . the group wants a cleric for the group . . . but resents a lousy cleric . .  but wants a cleric regardless . . . so in order to ditch a cleric you need to find another one or another good substitute like a competent druid.  Then the group will agree with your decision to ditch the cleric who can't heal in favor of the new healer.  <br />
<br />
In a pinch, I've healed in BoT for up to 2 hours all by myself without any deaths.  But I do have Quiescence and a lotta AA/good gear.<br />
<br />
As for loot, offer to be the ML if it bothers u that people are greedy.  ML everything and split at the end.  Give the cleric an extra gem to cover costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Damm those cleric loot whores!!  My cleric was a little grabby when it came to loot - I think they get used to being pampered in the loot department and just proceed.  And.....playing a cleric is the worst class you can play in my opinion - always felt like a slave, could not solo anything db, etc - so some extra loot for getting fooked over in the fun department - very boring class to play.  Sorry for getting off subject.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jhendlasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When there's a cleric in the group, I just help with the DPS unless a pull gets out of hand.  The instant the situation starts to get shakey, I will start healing as if I'm the only healer, and I've found it usually works out quite well.  Of course, it all depends on the cleric.  If they want me to handle heals for some classes then I usually do (of course, if those classes cry about being Torpored I let them get killed once to see if they'll still whine about it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Normal 65er grind scene:<br />
<br />
Inc (( stuff ))<br />
You begin casting Malos<br />
You begin casting Turgur's Insects<br />
You begin casting Quiesence<br />
<br />
Malo mob, slow mob, Q on the MT. Cleric kicks back and appreciates the help and is ususally FM. Sounds lazy, eh?<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: Normal grind goes screwy. <br />
<br />
Inc (( buttload ))<br />
You begin casting Greater Immobilize<br />
You begin casting Greater Immobilize<br />
You begin casting Tugur's Insects (hell ya, no time for this malos crap, take a chance)<br />
You begin casting Greater Immobilize<br />
You begin casting Malos (now you got them parked, get em debuffed)<br />
You begin casting Quiesence (on yourself of course. That's alot of aggro you just bought there, pal)<br />
<br />
Rest of the party (regardless of wether or not a chanter is present) took alot of slugs while you did your part of keeping the group alive. They also have been depending on the cleric for heals. If he was FM, your chances of survival are now pretty damned good. The sequence just noted is sometimes inturrupted with a good Tnarg's (go crits!) if someone is about to hit the low-health-aggro range. Many a mage have learned to survive with me, if he kites an unharmed add around me, close enough for Tnarg's, regardless of his health. <br />
<br />
Now, as far as etiquitte goes, make sure your group knows you are gonna help. Make hotkeys <br />
<br />
Quiesence on ( %T ) <br />
Fast fuggin heal on ( %T )<br />
<br />
Q lets your cleric know, not only should he not waste his mana casting elixir, he also shouldnt waste your mana by overwriting it. And the CH can wait a bit. <br />
<br />
Tnarg's let's the cleric know, he can inturrupt his own fast heal and begin his CH... I got yer back, bro!<br />
<br />
And most importantly, never forget you are a shaman! If you cast malos, tugur's, Q, Tnarg's and another Q on every pull, you just blew over 1k mana. And before the next pull, you will be FM and ready again. And that my friend, is our claim to fame. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Most clerics I've grouped with lately tend to focus on the MT and let the others fend for themselves. I know they're just letting them get down far enough to throw a complete heal or something, but I'll usually torpor the casters or tnarg a secondary melee just to keep all the red bars looking pretty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If I see a caster getting hit, I heal them.<br />

When a Rogue, Ranger, etc... gets below 50% I heal them.<br />
<br />
When the MT get below 40% I heal them.<br />
<br />
Of course if I see the Cleric heal land before my heal I duck out, and yes, I do use hotkeys to let the group know I am healing a specific person.<br />
<br />
I like having the cleric do what they are there to do, however I would rather have some mana 'wasted' rather than have the whole group die because of a lucky series of hits that kills someone. If the cleric want's to complain then let them complain, the group is still alive, whichever way you look at it.<br />
<br />
Some of those mobs in the PoP zones can kill someone fast. You cannot always rely on one person to heal.</div></div><hr />

When I am stuck with a cleric, in a normal situation (again, fully slowable mobs), I occasionally toss a Q on the MT, but otherwise let the cleric do his job.  I handle all healing of party members that aren't the MT, including the puller and anyone else foolish enough to grab agro.  Enchanters with pets we usually split the healing, if he gets a resist or a couple interrupts, he's gonna need both of us healing him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just curious, whenever you are grouped with a cleric, do you offer (or insist, or go ahead and do anyway, whatever) to heal non-tanks or everyone but the MT to help save the cleric some mana?<br />

<br />
I've been the only healer in the group a lot of times.  I can handle it.  That said, I MUCH prefer to have a backup healer in my group than to be the only healer.  I like knowing that someone is there to cover when someone else draws agro when I'm halfway through a CH.  I like knowing someone is there to heal me when I just got heal agro and the add is pounding me.  <br />
<br />
As to the etiquette...call your heals.  I usually only call CH but if I end up in a group with another healer I try to call all my heals.  That way everyone knows what is happening and there is less wasted mana.  Also, if you both call at the same time, backup healer usually ducks.  Although I used to duck if I called second, most shaman and druid I've found will duck and expect me to continue so I changed to that.  Is a good idea to determine who ducks if you want to heal a lot though so you don't both duck and watch the MA die.  While that can be amusing, it wastes time.  :)<br />
<br />
Thank you to those of you who keep group regen going all the time!  I've been in a few pickup groups lately and I've had to ask for it.  I don't understand that...is there a reason some people don't?  I use divine arbitration (averages the hit points) a lot and if the group is regened usually that is enough not to have to heal afterward.  If there is no regen going I have to follow with a group heal depending on how mana hit points I just averaged.  Pick up group rant (this weekend was a good reminder of why I never do pickup groups...):  I grouped with two shaman who didn't know that clerics don't want focus.  I asked both of them for dex and they both replied with &quot;I focused you.&quot;  I had to explain that I clicked it off because it doesn't stack with my self buff.  Shouldn't any shaman high enough to be in PoV know that already?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Question I have that sorta goes with this thread...<br />
Unslowed add is pounding your cleric.  Do you (1) heal the cleric or (2) slow the add.  I would expect the answer to be slow over heal but I'm honestly not sure and want to know for the future when it happens that I'm the shaman in the group not the cleric.  :)  Ariene can tank a slowed mob for a bit chaneling fast heals if needed.  She can't tank an unslowed mob for very long at all.  So I would think if the shaman slowed that would have the chance of pulling the agro off the cleric but even if it didn't the cleric would be able to survive long enough for the MA to get it under control.  OH, or (3) root it and expect the cleric to back up?  That would prob be best on mobs you know for certain are rootable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">As to the etiquette...call your heals.<br />
<br />
I dont call my heals as it takes hotkeys I dont have available.  I have another banks set up with hotkeys to call heals... but it does get in the way of my other functions, so unless I am raiding, I generaly dont do it.  Of course I am usualy the only healer for my groups so its easy to get away with this.<br />

<br />
People dont realize just how much healing benefit you can get out of group replenishment, and its a mana hog if only one person is getting hit.  I tend to use it, and not worry about healing anyone who isnt under 80% -the regen will top them off soon enough.<br />

<br />
Sure, we know it doesnt stack.  What do you want a dex buff for anyway?  (yes, I have cleric friends who love to melee and want dex for procs...) its a waste of our time to mem a single target spell to buff you with.  The benefit to the group from you having dex is next to nothing.  We dont mem (some of us dont even have) the single stat buffs, they dont stack with our primary buff -focus.  If we have it, its on some unused page in the back of the spellbook.  To us what you are doing is like clicking off virtue and asking for a symbol so we can cast our own AC buff.  We dont tend to think of things like increased mana regen :)<br />

<br />
My first response to a cleric taking a beating is to heal the cleric.  If I pull heal agro and wind up with the mob on me, fine -I am used to slowing while taking a beating.  If the tank gets the mob off of the cleric, then I can slow it.  If the cleric dies we have a problem.  If the cleric calls DA, then I slow and watch the tanks health until the cleric is back.<br />
<br />
-long response... slow day at work :)</div></div><hr />

I would expect the answer to be slow over heal but I'm honestly not sure and want to know for the future when it happens that I'm the shaman in the group not the cleric.  :)  Ariene can tank a slowed mob for a bit chaneling fast heals if needed.  She can't tank an unslowed mob for very long at all.  So I would think if the shaman slowed that would have the chance of pulling the agro off the cleric but even if it didn't the cleric would be able to survive long enough for the MA to get it under control.  OH, or (3) root it and expect the cleric to back up?  That would prob be best on mobs you know for certain are rootable?<br />
<br />
I'll answer this, because I see you play a 56 shaman, so you're in a similar situation to me. This is my approach in Tier 1 planes and other places - it may be different for Tier 2+ where mobs hit harder, but I'll find that out when I get there.<br />
<br />
At 59, my fast heal is Chloroblast. 428 hp heal, 3 second cast. Turgur's Insects is also 3 second cast.<br />
<br />
Chain casting Chloroblast or using Stoicism will possibly keep the cleric alive against an unslowed tier 1 PoP mob, but maybe not. So, if the cleric is nearly dead, I'll heal. If there's a little leeway, I will slow, and leave the cleric to heal himself or DA. My heal isn't going to help a lot against an unslowed mob, but the slow will make a difference. Even if the slow is resisted, the mob will usually turn on me, unless the cleric is very low health. If the slow hits, then healing for me or the cleric won't be a problem.<br />
<br />
However, I would like to say that this doesn't happen very often. It's usually when we get adds that one pounds on the cleric when he heals the tank, and I mostly have time to slow, or to get resisted slow agro before the cleric gets to the point of low health agro.<br />
<br />
Of course, at 62 we get a vastly improved quick heal, 1300 hp in 3.75 seconds cast, which will be much more effective than Chloroblast.</div></div><hr />
