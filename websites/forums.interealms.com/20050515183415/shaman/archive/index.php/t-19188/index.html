Balance of the Nihil  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4900&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Now the two spells look like serious upgrades. But...<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaos Breath erased and the plague of delusion is up<br />
<br />
Plague of Daluda  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4901&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Why this stupid dot is not erased instead? I don't want another useless disease dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So slow now 1.5 min duration, and -40 resist but with a minor mana increase and also recast has been changed down to 6 seconds. This looks pretty good now. <br />
Ancient Chaotic pain the cast time reduced down to 2.5 seconds.../boggle.(Edit, Cache was showing Quiesence upgrade still and not the new changes of a 600 hp/300 mana cannibalize which is very nice)<br />
Plague of Daluda the spell message altered lol.<br />
At least the slow change is good. Now a replacement for Turgurs in the spell line up.(for Ldon at least, still only a 60% slow)</div></div><hr />

The Canni4 upgrade is looking better. Still cringing at the 'Ancient' pretitle. The slow is getting there.<br />

Good job to those in beta. Just wait till the Proposal starts flowing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">a 60% slow for 1.5 mins... So it's useful for preslowing very resistant mobs or perhaps in certain situations where slowing is only marginally needed anyway (LDoN)...  I'd stop WAY short of calling it a replacement for Turgur's though.<br />
<br />
Summing it up, they have made a postive change to the new Canni to make it worthwhile.  We still have utter crap for our lvl 65 damage spell and an extremely unexciting/underpowered upgrade to Q.<br />
<br />
Call me unimpressed.</div></div><hr />

Like that it's more of a mini-canni5, but not sure if it will be able to replace Canni4, or worth taking up the spell gem for it just yet.<br />

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=4899&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
It's showing Chaotic Pain, now changed to Breath of Trushar, to be an HoT as well as mana regen over time.<br />
<br />
I think that's neat.<br />
<br />
And as far as the recast goes, they are giving us what we wanted:  same amount of regen, less button pushing giving us time to cast in between canni casts.<br />
<br />
Why does this slow have to replace turgur's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">its a lower ratio than every other canni spell, but not enuff to complain .53 from .55 ...if they could use a calcuator, it would be 360mana/655hps <br />
<br />
The 18 sec recast is gay, should be 3sec like canniIV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">almost 3 clicks per minute for 880 mana after a Q. A good solid upgrade. Chain casted canni4 in comparison is a some odd 500 after a Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Booo, 18 second recast? On the plus side, if you're desperate for mana, you could mem both :)<br />
<br />
If Chaotic pain is ours, I will be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If that new Canni goes live, I will now buy this expansion... it just became worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The new canni will only be worthwhile if its obtainable. The ancient part scares the crap outta me. <br />
<br />
Who cares if we get a nice upgrade if only the current time+ people will see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">From the looks of it, we're screwed in this expansion, as always, but lets not give up all hope yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, let's see... taking 2 casts of chaotic pain, that's 41 seconds, factoring in the wait time for a third casting, and assuming you cast as soon as the gem un-greys.<br />
<br />
1336 HP for 720 mana.<br />
<br />
In 41 seconds, you could chain-cast Canni4 7 times...<br />
<br />
1036 HP for 574 mana.<br />
<br />
So, bigger bite, more mana, and with 2 casts vs 7, you have a fairly abundant amount of time for doing everything else, where the Canni4 option would mean that you would ONLY be regenning mana during that time, and not actually casting productive stuff.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if they upped the mana recovered to 380, shore up the efficiency a bit, but this is a huge leap forward compared to the total trash they've been giving us before.<br />
<br />
The new slow doesn't seem to be too bad either. Duration prevents it from being an effective soloing spell, but it looks good for groups.<br />
<br />
Comparing to Turgurs:<br />
<br />
/Same 200 range.<br />
/Same 6 second recast.<br />
/Magic resist check.<br />
<br />
+Half the cast time<br />
+Resist check of -40<br />
+75 less mana<br />
<br />
-1/4th the duration.<br />
-50% more disease counters bodes ill for aggro generation, especially on a resist.<br />
-15% less slowing.<br />
-Level 65 means Focus III items won't work on it, harder to channel.<br />
<br />
Overall, this looks like something I would use on a regular basis. It doesn't really replace Turgurs, not enough to put Turgurs to the back of the spellbook the way Turgurs does to Togors, but this looks like an extremely viable alternative in most situations.<br />
<br />
I may even buy the expansion now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The canni looks great, no more finger pain but the ancient tag worries me. I  dont wanna have to key for vex thal again if you know what i mean.<br />
<br />
The heal over time,, i dont care i dont want more healing i rather have damage over healing,, melee damage pet damage dont matter, get rid of the disease dot put in a new pet? or something that buffs lvl 65 melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's not the nature of these spells that worry me, its the lack of others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Think of it this way:<br />
<br />
In 20.5 seconds we can canni4 3.7 times, for 300 or so mana<br />
<br />
With this new spell, we can just hit a button once for 360 mana, and spend the rest of the time doing other stuff. I'd gladly trade some efficiency for that.<br />
<br />
It still needs some tweaking though. Make it 1 second cast time change the fizzle adjustment to zero. We're the only class whose mana regen is succept to interrupts and fizzles, and is unusable while on the run, so making it a little friendlier to actually try to cast would be quite welcome.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=4904&amp;source=Test Where do we draw the line? The new SK Spear is leaps and bounds better than the quite similar Spear of Torment.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">They are getting there, cann upgrade looks decent.<br />
<br />
The slow needs to be made more like -40 to dr checks, since its dr curable vs mr if its going to have that short of a duration.<br />
<br />
Currently I will STILL be throwing turgurs on everything that moves, first, regardless.  -100 on the slow would make me throw it first, since a malos + turgurs is still better for 2 reasons, 1: It debuffs the mob for everyone and 2: turgurs slow % and duration is superior.<br />
<br />
The dot needs to be made lure, and uncurable (or add in a TON of curse counters) in order to give the pvp aspect balance.  Make it at least do 4500 damage if its going to stay disease for 2 mintues, 3250 for pr in 7 ticks w/80 curse counters.  MAKE it so a bard cannot cure my *(#$&amp;$# dots in less then 2 singing ticks (which is utterly annoying as hell).  <br />
<br />
This way our dots are not doing so much damage someone cant stop the bleeding, but are truely cursed.<br />
<br />
The slow though needs a bit more tweaking, and a cripple effect tied into it, make it truely lure based.  Wizards got high lure based spells for damage, we need high lure based slows for shaman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Khelud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For such a big level discrepency between our current slow (51) and the new one (65), you'd think there would be alot less wrong with the new one.<br />
I dont understand the short duration... timeing slows on a raid is one thing, but I dont want to be doing it in an exp group.<br />
I dont understand the lesser slow % ... there should be a clear choice for no1 shaman slow, and this new one looks like a no2 slow to me... <br />
If they are going to be this lazy with our new spells just make it exactly like the level 51 slow, and dump a -40mr on it....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The new slow is strickly an LDoN quick and dirty slow, for those mobs that have MR that can be overcome with the built in -40 MR check, pure and simple.  Not a Turgurs replacement in general, but perhaps a viable option on LDoN easy missions.  Let's not forget that there are 10 more LDoN-style &quot;instanced&quot; zones coming in the expansion.  This slow is taylor made for that environment.<br />
<br />
However, I must join the group of very concerned folks who believe that the new &quot;Ancient&quot; canni spell will be very difficult to obtain.  If you look at the other classes ancient spells, they are upgrades to other 65 spells they are already getting, mainly better dd's.  If the past is any indication, these upgraded spells at the same level means to earn it you have a much more difficult process for obtaining it.  NOT what I'm hoping for, since this new canni would be great to close the gap between the level 58 canni 4 and canni aa.  But I fear I may never see it. (anyone actually have Ancient Feral Avatar?)<br />
<br />
Dot is junk, move along, nothing to see here.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the upgraded Q is being made into an aa.  One can only hope.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Actually the whole idea with AA spells is somewhat appealing. Making key-spells into AA spells will guarantee that everyone gets their copy so to say. This ofcourse means more AA's to get, but it might be an alternative to paying outrageous prices for class defining spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Agreed Vigdis.  Bottom line, they only make their revenue targets if enough folks buy the expansion, so they have to give us a reason to buy it and keep playing for several more months to get the spells and aa's.<br />
<br />
Overall, if the canni spell is actually obtainable by less than a time-capable guild, then I'm pretty darn happy with the changes.  If you have any doubts, check out all the changes on LUCY.  It seems that except for the new &quot;ancient&quot; spells, most other classes got NO changes to their spells.  Only shaman spells got any significant changes, all for the good.<br />
<br />
Could it be that someone is actually listening?  And, my hat is off to the beta shaman, I'm sure it took tons of feedbacking to actually get changes made.  Well done.  <br />
<br />
Not celebrating yet, but definitely looking better than it did.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am happy with the new changes. Still don't really care for another disease dot but I am happy with the way the new slow and Cann are looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My two cents.<br />
<br />
New Slow: Looks very, very very good. It gives the shaman the status of the true preslower. The beastlord will now really have no purpose as far as that. With a 1.5 second cast, and a mana DECREASE from turgurs, on top of the lure check, this will probably be the primary slow in LDoN adventures, and it will DEFINITELY have a spell gem in my mem bar for raids. I would like to see the slow bumped up to 65% so we can really have no contest with the beastlord but what are you going to do about it. Very nice upgrade, and hardly overpowered.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaos Breath: If you notice it is not gone, it just has not been tagged with SHM65. It is now called Breath of Trushar (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4899&amp;source=Test). This is just worthless. Utterly worthless. 20 more mana for 60 more hp/tick. This increases HP regenerated per mana from 6 hp/mana to 6.5 hp/mana. Wow. If this stayed at 200 mana from Quiescence, I would be okay. Right now it is just a worthless upgrade.<br />
<br />
Plague of Daluda: I am a fan of Disease DoTs, I must admit it. They are worthless in exp groups I totally agree. but With crit DoT aa's, on raids disease dots play a critical roll. Ultor, Pox, and Daluda. The combo together makes for over 370/tick without burning affliction 4. The beauty of the disease DoT is they are &quot;Fire and Forget,&quot; You unleash them on the raid mob, and then you can do whatever you want for 2.1 minutes while they act out. No, you aren't going to get a killshot, but it will contribute almost 7k damage. If you want to go full on DPS, fire the disease off and then attack with poison and magic DoTs while the disease dots take off a hefty 400/tick. I wouldn't mind a disease DoT upgrade. I also wouldn't mind a poison or magic DoT upgrade. I also wouldn't mind a nuke upgrade. I am glad they look to improve our DPS in any case.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain: PERFECT. JUST what we wanted. Last week I removed canni4 from my spell lineup. it just doesn't do anything any more. The mana increase is miniscule. my time is better spent doing something else. One thing bothers me though, it is called an Ancient. Ancient does not appear to be part of the name, there are about a dozen &quot;ancient&quot; spells on test. If these are like Luclin Ancients, this would not be very good. This is a NEEDED upgrade, not something I can go months and months without while waiting for it to drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sony, if you read this, Make Chaotic pain not an ancient. Instead, make Breath of Tushar the ancient, and make it heal 420/tick for 200 mana. Maybe tone Chaotic pain a little down. Leave the essence the same, however, high mana for high HP, with a long recast. Small teeny cannis for small teeny mana just does not work, I cannot canni 24/7</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Khelud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If this new slow is seen as a LDON only spell it shouldn't be level 65. Lots of non-65 people do LDON too. <br />
It looks more like a level 60 spell at best to me.<br />
The duration is still way too short to replace 51 slow.. a 4+ pull and you're going to be going back and reslowing to be sure it holds.<br />
I dont see alot good about this slow, I dont need a situational slow hogging another spell gem...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Agreed Penny, Ancient Chaotic Pain is a must have, Breath of Trushar is a marginal increase (if that).

The resist check has nothing to do with how a spell is cured. All slows have disease counters, it doesn't matter if they are magic or disease resist. Also, I doubt they'd give us a disease slow with a -40 resist check when we already have unresistable, fast cast Malicious Decay to combine with Grummus.<br />

If ya got the hps for it, why not let the shaman do as he pleases.1) bump the slow percentage up to 70% and the duration to 3 minutes and I'd never mem turgurs again, except for stuff like VT bosses or other stupid long fights (or meleeing BoT giants to death to piss off gimp people).<br />
2) Eventually we're limited by the ammount of HP we can recover while remaining efficient. I'd assume that point is around 450 a tick on raids with quies/regen/bardsongs/SD/Innate. using a spell like this, we'd be able to pull off around 210 mana a tick (ignoring mana spent healing), which is around where some of the best mage pet canni was. I really don't think that's what SOE is working towards. the 18 sec recast is lame, but it still works out to a pretty slick upgrade. I'd love to see the recast lowered to 12 seconds so we can do it 4 times a minute instead of 3, but I don't think that's gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

That leaves 21 slots for dps. Now lets be honest, DOTs are just crappy DPS compared to nukes, as they stand now. i'll quote the top druid in my guild, &quot;what is a dot?&quot;. He nukes, and with reason. What's the point of casting a DoT if you can do 1k more damage with a crit for 3100 60% of your casts? Mages aren't going to DoT.

My point is Its really only necros and shaman who's mana is better spent with DoTs than Nukes. For all other casters, dps is faster and more efficient in nuke form. 21 slots is plenty for the 5-6 necro/shaman on a 40 person raid. <br />
<br />
What you need to be far more concerned with is the rogues and other melees who are proccing their poisons or level 12 necro DoTs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I still wouldn't use the new slow.  Since spell haste doesn't reduce the cast time on anything below 3 seconds its only a 1 second difference in cast times if you have even the lowest percent of spell haste.  Lure spells have a -300 resist adjust, -40 isn't even close for 15% less slow and a 1.5 minute duration.  If you only use it to preslow a mob why not just malos on inc?  I don't see how a -40 resist mod with a 1 second less cast time at 15% less makes us any better of a slower 99% of the time let alone the king of slowers.</div></div><hr />

or <br />
1100pt poison or fire nuke would be welcome also.<br />

I often mem 2 slows at once because I can't afford to wait the 3 seconds it takes turgurs to be castable again.  18 seconds is a joke.<br />
<br />
They can either do something to give the impression that they are actually thinking about useful upgrades or they can lose customers, it comes down to that.  I still don't see anything of substance here*.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*The new canni is interesting, but a) it's still listed as an Ancient, which means it might as well not exist, and b) I need to canni when I have less than 600 hp far too often to replace canni4 with that thing, which makes it unusable for me.  I'm not memming 2 cannis.  Would 300hp for 150 mana be so hard to come up with?  Come on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plague of Daluda is still utterly useless.<br />
<br />
New slow is now useless in a different way - in a fast exp group where you want to use this is will now last the entire fight hopefully but for that kind of mana I will just cast Turgur's.<br />
<br />
Lucy shows no HoT spell for shaman, didn't we use to have one?<br />
<br />
Anyways, I feel we still need all of the following:<br />
 A healing upgrade - make it a Torpor upgrade so I can't make the cleric and druid feel useless by healing everyone in sight and make it bigger then Supernal Elixir so shaman actually get to cast it and dont have it overwritten.<br />
 Some way to do more damage - the current state is pitiful. Over better DoTs, unresistable DoTs, faster nukes or bigger nukes does not really make a difference as long as it still works in 1 minute fights.<br />
 A true upgrade to Turgur's, not some sorta-in-this-or-that-situation- upgrade. Keep all the turgur's numbers, add a -30 resist check and call it balanced.<br />
 A way to buff melees, supposedly our area of expertise better then our hybrid. Group Avatar and combat effects/strikethrough/etc. buffs would be a way of doing this.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, I feel we need all of this. We are still paying for being powerful back in Kunark and Velious, with more expensive spells, longer casting spells, and spells with a lesser impact then other classes and that on top of having to waste time just to get mana back.<br />
Where any other class casts a spell (like a heal or a nuke) then sits down to med(or has the OPTION to go cast more spells) a shaman will have to cast two spells, each of which will take longer then the single spell cast by the other class, will then have spent an extra 300 or so mana, which we then get to cannibalize back. If the shaman is lucky he will be at full mana again by the time the other caster is, except that other caster had the option to do something else in the meantime.<br />
The quadruple hit of active mana regeneration, long cast time, inefficient spells and low impact has to go if shaman are to do anything else in groups and on raids then cast malos, cast slow and then sit and twiddle their thumbs.</div></div><hr />

Quiescence is a spell I never demem, so that would be a permanent spell slot freed up (assuming reasonable reuse time on the aa).  If it's a regular spell, then ehhh, only so-so.<br />
<br />
The new canni looks great.  Remember, no law against using canni4 and this one together, so that's really good.  Only problem will be if it is difficult to obtain.<br />
<br />
The new slow is decent now.  It would be more of an LDoN slow.  It would also be nice for really resistant mobs.  Can't say I'd always have it loaded, but it would see some use.  At least it brings us back to being superior to BST as slowers in every regard.<br />
<br />
The disease DoT is really worthless except for raid mob damage (who cares) and soloing (who cares, we already do that well).  I'd scrap this spell entirely and put in something else (a nuke or a spot heal).<br />

The slow still needs some work, but it's getting a little better. Who here has an extra spell slot to allocate to ANOTHER slow? I know I don't. Otherwise, it's just a situational slow that can't be memmed fast when the need arises. It will be used to predebuff raid mobs, and for LDoN, and that's about it. GIVE US A REAL UPGRADE TO TURGUR'S, PLEASE. Otherwise, we'll still be stuck with a primary slow that's 5 expansions old. Oh, and how about something to differentiate shaman, the alleged masters of slowing, from the other slowing classes out there?<br />

275 mana<br />
1.5 second cast<br />
5 second recast<br />
75% slow<br />
-50 MR check<br />

Imagine being able to slow reliably without pre-debuffing... Malos eats up a ton of mana and takes forever to cast. Let's put Malos back where it belongs - in our raid spellsets, not our xp spellsets.<br />

Completely agree. This gives us more variety in handling different slow situations and is a 'good thing' (tm). It has to have some disadvantages like relative short duration and a bit less slow, as SoE seems to view slows themselves already as too powerful (see mitigation).<br />
<br />
The canni-update is fine aswell. Come on, a recast of 3 secs for that spell?? That is so going to happen for a 300+ mana regeneration spell (3 secs? /boggle).<br />
<br />
Will have to check, if those numbers could still use some tweaking, but they 'look' ok.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">The slow is starting to look better, but the -40 resist check wouldnt be enough to make me use it. If they really want to make it an upgrade to Turgur, give it a -175 or -200 resist check. Then it would be worth using, even with the short duration.<br />
<br />
The cannibalize spell is okay. 18 second refresh is kinda harsh, but maybe not in practice. I'd have to actually use it and see what kind of rhythm there is to it's use combined with CannV. It may be pretty good, even with the refresh. But, if the long refresh wound up being a hinderance to my ability to cann mana when I needed it, that spell would go into the back of the book and CannIV would stay. We cant afford to allocate 2 slots for Cann spells.<br />
<br />
The disease dot is actually better than Breath of Ultor - more damage for less mana. But I rarely use dots anymore - mostly I use my rain spell, or Velium Strike if I cant use AE. I think I'd rather have a second line of rain spells based off cold resist - hopefully one that wasnt resisted all the time, and did more damage than Tears of Saryrn.<br />
<br />
I also think it's about time we got some better healing, since we are supposed to be a priest. Obviously clerics should heal the best, and I dont mind druids healing better than me, but paladins should not be better healers than shamans. They're a hybrid. We're priests. A group heal would probably fill that hole - say a group version of Tnarg's for about 900 mana with the same cast time. Sound too powerful? I dont think a 1300 group heal is too powerful for a priest, when you have a hybrid priest that has a 900 point group heal that casts faster.<br />

Say bye bye to being the best at curing poison/disease/curses. Mysteriously, now clerics are better than we are. All clerics must hang.<br />
<br />
While I'm on the subject of spells; it doesnt get brought up much here but why is the level 54 Blast of Poison more damage than the level 61 Spear of Torment? Lower mana cost for less damage...uh ok. Doesnt seem like an upgrade to me, just a sideways improvement. How about you jack up the damage and the mana cost on Spear of Torment and make it a true upgrade. Then the focus effect on my ornate gloves has a purpose, albeit a marginal one.<br />
<br />
Despite my hatred of buff beggars, I still know one of the main attractions of having me in a group is my ability to buff. However, the two most important kinds of buffs are hps (stamina included), and mana regen. We're quite far behind clerics in the ability to buff hps. Focus is 544 hps. Virtue is 1405. An 1105 hp buff would be something to establish us right back up where we belong as buff kings. Too much, you say? Feast your eyes;<br />

&quot;Now&quot; better?  Word of Replenishment was added over a year ago with PoP.  Its not new.   Also, look at the mana cost (Mana: 1100), clerics aren't going to be chain casting that for long.   Removing 14 counters doesn't remove a lot of the AE's out there either.<br />

<br />
I really don't understand the complaints of the turgurs upgrade. Seriously I  guess I must have been mad to think about 7 ticks being good but I did for a -resistadj slow not having to cast Malos.  <br />
Situational wise its cool to consider using another slow for the lineup, rather than a slow to deal with EVERY lineup. <br />
<br />
New cannabalize very good in that after ldon mob dead, one cannabilize as opposed to multiple cannibalizes during the fight. <br />
<br />
I agree with the posters in this thread that are urging for a new buff or a healing upgrade or a ability to do damage.<br />
<br />
Even with a negative resist slow in Ldon, to consider putting Bane on them we have to debuff. So damage wise we are no different that before. Healing wise we have saved time to concentrate on healing but I don't believe we are any more efficient in healing. Furthermore I am dubious that the aa heal will boost that.</div></div><hr />

2) Stygiana's Canni over Time suggestion<br />
<br />
600 HP/200 mana coversion for 4 ticks for a total of 2400 HP/800 mana<br />

3) An upgrade to Cannibalization(Canni V) in form of an AA that reduces the recycle time by 10/25/50%<br />

The facts of the matter are that SoE has thrown us a bone with the new Canni spell and Slow Upgrade changes.  Both are good spells with solid purpose.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">So, Lets take the highest Canni SPELL cast (in other words, not including AA) , which is 18 secs, and do a bit of comparison.<br />
<br />
<br />
Canni1<br />
5 casts = <br />
17 secs (including recast times)<br />
Decrease Hps by 335<br />
Increase Mana by 145<br />
1.72 hps/1 mana<br />
<br />
Canni2<br />
5 casts = <br />
17 secs (including recast times)<br />
Decrease Hps by 335<br />
Increase Mana by 185<br />
1.81 hps/1 mana<br />
<br />
Canni3<br />
5 casts = <br />
17 secs (including recast times)<br />
Decrease Hps by 370<br />
Increase Mana by 210<br />
1.76 hps/1 mana<br />
<br />
Canni4<br />
3 casts = <br />
16.5 secs (including recast times)<br />
Decrease Hps by 444<br />
Increase Mana by 246<br />
1.80 hps/1 mana<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain<br />
1 cast =<br />
18 secs <br />
Decrease Hps by 668<br />
Increase Hps by 360<br />
1.85 hps/1mana<br />
<br />
So basically the % of hps for mana is almost the same for all the canni including our AA. The difference is being able to do SOMETHING else instead of sitting there and mashing the buttons. Ancient Chaotic Pain is the upgrade for Canni4 and rightly so. <br />
<br />
For those of you who don't think it's powerful enough, feel free to get out ole Canni1 (since it has the best ratio) and do that 5 times while I hit my one cast of ACP and am nuking or doing something more fun while you're still mashing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Balance of Nihil - What a joke, while i can slow 75% i will continue to do so.  If a group wants to slow 60%+, they will take a Beastmaster or Enchanter for better dps/mana regen/buffs.  Even on hard LDON adventures Turgirs normally lands first or second attempt without Malos.  I am lucky enough to have a Time's Antithesis so i can spam it till it sticks, so recast time is not so much of an issue.  I can slow a bunch of mobs pretty quickly, which seems handy as the groups i'm in tend to kill a room at a time not single pull each mob.  With a crappy recast time and percentage the new slow sucks.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain - About time.  Canny 4 gives me less than 1% mana on my bar per cast atm.  The recast time is way to slow on the new spell.  It should be the same as canny 4 not 18 secs.  This needs to be fixed. <br />

One thing most every person in game Ive spoken to agrees on is that Mobs and Raid encounters are now tuned to the mob being slowed to 75%...... Meaning PoP mobs were designed around our slows...<br />
<br />
With this in mind why the heck would anyone accept a lesser slow? I dont care if its instant cast instant recast.... Sony has tuned the game to the shaman slow and mitigated to the shaman slow then they trot this 60% slow out like its a good thing?<br />
<br />
Get a grip Sony.... Bump the slow back to the 75% you have the mobs and encounters tuned to....Leave the mod and cast time and take the duration back to 6mins and you have done something to address our 5 expansion old MAIN ability.... Tks but no Tks<br />
<br />
Canni looks decent... not thrilled with the recast but at least its a effort.<br />
<br />
Disease dot.... ya right....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Although I am encouraged by the improvements to the new slow, I don't think that 60% is enough.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Ran this in a short VB parse and figured this out. <br />
<br />
Total duration: 12000 seconds.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize IV - 2526 casts.<br />
Cannibalize IV - 6315 seconds casttime total.(not counting recast)<br />
Cannibalize IV - 373848 hp decrease.<br />
Cannibalize IV - 207132 mana increase.<br />
Cannibalize IV - 17,3 mana per second.<br />
Cannibalize IV - 0,554 mana per hitpoint.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain - 586 casts.<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain - 1465 seconds casttime total.(not counting recast)<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain - 391448 hp decrease.<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain - 210960 mana increase.<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain - 17,6 mana per second.<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain - 0,539 mana per hitpoint.<br />
<br />
Notice the enormous amount of casttime decrease. Also note that theres a 2.25 sec refresh between every cast of a spell where you cannot cast anything else. Fewer casts (of the new canni) means less time is spent waiting for spell gems to refresh AND less clicking. This looks like a very good upgrade to me, not to mention, should you ever want more mana you could probably mem both and chain them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">You really should including the 2.5 recast time for canni4 and the 18 recast time for ACP. It would change the outcome some, because I think you believe ACP has a 2.5 recast and it doesn't. You can't chain the two. You could do ACP then about 3 canni4, before you could hit acp again. Personally, I wouldn't want to give up a spell slot for another canni to have two up, but this is a good suggestion for after a wipe and rebuffing the group. <br />
<br />

ACP<br />
Quiess<br />
Canni5<br />

Canni4<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">On the whole doesn't look too bad to me.<br />
<br />
To reiterate what some others mentioned:<br />
<br />
1)  the slow really needs to be 65%.  beastlords shouldn't be knocking it off.  Otherwise, I like the slow so far.  <br />
<br />
2)  the &quot;ancient&quot; concerns me.  I don't want this to be some stupid rare drop.  I've been part of a number of VT clearings now, and while I got Ancient:Bane, that's a really crappy way to disseminate spells - especially one so critical as a Canni upgrade.  <br />
<br />
If Ugzug is right, and he probably is, that's a little better, but I don't really care for LDoN that much myself.  It just seems sterile and artificial and stupid.  I dunno.  I slogged through to get Bane, but yech....<br />
<br />
3) I do think some kind of heal tweak is warranted.  <br />
<br />
4) I'd love an AE slow.  Or an AE malxxxx.  Preferably the malxxx I guess.  <br />
<br />
5) We still don't have a MGB raid spell.  One shaman bot can blast out of Fo7, and then nothing else to MGB.  <br />
<br />
Fundamentally, this class has become less and less interesting for me to play.  That's a bit novel after 5 years.  It's the first time I can recall really thinking that.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how it can be changed really.  There's too many classes already, with competing roles as it is.  <br />
<br />
However, shaman remain viable and, on the whole, balanced, notwithstanding the complaints here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">new canni id diffinately the right direction, possible a better ratio, or up to half canni5 might be better, but as it is i would still like it.<br />
<br />
the new slow heading right direction, but i dont want to be a preslower, i want to slow it . if mob resistant and hits hard you dont want to slow it first cos if it fails your summon and dead. any resistant mob i would malos first then slow completely negating this spell, and for less resistant mobs , well i still be using turgurs. <br />
shaman are top slowers dont give us somin beast already have at the same level. we need a 75% slow faster cast recast (maybe less resistant) frankly nothing esle will do. i still like the idea of slow stacking ie our slow stacks 5% with anyother slow. if you take mitigation into account it doesnt add up much atall, perhaps 10% better? (back i dont think you could have 1 spell that can take how mobs affect by slow into account:( ie on normal mobs 5% on mitigated slows 15% )<br />
<br />
the desease dot?  its 3045k but over 2.1mins far too slow, now i had 2 ideas , <br />
1. make it a 3045dd but witha 2 min recast? course despite the long recast wizards might be up in arms, so instead <br />
2. rain spell! 3*1000?<br />
maybe abit too much. so maybe 4* 760? i be happy with that.<br />
<br />
and new quin at 400/tick at the smallest perfer 500:) with aa to improve it 10%, 20%, 40% (or poss 15% 30% 50% if lower value used.)?<br />
<br />
basically this just on the spells they showing, there are other spells i would like but wont say on this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">When this is all said and done, we should send a critique of the &quot;upgrades&quot; to SoE so that they understand what they did wrong and right.  Having upgrades go in the right direction will not help us in future expansions if the Devs merely got a spell upgrade right by dumb luck.  These folks have to know exactly why an upgrade helped us or why it did not.  <br />
<br />
A Canni4 upgrade does not help us just because it adds more mana, it is the time savings that allows us to do other things that is the true benefit. (yeah I know, so we have extra time cast our crappy heals but we have to start someplace)<br />
<br />
I still think that we need some unique skill that bolsters our groupablility(new word).  I like the idea of focus buffs of short duration.  I would not mind standing in the back of a raid chain buffing Casters with a stacking 10% DD focus buff that only lasts a few mins and has a short recast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Canni is solid.  Rest is crap.<br />
<br />
A minor resist mod and negligible decrease in mana cost is hardly enough to compensate for a massive decrease in duration and very significant decrease in slow%.  Personally, I'd much prefer they just left the slows in game as is and stopped screwing around trying to tweak us by giving us some new slow that's only going to be situationally useful.  Just drop the new Slow completely and give us meaningful upgrades in areas we actually need them.<br />
<br />
DR DoT is still complete and utter crap.  Give us a new Rain or nuke.  Upgrading Tears, Spear, or Velium Strike makes a lot more sense than Ultor.<br />
<br />
Q upgrade is a joke.  60 more hp a tick is insignificant when our biggest problem is inability to do even relatively medium amounts of healing quickly.    A very minor upgrade to a level 65 spell as... another level 65 spell makes no sense.  Tnarg's needs an upgrade, not Q.<br />
<br />
EDIT: We don't need a new slow.  We ARE the best slowers already even if the margin has gotten smaller (Not necessarily a bad thing IMO).  The problem is that since we're not the massively better slowers than everyone else, the other things we bring to a group has become more important.<br />
<br />
Personally, my ideal spells would be canni6 as is now.  Add an upgrade to Tnargs healing about 1650-1700hp and a new Rain or Nuke.  I'm fond of the rains personally and think that'd be the best choice.  They are decent DPS but still slightly situational so that we don't just become another mindless nuker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Lets face it folks, we are not going to get a slow &quot;upgrade&quot; PERIOD. Not happening. SOE has spent the last 2 years trying to compensate for the EXTREME strangth of Turgurs as it is, with huge mitigation and immunities. <br />
<br />
All I really want is a new nuke (faster than VS, but more damage than SoT), a bit better heal (Tnargs isnt horrible with a good focus item and a bunch of AA, but its still a bit low for a &quot;priest&quot; class) and a minor upgrade to Canni 4.

Folks - we're not going to get a new Canni AND a new heal AND a new DD AND group heals AND a slow upgrade AND this AND that....<br />
<br />
The facts of the matter are that SoE has thrown us a bone with the new Canni spell and Slow Upgrade changes.  Both are good spells with solid purpose.  Expecting them to fix EVERYTHING in ONE expansion is unreasonable and naive... if they DID, ALL other classes would be screaming to the heavens about the disparity and they would be right.<br />
<br />
Just chill out... one step at a time.  Canni today... heal tomorrow... DD the next day.  A little patience goes a long way - especially when the argument is that these things have been broken since Kunark...<br />
<br />
The argument is not that these have been broken since Kunark - the argument is that we got less and smaller upgrades in every single one of our capabilities then every single other class did for five expansions straight.<br />
This is not made up with a single upgrade. So, while i might not expect to 'be given every single thing I want' I will not dance and sing because we are getting a moderate upgrade to a single spell line on test at the moment.</div></div><hr />

I see that SHM/65 was removed from this renamed spell.<br />
<br />
Some posters seem to think that this change in class from Shm/65 to none means that it is going to be an AA skill.  If that is true, I can definitely agree with Gloriana - Spectacular!!<br />
<br />
But - why do we assume that it means an AA skill?  It makes sense that all those changes would not have been made to a spell, unless it was going in to release .... I want it to be true ... should I believe it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">they took slow into account in kunark, they simply made boss mobs hit hard and innate hasted, so once slowed they hit at right speed for encounter. only as player became more skilled and equipement became better this wasnt enough (cleric rotation), the problem wasnt that slow is a powerful ability (which it is) but that player became alot better at working out how to do stuff, and better equiped. so instead of making a more tactical situation they took the easy way and either removed slow completely or mitigated it to make encounters just plain harder.<br />
the easiest way to make something harder was to not be able to slow it. <br />
hence shaman got nerfed. it was more verant, at the time,  lack of invention that caused the most problems.<br />
a level 60 raid equiped with kunark gear only, could not do any of the pop zones raid encounters, and thats with the same slow. <br />
slow would have no impact atall on alot of these counters. and i think even the exp mobs for group would actually be very hard to do if you where only in kunark gear.<br />
<br />
so please stop with the slow is all powerful, its not. very useful, but no all powerful.<br />
 in an outdoor zone i would say snare is much more powerful, cause if you can do damage from a distance you never get hit!</div></div><hr />

As for availablity:<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil = deletable spell<br />
Plague of Daluda = deletable spell<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain = NOT deletable<br />
<br />
Personally, I doubt Ancient Chaotic Pain will be a drop spell (say like Ancient Feral Avatar which is nodrop but drops in ST). My guess, since it's lvl 65, it will be a 1495 pt LDoN spell in the new continent. <br />
<br />
The other two, I could care less, but I bet they will be dropped spells in the new zones of some boss mob or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Deletable is just another flag. I wouldn't put too much into that telling if somethings dropped or bought.<br />
<br />
As far as the new spells go the new cann looks great. Sure it would be nice if it had a couple more mana to make it more efficient but it's already gonna a nice upgrade. It's a significant upgrade in volume and as several people have pointed out it still converts more hps to mana than you could do in the same time with cann 4 with less casts. That is a definite improvement in my book. Will definitely replace cann 4 in my spell line up as soon as i can get it.<br />
<br />
The new slow is definitely improved from where it was. As it is I can actually see myself using several different situations. Ldon normal missions, known highly resistant mobs etc. I'd love to see it as a total replacement for turgurs with 75% slow and 5+ minute duration but I don't think that would happen. Failing that I'd still like to see something tweaked a bit more on the current spell. Better slow percent, shorter recast or longer duration would be nice.<br />
<br />
As far as the potential AA q ability I can't say i'm impressed. The amount healed is still only minorly better than q and it's still only single target and Q isn't an expensive spell so the mana savings isn't a big deal. I'm not optimisitic on the recast time being low enough to alow me to drop q from my spell line up so it really doesn't get me much. Convert it over to a group HoT as an aa and i'll be happier altho I'd still like to see the slot changed so it stacked with cleric HoT's like bst and druid do.<br />

My 50 platinum is better spent on some meat pies so i can have 30 more max hps for a week.  As for all these people who are c omplaining about more healing, i dont think we need that all as a class.  In an elemental group if the cleric goes down i can typically keep the group up against 2 mobs.  No i cant do it indefinately and it takes lots of mana, but i can get the job done.  Pair me with a well geared tank and i can DUO hard adventure mobs/elemental mobs that hit for under 1000.  We're not clerics our healing is good as it is.</div></div><hr />

cleric +enc is completely diffeent from a shaman war. the enc was probably charming and runeing himself , the cleric just healing enc when he got hit.. very different.<br />
seen this done in potactic pit, and likely a shaman might be able to heal the enc in that circumstance. course the enc is probably got a high hp too. and not yer normal run of the mill. and if the enc didnt charm i bet this couldnt be done.<br />
<br />
hey darkpaw did cleric come back and where you able to do the adventure quickly? did you suceed or fail?<br />

LOL!   PSYCH!<br />
Anybody using Lucy to check our spells would have seen us losing a spell here and gaining another there... they actually just swapped the two.<br />
<br />
The HoT has no changes.<br />
<br />
The Cann4.5 changed as follows:<br />
OLD: Cann 4.5a turns 167 hp into 90 mana, Cast=2.5s, recast 3 sec<br />
NEW: Cann 4.5b turns 668 hp into 360 mana, Cast=2.5s, recast 18 sec<br />
<br />
That means the mana to hp ratio is: 53.9%<br />
<br />
That's the same as before, BTW.   Now to compare reasonably you can do either 4 casts of Cann4 [(2.5+3)*4=22]or 1 cast of Cann4.5b [(2.5+18)=20.5].<br />
<br />
Cann4 * 4 = 328 mana / 529 hp  [(82 mana / 148 hp) * 4]  (ratio 55.4)<br />
[u]Cann4.5b  = 360 mana / 668 hp (ratio 53.9)<br />
Difference =  32 mana / 139 hp<br />
 <br />
If they were going to make the ratio similar to the Cann4/Cann5 rate.<br />
<br />
That would put it at (360 mana / 650 hp) or (370 mana / 668 hp).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">hey darkpaw did cleric come back and where you able to do the adventure quickly? did you suceed or fail?<br />
having not been in that situation i would like to know. but i would think it would take alot longer with shaman only healing? and regular regen breaks?<br />
<br />
I think with me healing we killed at most 6 mobs in 15 minutes or so before we had a triple pull wipe us. Cleric didn't get back online for a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">cool (well not really) but my orignal post is correct in that it extremely hard for a shaman to heal in hard ldon. and only just backup, and diffinately not a main healer.<br />
<br />
personally i dont really want to be a main healer , but if like this the main healer disappears i want to be able to be effective at healing group, but by no means a main healer.. i.e we have enough so that we can heal and continue at an ok rate (ie finish the adventure in 85 mins) but just enough no more.<br />
<br />
the only way though i think to do this without making it bad for the lower planes, would be to have a group only spell. not sure how that would work though or aa that increase our tnargs and q effectiveness shaman only and not just the healing aa we have at moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">The hybrid took a big leap forward ahead of us in healing power it seems.  1k group heal?  Gimme that and forget the dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">They should have Balance of the Nihil to 70%, its the perfect spell when you pull. And until the tank get aggro he will hit less on you and after that cast turgur on it. Worked like a charm for me yesterday on test. About heals, I dont want more than I have and I cant see a reason why I should get it either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">New slow might have situational uses now....<br />
Still not really an upgrade.<br />
Frankly I would have to have 3 slows memmed in LDoN still.<br />
Sorry but there just is not enough spell slots imho it needs to be a true Turgur upgrade 75% and at bare min a 3.5 min duration.<br />
<br />
We shouldn't settle on that issue.<br />
14 levels and how many dang expansions?<br />
About time they did it right and not give us another situational slow.</div></div><hr />
