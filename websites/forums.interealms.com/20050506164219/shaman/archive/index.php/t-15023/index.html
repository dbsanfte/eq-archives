<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I just got my so-called ubah snare necklace, and to be honest, I'm not really sure what to do with it.  The cast time is so long and the duration is so short that the only good it seems to do is to stop runners.  The utility of that is obvious in a dungeon enviorment, but is there any other areas that I can benifit from using it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stopping runners is the only thing I use mine for.  I suppose root works too, but it can break unexpectedly.  Clinging darkness lasts 36 seconds every time.  And if a mob is rooted, it will keep attacking and/or casting.  I use it all the time when there isn't a snarer around, or if the snarer isn't too attentive in his duties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The neckless's primary purpose is to stop runners when it would other wise spell nasty things.  I find once you get use to the cast time its not all that bad.  Shoot the JBB has a 8 sec cast.  That thing flies compared to it.  Though from trial and error after two Jbb casts its ussually a good idea to give the old mob another snare for good measure.  It depends on the mob but they most often start running between 20-10% so start casting somewhere around the mid 30 to low 30ies.  Oh its also really handy for use lazy trolls that dont like walking far to loot our shinies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yerp, very nice item, especially for dungies, but useful anywhere a runner is dangerous. It sorta lives in my bag, ready to be swopped in  once I'm done buffing etc (Amulet of Insight), or swopped asap in a panic if my ranger/druid/necro forgets snare, hehe. No other use really, but don't think it's a bad item, you'll love it in the end =)<br />
<br />
Oh, another (fine) use is it bemuses people no end that haven't heard of them and wonder how on earth you are stopping runners.</div></div><hr />
