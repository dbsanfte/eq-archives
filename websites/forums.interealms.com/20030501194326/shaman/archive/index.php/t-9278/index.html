<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I understand that there are spells that are dropping that we can't use...or that they are far less beneficial for us than previous spells. <br />
<br />
Why are we complaining? Every time you kill a mob you can't expect to get an upgrade to your gear...You gotta expect the rusty dagger a lot...<br />
<br />
I say instead of worrying about what drops, bandy the troops to stand up for more drops. Torpor...Malo...BoN...etc. Heck, at least Sony is turning their heads toward the Shaman lately.(Alchemy?) Fine, so we get diaper hoo-hash spells...That's just a few. Someone put together a list already that has a list of 13 spells that they considered useless...and people have already been saying no to that list.<br />
<br />
So we have a few (VERY FEW) spells in the big scheme of our spellbook that are usless to the level that you obtain them. Let's not be the &quot;Ranger/Druid&quot; for 2002/2003 with complaints.<br />
<br />
Loot the rusty dagger, canni, and wait for MT to shout that all important &quot;INC&quot; again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All complaints aside, the most glaring issue is that they left a screwed up spell progression for PoP. Originally we got a HP buff, then single target stat buffs, then group stat buffs, followed at 65 with all rolled in one in group form. The problem is that they basically moved the single target stat buffs into the HP buff but didnt remove the stat buffs. It would have made more sense to give us a HP buff ala tali of Kragg single target stat buffs, from 61-62, then a focus type spell at 63-64 then group at 65. To just lay down and accept that as taking the good with the bad, its just stupidity or laziness period. Its like paying taxes for a program that doesnt exist and only enriching the politicians. I for one will not be turning in any spectral partchments, no thanks.</div></div><hr />

People are &quot;crying&quot; because those spectral parchments are very rare and all casters are competing over them.  Guilds often hand them out based on raid participation &amp; how deserving a player is.<br />
<br />
Now pretend you play with a bunch of people you really like, you all need a spell in the 62-63 level range, the guild hands you a parchment because you've passed over all of them and you get a spell you will probably never cast.   Meanwhile your friends are still sitting there hoping to get their chance to turn in a parchment and get a spell that benefits them, your guild or both.<br />
<br />
The &quot;13 most useless&quot; thread is someone with their head up their ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mostly what Taladaen said.<br />
<br />
Except it is for 63-64 level spells we have a problem.  The scrolls are extremely rare in the first tier and moderately rare in 3rd tier.  The fact that the reward can be something that will rarely be used, if at all, is why people are &quot;crying&quot;.  I have had to camp a lot of junk just to get my 61 and 62 level spells, not to mention all the extra copies of spells that I had already gotten.  <br />
<br />
Add the rarity of spectral parchments to the fact that you get multiple copies of spells (including the ones you will not use) and you may see that this is rather needlessly wasteful.  If you go a step further and compare how many useless spells other classes get you might see it better, but I would rather not go there, thats a whole can of worms that I will not be opening.<br />
<br />
This is worse that looting a rusty dagger.  When you loot a rusty dagger you at least have a rusty dagger.  When you turn in a spectral parchment and get something *useless* you have less than a rusty dagger.</div></div><hr />

As been stated above ... SOE/VI Remove Str and Dex Spells Please (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8973) is about removing the spells out of the Shaman PoP spell list which requires parchments.    <br />
<br />
Yes ... Shaman capable of gaining these parchments could pass on looting them ... but are choosing to take a different path ... IE asking EQ dev's to remove those spells out of the list.    For months, our community has been trying to engage the EQ dev group for improvements on Planes of Power spells ... but to no avail.    So it's nothing to do with complaining ... and everything to do with trying to get someone within Everquest development group to wake up and listen to the people that play the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
Other posts concerning non - PoP spells are a aside.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The spell lines need some serious changes plain and simple.  Chances are that several different people, who never looked much at one another's work, were responsible for coming up with the impractical and conflicting spells that make up our current spell lists.  We get multiple spells that do variations of the same thing and don't stack.  It is like having three different kinds of vanilla or ten pooperscoopers.....nice to have I guess, but what is the point?<br />
<br />
You dont give shamans a Focus upgrade at 62 and THEN slap on 4 more versions of Strength and Dex that don't stack with anything at 63/64.  If they were to put the Gindain and Daiku line anywhere that made sense, it would have been restricted to level 61.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nevertheless ... STR/DEX spell's post PoP are almost totally worthless (pun intended).   The point of this post in part appeared to link the issue's about STR/DEX and complaining.    <br />
<br />
The thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8973)  isn't a complaint ... but one of the strongest outpouring of the Shaman community on a single issue in months if not years on this board.    <br />
<br />
One can try to detract from the issue ... or switch topic's ... or go back to &quot;tired ole line's&quot;, etc.    But the issue remains that 8 pages of Shaman poster's asked the Dev's to remove 63/64 single and group strength/dexterity spells from the parchment turn-in list ... and NOT as a complaint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Twobrew, why don't you roll against your friends or guildmates for rare (and I don't care what Chukzombi says, I spent a ton of time in HOH last week and saw ONE spectral drop) spectrals and then after WINNING a spectral over your friends, go turn it in for a spell you will never mem.  <br />
<br />
After you experience that, why don't you come back and tell me how you feel about single target/group str/dex spells.</div></div><hr />

I keep erasing what I've written because it doesn't matter. All I'm saying is that we can't expect to roll for a RARE parchment, and then turn it in for the best spells ever every time. You get the rusty dagger A LOT in this game. <br />
<br />
If you honestly feel that you're not going to get a good spell, keep pushing onward then, but in the meantime, don't roll against your friends or guildmates for rare spectrals. Don't go for the win because you already know that there's a greater chance of getting the rusty dagger right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you honestly feel that you're not going to get a good spell, keep pushing onward then, but in the meantime, don't roll against your friends or guildmates for rare spectral<br />
<br />
So, in order to avoid getting crap spells, I should give up chances of getting some great 63-64 spells like group replenishment or malosinia or breath of ultor?  There are EIGHT 63-64 spells which are both wanted and needed.  <br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be easier to simply remove the useless, never-to-be-memmed spells?  Did you READ the responses in the sticky thread about the 63-64 str/dex spells?  Didn't you notice the nearly 100% agreement?  <br />
<br />
I hate to pull the level card, but at level 44 you have barely had any experience with spells that aren't simply purchased.   You have never suffered for a spell, so I find your &quot;rusty dagger&quot; analogy ignorant and insulting.  I also dislike the title of your thread, &quot;why are we crying.&quot;  There's no &quot;we&quot; about it, why don't you let those of us who are directly affected by the 63-64 str/dex spells continue the petition, you don't need to be a part of it since you don't agree with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I understand your concept ... Twobrew ... but it's like at lvl 49 when Shaman's get HoS ... and a single STR and DEX thrown in  at the same level that don't stack.    You find yourself rarely memming those single STR nor DEX.     Then if those single STR/DEX spell's dropped via a random method (like parchments do) ... and could be used by any other caster  ... you would be thinking twice about loot rights.  Even worse admitting to receving same single STR 3 times in a row.<br />
<br />
You get the rusty dagger A LOT in this game. <br />
<br />
It's just the number these rusty dagger's (2 single str/dex's and 2 grp str/dex's) that really rub people raw.    And what's worse that 3 of them are lvl 64 spells.    This means that over half a Shaman's PoP lvl 64 spells are totally worthless ... discounting lvl 64 Imbue War (skill spell).   Add in the crazy randomizer ( can anyone say rigged) spell award code for the turn-in's ... it's very painful situtation for a Shaman to think about looting a parchment.    <br />
<br />
IMHO ... a post by all these Shaman's asking for the Dev team to REMOVE spell's from the pop list ... is pretty classy.    We could have started a whinfest, rant filled, petition asking for the moon and green cheese ... but instead we just would rather get some use from the few parchments come our way.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the rest of the spells as helpful to my guild as these were, so I won't be competing against guildies for specs for quite a while.  For helping the guild get ahead, the 61-62 spell lines seemed powerful, the 63-64 weak and the 65 spells GODLIKE (except for BoS which should've been in the 64 set of spells).  <br />
<br />
And BTW, even though every melee in the guild has a primal or two, I'm very excited about the new Avatar.  140 beats 100 any day and sometimes the primals take awhile to proc (watch the melees /dueling each other before they engage the mob).

And that's a HUGE flaw with EQ.  Why should you ever expect crap for loot or no loot?  This is a game.  It doesn't have to be Monty Haul, but why shouldn't you get SOMETHING for your trouble?  Unfortunately, SOE decided that a couple plat and a rusty dagger was too good and decided not to populate the loot tables for a lot of mobs post Kunark.<br />

go do the can2 quest right now . log on to EQ and DO it . with no help from uber 60+ friends , alone , as SoE intended it.<br />

After you taste that , think about turning in those items and getting tiny companion at level 44 when you have shrink already ..<br />

then you will have a feeling , a taste of what we are talking about for our multiple spells we need from these specs<br />

<br />
I'm only 44 and I'm not agreeing with the &quot;down with STR/DEX&quot; post. How many people are agreeing that is doesn't affect? A LOT. There are SO many people on there 24-61 that is has no bearing on. <br />
<br />
I'm a jackass? At least I'm sticking to what I think is right and not talking about quitting Land...(Eq Dying?)<br />
<br />
If I do the canni 2 quest, I would expect canni 2...However, if I do the turn in quest in FV with the 4 spells, it's random...if I got 20 in a row of the same spell, do I complain to SOE? Nope, I complain here about the rusty dagger, but I don't request that SOE change the game for me...<br />
<br />
People that are under the level for these STR/DEX spells agree with you and you don't ask &quot;why do you care, you're not of that level anyway?&quot;...Fine.<br />
<br />
People on THIS post saying &quot;Parchments aren't rare&quot; and &quot;I don't see the rest of the spells as helpful to my guild as these were, so I won't be competing against guildies for specs for quite a while&quot;, agreeing with what I'm saying, you don't discount them? Fine.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is that this IS a game. If I'm getting bashed at 44 for saying &quot;we&quot; shouldn't complain, then no one under the 62-63 level should be saying anything either...They haven't &quot;been there&quot; yet either...yet because they agree with you, it's ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Twobrew, you obviously have absolutely no concept of what is going on. You are too low of a level for this to be an issue that you have dealt with so you cannot really comprehend whats going on from a first hand account. This isn't like spells in Kunark where you kill the mob and get a spell that perhaps you may have or might not use, but you can trade it in for something else (if it is a trade in spell) or trade to someone else that still needs it. With the spells being discussed, the pop str and dex spells, nobody will use them. You cannot turn them in to a mob for a trade in for a chance at another spell. <br />
<br />
Here is the problem. We get Focus of Soul at level 62 from parchment turn ins. This spell does NOT stack with strength and dexterity spells at all, but has a str and dex component along with hitpoints on it. This makes strength and dexterity spells not useful once you have this spell. Then, after all need for strength and dexterity spells has been removed by this spell, they add in at levels 63 and up strength and dexterity spells. These spells are not being complained about because they are not considered good spells. They aren't getting complained about because they aren't as nice of spells as we would like. They are being complained about because they are 100% useless to the shaman class at the time that we get them.....100% useless. They will never be cast, and in most cases probably not even scribed into spellbooks. Depending on how your group/guild etc does parchment drops, you then have to spend a bunch of time working hard towards the hope of getting parchment drops in the first place. Then, if you are lucky enough to get some parchments, you go to the shaman turn in mob and turn them in for spells. Then, here it is 8 hours later or whatever, and you just got 3 or 4 spells that will never be used by you, and no other shaman needs them either because it is inferior and does not stack with our spell from the level before. I mean you might as well be getting back druid spells from our turn in mob much of the time. That is how useless they are to us. <br />
<br />
Now, if you were saying that we were complaining about wanting different spells to replace those or whatever, I could maybe see somewhat on your side. Shaman have a pretty nice compliment of spells already and asking them to replace the str and dex spells is maybe asking a bit too much. But that isn't what is going on. We are asking that they just REMOVE those spells from the lineup or put those particular ones as vendor sold only. <br />
<br />
Maybe once you move up in the world and actually have to go through this then you will have some grasp of the concept of what is going on. Until you do, however, please refrain from commenting on balance issues that you don't understand.</div></div><hr />

For the amount of trouble to get into the Plane of Torment (flagged), it is way too lacking.  Bastion of Thunder (flagged) blows, because there are half-a-dozen other guilds on my server that compete to kill the mini-bosses there (at least I've seen a rune drop, but lost roll).   I'm not flagged for HoH, but it sure seems the zone progression chart for spectrals, is complete ass.    I've only managed 3 spectrals and results are: 2 Aim of the Gindan and 1 Petrifying Earth.</div></div><hr />

So, not counting the ones without a magelo or a level in their profile, we're looking at 40% of the posts being &quot;an issue&quot; for the correct level...out of 310 posts, that'd be 124 people that it would affect...I didn't go through all the pages to see if there were reposters, just on the front page. Again, all I'm saying is that we have to take the rusty dagger. Not every drop or turn in will be beneficial to us...How many Talisman of Shadoo's did you get? I remember reading that someone once got 8? Rusty dagger...<br />
Eventually, that person got the spell that they wanted....but they sold the ones they got to vendors...because it was worthless.<br />

You have your right to post what you want ... which opens you up for any rebuttal on it's merits.   Over the course of your posts on this thread you have shown that you really don't care about the issues other than telling people to suck it up.   <br />
<br />
Quite frankly ... I'm with Gloriana on this one ... you don't have any clue of the issues because you are only lvl 44.   Level almost 20 more levels ... get into PoP completing for lvl 63 and 64 spells ... and you may have something to say from experience on the issue.    <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The majority of the playerbase is 60+.  Even the most casual of gamers are reaching 60+ easily now.  This is a fact, we know it.  There are more and more 60+ people every day.  <br />
<br />
Back in the day (tm) EQ, nearly everyone had all of their spells.  Each caster was equipped with the same spells as everyone else.  (Few exceptions with Ice comet etc)  Kunark was released, and VI/SOE decided to make spells difficult to get (see rare drops from dragons etc).  Most people got over this and got their spells.  With Velious and SoL it was quite easy to obtain the useful spells for most classes (sorry wizards).  With PoP getting spells is once again hard to do.  It will be months, probably at least a year (if ever) before my guild reaches tier4 planes.  This makes getting runed glyphs nearly impossible.  Spectrals, while they do drop from yard trash (in tier 3 planes), come at the rate of approximately one per 2 hours everywhere I have seen.  Most groups have 4 or more casters (including hybrids) all after spectral spells, which is stupid.  <br />
<br />
To compile this problem, 4 of the shamans spells from spectrals are absolutely worthless.  They will NEVER be cast, even the occasional cleric wanting str or dex would live without the 10ish increase from the pop buffs.  <br />
<br />
This is the problem with spectral turn ins that everyone wants corrected.  Glad you understand now.<br />
<br />
Thanks kindly,<br />

Eventually, that person got the spell that they wanted....but they sold the ones they got to vendors...because it was worthless. <br />
<br />
1) Yes, I'm level 62. Of course, I've now had the chance to roll for 3 spectral parchments.  Lost 3 rolls, but at least I've had the opportunity to experience what it would feel like to random against friends who desperately need their own valuable spectrals.  So, it's currently my issue.<br />
<br />
2)  If you got 8 copies of Talisman of Shadoo there was the potential to sell the excess to other shaman, not so with the 63/64 str/dex spells. <br />
<br />
3) Notice that Chukzombi doesn't necessarily agree that the str/dex spells should be removed.  Has anyone flamed him or said his opinion was worthless? Nope, because although I don't agree with him, I respect his experience and his opinion.<br />

_____________________________________<br />
<br />
Before you stand up for the shaman class against the cruel depredators you seem to envision sprouting all over the board, perhaps you should ask yourself who you are standing up for?<br />
<br />
As much silly jockeying around as you indulge yourself in regarding who is or isn't qualified to comment based on their levels to the contrary, it's more than fair to an open mind to see that you do not have the numbers on your side on this one.  The enormous majority of shamans do NOT agree with you.<br />
<br />
Well, then, are numbers alone everything?  Clearly, you think they aren't.  Is the experience of the people who comprise those numbers meaningless or simply not relevant compared to your own?  It looks like you think it is.<br />
<br />
How about on the basis of clearly conveyed, logical argument alone -- the way most propositions should be advanced and most issues decided, at least in a better world than this is?<br />
<br />
There, I think you fall short.  <br />
<br />
Your analogy about turn-in spells for Kunark things like spirit of scale or cripple or shadoo or whatever is a very, very poor analogy.  Those spells are dirt common, and can even be purchased in the bazaar in quantity for often 20pp each.  They're common enough that most people just sell them to vendors or destroy them when looting them.  Easy to get, worth little, and of little value, they just don't compare in much of any way at all to POP spells of any level.<br />
<br />
As has been stated clearly, though you seem to completely discount it, without any real explanation, PoP spells are much rarer, especially the higher level ones.  Nobody destroys them, and they are also vastly more expensive to buy in the bazaar, if you can find them at all.  True Spirit, for one, goes for 20k, NOT 20pp, on my server.  Even the lousy ones go for a couple or a few K plat, though common sense will tell you that a huge supply of worthless spells will make those worthless spells eventually pretty cheap.  The good ones will remain highly priced -- probably all the more so as virtually everyone in the game catches up to 60 and goes beyond it.  (There are not that many true newbies anymore.)<br />
<br />
This is very high stakes gambling; winning the gamble is hitting a jackpot, and losing it is losing big.  <br />
<br />
Consider also the size of the loot table -- there are many more spells per level than the paltry four Kunark turn-in spells.  Your chances of getting what you want on the Kunark trade-ins is fairly decent after a few handfuls of trade-ins; if not, you can just go buy the spells for 20pp in the bazaar.  For PoP spells, you have many, many chances to get spells you don't want, as there are far more than four POP spells.  If you don't -- you don't just lose the 20pp you paid for the chance; you lose a chance at a spell that may be selling for 5k, 10, 20k, or more, depending on the spell -- IF (!!) it is sold at all.  (Quiescense, anyone?)<br />
<br />
It's just not comparable at all.  For anyone of reasonable intelligence, that much should be clear.  I'm surprised you ventured such a poor analogy in the first place; it helped provide your arguments an incredibly weak foundation.  Your analogy showed how very little thought you put into the matter.  Additionally, your trying to &quot;instructively&quot; advise shamans to just go suck it up and quit &quot;crying&quot; shows a complete lack of empathy being piled on top of the lack of understanding your inept analogy reveals, and even adds insult to injury, in a way -- rubbing salt in a wound.  And almost seeming to gloat about it.  <br />
<br />
Given your display of so little understanding of or empathy toward your fellow shamans and the situations they are faced with -- situations which you have not even experienced yourself, can you honestly be surprised that some of them have called you to task for it?<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'd compare your take on things to people who have changed classes, but still identify with their original class, poo-pooing any problems or difficulties in the new class you just joined, perhaps just joined precisely because of an unrealistic idea of the all-around wonderfulness and freedom from grief of a new class.<br />
<br />
In the past, I've seen this kind of situation crop up on more boards than this one, and I've seen some of our shamans here laugh off the problems other classes like druids and monks have because of an inability to understand and identify with people outside of their primary or original class.  Heck, I've even seen shamans indulge themselves quite a bit in gloating over the troubles of less lucky shamans.<br />
<br />
At any rate, you don't seem to grasp what makes the probably 99% of other shamans disagree with you, either via empathy or intellect(and the arguments are really not that complicated).  Therefore, I have to wonder again -- who exactly DO you identify with?  Because you don't seem to identify with either the problems you are purporting to address or the people whose posts gave you something to argue about in the first place -- OR the people who disagree with you -- that being most everyone.<br />
<br />
Exactly what world is it you're living in?<br />
<br />
Yes, you have a right to post your ideas.  No, you have no right to expect them not to be criticized.<br />
<br />
And, yes, a little humility wouldn't hurt you too much.  If your ideas really stood up well, and disagreeing with them or agreeing with them was a close call, then your being level 44 when dropping your pearls of wisdom before we shaman swine wouldn't matter much -- if you've got a point, you've got a point, even if arguable.  But if you give us so little to go on in order to rally behind your idea, perhaps you really SHOULD consider the source -- yourself -- to see if your otherwise very impeachable ideas can be given any additional stature by the persuasive experience of the person behind them.  You have no such experience.  Contrarily, virtually all of the people arguing against you DO have such experience.  And they also DO tend to disagree with you.<br />
<br />
That should suggest that you might need to step back and refocus -- but not just to take a deep breath and blindly plunge back into the fray again.  Not to go for a &quot;win.&quot;  But to take a clearer look at things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Callir, I don't know who posted that originally, but it seems to me you completely misread it.<br />
<br />
The person was probably talking about how it feels to go through getting useless spells in POP.  That has nothing to do with anything intellectual, though you did pigeonhole it that way; the comment retains its merit.<br />
<br />
Simply on a common sense, mechanical level, though, comparing PoP turn-ins to Kunark ones shows a lack of understanding of the scope of the problem and the odds, as well as simply of empathy.  Neither of those are have to do with intellect.<br />
<br />
So it seems that the comment is legitimate either way.  Maybe experience IS necessary for some (most?) people to grab things either empathetically or get a common-sense understanding of what is really going on.  No matter how bright or dumb they are, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I wasn't expecting my idea to not be criticized...I expected that.<br />
<br />
The initial responses I got were &quot;But everyone else is saying it's bad&quot;...and &quot;you're too little anyway&quot;. Now others have actually given OTHER  reasons why...not just &quot;you talk out of your anus&quot; and &quot;jackass&quot;. That was some SOUND criticism!<br />
<br />
Callir is one of the few who has finally commented on the fact that there are others that are UNDER 63 that are supporting it. So, if you're under 63, just like I'm 44, we're too little...so there's no need to comment on it! I'm too little...so anyone 62 and under can't possibly understand either, yet their comments for &quot;Yes, please remove them!&quot; when it doesn't affect them is making a HUGE complaint, when it's really not that many people that it affects in the first place. <br />
<br />
Again...all I was saying is that we're complaining a lot about one part of the game. A part of the game that doesn't even affect MOST of us. 60+? Nope,  but definitely 63+. Maybe I was wrong for bringing it up that I don't think we should be complaining about it. I guess maybe the other 60% that were also &quot;under age&quot; shouldn't be agreeing with it either then. Perhaps it does affect the 63+ crowd...so why are (on the first page) 60% of the others complaining? They have nothing to complaing about! They can't have ANY possible idea what it TRULY means...just like me.<br />
<br />
Maybe SOE will look at this as I am. They'll look at that post and say &quot;What the F are 60% of the group even commenting on this? They're not even of a big enough level to have that spell become an option for them to mem or not!&quot;...<br />
<br />
My post was that &quot;WE&quot; are cyring about this as if it's a MAJOR part that's affecting ALL of us, when we've now been clearly shown that it doesn't affect me at all. And it won't affect anyone 62 and under. So...if the 62 and under crowd would have left that post alone, maybe I could see more validity. People that have a valid concern for things that ACTUALLY concern them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It appears that you do not.  <br />
<br />
The comment that you are too low level to understand does not mean that you must be level 63+ to understand.  It is just people struggling to come up with an explanation for your failure to understand.<br />
<br />
Perhaps as you begin your struggles to obtain the rare spells of our class you will begin to understand where this frustration comes from.  In former expansions we have the most valuable spells in game, in the form of ones like Malo, Torpor, Pox.  With POP we have spells that are not only rare, but randomly worthless.  It's like getting Malo to drop, scribing it and having it appear in your spellbook as Burst of Flame.  Spectrals are still rare enough for many people that the spells will remain very high in value for a while.  On my server at least, they dont drop with any frequency in the only 3rd teir zone I am in, BOT.<br />

Meself isnt playing very often due to the nature of my RL living (Postman, 6 day work week from 4am til open end, plus a wife to take care of and be a good husband).<br />
<br />
I play a Shaman since August 12th 2000, and ever since that day i loved the Shaman Class.<br />
<br />
I only have Kunark and Velious installed due to my crappy hardware, and thus, i am unable to get the &quot;Shadows of Luclin&quot; nor &quot;Planes of Power&quot; expansions enabled. And no cash to upgrade the hardware either....<br />
<br />
With all that said, id just want to say that Twobrew Happyhour - as &quot;young&quot; as he might be at the moment and as much he &quot;has no concept&quot; about participating in PoP Raids or about the Rarity of those Spectral Parchments - is indeed a honorable person and friend of mine. And i am pretty disgusted about most of the comments i have read here, especially from Landragoran (your behaviour didnt change much as i first read a post over at Everlore, ye still that same ignorant and haughty disgraceful shame and still without manners) and that Uman guy.<br />
<br />
And to myself, i can say that i am quite happy that i dont need nor cant participate in PoP and even Luclin. For i like not to ruin my charakter like it happens to most &quot;High Levelers&quot; in large Guilds who raid often.<br />
<br />
But who i am to post my 2 cp here anyway ? A stupid newbee who doesnt know one bit.....so excuse me please, i will go back to my little Server and play my only Char....like i do for 2 1/2 years now....<br />

Oh and TwoBrew, three things:<br />
<br />
(1) Take me out of the &quot;we&quot;. I am perfectly capable of speaking for myself (call it crying if you feel like, doesn't matter to me).<br />
(2) Last time I casted a STR/DEX buff was nearly two years ago, thanks to Focus of Spirit line.<br />
(3) Do you think it's normal for a level 65 shaman wanting 1 or maybe 2 spells out of the 63-64 line? No? Well that's my case. I am only looking forward to Talisman of the Boar. Maybe Breath of Ultor. Same can be said about 61-62 spells, wich are again, polluted with useless stat buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Twobrew, if it doesn't affect you, then just move on to the next post. When you post something with the title of &quot;Why are we crying?&quot;, that is being antagonistic and invites harsh commentary and criticism. <br />
<br />
Also, Is it really &quot;crying&quot; to ask that those useless buff spells be removed? I think most people have learned by now that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, if you never ask it won't be looked at, much less granted. Druids got snare removed from their epic, got a single target version of POTG for example. Was this randomly granted because they were putting every class under a microscope and realized Druids had some issues that should be addressed? No, it was because they were issues put forth by the Druid community and they were addressed. And so it is here.<br />
<br />
In the past I myself haven't bothered replying much to percieved issues that many that play Shamans had. Mostly because it didn't seem to affect me or because I figured those that wrote the game must know best. Well guess what, they don't. I have seen many many times where they have reversed decisions or admitted they made a mistake.<br />
 <br />
I guess what really opened my eyes was the Druid/Shaman healing spells at 58. People here complained that the Shaman one was 1000 points less that and the Druid one but same cast time and same mana. They were pooh poohed that it was on Test and to calm down, they were just testing the relative power of the two versions. So people kinda quieted down. Well guess what, it went live exactly as it was on test. And now we get stuck with an inferior spell, 1000 less hps healed for the same mana and same cast time. Not to get off on a tangent here but that made me realize that if you don't speak up, they are just going to assume everything is fine. And while an issue may not affect you now, it can and will in the future. And to remain civil I will stop here and maybe you can reconsider what you have said. Or not. It's your choice.</div></div><hr />

The difference between you and most of us others under 63, however, is that we don't try to pretend that we know how it feels. I know that I haven't any idea how it would feel to deprive a guildmate of a spell for something I'd never use. But I base my opinion that they should be removed on 1) Logic (which I've failed to see you use) and 2) The opinions of people I respect (Gloriana, Chuk, and everyone else in that thread).<br />

Uh thats an erroneous statement, i spent all week there  made about 20 aa and my little 6 man group averaged 1 rune every 2 hours.  Yes it was nerfed, it used to drop a rune every 40 minutes. A effing blue SOLOABLE by me wizards or necros mob should NOT be dropping runes at all.<br />

<br />
What was my reward for that session?  I didnt feel happy, I didn't feel like I'd achived a step forward, I felt gutted, and most importantly I felt like I had screwed my friends out of a potentially useful spell.<br />
<br />
Remember this wouldn't be an issue if spells dropped as spells rather than as all/all parchments/runes.

<br />
If the useless spells were removed, we would no longer be screwing over our friends since our own spectrals would be just as valuable as theirs.   Your rusty dagger analogy is flawed and naive.  You make it sound like a group is fighting a mob and that mob has a chance to drop a rusty dagger for everyone.  What actually happens is the mob dies and it has a chance to drop a good thing for many classes, but a 50% chance of dropping a rusty dagger for shaman.  Shaman who win the roll and loot the rusty dagger wasted a chance for another class to get a good spell.  <br />
<br />
In addition, if shaman had 4 fewer spectrals, we would be done with spectrals faster and have more opportunties to bow out of randoms in favor of other guildies.  I'm done with my 61-62 spells and it feels good to say, &quot;Count me out, done with ethereals&quot; to my groupmates.<br />

<br />
Do you think all the level 65s posting have all of their spectrals?  Unless they're in a top tier guild like Chukzombi and have had access to tier 3 zones for awhile, the answer is NO.  How about all the level 65 shaman who only have access to PoV/PoS, do you have ANY idea how rare spectral drops are in those zones?  Oh wait, you don't.<br />
<br />
Here's a clue.  My own guild is pretty decent, not as strong as Chukzombi's guild (we are on the same server) but we have a lot of folks flagged for PoV/POS, HoH and CoD.  We have a few people flagged for BoT and no one flagged for Plane of tactics.  There are 3 level 65 shaman in my guild, none of them have any more than 2 63-64 spells.  My guild *is* flagged for the appropriate zones! We have a GREAT chance of getting spectrals before 80% of the rest of the server. <br />
<br />
That doesn't mean I don't see how the problem I face with rare spectrals would be even worse for those 65 shaman who don't have access to the same zones I hunt in with more frequent spectral drops.</div></div><hr />

I tried being polite before, but are you ever going to cut the crap on that horsesh** line of blather?<br />
<br />
90% of your responses on this thread have come down to that idiocy, and it's not even a legitimate response, which pretty much shows you don't have one or are simply too egotistical or scared to admit you've been caught out on being wrong about an issue.<br />
<br />
Don't argue about the subject -- argue about the argument!  That's what you do not when you want to get to the bottom of any subject and work out an understanding, but when you want to win an argument or at least confuse people and seem to not lose one.  It's a petty little &quot;trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your emphasis now is entirely on your own ego, and your posts are about whether your ego is or is not validated.  As such, they are boring and useless, and I don't know why you want us to get involved in your personal issues anyway.  It's not as much fun for us as it seems to be for you, and it doesn't seem to be working out that well for you anyway.<br />
<br />
Forget this particular issue; I think you've lost all credibility, period.  You need to get your head together.<br />
<br />
To quote you again, &quot;unless I'm agreeing, I'm wrong. &quot;<br />
<br />
No, your argument is wrong ON ITS MERITS.  Which you steadfastly refuse to address.  Instead virtually everything we get from you is this tedious level-based &quot;who can argue&quot; bullsh**.  Cute, very.  Any idea how thin you've worn it by now?  I think maybe you do have an idea, and are just posting that crap to aggravate people; in short, you've turned completely into a troll.<br />
<br />
How about we just flip it around?  Unless we agree with YOU, then 99% of everyone else is wrong.  <br />
<br />
That's a neat trick!  How the hell did you get so much power?<br />
<br />
Clearly, not on the basis of your argument, which you have VERY wisely stayed far away from addressing, as it falls apart pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
So then to you it's all about who gets to be right or wrong based on personality or your good looks?<br />
<br />
It's all nonsense, and your posts have become entirely worthless by now, simple trolls -- a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, to borrow a phrase.<br />
<br />
Cut the crap -- do us a favor and wash it all out of your system and don't subject us to it anymore -- and just stick to the issues, if your ego will let you even come close.  On the issues, your argument is so poor even you don't bother defending it; you're only extending your troll because you have personal problems or something.<br />

I agree with that sebazy, i have issue with the ease of obtaning Runes in Tactics. An asskicker that we fought today in PoEarth shoulkdnt be dropping 1 spectral. it should be dropping several runes. a soloable blue in tactics pit should drop a spec and a challenge for 1 balanced group should drop a rune. <br />
- Maybe I am incompetent or crazy but I fail to see how a shaman can solo named in arena. There are tons of mobs there, I seriously doubt you can solo pull the named, sometimes they spawn in the middle, side of arena, other side, whatnot. The mob itself is soloable, sure BUT the environment doesn't allow that. Arena is a one group gig. I would pay to see people trying to solo there, maybe an enchanter can. Big maybe. If you get lucky and the mob spawns at a point where there aren't any others and you can pull it to a corner without aggroing others then maybe you can solo it. This is not your named that you walk up to it and kill it. Plus they roam too.<br />
<br />
As for drop rates, 7 hours counting, no runed (plenty of named dead) one single spectral. Yesterday guildmates had same story. It's been nerfed but to an acceptable level. I am perfectly aware that first few days it was El-Dorado spell wise, with spectrals dropping every 5-6 kills and every named dropped about one out of 4 times a runed. That was overkill, the current state is not.<br />
<br />
Oh and instead of trying to get this nerfed, how about lobby to have VI increase the goddamn drops in your Plane of Earth or any other tier 3 zone instead of getting drops nerfed for many people.<br />

<br />
I'm told I'm too young.<br />
<br />
Most of the people complaining are too young, but they're agreeing, so they're correct.<br />
<br />
If the issue is that I don't know what I'm talking about because I'm too young, fine...This whole issue doesn't affect all that many shaman, but 300+ plus posts says it is. The truth is that this doesn't affect MOST of the people that posted. I'm saying WHY COMPLAIN IF IT DOESN&quot;T AFFECT YOU?<br />
<br />
The basis of my arguement is that we shouldn't complain at all. It's a part of the game. I've been told that I shouldn't disagree because I'm too young. The responses toward that have been VERY double standard...It's ok for them to agree, even if they're too young...but when someone too young disagrees, they're wrong.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is don't join in on the STR DEX complaint when it doesn't even matter to you! That way, it MAY get recognized as a valid complaint and not looked at by SOE as a bunch of toooooo low levels complaining about something that doesn't affect them.<br />
<br />
My arguement is not wrong on it's merit...I have a valid issue...that we should NOT complain...ESPECIALLY if it doesn't apply to you!<br />
<br />
Most of the people that were agreeing were in the 50-62 Range. My initial post said that we should bring a valid issue that would affect a lot more people...let's shoot for MORE drops of Torpor/Malo/BoN etc...<br />

Even further, you're a hypocrite. You say that those of us 50-62 shouldn't complain because it doesn't effect us, yet you (being level 44) advocate complaining about Torpor/BoN drops. And you bitch about double standards? Pull your head out.</div></div><hr />

People talk about Torpor drops before and damage mitigation issues...I've NEVER &quot;rooted for us&quot; because I'm not of an appropriate level...I said rally the troops for something that would affect more people...I never said I would agree with you, or sign a petition...Bring something worthwhile to the table to talk to SOE about...not a spell problem that affects 3 levels of play..63, 64 and 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, let me get your reasoning straight.  It's okay to advocate increased spell drops for torpor/malo which only affect levels 60, 61, 62, 63and 64 but it's wrong to petition to remove completely useless str/dex spells because they only affect 63 64 and 65 characters?  <br />

If you plan on killing 2-3 mobs out of the 20+ that spawn in arena in hopes of getting a named to spawn in that spot AND that the named drops a runed then you are entitled to solo that, the reward is fine because you are going to spend insane hours there. Drop rates are no longer what they were and IMHO it's fine, if you want to spend weeks of soloing, because gating out at every trouble is not really an efficient way of soloing, just to see a rune drop, more power to you.<br />
<br />
But since you are hell bent on nerfing, how about getting Myral nerfed too in Grieg's. A 3-4 people mob that spawns near zoneout and often drops a low end VT quality or very high end Ssra quality cleric wand.<br />

 Your rusty dagger analogy is very much flawed, in the fact that no other class is going to end up with a spell that doesnt at least have some situational use. Also, Spectrals, at least from my estamation, and from looking at spells gained by other classes arent intended to be rusty daggers. Even if Focus if Soul had no strength and dex components, our 63 and 64 spells would still be largely junk with those 4 sitting there, being str and dex have never really made tha great of an impact on anything anyways.<br />

Hmmm ... I would not draw the line at 63 but somewhere in the 49's to 60 level.   You try to draw the line based on the ability to mem the spell ... which shows you aren't listening to what many have been trying to tell you.   The STR/DEX petition is about:<br />
<br />
1.  Spells on the PoP Shaman spell list that are almost worthless in usage.    (IE single str, dex, grp str/dex which DO NOT stack on any Focus line much less HoS)<br />
2.  Require parchments which are<br />
     A. worth a great deal <br />
     B. Usable by every Caster of correct lvl and PoP enabled.  <br />
3.  Which in many cases becoming 2x, 3x, 4x of the same spell instead of passing to other classes which could use them.<br />
4.  Finally ... asking to remove (or update) those 4 spells.<br />
<br />
Your post is trying to tell people to stop complaining and suck it up.    I'm calling on this because you are trying to turn this thread into your personnel ego stroking while pigeonholing anyone in agreement on the subject into &quot;DrOOdwhiner&quot;.<br />
<br />
That petition wasn't complaining ... IT was asking for action.    That is not a complaint.    It wasn't a bitch, or whine, or troll ... but a thread explaining the single stat buffs for STR and DEX along with Group buffs for same ... when they don't stack on focus ... are worthless by their agreement in posting.   <br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with a lvl 44 Shaman offering a opinion ... or even a lvl 1 Shaman.    I do have a problem with a lvl 44 Shaman talking about something at length esp after being called on it ... without any relative first hand experience.    Other than pointing out that only 63 - 65 Shaman's can mem lvl 63 - 65 spells ... every other point you have made is totally based on second hand knowledge.    You could be much smarter with more  first hand knowledge.    Maybe some time in Dreadlands leveling to at least 49 so you can cast HoS and then try to stack STR/DEX on it.<br />

Quit complaining about complaining.<br />
<br />
I think it well worth pointing out the lack of usefulness of those spells BECAUSE of the way they were originally conceived.  In the early stages, the PoP focus was ONLY hitpoints without the str/dex components of the level 60 Focus of Spirit.  With the thought of having to do three times the amount of buffing to buff melees with the hitpoints + dex + str inherent in the level 60 buff, we politely asked for a change and the developers listened and made that change.<br />
<br />
This was very close to the launch of PoP and I am well aware the developers were fine tuning 14 classes and I believe the inclusion of level 63/63 str/dex spells was an oversight owing to the original plan of Focus of Soul not having a str/dex component.  The developers added str/dex to Focus of Souls without removing the now useless str/dex spells.<br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong with a reasonable and polite request for the developers to consider the fact that since Focus of Soul now consists of hitpoints + str + dex thereby rendering the 63/64 str/dex spells worthless, they might be removed.<br />
<br />
There, I have argued my case.  I have yet to see you argue ANYTHING logically.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Chuk wants a hard game.  He's all for time sinks and time spent in game and ubers-need-to-be-the-best kind of thinking.  He doesn't want to &quot;win&quot; EQ.  That's fine, neither do I.  I don't want to see uber loot dropping off orc pawns either, nor do I wish to see cheating or hacking or anything made too easy.  <br />
<br />
Spells seem pretty important to me tho, and I have a different view of their importance to casters.  Making them uber rare loot obtainable only from large guild raids . . . well honestly that seems silly to me.  <br />
<br />
To stress my point, look again at Furor's pic.  Ok, what class is Furor?  A warrior?  And runes being no drop, he will be the one and only person who decides which classes the runes will be turned in for spells.  According to whatever raid loot system FoH has currently.  So, is it right and fair that an entire guild should decide whether to turn in for shaman spells or for &quot;more useful&quot; enchanter/cleric spells?  You have to admit, group Virtue or C5 is worth more than a group focus . . right?  <br />
Anyway, this is where Chuk's kind of thinking has taken us.  Shamans are in the minority folks.  We don't control anything.  If we leave it up to the rest of the classes to decide our fate, we'll be left with those rusty daggers Twobrew seems so fond of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somewhere between TwoBrew's 3rd or 4th proclaimation that 44 is too low to understand and comment on this problem something occured to me. I pay Social Security. I don't get a damn dime of that money back until I'm old and haggard, but I understand it. I understand that it's important. I can vote, comment, and petition all I want about social security. If there's a problem with social security (ie that I may not get it when I'm older cuz it's all run dry) then I'll go to the voting booth and pull the corresponding lever. <br />
<br />
What's important to note here is that I don't have an army of senior citizens limping after me because I voiced some opinions about the issue.<br />
<br />
Wait, this is a horrible analogy. It made so much more sense before I opened my mouth.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm only 41, but I can sympathize with my fellow shaman and perhaps vote toward a goal that will save me from a lot of heart ache when I finally do reach elder shammy status. I say I &quot;sympathize&quot; with them. I do not &quot;empathize&quot; with them because I have no idea the lengths they go to in order to obtain these parchments. I think that a lot of the hostility has gone toward your low level (44) is due to the fact that they can, in no other way, explain where you are coming from. <br />
<br />
The image I'm getting from out 63+ friends is that 4 of these spells are useless ( not a rusty dagger, because I can equip a rusty dagger and kill a moss snake with it.) So what this means is that VI has made this a gambling thing. You turn in the parchment, a guy asks you &quot;Pick a number between 1 and 20.&quot; You say '5', and he says &quot;no sorry, come back in a few days.&quot; <br />

On a personal note, you don't know me personally, either in RL or in game, so kindly silence your suggestions as to my character.  Just because I came the the early conclusion that your friend is a jackass before he completely justified me later in this awful thread, doesn't mean I am an ******* myself.  Well, not all the time anyhow hehe.  Actually in game you'd probably never group or raid with me, since I hardly ever group with another shaman (go go stackability) and you'd never make it into my guild.  I dunno our current requirements . . . something along the lines of 1) pornstar in RL, 2) 65/50AAs, good equipment, a few flags, and a decent reputation.  And I think you have to cyb0r with a few officers or something.  I dunno.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Interesting thread.  To be honest Twobrew you opened up to a serious issue or 10.   Once you hit 49 and get HoS you will never want the Str/dex buffs again and once you hit 60 the last desire for any str/dex/hp buff is gone.   Till then you are just pissing in the wind on issues you are have no damn clue on.   There have been some good rebuttals here on your stance but you are need to get rid of that green horn aspect before going any further. <br />
<br />
If I were you I just acknowledge the differences in opinion and move on.  As you gain more experience in high end game you will  will either a) change in view or b) keep dreaming.   Either way up to you to figure out how the game changes.<br />
<br />
One thing I do want to note is that when Kunark came out there was the same mad dash to 60 with new spells each level 51-60 with many purchasable, some trade in and some dropped.  Prices were high on many of them and to this day still high (higher yet on malo/torpor due to growing 60+ shaman population demand vs less farming of Kunark 60 spell dropping mobs) but on the crap spells at least they dropped to next to nothing over time.  Same will happenwith POP except on the good ones (crap spells will be vendor fodder eventually because...well they are just pure crap)  The only really good thing I liked about VI and they kept it up thru SOL was actually dropping spells instead of this BS parchment turn in.  However they did tinker with spell drops in SOL such that certain mobs would only drop certain spells (wizard/chanter/necro/mage spells in particular) from certain mobs and some spells were considered loot items not spell items so were ultra rare (group speed, Elernicks Electrical Rendering, etc).  To this day still rare to see them.   Not the perfect system but it allowed you to at least see what dropped and what classes got them vs this horribly rigged spell turn in crap (10 copies of wrulan..w*t*f!).  I still think that system was better than this new POP crap.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo Twobrew as an up and coming shaman you will have it easy relatively to 60 for spells barring malo/torpor and possibly easy too on 61-64 spells depending on your rate of progression but I will say this until you are one breaking ground shut your cornhole on speaking about it.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Twobrew is young an inexperienced.

<br />
I have more problems with Chukzombi, whose &quot;The game should only be playable by Ubers&quot; attitude is again shining through.<br />
<br />
Hint Chuk, those mobs that are single group killable and drop Runes are for single groups clawing their way to Tier 3, not for bored Level 65 Ubers that dont know what to do with their time between raids!<br />
<br />
So the solution would be to up the drop rate in Tier 4 planes, so that both Casuals (that will never kill a Tier 4 boss) and your like have a fair shot at runes. Not everybody plays the game in a raid guild, and raid guilds arent a prerequisite for Level 65 and shouldnt be for 65 spells.<br />
<br />
Fewer runes - maybe. But no runes at all is ridiculous. That would mean only raid guilds get Level 65 spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Land, Enkebesh, and many others in the game that you shouldn't have to be in the best guild on the server to get your spells -- or even close.  <br />
<br />
The game has been run and designed for the benefit of those who already have the most and can bust down every door the quickest for most of its duration; sometimes startlingly so.  However, those folks have actually always been the tiny minority of people in the game.  That bespeaks imbalance in game design and a pretty flawed idea of designing customer satisfaction into the product -- how you make people keep buying expansions, playing, and recommending the game to others.  It will be increasingly quite necessary to make the majority, not merely the minority, feel the game offers adequate reward in terms of accomplishment and enjoyment.<br />
<br />
At this point, the game is long enough in the tooth that a great number of people are already 60 or over, sometimes with two or three characters that level.  Eventually, there will be relatively few people who aren't that high.  If all these people must be in the very best guilds to get their spells, many will quit.  And they will certainly tell their friends not to bother with the game.  It's not like there aren't a lot of other entertainment options out there, many directly competitive with the game already.  If all those people have to fight with both the best-equipped, most raid-oriented guilds to get the mobs that drop their spells(and weapons, armor, what have you), the game world will be a very angry and dissatisfied place.  And the developers will not be doing their jobs.<br />
<br />
Eventually, everyone will want to be eating the uber's lunches.  The people in the strongest guilds would rather have everyone else remain as weak as possible, usually -- that mentality often comes naturally with the kind of commitment(perhaps near craziness) required to be in those kinds of guilds.  That was somewhat manageable when 60's, and then 60's with good gear, and then 60's with decent gear and good AA, were still not in overwhelming supply.<br />
<br />
But eventually ALL of us are going to be in that same place.  At that point, exactly like today, all of us are NOT going to want to be in the world's best raiding guild.  Just like all of us don't want to be now.  People aren't going to fundamentally change just because designers say so -- not even just because people in uber guilds wanting to protect their privileges say so.  <br />
<br />
What then...retire?  Smart azz punks will happily say, &quot;Yes, of course -- losers!&quot;  <br />
<br />
However, Sony needs money from more than just the &quot;best of the best.&quot;  It could use the cash from the other 95% of people who comprise their customer base, too.<br />
<br />
When you have a game divided into two tracks: 1) uber and 2) absolutely nowhere, you have a problem.<br />
<br />
Because of that, you MUST have ways of people having a chance at making some progress in the game even without being in an uber raiding guild and having every flag known to man.  Sony realized this to a certain extent with the alternate methods to get flagged to zones like BOTH, COD, etc.<br />
<br />
That understanding of what the broadest section of their customer base needs in order to feel like they're not just stopped dead in their tracks in the game must extend to things like spells, too.  If eventually 85% of your customers have a level 60 or above(or even more than one) and 90% of them and more are missing important spells appropriate to their level, with little hope of ever seeing them, you have a recipe for disaster -- tremendous dissatisfaction in almost everyone, leading to mass customer migration out of the game to other competitors, or wherever it is that people go.  With a good chance that they'll never come back to another one of your products again.  (EQ2, anyone?)<br />
<br />
Sony must keep alive alternatives to the &quot;crash and burn&quot; syndrome that will eventually hit the majority of their customer base if it finds out that once their character hits a certain level, without even having experience much of the game, he has hit an immovable wall, and come to the point where there IS no point in playing further.<br />
<br />
Spell drops available outside of major uber raids and decent alternative ways of getting flagged that don't frustrate people too much are necessary and will become even more necessary as the crushing bulk of the customer base begins inhabiting the same &quot;space&quot; in the the storyline of their own individual characters.  Can you envision a successful game where 700 people are LFG in POS and 800 in POV -- caves preferred?  I can't.<br />
<br />
These alternatives cannot be or remain based on rare spawn mobs or mobs that can easily be killed off by uber guilds to keep 95% of the game's players permanently or interminably fixed at certain stages of progress, or situations that the strongest builds can likewise manipulate to the same end -- The Sleeper comes to mind a bit here.<br />
<br />
There can't be a flood into the new, highest level content, perhaps, nor should everyone have nearly automatic access to all the very best spells and equipment, but if the river runs dry, so does will the players' thirst to log in, and pay for the privilege of doing so.  A trickle will perhaps be too little as well; we are talking about virtually the ENTIRE customer base, after all, wanting to improve their character avatars.<br />
<br />
Where and how to draw the lines is something we can all argue about or have opinions on, but the fact remains that players must have achievable, enjoyable goals -- all of them.  If all but a few are locked out of their spells -- or improvements in equipment -- and are locked out of experience in more than a handful of nice enough but fairly simplistic outdoor zones, the majority of players will not have achievable, enjoyable goals.  <br />
<br />
Becoming a full-time EQ player is NOT an option for most people, so is no solution.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the game will continue to need things like spells dropping in ways that people in the strongest guilds find objectionable, just as people in the strongest guilds will at one point have to learn to live with others invading &quot;their&quot; zones and competing for &quot;their&quot; mobs and &quot;their&quot; loot.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, they'll have to hope that EQ doesn't become yesterday's news.  DAOC didn't do that to EQ and probably couldn't, because players still had plenty they could do, and plenty of people nowhere near doing all of it that mattered; giving players nothing to accomplish or look forward to can very easily do it.<br />
<br />
A lifetime in POV/POS or, for some, the other lowest tiers without spells or flags should suffice to accomplish that handily.  How far away is the majority of the customer base from that scenario?<br />
<br />
And no, after being burned like that, the average customer WON'T be picking up a copy of EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is it that every spell caster in games like this feels he should be entitled to get all his spells?<br />
Why is it that those same spellcasters see no problem in weapons being drops from mobs  and that not every melee will always get the best weapon (or armor)?<br />
<br />
This whole &quot;the ubers get all the good stuff and I am being shafted by SoE&quot; argument is so unreall it is not even funny anymore.<br />
<br />
On my server there are 6 guilds racing for the higher tiers (my own guild being one of them). the structure of these guilds range from hardcore raiders to a casual guild (and all between those 2 options) so your argument about the casual player not being able to enter these zones is far from the thruth.<br />
I currently see players as low as level 61 in tier 3 zones. And no this are not twinks, this are not new characters racing to level 65 no this are casual players who are happy being level 61.<br />
<br />
Maybe my server (The Nameless) is an exception but yesterday every level 61-64 shaman spell was for sale in the Bazaar. Not a single one priced above 10K pp.<br />
As far as 65 spells go, Malos, Fo7 and FA where for sale. (Malos was priced at 20K) So I think that most shamans will be able to buy the spells they can not get with EP's,SP's or Runes.<br />
Sure buying yours spells is more costly then camping them but the same goes for buying equipment when you can not camp it.<br />
<br />
So I suggest that instead of spending time here flaming Twobrew you play the game and have fun while doing so, and if playing the game aint fun anymore then you only have 1 option imo.</div></div><hr />

What are you asking? can i solo in arena, i answered yes i can. Can a  6 man group keep spawns dead and force a rune dropping blue to 65 soloable (by me) named to spawn  every 2 hours? Yes they can. Whatever else you are reading into my post is on your end not mine.<br />
<br />
Get over it man, you know runes shouldnt be dropping off those mobs, so why the anger?  I could care less about Luclin, that expansion was broken in so many ways i cant even begin to start. <br />
<br />
I am not angry, I am just intrigued to see a person that didn't give a damn about RvR in the past suddenly become the RvR crusader. But sadly, the fact that you completely ignore other RvR irregularities points to ego, greed and attitude issues. I can't let others who haven't killed (insert tier 4 plane mini boss or boss) get level 65 spells! Only the elite of the elite can have it! Not John Doe who spent 100+ hours on quests to get into tier 3! I am holier than thou!<br />
<br />
Oh  and I am not &quot;getting over it&quot; because the same way Aten Ha Ra drops better loot then Emperor the same way glyphed runes should drop there, in the arena. And Aten is much easier than Emperor.<br />
<br />
To get to Tactics you need to either do a massive timesink quest that is estimated to be three times the time you need to get Seru bane weapon (to get ONE SINGLE person in) OR to kill in the most bugged zone, the most bugged POS boss encounter that takes quite a few people, that is blowable, you are lucky if it spawns and you are lucky if it doesn't warp on top of factory slaughtering your raid.<br />
<br />
The timesink quest AND/OR the fact you got passed Behemoth is more then enough to justify that glyped runes CAN VERY RARELY drop in an area where you need 4-5 people to have a reasonable camp time. The whole soloing one mob and gating out because aggro is a non issue, it's a timesink you create, hell even better for VI (aka high risk). But since you think it's not all right, why not lobby that they make named in arena immune changes in attack speed and movement? Oh right, that would be the logical thing to do, that would completely eliminate the soloing possibility of those, hell it would take a solid tank, dps and healer just to kill them.<br />
<br />
Let's use the VI mindset, instead of changing the mob, nerf the drops! Don't leave any spots in the game that are Reward &gt; Risk, hell nerf them! <br />
<br />
But one thing you forget, it's too late. The damage is DONE. Guilds with access to Tactics already got a great number of glyphed words. By getting this nerfed even more, you only going to hurt guilds who are not in Tactics yet, or people who are currently doing the insane timesink to get in tier 3 without killing bosses.<br />
<br />
One last thing I forgot, did you ever think that VI maybe intends to let a very small number of people in a group obtain glyphed runes without killing bosses? Afterall they already allow single groups to have access to every single tier 3 zone without killing one single mob that needs more than 6 people? But hell, nerf Tactics even more!</div></div><hr />

Oh well, seems the world is filled with dumbasses a lot more then i thought /grin<br />
<br />
And since the Moderators on this board hardly do any moderation at all so everyone can curse and abuse everybody, i may just let go of my polite formulations.<br />
<br />
Landragoran....<br />
<br />
1.) I didnt know that ye own this board. And as long as i dont see the site being named &quot;Interealms - Landragorans Shamans Crucible&quot;, id suggest ye - kindly - hold ye big trap about what is &quot;yours&quot; here ok ? Thanks :D<br />
<br />
2.) Group with you ? Get into a Guild with you ? Heck, i be damned if i  would sink THAT low. I have no regards for a large Guild that has restrictions set up in means of what members get in and which dont (Level / AA wise). I agree to the fact that for &quot;Uber items&quot; and other crap a powerful force is indeed needed,  yet alone the fact that i will become a sheer number rather staying a individual that is being recognized makes me almost puke to think to be part of such a machinery at all. As ye may have found out by now, im no &quot;Raider&quot; - since i dont have the appropriate Hardware nor the time to spend on something like that.<br />
<br />
And as we come to &quot;You dont know me, so please dont judge me&quot;, i only can say that ye (and all of the others that posted here) dont know Twobrew, nor me for a longer period of time. Ye never talked to him or me in game, and seeing ye speeches, ye kind of attitude would make it literallly impossible to get along with you (this is aimed solely at Landragoran and the other Braindeads who just flame around - isnt aimed at the persons who can write well formulated speeches without need to abuse in every line).<br />
<br />
Umm....now where was I ? Ahh, yes - if you name someone a jackass, yet have never seen, talked or been with him or her for a longer period of time, it shouldnt surprise ye when ye get smacked back just the same.<br />
<br />
Its all about respect - in game and in RL. And seeing you giving no respect, ye dont need to whine if ye dont get respected in return.<br />
<br />
Now, go and play with ye Gnome Dolls, kid :D</div></div><hr />

Wow ... talk about proving your own point ... Thanks for falling on your own sword for the point.   <br />
<br />
Landragoran doesn't really need any backup ... his writing style is going to get negative feedback ... and he knows it.   But he has done the time ... can back up what he's written ... and lastly has some basis of ingame knowledge and accomplishments to back up his rants. <br />
<br />
You on the other hand ... Kubax ... bring nothing to the table other than trying to support TwoBrew ... and for the most part  just trolling.    To complain about the mod's on this board and those that require moderation ... then go off yourself on Landragoran just revealed your true colors.    If one have been wronged ...  don't wrong someone back to prove virtue.  Morals 101.<br />
<br />
Sadly ... after taking off on a rambling list of statements bemoaning Large guilds, Raiding, flaming, and speech writing ... you try to wind up with something about getting respect is giving respect.   Good point (see above) but one doesn't gain respect by dis-respecting others (other than a getting respect as a great flaming troller).    IMHO on the Shaman's Crucible ... you gain respect by your actions, posts, accomplishments, and style.   <br />
<br />
Ramble on Kubax ... but on the subject of respect ... keep searching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Stygiana, you almost certainly are quite correct that your server IS an exception in having EVERY shaman spell for sale, and under 10k to boot.  Perhaps mine is also the exception in having VERY few POP spells for sale, and those ones tending to be multiple copies of the very few spells, as well.  True spirit, for one, is 20k on my server.  However, to extrapolate that either your situation or mine is necessarily everyone's situation is simply to be careless. <br />
<br />
My point being that the game MUST have ways for more casual players, or players who are hardcore but don't want to leave the guilds they're in, or can't, to achieve some sort of goals or progress, is a good one, and Sony seems to agree.  First, by making trials difficult but not impossible for average level 60's, second, by making alternate, though sometimes very tedious and not quite properly working alternative ways to get flagged, and third, for example, by making spells and some items drop in a way not all of the people in the strongest guild like, that is...so that people BESIDES them can get them.<br />
<br />
What any of this has to do with everyone getting everything all the time(though you seem to single out spellcasters for some odd reason) is anyone's guess; you seem to rather sloppily assert some relation.<br />
<br />
If you do not like the idea of some people achieving their goals and protest that I do, fine.  To tell me to quit &quot;flaming&quot; poor Twobrew and to imply that I should just quit the game or shut up and like whatever it is that you or anyone thinks I should like is foolish and unfriendly and completely self-centered, something I haven't seen you be before and am surprised you would stoop to.<br />
<br />
Perhaps your feathers are ruffled that anyone, perhaps anyone merely of my own lowly status, should dare to question the assertion that the majority of the game's customers should NOT have to buy or spells from people like you or simply do without?  You've suggested I shut up and quit the game; why don't we all shut up and quit so you can keep selling spells at inflated prices until you're so rich and gorged with plat that your eyes roll back in your head?<br />
<br />
You know what?  Most people are NOT like you, believe it or not.  They're not likely to wish that the game should be disproportionately easy for those in the &quot;right&quot; guilds and able tp play long hours and disproportionately harsh and pointless for those who are not and cannot.<br />
<br />
If you or Chuk or whoever can protest bitterly that others who play the game differently from yourselves or are in &quot;lesser&quot; guilds manage to get a little something now and again, it's certainly no less legitimate that I or anyone else in the vast majority can say, wait a minute, I'm not behind an agenda that's all about making sure I get as little as possible.  <br />
<br />
The vast majority should shut up and take less and have things get harder or QUIT?  How very nice of you to suggest it.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness Sony hasn't been quite a selfish and mean-spirited in this regard.  In the future, as even more people want to intrude on the precious &quot;rights&quot; of the ubers to sell and farm all the best loot and go to all the best places because THEY HAVE NO PLACE ELSE TO GO and no other way to achieve anything for their characters, Sony will have to make sure to continue to at least consider the ability of the majority of the people to play and continue playing their game.<br />
<br />
If they wind up playing a little too close to anyone's exalted station sooner or later, I suggest you release the hounds or something.<br />
<br />
If you can't be happy with your own game, I hope you learn to forgive others who would like to be happy with theirs.<br />
<br />
If you can't, why don't you just quit?<br />
<br />
Just trying to make a VERY friendly, VERY helpful suggestion.  I'm sure some would approve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, when it comes to actions (which speak much louder then words alone), i can truly say that - on the Server i play - i have gained quite some respect and are liked by quite a few persons. So i cant be all wrong in what i do.<br />
<br />
Yet, coming to the point of &quot;respect&quot;, its really simple. Either you respect someone (and his friends) and treat them due to their actions - if someone wronged, then its time to listen first, then to judge why he / she has done this or that - and reply in a POLITE MANNER. This goes for me as well (hell, im noone with a Halo also). But being outright negative and abusive makes me mad. For it sounds like &quot;What ye think ye doing here ? I know what is right, I make the rules etc etc. - and sorry, but thats just awful. <br />
<br />
In the case of Landragoran, he sounds like he owns this whole place - and i was quite mad at first. But now, im just disappointed, since charakters like  him spoil the gameplay (quite a few of those on my Server too). Maybe he has some ingame knowledge - okay. But that doesnt make up for his behaviour he shows in here, which is without doubt how he acts in game as well.<br />
<br />
And thus,  its a simple rule fer meself:<br />
<br />
&quot;Respect me, and i will respect you. Disrespect me, and i will disrespect you.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'd like to point out that the first replies to this thread were all quite civil and explained the situation well, it wasn't until TwoBrew replied back that it started getting mean.  And even then, it was Land who started.<br />
<br />
Hands up, anyone here ever not noticed that Land can be a bit abrasive?   Anyone?   Beuller?   Beuller?  Gosh, the guy that is known as occassionally being a bit rough was.   Suprise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">I replied back...that means rudeness in response? Not just Land, a lot of &quot;anus talker, jackass,etc...&quot; from others as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Twobrew, you are either VERY bad a communicating your point or simply changing it whenever you are confronted.   Shaman on this board can not understand how anyone could fail to grasp the facts of the situation.  <br />
<br />
*The fact is that 4 spells received from spectral parchments are NOT worth the parchment.  When you go through the whole big deal of killing many difficult mobs for these rare parchments, win them sometimes right out from under your friends and guildies and then turn them in for.... single target DEX?  May as well jab yourself in the eye repeatedly with your spear of fate instead.  Thats about as much fun it would be.<br />
<br />
You then move on to saying that everyone disagrees with you due to your level.  No, they are using that to try to explain why you do not have any grasp at all on the facts*.<br />
<br />
You then move on again, saying shaman shouldnt complain so they dont turn into the Whiney Class of the Year(tm).  Hate to be the one to tell you but, as LB stated, the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Rangers sucked, they whined.  OMG did they whine, now they kick major ass.  Druids whined, now they got what they wanted via no snare on epic and better heals, muhahah!  (Sorry that last one is a double edged sword and amuses the cleric in me.)<br />
<br />
If you wish your opinions to be considered you should follow the basics of writing just a bit.  State your point, state back up factual information supporting your point and restate your point.  You need to show respect for your audience as well or else people are just going to Jackass you.<br />
<br />
Of course thats just my opinion, I'm just a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">My points...<br />
<br />
1) Kunark spell turn in vs PoP etheral/Spectral turn in. <br />
In Kunark it was bsed on a class specific spell that dropped not a generic parchment that all classes (minus monk,warrior, rogue) need. If a spectral drops all casters are gonna roll since it is not class specific. That is the major difference in that comparison.<br />
<br />
2) The &quot;crying&quot; for spell removal. <br />
The reason this was brought up is obvious. We are getting the chicken before the egg. Why the hell would i need a lvl 63 str buff when i got a level 62 hp/str/dex buff? Its not crying at all, its logic. Don't waste my spectral turn in on a useless spell that has pretty much already been given to me.<br />
<br />
3) The whole PoP spell deal.<br />
Dumb. 40% of level 60+ shaman still needing torpor and/or malo 2 years 9 months after Kunark should be an obvious clue on how to NOT structure a spell drop system. I realize we have as much chance to get a spell as the next guy but making it so generic from the get go was kinda short sighted. It should work like a Lotd Yelinak quest, you keep returning the spell till you get one ya need.  I know one of you deep thinkers has an even better idea.<br />
<br />
4) Runes<br />
Yea the pit was cool for a while for those lucky enough to get a shot at it but i agree that pit mobs should not be dropping runes when MM, bertoxx, Sol Ro mobs(excluding mini bosses) arent dropping them. Last MM kill we got 4 freaking etherals! How rediculous is that?<br />
<br />
5) We the people<br />
Don't say &quot;we&quot; as if your an ambassador of the shaman community. You obviously don't have the pulse of the community nor feel the same desperation we do in the Planes. I don't actually mind your argument, you have your view and thats fine but don't expect sympathy from those you offend when you come here trying to represent us as a class on the whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most are complaining because we feel the real frustration of poor design. I never got to feel this kind of frustration till SoL came out. I got lucky and got Torpor at lvl 53 as a guest to a Servilious kill and Malo was given to me by the guild. When SoL came out I got to see how annoying it was to have greater curse AE's but only one mob was dropping GRC. Everytime we killed Arch Lich in that ******* of a zone Ssra temple we didn't give a damn about the items we just wanted to land another copy of GRC for the guild. <br />
<br />
<br />
I couldnt let this one slip, sorry....<br />

Don't think of comming here and telling us that &quot;like I do for 2 1/2 years&quot; makes you an authority on the class. Simply going to school doesn't make you learn.<br />

<br />
I for one don't quite understand this statement but I will say what i get out of it. Your saying that the majority of &quot;high levelers&quot; in big guilds are incompetent players who only know how to raid. If thats the case I dare you to try and back that up. What ever you think you may know about the upper tier guild shaman from every server based off your VAST experience from what ever server your play on, its obviously biased. Don't think of comming here and making some bold claim about your &quot;ubber leet skillz&quot; and expect some form of respect from anyone. Respect is earned not given. <br />
 If you did NOT mean it like I think you did, then I am sorry, I obviously missunderstood. You did say your from the father land and english is not your primary laguage. Being in the &quot;upper guild&quot; provides those players a different view of EQ. When you go into a zone that no one has seen and no one has any info on and you have to learn on your own then you develop a certain attitude. You find the stratgies and beat the boss of the zone and you get rewarded for it. Yea you get a little arogant at times and sometimes you forget where you came from but it doesnt mean they loose skill. Do I think I am better than any other Terris Thule shaman because I'm in the local &quot;uber&quot; guild on TT? No. Give Henora my gear and she would be deified in the EQ hall of fame, she is that good. I talk to her a lot because on TT her reputation preceeds herself. She commands respect from her quiet corner on Terris and I have yet to meet a shaman on Terris who does not respect her opinion and sometimes seek her advice. Now she is wrong about Iksars but she is a barb after all and can't be faulted for her &quot;racial limitations&quot;<br />
I get real sick and tired if the bulls#it assumptions people come here and make. Don't pretend to know everything about everyone and don't speak for everyone unless your asked to. I wouldnt begin to be so ignorant to assume I am &quot;the voice of the community&quot; Hell my 13 year old nephew has better grammer :( Now Blarg though, he has damn good grammer.

<br />
As for the topic:  At 54, I already do not ever cast strength and dex spells.  If these useless spells come after Focus of Spirit, requiring me to take valuable parchments from my guildmates, then I will not be able to justify rolling on the parchments.  Many shaman are in my position, and we are not seeing other classes complain that their 63-64 spells are unuseable.  It seems to me that shaman are very justified in complaining, and in asking for the spells to be removed.   <br />
<br />
This is a case in which a class is asking for nothing, rather than having something.  If someone would rather have nothing, then you really need to take a close look at the circumstances.</div></div><hr />

Why is it that every spell caster in games like this feels he should be entitled to get all his spells?<br />
Why is it that those same spellcasters see no problem in weapons being drops from mobs  and that not every melee will always get the best weapon (or armor)?<br />
<br />
Because while casters only have a small handful of spells, melees have armor and weapons just lying around? Most of which cast spells?<br />
<br />
Because casters need the armor AND the spells, as well?<br />

Because you can equip a warrior with a rusty longsword and he'll still do damage, whereas a caster without spells is as useful as a Gnome Paladin?</div></div><hr />

I know my posting style can offend people and I don't care.  If I offended you personally, I probably meant to shake you up a bit.  Doesn't mean we can't still argue about things.  Very rarely do I consider someone a complete idiot and refuse to converse with them further.  <br />
<br />
 If I offended you indirectly, I might owe you an apology, or at least a clarification.  I don't usually offend indirectly tho, unless people just can't stand to see someone getting owned on the boards once in a while.  Oh well, speak up if you feel offended by the gnome.  I promise I'll hold your hand and sing Kumbayah until we both feel better :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Siamese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">I know that TwoBrew was saying that we shouldn't complain because he is afraid that we will look like whiners.  Well, honestly, I don't think anyone here that the parchment turn-ins is affecting could care less about being labeled a &quot;complainer.&quot;  Who cares if people start saying we are whining?  Do I care?  Not really.  In high school, I couldn't have cared less if someone liked me or didn't like me, and I *really* don't give a drolvarg's arse if someone on the other side of the country whom I've never met thinks that my class might be whining.  If &quot;complaining&quot; gets the issues fixed, then I will happily join the ranks of complainers.<br />
<br />
TwoBrew, I know that you feel offended that people are saying that you are not of a level to understand what you are talking about, so let's take this from a very elementary progression, shall we?  Let's preempt this by saying: &quot;Don't get your feathers all ruffled here.  I am trying to help you understand where everyone is coming from so you are able to feel a small amount of empathy for the shaman community.&quot;<br />
<br />
At level 44, I am guessing that most of your experience is in single groups of 6 players and you have most likely participated in few, if any raids as a shaman.  Understand that the Focus spells are basically 3 buffs in one.  You get the first Focus spell at level 49.  On a raid, having to cast 3 spells on each and every group, as opposed to a single spell would literally be a never ending process.  By the time you were done with the last group, you would have to completely start all over buffing the first group.  ...and that is just for Str, Dex, and HP.  Nothing said about any other buffs people might want.<br />
<br />
With me so far?<br />
<br />
Now with Focus, that eliminates the need for casting all those spells, and you actually get to participate in the raid, rather than being the buff vending machine.  Now you actually get a chance to slow a mob and maybe drop a DoT or two in there before the next request for buffs.<br />
<br />
Now take the spells that are being discussed here.  We are back to single target/single stat effecting spells.  These are spells that no one will want to use because there is no real value in using them.  So here we are with spells that no one really wants.<br />
<br />
So far so good?<br />
<br />
Now, these rare parchments that are very difficult to get for a significant number of players...they are used by all classes.  Most of us will feel that it is not right to take a parchment from another casting class that can get a spell they will get a lot of use out of, when we have a significant chance of receiving a spell that we will never use.<br />
<br />
Here is where we feel that we need to voice our opinion.  We are hoping that we can get the change where the spells are removed from the quests entirely, or make them a spell that can be purchased for the people that would find a use for them.  That would end all frustration with the parchments.  Maybe it is whining and complaining, and maybe we will start being the new druid a.k.a. complainers.  I for one could care less who calls me what if it actually fixes the issue.<br />
<br />
Here's a suggestion.  Don't worry about what people might think of you.  It doesn't matter if people think you are a complainer.  If it benefits the entire shaman community to be a complainer, then so be it.<br />

Siamese, Complainer and Whiner.</div></div><hr />

Well as to fairness , ive been trying to get this nerfed for 2 weeks now. I helped get it down from the rune every 45 minutes rate to every 2 hours rate. I wanted the Runes to be removed completely from those mobs though, which from what my friends on Test are telling me were removed as of the last few days. We shall see, i will continue to bug report every hour on the hour until this bug gets fixed.  <br />
<br />
I have no problem with runes dropping like candy in any tier zone, but considering these spells are extremely powerful, the mobs dropping them should be equal in strength and receiving them should be an accomplishment.  Got a problem with that? Then you really should quit playing, go buy Diablo2 and  use /godmode.<br />

If you think the runes dropping are so wrong you have /feedbacked them to be fixed, why are you still hunting at that spot?  <br />
<br />
For example, back when Kunark came out, it was discovered you could exploit the pathing in CoM for easier pulling.  I thought, whoa, that's wrong and should be fixed and I submitted /feedback.  Did I use the pathing until it got fixed? NO!<br />
<br />
Why can't this spot where runes drop be analogous to the emp in OS dropping level 60 spells? Getting to Plane of Tactics itself is NOT easy, either kill a raid mob tougher than AoW or do a quest that involves camping 4 different items off a mob.  If you manage to get to the Plane of Tactics, why shouldn't a non raid individual have SOME hope of achieving level 65 spells.  <br />
<br />
Chuk, if there is no place in PoP for a single group to get runes, how are your average Joe shaman, not in a raiding guild supposed to get runes?<br />
<br />
This is right back to the whole &quot;malo and torpor aren't too rare because my guild can easily kill Kunark dragons and I have my spells&quot; argument that's been going on for 2 years now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">A few things to chime in with..<br />
<br />
1) Lan, OW man, you come with a mild setting? LOL<br />
<br />
2) TwoBrew was totally off base with an unwarranted statement that was about as foolish as I've seen since my days as a wizard when someone tried to tell Graffe's wizards weren't broke (pre Vellious)<br />
<br />
3) I can see the point about the Pit in Tactics.  Although I spend the majority of my time in HoHO and Valor, that seems excessive IF and ONLY if the high spell sets are the end all be all goal in PoP.<br />
<br />
3a)  The 63-65 spell set should not be a nightmare to accquire the specific spells you want.  This analogy is gonna be a bit crappy but a 65 warrior with NToV is still more effective than 64 Warrior with NToV, but you'd rather have him have PoP/VT/SSra gear.  A caster without at least SOME of their spell set, is not (yes I understand mana pool and resists but follow me here).  Some bone needs to be thrown to Shaman who don't want to blow parch after parch on useless spells to the point where you just don't want to award your top two shaman with spells for fear that it will go bad.  Just something besides a title beside my name to make 65 worth it.<br />
<br />
There has to be a middle road.  I'm looking forward to 65 just so my guild doesnt' tell me to level and I can go straight Aaxp again  but as a caster, having my skills improve as well is a needed boon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">Remember when Ancient spells were introduced and only one mob was dropping them? Some mob in Sebilis was bugged and dropping ancients everytime (so I was told)<br />
<br />
I agree with Chukzombi in that runes are to be a reward for a great achievement, not a common 6 man group kill. Name me one level 60 spell that dropped off a mob that a 6 man group could kill (In the proper time frame) Runes should definatly drop off MM, PoS giant bosses, Zeks, Saryn, Aerin Dar. Tier 2 zone bosses should drop one rune per kill and MM and up should be 2 or 3. Last MM kill we did we got like 4 spectral's.<br />
Bastion of Thunder bosses are one group doable and drop runes. Hell the only hand of virtue we have in the guild came from a cleric on a BoT exp group who won the rune. Pretty damn sad IMO. Super power guilds should not be the only ones regulated to having access to runes but runes are not parchments and should not be on yard_trash_mob_01</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure juggs never dropped lvl 60 spells till this recent spell drop rate tweak. BUT I can't be certain. I missed almost all of Kunark due to the Karana server split. <br />

<br />
You should get the runes first, and I'll have to wait a year or so.  That's how it has worked in the past.  <br />
<br />
On my server, etheral parchments spells are selling for 15kpp.  I'm not worried, because I can get those - and already have most.  But I don't want my only option to be buying 65 level spells from some guild mule for 100kpp.  <br />
<br />
If that's the case, a lot of guys like me will simply quit.  <br />
<br />
Maybe I will fire up Diablo.  I've over 200 days on Gart, and he's essentially the only character I've played meaningfully.  I like playing a shaman.  I'm used to things being harder for me because I can't raid like others, but they ought to designed so they are still doable for less than massive raiding guilds.  <br />
<br />
You have it *easier*, not harder.  I play a fair amount, but my time is inconsistent, and I can't get into a groove raiding-wise, or commit to big raids, because I often don't know when I can be on, or when I have to leave.  I've still scrabbled my way into VP, gotten malo, torpor and done some stuff.  Guys like you should and do have much more, but guys like me ought to be factored in.  <br />

Thats only two zones. Each and every one of those mobs single group killable with Level 60 and below.<br />

<br />
Yup, and like I said, any warrior can do to East Freeport and buy a pair of rusty shortswords. Doesn't mean they're effective or even close to being level-appropriate. Casters rely on level-appropriate spells and armor, while melees rely on level-appropriate weapons and armor. Decent melee weapons and armor fall like rain in this game, while caster spells are crammed up the rear end of critters that take a raid force to take down in some obnoxious zone. There's also quite a limited selection of spells per class, unlike melee's weapons. Does your Paladin want to use the Goldrenrod today? Petrified Heartwood flamberge? Windblade? Sword of Ssrawhatever? Does your Shaman want to use torpor or... torpor?<br />
<br />
Maybe there's a lack of melee gear in PoP... Never fear, that's what Kunark, Velious, and Luclin are there for. If Kunark spells are good enough for your casters, then cobalt and dual lammies are good enough for your warrior, right?<br />

Burst of Flame, in my opinion, is better then some of the stat buffs...I certainly use burst of flame more then I have ever cast the str / dex buffs..(never)..It's wonderful for faction tagging, like in Kael, if your feeling lazy... =)~</div></div><hr />

I'll back Chuk up on this one, the guild made a big push to get everyone BoT flagged over the christmas period, unfortunately some of my friends missed this, we didnt sit there and whinge about annoying flags, we knuckled down and basically walked into pos with a far from perfect group with the aim of not leaving till all 6 of us were flagged, it took us 3 wipes before we finally pulled it off, but we managed to take out a PoS miniboss with a single group.  Cleric, Shaman, Warrior, Warrior, Bard, Necro.  The only outside help consisted of me trading shaman buffs for c3 whilst we tweaked our tactics to get the kill.<br />
<br />
Imho 1 decently equiped and smart group can get into all the tier 3 planes if they stop moaning and actually get killing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the slow immunity, BoT flag is not single group killable anymore, barring specific group setups.<br />
<br />
And we are talking PoT anyway, not BoT. Which, incidently, is an even easier key. We are talking single person kills here (lots of em though).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u175"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p175">How did the people whining about other people not being uber enough to deserve the things they themselves do manage to derail the latest subject of this thread, that being runes dropping in a place you didn't need to be in a major raid to get?<br />
<br />
Getting flagged is not the same issue.  <br />
<br />
For myself, for instance, I'm content to get flagged for whatever I get flagged for whenever it happens; but for those already there, I don't think they deserve to not have a crack at anything without a major raid.  Nor do I think the people in the uberguilds should completely run the game, locking up raid level mobs to either prevent others from advancing by getting their spells (or keys)EVER, or so they can charge gigantic prices and become rich as King Midas.<br />
<br />
Heck, I've seen 41% haste belts, a ring with Vengeance on it, lotta other stuff drop off single group mobs just in POS, and windblades are all over the place.  It's not like having upgrades for either casters OR melee should always be something you have to leave your guild and join an uberguild to get.  Heck, unlike melee, we don't really have any replacements or similar items to choose from if we're missing spells; it's all or nothing.<br />
<br />
I like the idea that spells are not going to come into the game purely at the whim of every server's uberguild(s), sold for fortunes to whatever very, very few people can afford to buy one after another of them from a monopoly or cartel.  That doesn't mean nobody should ever try to get flagged; but heck, if they're even in the zones the runes are dropping, there's no sense in making sure that whatever drops will never go to anyone outside an uberguild with a raid prescence right when a rare mob spawns or something ridiculous like that.  Like I noted before, that will rule most people out of wanting to continue the game once they hit that brick wall.  <br />
<br />
If people do spend the huge amounts of time necessary to level, get AA, and get some flags, and still can't get runes(or flags) because their guild is just not uber enough, they won't be buying any more EQ games and expansions from Sony and won't continue with this one.  That's probably over 90% of the customer base.  Sony would just be throwing money away.<br />
<br />
Don't worry -- if I ever get quiescence, it won't make your quiescence suddenly evaporate from your spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">Well for starters the drop rate in the pit in tactics was insane. All knew it, all knew it would be nerfed and all tried to get as many runes as possible before that nerf.<br />
<br />
SoE opted to not make spells vendor bought. So when you have spells as drops the plan is to make the amount of them in the game small and only increasing with a small number. This has nothing to do with players being uber or not but is just a tactic used to keep you playing longer.<br />
<br />
And I even understand the frustration and anger players must have when they feel that the drop mechanism favors the players in the &quot;uber&quot; guilds but to be honest I do not think it is true.<br />
I think that in the end it takes just about the same amount of time for everyone to get a full spellbook. Only some players play more then others and thus have the spells a lot earlier.<br />
<br />
I don't know if getting spells is to hard or to easy I do however feel that lvl 65 spells should be a reward and not something trivial.<br />
<br />
And lets be honest it aint that hard to get into some tier 3 zones, it is boring but it aint hard to do the quests.</div></div><hr />

You get some spells, although single use, that are being chosen not to be used...but those spells are far better than burst of flame. <br />

Exactly where in Plane of Valor were these spectral parchments dropping?  Desert? Undead? Inner cave?  Outer cave?  I've hunted virtually everywhere in PoV and NEVER seen a spectral drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">Stygiana, I think the idea that we all get our spells in the same amount of time, and it's just that some people play more, just doesn't make any sense at all.<br />
<br />
Why? Well, as examples anyone can probably find familiar -- I got malo off my first Sev kill, when I was about 58.  Others are 60 for a long time, after many dragon kills, without getting it.  Luckily, I was the only shaman there at the time.  I guess staying up till 5:30 in the morning just to help out strangers threw some very good karma my way. :)  However, I didn't get torpor until I had been 60 for like six months.  Same with my epic(ugh!).  A lot really depends on your guild.  <br />
<br />
How much time you spend really has extraordinarily little to do with anything.<br />
<br />
I remember one shaman who was a friend of people in the server's top uberguild.  He rocketed up the levels of course, equipped with the best of everything, and had malo and torpor waiting for him when he was still in his low 50's.  Did he earn it?  Nah, he wasn't even in on the kills when they dropped.  Did he spend much time?  Heck no.  About six months after he hit 60, he had just about the best shaman raid gear available at the time.  <br />
<br />
So is everything REALLY balanced around skill and time spent?  Of course not.   Never has been.  That really doesn't even make sense on the face of it.  There are and will continue to be people who have a vast swath of spells very quickly after the opening of POP, and others, perhaps much older characters who have spent far more raiding time, who will get them much slower.  That's not necessarily good or bad; but it's certainly a fact.<br />
<br />
And of course being part of an uberguild has an enormous amount to do with it.  That's one of the main motivations to get in one.<br />
<br />
I must note that again you speak of getting into tier 3 -- I agree that at least some of it is quite doable; the parts I've done in POS for instance haven't been particularly hard, though the nerfing of giant mini-bosses by messing with slows certainly has changed the difficulty dramatically; I got one medallion with two non-uber groups but now that ain't going to cut it.<br />
<br />
However, that again has nothing to do with whether or not you should get any loot or spells once you GET there.  What's the point for the vast majority of people in getting there if they can't get the loot there without major raids -- or if the bosses dropping loot or flags in those raids are kept perma-killed by uberguilds to keep them from progressing further?  It's not like you get a certificate or something; you want the goods, unless you're inhumanly weird.<br />
<br />
Maybe runes shouldn't drop in places that don't take a full group to get, or even two, like the POS mini-bosses used to before the slow nerf.  But to lock them up so that you need a coordinated guild effort to get one a month by making them too rare or on highly contested mobs would be ridiculous -- especially when people in the uberguilds and with that kind of capability have been watching them fall like rain for months now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">BlargX, I think we are on a complete different track here.<br />
I think of spell drops in much the same way as I think about equipment drops.<br />
Being that the good spells should drop from the hardest mobs around, that it should be a reward to get one and not some thing that is just handed out when you reach a new level.<br />
<br />
And as that I see nothing wrong with runes only dropping from raid level mobs.<br />
<br />
Now the system SoE uses to give out the spells is wrong imo (random reward) but I can see the logic they tried to use.<br />
<br />
Also I am aware that progress in PoP aint easy, that a lot of players will not see tier 4 planes for a long time to come but i think that was to be expected from an expansion aimed at the high level players. SoE expected players to have a certain level of equipment, a certain amount of AA skills and a certain amount of playing skills before being able to progress. And to get that equipment they needed to be part of a raiding guild so yes Raid level mobs are a big part of PoP.<br />
<br />
But let me ask you a question, If getting spells was as easy as getting AA points in PoP and you had free access to all content with a single pick up group do you think it would remain fun for long?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">Originally posted by stygiana Also I am aware that progress in PoP aint easy, that a lot of players will not see tier 4 planes for a long time to come but i think that was to be expected from an expansion aimed at the high level players.<br />
No. That would be expected from an expansion aimed at the uber guilds. I can level to 65 and still never be able to see a tier 4 planes.<br />
<br />
SoE expected players to have a certain level of equipment, a certain amount of AA skills and a certain amount of playing skills before being able to progress. And to get that equipment they needed to be part of a raiding guild so yes Raid level mobs are a big part of PoP.<br />
Wrong again. It's not the equipment (or at least only to a degree), a certain amount of AA skills and a certain amount of playing skills that enable me to progress. It's being in a big guild that can kill those mobs. I can have all the AA skills and even the equipment possible but if I'm not in an uber guild i won't EVER be able to see the higher tier PoP zones.<br />
<br />
I think that in the end it takes just about the same amount of time for everyone to get a full spellbook. Only some players play more then others and thus have the spells a lot earlier.<br />
Time has **** all to do with a full spellbook. No matter how long I'm playing, I won't be able to get many spells (Ancient, boss mob drop spells, runes) or I have to wait until all the ubers have their spells. How is it taking me just about the same amount of time to fill my spellbook?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u185"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p185">Stygiana, I don't agree that spells are equivalent to equipment.  There's tons of equipment out there, especially for melees, and much of it is interchangeably satisfactory to excellent.  A spell, by contrast, you either have or you don't.  A great many are not variations in efficacy, like a warrior gets when he gets a better or different sword or breastplate; many have no equivalent in the game.  They are complete and often pivotal changes in how your character is played.  A melee may have windblade OR dual fleshgrinders, and not suck either way; a shaman without torpor or malo sucks in comparison, big time.<br />
<br />
Also, the idea that certain mobs and areas should be locked out by virtue of how good your skills/equipment/AA are(possibly how good your guild is) works for other expansions to a certain real extent.  You hit your max level, and eventually got the spells to go with it, or most of the important ones, most likely.  Within that power level, there was still a huge amount of content.  There were a number of places to get experience, spells, and get worthwhile loot while refining guild tactics and strategy.  Trying to get to the next level, say by getting a shissar ring so you could kill the Emperor, let you achieve goals while getting experience.  Everything made sense and flowed together.<br />
<br />
However, this expansion made it so that anyone and everyone can get into a stage of the game at which they cannot progress normally.  At 65, compare.  Many 65's will not have a reasonable chance for lord knows how long, if ever, to get all 65 spells, or even lesser spells.  Yet, they will be penalized by the game as if they DID have access to all the planes, all the spare time, and all the guild power that much more uber people do.  So 65, being a natural part of the game, will take you to where the vast variety of play styles the game allowed and encouraged previously, all being worthwhile, will be whittled down to just a few -- do uber things in an uber way, or just hang around POV/POS for the rest of your EQ life.  Not much of an attractive choice either way, for many, if not most people.<br />
<br />
I've been staying 60, and am in no particular hurry to change that; but most people will want to pursue the higher levels and higher spells both.  Critically, many are already over 60(many more to come, too) -- 61 is all it takes to green out almost the entire game.  They can't progress in a coordinated fashion anymore.<br />
<br />
They may well not be able to find a way, for themselves and their guilds, to get EITHER those spells or a wide variety of experience and still feel they're progressing in the game.  If some people in their guilds get flagged, what happens if they're staying late at work that day or go linkdead?  The whole guild is going to do everything all over again just for them?  In what, two or three months?  If the mob is up and not kept perma-killed by ubers to keep everyone else out of higher tier zones or from getting higher spells?<br />
<br />
They made it much too easy to get 65, perhaps; you can do it in a week or so.  Or else, they shouldn't have made so many mobs green or horrible exp as soon as you hit 61.  Or both.<br />
<br />
While raiding should be required for some things, that's different than it being required for ALL things.  And if you can only get anything at all if you're &quot;the best of the best,&quot; most people will have to be content with getting nothing.  Well...ask that and you're asking something people will simply not agree with.  It's easy when you have plenty to say others should get nothing; heck, the whole world works that way.  But, this is a game.  It's supposed to be fun, not life and death, a harsh reality lesson, or something you put up with because you have no other choice.  Most people choose to play a game for fun; the game has to stay that way for the majority of people or they won't play.<br />
<br />
At least if things are going to be very difficult, there should be no bottlenecks.  As someone remarked, a place like NTOV does not have cheesy restrictions on when you can fight there; you fight there if you're good enough, and how much you die tells you that clearly and fairly.  That's a much better way to run a game because it gives everyone, eventually, a chance -- a shot at the big time.  Timesink key camps and ways of locking out content artificially -- and spells and items -- are not really good game design.<br />
<br />
POP prepares people with extra levels for the big time, then denies most the big time and also denies them the ability to prosper from where they were at, as experience no longer exists there.  It can put you in the middle of an unsolvable puzzle.  The solution to which, for many, is simply to quit, or will be.  At a rate unprecedented in the game's history.  I'd love to see how many people want POV caves six months from now.  1500 per server?  Or will a sizeable portion have gotten tired of that by then?<br />
<br />
Difficulty does not automatically equal fun, especially when things are artificially made difficult.  It's no more fun to do something difficult than something easy, unless the difficulty gives you a sense of accomplishment by requiring something of you that is challenging and has a point. <br />
<br />
You ask if the game would remain fun if I could get all my spells and everything was single-group oriented.  Very strange question; the two aren't necessarily closely related either.  Getting a spell has NEVER once been fun for me, though occasionally the process has been, be it the raid, the single group, whatever.  I have gotten exactly zero extra value by having any of my spells being hard to get, including only as hard as running to a different vendor to get them.<br />
<br />
I think I'm like most people -- of course I would like all my spells!  And of course that would make me happy.  As to everything being single group or raid-oriented, I think both ways are ridiculously extreme.  I don't think you should be forced to abandon your friends and guilds to join uberguilds in order to get anywhere in the game, and I don't think you should be able to get everything there is to get while soloing or in a single group.<br />
<br />
But there has to be something reasonable in between.<br />
<br />
I think Sony agrees by making some of these zones possible to get into with quests, and some items available without a raid.  Their doing so is merely their not being stupid and realizing that you can't alienate virtually your entire player base by making them feel the game is a foolish waste of time that gives them no chance to progress at an enjoyable rate.<br />
<br />
Instead of seeing it as a priority that others shouldn't get too much, I see it the opposite way:  that making sure that only those with powerful alliances, the best of luck, and endless amounts of playtime get goodies and have fun is not really very important at all.  To the game's success or to the vast majority of its players.  Quite the contrary.  I think that's a stupid goal, and one dangerous for the game.  At the very least, even considering it shows a profound lack of understanding of how the human animal works, and is too glib about there being no point at which people can say, &quot;You know, this is not fun.  I've hit a brick wall and it's become pointless.&quot;  Sony surely doesn't want them to say or think that too easily.  I'm sure nobody wants to both feel that way and pay for the privilege of doing so.<br />
<br />
It's NOT getting necessary things that makes people quit, in my experience, rather than getting things and then being able to enjoy them.  What's the downside in enjoying things?  If that's enough to make you quit, you were going to quit anyway.  That's when you can stop worrying and struggling, and enjoy a game's real content, if it has any(timesinks are not content); things get fun again.  Which is the entire point of a game.<br />
<br />
Nobody really gives a rat's behind if anyone has jumped through the world's hardest EQ hoops successfully.  The real accomplishment of EQ is having fun.</div></div><hr />
