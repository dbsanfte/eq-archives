<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Based on the current information about focus items, what would you consider your favourite focus effect?<br />
<br />
Some facts.<br />
- Affliction effects no longer affect slows, debuffs and roots.<br />
- No damage increasing focus effects affect right click item effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Extended enhancement (still gutted they took it off the shadel bandit ring).  Anything that means I have to buff less often is good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well i do not have access to all the effects, in fact the only one i have is Affliction Efficiency 3 on my Talisman of Evasion.<br />
<br />
However, i can without much hesitation say that Affliction haste would be my number one favorite if i could only have one. Cast times are extremely important in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">None really. Nothing to look forward for shamans since Slow/Malo is no longer affected by affliction. I raid a lot and from my view:<br />
<br />
Affliction: Yes, I cast many many dots. I think I haven't memmed a DoT since our last THO fight  2 months ago.<br />
Enhancement: Doesn't work with Torpor, no thanks.<br />
Spell Haste: Only decent one for shamans, then again clerics/druids benefit more from it. Oh and some high end items got this that are mostly useful for melee (Hand of the Master).<br />
Reanimation/Summon: Very usefull, I can summon food ultra fast now and ultra efficient!<br />
Reagent conservation: /yawn.<br />
Mana conservation: Yes manapool is a huge issue for shamans ... NOT.<br />
Damage: Let me whip out my ultra powerful 1/2 Ice Comet spell that is resisted in a large number of endgame encounters.<br />
Healing: Whoopeee Dooo, my Chloroblast is already about 0.05% of the damage a high end mob puts out in melee in one round, with this, it will be uber and move to 0.051%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spell Haste for sure, followed by Affliction Haste/Efficiency.<br />
<br />
Faster Cast times mean less chances for interrupt.  Mana Preservation is nice and all, but my mana pool/regen is rarely, if ever, a problem.  Affliction efficiency is a nice one since it's a relatively large savings of mana per cast and IMO would be useful in a lot more situations than affliction extension.  How often do you really need your slow ass dots to last longer anyway? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am with Zorlac on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Sciek. Most useful is spell haste. I value mana conservation high too because I'm not level 60 yet. I'm sure that will change...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">agreed...spell haste only one that helps me as a JBB equipped Shammy when soloing.<br />
<br />
When root breaks I can get it back  on faster and take less hits from those pesky mature wyverns in Skyfire.<br />
<br />
One extra poison dot tick and 4 extra disease dot ticks can be equalled by 1-2 JBB's so hardly exciting.<br />
<br />
Mana efficiency is nice i guess but with Canni its only useful if you want to take a carpal tunnel break from clicking your canni macro button.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree Zorlac<br />
<br />
Mez not even bother to check my equipment yet.<br />
<br />
If I have / get some focus items den fine.  Mez will<br />
even evaluate them when making equipment choices.<br />
<br />
Gerka not ganna spend a lot of time chasing this <br />
down thow.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even w/ canni, saving abit of mana w/ mana conservation is always helpfull.  Granted, canni is quite powerfull, and our overall mana regen is very nice, but it always helps to save those extra HP's for when you might really need em, and use less mana now.<br />
<br />
When im trying to slow/heal, and have been at under 400HPs for the last 30 minutes, you know i would like to save a bit of mana :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Amulet of Insight has Enhancement Extension 3 and is very easy to get. A 60 shaman and any 60 melee can do it, if the mob is up. It's a nice replacement for those that got screwed on shadel bandit ring change. <br />
<br />
Now if only they'd switch my Vyemm gloves back to Spell haste dammit. *** is this reanimation crap on Vyemm gloves for? They are all/all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">spell haste for me.  <br />
<br />
Just a taste of it the other night when affliction haste was effecting malo and turgurs and when I use regular mage focus naki ring has shown this is the one I like best so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Casting range increase is nice - can pull from further distances.  Mana conservation never hurt anyone.  Still bummed they took away the bandit ring - longer lasting buff would certainly be nice.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Spell Haste is kind of useful. But..We can AA that up with QuickBuff or use specific haste items (ie. affliction haste, mage focus rings) too. The focus item would only end up helping with non-core spells. It's really too bad that they've capped the spell haste this way, since we've created items that don't stack with our ability points.<br />
<br />
Honestly it would be just like giving melee classes a AA innate haste ability, but since they would hit the haste cap with their haste item/vog anyway it would become useless for them.<br />
<br />
Likewise for the extended enhancement, unless they fix it I don't care. It extends single target buffs I cast on myself, not group buffs I cast on others.<br />
<br />
Extended Affliction seems like it would be nice for soloing, but that's really all I think it's gonna be good for if it doesn't extend *debuff* type spells. Dots just don't stick for crap on most level 65 mobs, and that's just how it is. <br />
<br />
The healing enhancement could be mildly useful, but 30%+nothing is still nothing.<br />
<br />
Anyone know if they're going to retune/rework any of this for the next patch, or is this it?<br />

ps. yah Jing, Onyx chain is now officially necromancer gear, didn't you get the memo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its hard to say. I dont have one useful focus item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i think extended enchentment work best for normal exp'ing ppl like me.<br />
haste or regen are buffs that you have to reapply often and have obvious impact on fight.longer duration surely helps alot.<br />
<br />
mana preservation is also very good.needless to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">All I can tell you is...not Enhancement Haste.<br />
<br />
WHEN will that **** stack with quickbuff?  As is, it's pointless to have a skill of quickbuff1 or 2 if you have an enhancement haste3 item (and they're not rare)...it (qb1/qb2) will do absolutely nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh, I got enhancement haste on my Yunnb's earring...so now I'm really torn about the whole Quickbuff AA skill.  Don't get me wrong, I'm already loving the earring and my 18 second group focus spell, but it will be a LOT of points to get a 3.0 torpor without many incremental improvements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh, and I think the amulet of insight is mismarked, that effect is very good for such a goofy little item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My favorite effect?<br />
<br />
Any I can use on gear I would use--or even better, on gear I actually OWN would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Extended enhancement.  It's made PLing my druid 15% less tedious.  Yay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Have to say mana-preservation. I know I know.. Im a shaman.. I dont have problems with mana.. well..<br />
<br />
Now I have less. And sadly the obulus shroud was better then my previous shoulder item.. Im not very uber =p</div></div><hr />
