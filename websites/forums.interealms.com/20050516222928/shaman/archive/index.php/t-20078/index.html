<br />
as part of my studies at the University of Salford, I am studying the growth of online gaming. As part of the research for this project I'm conducting research on the players of the games. I've created an online survey at the following URL http://mmogsurvey.com, if some of you could complete the survey - it would be much appreciated :) The survey contains the results of all those who have voted, so I hope it will prove interesting to you.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time<br />

<br />
Good luck with this survey! If you need me to fill out another quick form, let me know and I'll be happy to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daefaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I deliberately made the survey as quick an easy to finish as possible, and hopefully fairly interesting :)<br />

<br />
I agree totally, the problem I am finding when searching for sites to post about the survey on is that EQ definetely seems to have a more defined network of online communities (some of this is perhaps down to my greater experience of EQ, and where to look)<br />
<br />
For example EQ has the following online communities<br />
<br />
1) Class Sites (such as this)<br />
2) Server sites<br />
3) Guild Sites<br />
4) Speciality sites - EQ Women, Norraths Studio etc<br />
<br />
The problem seems to be locating this type of site for the other games, it exists within DAoC and to a much lesser extent AO. However for some of the less highly subscribed games I'm finding a *lot* less in the way of community sites, I am trying to rectify this however it seems to be a bit of a problem<br />
<br />
Hope that explains why the skew is there :)<br />
