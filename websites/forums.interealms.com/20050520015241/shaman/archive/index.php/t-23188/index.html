<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was looking at the new stuff on lucy and found these. 3 ranks of a group heal/endurance regen. The final one is 400hp per tick for 5 ticks.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid I (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5933&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid II (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5934&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5935&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
The name fits and what it does also fits. On top of that they also have new bst, cleric and druid AA group heals on there so that really only leaves us. Looks pretty good to me and something that I would get right away.<br />
<br />
Also these:<br />
<br />
Boon of the Ancients I (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6030&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Boon of the Ancients II (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6031&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Boon of the Ancients III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6032&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
More swarm pets with a longer duration.<br />
<br />
On top of that I also found this Call of the Wild  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5880&amp;source=Test) which seems to be an AA rez or summon to corpse ability that doesn't have a cleric sound to the name, but could be for Druid or Shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some others are for shaman, but those were the only ones that really stood out as being for us. Hope all this wasn't posted before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Boon of the ancients has the following effect: Summon Pets: WARDShamanPet8 x 1 for 300 sec, which sounds like one of those healing wards, but a more advanced version.<br />
<br />
The AA abilities as listed on Lucy are arranged more of less by class and Call of the Wild is slap bang in the middle of what appear to be druid AA abilities. If it is a rez or summons, it will likely be a druid ability. Maybe a rez on a long timer for those &quot;oh ****&quot; situations where your cleric bites it deep in occupied territory.</div></div><hr />
