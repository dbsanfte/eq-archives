<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turriffic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After playing a wizzy to 53, I then played a kitty shaman to 55.  While I have decided that the shaman class is definitely for me, I am unhappy with how my kitty shaman is turning out.  I have acquired some OK equipment so far, but his HP pool is far too low for the coming levels.  He has only 1200 HP unbuffed with equipment on.  He will be hurting when I get to the Torpor/Canni5 stages, so I am going to start again as an Ogre.  I have a 2nd account to help with PLing up my new shaman (duo box) so I don't expect levelling to take too long.<br />
<br />
My question for the experts is...<br />
<br />
How to I spend my starting points?<br />
<br />
Here are the starting stats for an Ogre Shaman BEFORE bonus points:<br />
<br />
STR=130 | STA=127 | AGI=70 | DEX=70 | WIS=77 | INT=60 | CHA=42<br />
<br />
I get 30 bonus points to spend...<br />
<br />
My initial inclination is to go +13 to WIS and +17 to STA bringing the WIS to 90 and the STA to 144<br />
<br />
Recommendations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't reroll.  The only reason that ogres have more HP than vah shir is because they have a higher starting stamina.  Your stamina is very easy to max out once you start getting decent gear.<br />
<br />
If you would rather play an ogre than a vah shir, then by all means reroll, but I don't think its worth redoing 55 levels.<br />
<br />
If you do make an ogre, you're going to want to put most of your points in to wis, since your stamina is already so high.<br />
<br />
edit:  there is a severe AC penalty for having under 75 agi, so put 5 there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slowar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would have to agree with not rerolling.  You will be amazed at how quickly your stats will go up as you get some higher end raid drops.  Just stick w/the cat, join a good guild, get some AAs, and you'll be good.  Personally though I would commit suiside before I would play a character that resembles the fuzzball who runs around my house :d</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree with the others<br />
<br />
No need to reroll. Just slowly (or not so slowly depending on luck/friends, etc) upgrade your gear. There's a lot of good gear for decent prices these days. No need to start over. Just keep an eye out for deals if you have to buy gear or get friends to go camp loot spots with you. In a few levels, go camp CT and get some of the drops there. Many will be nice to wear or sell. If you join a guild, you'll get upgrades through raiding as well. Better gear will come. It may take a little while, but it'll come eventually if you keep at it. Good Luck! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ogre's don't get more HP than other races because they are *Ogres*.<br />
Ogre's start out the game with more HP because they have slightly more Stamina than other races.<br />
If your cat gets the same stamina as an ogre character, then you will have the same HPs.<br />
<br />
The reason your HPs are so low is because you need more +HP and +Sta gear.  Post a magelo account and let's see what you are wearring so we can tell you what gear to get rid of and what stuff you want to wear instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">really compared to all the RPGs I've ever played, starting stats and race really have such a trivial effect in everquest, I wouldn't say the difference is much more than looks. Yes, ogres have frontal stun immunity, and iksars and trolls get regen, but other than that, the only thing that really characterizes how good a shaman is, is the level of completion of the spellbook, and equipment. Race isn't a factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">59 barbarian shaman here - I recently got Infusion of Spirit, and since then have been able to max my stamina self buffed. With IoS/Kraggs/Riotous Health I have around 2500 self buffed HP.<br />
<br />
If that's your main problem with being a kitty, I wouldn't reroll. Of course, it took me nearly 3 years to get this far, and you're obviously a quicker leveller than me. :)<br />
<br />
I would instead suggest looking into getting better HP gear.  1200 unbuffed is a bit low, but you can build that up a lot with the cash you can farm in the time it would take you to level up back to 30, let alone 55. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another vote here with stick with your current toon.  ugh, I cant imagine doing 55 levels over, even if it was relatively quickly.  When you shop in the bazaar, search on gear with hp and sta, there are some pretty amazing items out there that will get your hp up in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is piling on, but everyone else is right.<br />
<br />
This is no reason to reroll.  <br />
<br />
It's just a matter of rearranging gear a bit.  <br />
<br />
Of course, vah shir shaman look really lame to me, and they all look exactly the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The previous posts are correct, I play a kitty Shaman, he's 51, and I have more hp unbuffed then that...  Look at your gear most likely need to get more hp or STA gear, there is a lot in the bazaar farely cheap...<br />
<br />
Don't do what I did in the earlier levels, I looked more like a Druid then a Shaman, but have changed that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kalaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One thing that I did was to sit down with the &quot;fast search&quot; feature at everquest.allakhazam.com, then did slot-by-slot searches with HP/STA ranked as the most important stats.  I then scan down quickly, eliminating anything that's elemental plane/ToV/Ssra/VT loot.  You'll be surprised at some of the items that filter to the top of the list that are very reasonably priced upgrades.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">went from just over 1000hp to over 1300hp in one level and getting a new item for face, back, bracer, neck, and fingers. I didn't spend over 3kpp with this upgrade. I also ended up with a higher wis. I was aiming for more AC. I am now saving for a tae ew bp.<br />
<br />
I saved up this cash in less than 1 level in both solb and dulak.<br />
<br />
I figure I should have saved up about enough for the tunic by 51 (the price has dropped insane, went from 20k to 8k now), and I might trade in for the shield too.<br />
<br />
but anyway, there is no reason to re-roll, just go to the bazaar and make smart purchases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bazaar has made upgrading equipment easy and fun!  I spent a few weeks 'listening' to the auction channel and visiting the bazaar.  When I saw some good gear for sale at a low price I negotiatied with the owner until I could buy it for even lower, and then sold my old gear for more than it was worth to the first frog/kitty twink that came by.<br />
<br />
I repeated this process until I had a tae ew bp (8k), SS sleeves + gloves, rings, earrings, ect. to build up my Hp's.  A few hit points here, a few unbuffed STA points there, and suddenly I'm packing more HP's and AC than most rangers I meet, and my unbuffed wis is still somewhere around 212.<br />
<br />
Bragging? Hell ya, but it can happen for you.  Stats are meaningless in regards to the overall growth of your shaman.  By the time you get to 55 you're really beginning to become an asset to any raid or group you choose to join, and the loots will follow.<br />
<br />
My best upgrade was a nice pair of chain pants from SSra that I got totally by surprise on a quick raid that took a whopping 2 hours on a weeknight. It can happen to you.  Don't give up</div></div><hr />

Don't reroll, it's all about the gear. I have 1411 unbuffed HP's as an Iksar  at lvl 50 (lowest sta of all shaman races) and I put zero (that's right zero) starting points into stamina (No I'm not twinked either, take a look at my gear and you'll see I'm not). Take a look at your gear and focus more toward HP's and AC. Post a magelo and we can offer some suggestions as to gear selection. Even if you were to reroll an Ogre and have the wrong type of gear on your HP's will still fall behind.<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Tunic 8K ? WOW its 17K on average on Inny server. Us broke soloists have a hard time comin up with 17K, I'm still saving for a Lizard ! <br />
So anyone willing to contribute to the Storm Drogmor fund, look me up on Innoruuk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">An ogre starts with 47 more STA than a Vah Shir, by default. At level 55, that translates to 129 HP. Not worth re-rolling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sta is so easy to max at high levels, not worth starting over for.  I was considered &quot;lucky&quot; for putting a lot of points into Sta at the beginning, and not much into wis.  Too bad, now my sta is way over the cap with buffs, while I still have 30 wis &quot;room&quot;.  You get 95 points sta buffs at 57, so if you can get your equipped sta to 160 you would be maxed anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Kitty shamans are grrrreat!  They got innate safe fall (you won't appreciate this until you don't have it), innate SNEAK ability (so many kewl uses), and they got ZERO exp penalty!  Ogres have 15% penalty, so it would take you 15% more exp to get an ogre to 55. <br />
<br />
Honestly, post a magelo and we'll take a crack at it.  It's likely that you have next to ZERO +hp items and THAT is your problem.  <br />
<br />
I think with 1200 unbuffed hps, . . . well I know at lvl 60 as a barbarian I had 1206 hps naked.  That's maybe 100 hps more than I woulda had at 55 naked.  So at your level I woulda had 1100 hps naked, without any gear on.  This tells me that you have not chosen wisely young grasshoppa.  And that you're about to make another poor decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">show us the magelo of the shaman, there is alot you can do with just a few slots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">you should reroll ogre... you don't deserve to be a kitty!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Keep the cat. I can't think of any advantage to leveling up another shaman to 55+ just because your only 100 hps lower than you think you should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just hit 1410 hp last night unbuffed.<br />
<br />
got chains of the accursed and it pushed me over the top :)  another 3 levels and I will be over 900ac. tae ew is dropping in price. last night I saw someone selling two tunics for 8k<br />
<br />
will probably drop down to about 6k before it levels out. hoping I can save that much in 3 levels...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Add another for not rerolling , your just about to hit your power levels , where all the hard work and buffing others and whatever all pay off. stick with it till 60, trust me , even before that you will be able to start soloing areas that can turn in some very nice cash returns , which ofcourse will buy you upgrades.<br />
<br />
55 levels all over again is not worth it if its only cause you have not enough HP. I didnt either as i was aproaching CanV. But it all worked out and now im just dandy. You dont even need to raid if you dont want , just keep working and it will come.<br />
<br />
Trust us ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">don't re-roll.<br />

gear &gt; race   trust me. it's not worth the time imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you are worried about stuns, RP and looks, then re-roll to an ogre. <br />

If all you are worried about is stamina and HP, don't bother. Gear will do it and in case you forgot, we happen to be the best stat buffers in the game ;)</div></div><hr />
