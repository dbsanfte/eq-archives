Sorry I couldn't answer you in game.  My printed notes are ancient.<br />
<br />
Here's the reference page and the information you were asking about: (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm#olda) <br />
<br />
Vampiric Spirit -  Griffon Feathers, Feverfew (trivial 116) HpToMana (-180 HP, +60 mana) <br />
<br />
Wrackbane -  Mammoth Meat, Woundwart (trivial 115-127) ManaToHp (+54 HP, -? mana) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Those potions arent worth it, they cost about 50pp to make, + a drop, and only do similar amounts to Canni4. 500pp for 10 casts of it is horrid. might even be more</div></div><hr />

First of all, I didn't post this for you.  It was clearly marked for Gloriana's attention. :)  She specifically asked me about one of these in game, but I couldn't find it in my printed notes, so I posted here a few hours later, knowing she views the boards regularly (daily now at a minimum as a moderator).<br />
<br />
Second, there are changes happening to Alchemy on Test right now.  They seem to be finally acting on their promise multiple FanFaire's ago to remove negative attributes to our potions.<br />
<br />
Who knows... If these two potions had their negative stats eliminated (pure speculation, with nothing to support that), they'd be hot sellers, trying to fill a replacement spot for the old mod rods, but with a hefty price tag.   Even if they don't, with PoP encounters geared to short durations and high mana usage, these potions may sell more to situational encounters for rich players even with the downside to HP or mana conversion.  <br />
<br />
Can you imagine a cleric chugging a 10 dose Vampiric Spirit potion for a quick 600 mana?  1800hp is quick to fix (by a shaman even w/ Kragg's mending or Torpor) and can extend the CH rotation another round or two.  Could also be useful for that Aego buffed wizard to eek out that last powerful nuke to down the mob boss.  (Who cares if it leaves the wizzy w/ 200hp.  If you win, you win.  If you didn't have that extra damage, you might have wiped.)  Etcetera.<br />
<br />
For everyday use?  No.  For the trials where you need that little extra boost to win out during a tough wave?  Possibly.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry Frekkels. I did not mean to offend.<br />
<br />
I dont think the negative to hp or mana will be removed though, the effect is called HPtoMana. I'm not saying these potions are useless, no potion is useless.<br />
<br />
I'll shut up now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I started making these about 4 days ago :)  I've made a profit off them so far, sell them for 400pp a 10 Dose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shanelle Heartogold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/nod<br />
<br />
My hubby's a cleric... and he DEARLY loves Vampiric Spirit.  He's very envious of my ability to canna for mana while he has to sit on it and rotate.  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I stand corrected</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmmm - I would think a open post anywhere on this board is open to comment.     EMAIL directly to someone if it's purely private information.   <br />
<br />
That being said ... external to :) or :( ... the current attention off Lucy to Alchemy is very exciting to me.     So much so that I spend 5K working mine up for gate and stinging wort's alone this past weekend.   Hopefully somone is truly working on Alchemy instead of just messing around.    <br />
<br />
As to Vampiric Spirit ... with all the changes to Mod Rods ... using this potion along with a Torporing (or better) Shaman in group is almost a replacement for GodRod's.   Much more work and costs ... but at the level that a raid would be trying this ... cost is pretty much out the window.<br />
<br />
Lastly ... it was great fun skilling up from 56 till around 115 ... after that it got slow on the skillups.    150 plus was painful ... post 180 has got to be madding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here's a trick for all those doing Shar Vahl alchemy.<br />
<br />
There are two vendors selling herbs in the building near the bank. The one that stands at the counter is indifferent and prices are expensive. The other vendor is usually on the left of the counter and will not sell in this position. When she moves to the back of the room, you can buy her stuff and the prices are much better. I believe the feverfew from her is in the 20-30pp range. <br />
<br />
Griffon feathers are pretty easy to get either farming or paying 8pp to vendors in North Karana or Jagged Pine.</div></div><hr />
