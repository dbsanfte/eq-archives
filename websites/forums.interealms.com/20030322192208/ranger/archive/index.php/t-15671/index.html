<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have no info on them except they r red on track :p<br />
<br />
which mobs are they comparable to ? i'm guessing harder than vindi, doomshade, rumblecrush, right ?<br />
<br />
if anyone like to share infos you're welcome ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinolen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I understand they're more difficult than AoW.  Unslowable, hit for 1400 or so, flurry, rampage, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dlaritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think AoW on steroids with adds (yard trash assists)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kiyrwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They all have quite low hp, ocean lord was not too hard he quads for 1481 i think unslowable but not as bad as AoW i at least had the impression, Rampage also.<br />
Also calls some mobs for help but yes definitly harder than Doomshade and the like. :)<br />
Desert lord just owned us lol he is the same basically but also has an unresistable 1500 DD stun which kills tank aggro.<br />
Forest lord somewhere in the middle i hear.<br />
But you don't have to kill them just for BoT access i think, every camp has 2 easier named that are doable by 3 groups no problem i would guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">seems strange, should make lords drops kick ass for the effort, guild who regulary owns aow can 2 tpw's but lower healing than would use on aow.<br />
Minis are easy and realistically no reason lords should be harder though have heard they can drop 65 runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AoW+ for the lords.</div></div><hr />

More like 1 solid group, or 7 or 8 random people :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They hit very very hard but have low HP. Think AoW damage with Sont tactics.<br />
<br />
DPS = your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok just tried.<br />
ouchie.<br />
<br />
1481 max with rampage and 1500dd proc.<br />
i got a min hit of 394! ranja mitigation &gt; all ;)<br />
<br />
really... the quad rampage is evil...<br />
<br />
see ya in a few months, Mr Lords</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You tried the wrong lord=P Go for forest. Desert boss and that stupid unresistable 1500dd proc sucks. For smaller raids anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When we were farming before they made the quest easy we would do the forest and desert bosses with 30 people with ease.  They really arent that tough though.  If you just want flags its easier to just do the 6 hour spawns  since you can 1-2 group them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">does PoP rampage works like Luclin's ?<br />
i mean, can we setup archers on rampage list to avoid the non-ank melees to get squished ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwadwog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did Forest and Sea Lords yesterday.<br />
<br />
As mentioned previously DPS is your friend in these fights. I love this type of fight where our DPS is thrown out the window with some whach mob getting pinned in a corner. Archery eats these guys alive.<br />
<br />
We never had a problem with adds for either of them. Especially since you have to kill all the surrounding giants to target him anyway.<br />
<br />
BUT on the sea side: Sheesh, it seemed that every friggin flower or tree or whatnot aggroed on us while we were set up at that camp killing the minis.<br />
<br />
Theory was peeps on horses or manasong, but getting rid of either didn't seem to change the situation at all.<br />
<br />
ciao tutti</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Underbrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Did a bunch of minis last night, couldn't get enough people together with the holidays to do the lords. Managed to get 6 minis last night. Even picked up a beard and sash to complete my quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sorronn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Think AOW+ in terms of damage output. Make sure your have the healers for the MT. Make sure your people control aggro.<br />
<br />
If you can control aggro and keep the MT alive, a good guild's DPS can take them down.<br />
<br />
And no, that 1500 DD is not fun. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Utaldain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">BUT on the sea side: Sheesh, it seemed that every friggin flower or tree or whatnot aggroed on us while we were set up at that camp killing the minis.  <br />
<br />
That was due to people using autotarget instead of /assist.  I've done that camp for hours before and it only takes once for people to figure out they need to assist the tank and not just autotarget.  Well, it should only take once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Toshiden Satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Also make sure folks aren't in wolf form (not sure about other illusions). Wolf form will be kos to all that trash in the Sea area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye Desert boss is a super biotch with his proc.<br />
<br />
Jeplak is the easiest I've found, the adds he calls are kind of annoying though. I think we mezzed em, cant remember for sure tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rhone Darkarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">More like 1 solid group, or 7 or 8 random people <br />
<br />
umm, no, and no.  not since they were made unslowable anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">He was referring to the mini-bosses.<br />
<br />
I think you could probably do them with 6....a very good group...a group that probably doesn't still need to be flagged..;-)<br />
<br />
Gryfalia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Akelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wolf form KoS to the trees in the forest lord's area too.<br />
<br />
BTW, he hits for 1484 on mid-level equipped rangers, and doubles on most rounds.  Not too high AC, I was hitting him quite well with the bow, but when he decided he had pretty much stomped the other 20 or so of us into the ground, he got annoyed with me... 4500hp raid buffed at this point did not exactly tire him out as he made little ranger pancakes...<br />
<br />
On the bright side, the CR in PoS near the forest giant fort is a run back, easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">wolf form drops your effective faction by 2 or 3 faction levels.  And since most people are dubious to the regular enhabitents (trees, bears, scorpions, cactus, regular frogs, and all the lost/stranded travelers), wolf form makes pretty much everyone kos to pretty much everything.<br />
<br />
Frog form has the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Doon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tried him last night well i aint the uber'st ranger but i had 4400+ hp over 1200 AC, we wiped 1st try he hit me for 1481 1481 proced a 1500 DD on me, that was one round from the lord mob, and it lasted all of 2 seconds. This guy hits like a freakin truck and backs up over u to finish the job, o and dont forget he rampages. He makes the AOW offensive look like a orc war with a rusty sword. we decided to return another day when we had more tankage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wolf form faction adjustment is utterly BS but anyway.<br />
<br />
Lords = rough. Nuff said. I'd rather do AOW.<br />
<br />
Mini's by and large are 1-3 groups. i've also helped two druids with charmed frogs kill one of the forst mini's before. But they were nuts and lucky on charm that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mirklin Darklander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Guys, AoW QUADS, the only one even close to AoW damage output is the Desert one because of the proc.<br />
<br />
We did the lord in desert the other night with like 24ish people and only 2 clerics.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>KaabaCloudberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">We needed a full size raid (6 or so groups) to take them out and even then we had problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">We did a raid on these not long ago.  We had about 40-50 people.  We had TONS of clerics and plenty of dps.  We took the first lord easy, but the REAL lord is insane.  Mana wasn't even a problem, that's all I have to say.   1498, 1654, 1234, DEAD.   Hits hard and fast and mana isn't a problem, it's just having MT survive first half a second.  The first round of hits alone could quite possibly kill your MT, even if it's slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yeah the lords are nothing compared to aow. Only thing that is really trouble is the dd procs / whatnot they can toss out. We just have a cch rot running and the druids toss in their heals as well, or cancell if tank isn't low. His damage output isn't all that scary once you get past the fact that he does not quad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mirklin Darklander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The names can be done with a single group, the lords are probably 3-4 groups minimum if you know what you're doing (your results may  vary :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Someone said their tank was getting hit for like 1600 above...if he's getting hit for that, your tank isn't using defensive, and you may as well not bother trying if you aren't using defensive to tank a mob that hits like that...also, consider WS tanking him  until he is slowed if you're having a problem getting him slowed.</div></div><hr />
