<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Never been to ToV  ... East, West, &amp; North.<br />
<br />
I know to stay out of North (for now).<br />
<br />
Anyone have any instructions or help pages for the zone?  Is the West considered HoT?  Anyway, guild is having a raid there and was just looking for some reading materal if anyone knew of where any were.<br />
<br />
Most of the guild is CoV+<br />
<br />
Just looking for some help.  I am level 55 so I know that most likly I will not be slowing, maybe assisting at best.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go to www.google.com<br />
type in &quot;temple of veeshan&quot;<br />
<br />
actually, you can just click here!<br />
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=temple+of+veeshan<br />
<br />
theres lots of basic guides, with basic info - plenty of reading material.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HoT is the east wing, and if you are +CoV then that is where you should hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">West wing is all CoV faction mob, kill them for kael quest amour<br />
East wing also call HoT, KOS to everyone, kill mob here drop amour for SS quest amour<br />
North is also KOS to everyone, have chance drop amour for SS quest too, and lots name who drop for L33t<br />
<br />
there are 3 name at West wing, who drop l33t and also give out test(quest) with very good reward, the test require you hunt at east wing, that why east wing call Hall of Test(HoT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Two caveat about ToV, if you don't know EXACTLY how to pull KoS corpses, DON'T DO IT!  If the monk dies and you pull the corpse, you'll aggro the guardians outside and they'll come in and kill you, anyone KoS to CoV and any bards doing beneficial AoE or group songs for you.<br />
<br />
The second Caveat is NEVER, EVER open the door without asking first.  If the doors opens and anyone is on a hate list of a mob in HoT, the guardians will come in and kill EVERYONE on the hate list.  It's a GUARENTEED TPW (and watch out for other guilds sneaking in and opening the door to try to get you out of HoT).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">North is also KOS to everyone, have chance drop amour for SS quest too<br />
<br />
Actually, the CoV faction mobs in NToV have a chance to drop Kael armor.<br />
<br />
If you're on CoV faction, consider yourself lucky. It boggles the mind that when the armors first came out, people on Kael faction were letting us know how much the SS armor sucked. When you've got 200 more HP than the Kael shaman on the other side of the fence who is your equivalent, be glad you stuck with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looked at all the factions and all the armor quests.  The thing that decided that +CoV was the way to go was twofold.<br />
<br />
1) IMO Better armor.  Give up a couple AC here and there, but resists and stats beat the hell outta it (Still a little peeved about the BP clicky, but oh well)<br />
<br />
2) It was harder.  Not to say Kael is cake, but +CoV seemed like a challenge (some call it faction-sink) that made it worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Minor points<br />
Access to 2 cities instead of 1, being able to port into WL without a second thought of &quot;/ooc Anyone know if Woushi is up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Negative points....<br />
Trolls look like some sorta overweight superhero-type with the aqua-green form-fitting armor and that nice beer-gut.   The hotkey &quot;Worst Episode _Ever!!_&quot; seems to be lost on people though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1) IMO Better armor. Give up a couple AC here and there, but resists and stats beat the hell outta it (Still a little peeved about the BP clicky, but oh well)<br />
<br />
All Velious shaman bps (POG, Thurg quest, Kael, SS) share the same right click sta buff.<br />
<br />
As far as benefits to CoV factioned guilds, don't forget the nice Scout Charisa quests.  Get ready to hear, &quot;SCOUT CHARISA UP NO BAG&quot; in your guild channel a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you everyone... should be intersting...I have never been past cobolt scar as of yet, and I have owned the expansion since it came out.<br />
<br />
I am only level 55 and have concern wheather I will actually be effective there.  I will have a bunch of guild mates that are level 60 that are pretty much ready for it, but we don't have a level 60 Shaman yet..best currently in guild is level 58, and me following that.<br />
<br />
We do have alliances with other guilds that have shaman that are higher than me but not sure if any will be showing up.<br />
<br />
I heard about that door thing.... never open a door there...maybe they should have locked them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can fight the HoT mobs with the door closed.. if it's opened you instantly agro the hub mobs who then come to assist, therefore wait outside until it's declared safe.<br />
<br />
Just remember your cold/fire resist gear for the AE mobs.<br />
<br />
hehe have fun brek :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Completely forgot about resists ... I have read that they need to be unbuffed and above 100 in fire and cold....<br />
<br />
How hard and fast is that rule?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's a good idea, Brek.  If you have 100+ in resists before buffs, then you can get circle of seasons from a druid and bard resist song to get you above 200.  The bad news is that it will only help some.  Unless you are level 58-60 (and not all of your guild will be, I'm guessing) that AE will still hit a lot, and hurt.  Level &gt; Resist.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">stuff in there loves to AE.  In HoT there is a little cut out hole in the wall below the stairs past the door.  ALL AE's are LoS (Line of Sight)...therefore, 95% of the time, if the mob cannot see you (like blocked from a wall) its AE will not hit you. <br />
<br />
To get that 100 unbuffed stuff.  I suggest Blue Diamond gear (2 earrings, 2 bracers) and possibly those Velium Diamond Wedding rings (+8to all resists).  And if yer still a tad shy, Shard of Core (mage summoned) gives +15 i believe cold in range slot.  Naturally yer stats will go down, but that is what KEI or c2/GoB is for :)<br />
<br />
At level 55 as you stated, you will not be able to tugur's much of anything.  However, you should be able to land PoI's on **** if no other shamans are around (smart to ID before hand).<br />
<br />
Good Luck, its fun the first few times! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">HoT is now an accepted stop off in a player's route to uberness.  It's a time sink for a guild, whereby you must pharm armor for everyone.  Once that's done however, you're well enuf equipped to start harder challenges like the ST key dropping dragons and vindy/tormax/statue that can also drop ST keys. ST weapons make your DPS rise as a guild to the point where you might be able to gank Aaryonar and gain access to NToV.  After you manage this, Lord Vyemm is your next challenge, to prove that you deserve to be there you need to kill him.  Once you've managed all of this, pharm NTOV as much as you can to get excellent upgrades for the whole guild.  Head to Luclin on off days and research the AoW fight.  Kill CT whenever you can.  <br />
<br />
That's pretty much the path my guild has taken and I've been with them the entire way starting from HoT.  Oh while yer doing HoT you should also be doing Dozekar as much as possible, and HoT named drakes for symbols.  The Doze quests are excellent, and many items are better than NTOV quality.  It's a slow slow way to upgrade a guild, but at least some of you will get *nice* upgrades during the long boring HoT pharm.</div></div><hr />
