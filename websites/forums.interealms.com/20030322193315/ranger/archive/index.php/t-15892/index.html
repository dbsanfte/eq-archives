<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eldakka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I read somewhere, can't remember where unfortunately, that there has never been a soft AC cap.<br />
<br />
The gist of the article follows:<br />
<br />
Apparently (according to this article), any AC you have that is OVER the mobs atk is wasted. So if a mob has 1200atk, it makes no difference whether your ac is 1200 or 1400, it is effectively 1200. <br />
<br />
Before luclin, no mob had over about 1200 or so atk, hence anything more than 1200-1300ac was not noticeable. I'm not sure if luclin has mobs over this atk, but PoP definately does, therefore higher AC has again become useful. No idea what the highest PoP mob atk is tho.<br />
<br />
No idea on the accuracy of the above, just what i read somewhere heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thicket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Eldakka is right.  There is no soft ac cap.  Here is an articel posted on my guilds web page.<br />
<br />
 found a very good reading about the ultimate Question WHAT'S THE AC CAP? <br />
<br />
well the answer is that there is no such thing...all depends on the Encounter! well...here it goes  <br />
<br />
Damage in Everquest <br />
<br />
In EQ, Damage relies on a two component combat formula. The exact details of these is not hugely important so I will outline the important factors as they effect your EQ experience. <br />
<br />
The two components are the chance of a mob To Hit (commonly referred to as &quot;Avoidance&quot;) and the damage the mob does when it hits (commonly referred to as Mitigation). <br />
<br />
Mob chance To Hit <br />
<br />
We are now in the position where hundreds of analysed logs exist which examine various aspects of the game. But one over-riding conclusion can be made from any examination of these. No matter your Agility or AC or anything else, the same Class and Level character will be hit the *exact* same percentage of the time by the same mob. <br />
<br />
This is important. Because it basically makes discussion about AC very clear. Avoidance CANNOT be changed by a player (other than specific AA abilites mentioned below) as it is a fixed value based on the class you are playing, your level and the mob you're fight (its ATK/Level, whichever, or both, is irrelevant). <br />
<br />
One of the other conclusions you can make, by examining all the evidence, is that Monks have the best chance of a mob missing them. Block will avoid a hit exactly twice as much as Parry and the innate To Hit percentage before Block/Parry/Dodge/Riposte is lower anyway. This confirms what we will all have seen - in an XP group, high AC Monks destroy Warriors in terms of tanking abilities. <br />
<br />
Mob Damage <br />
<br />
The most interesting thing to come out of the various analyses which have been done is that mobs can only hit for 20 discrete values with their regular swings (we can ignore Bash/Kick, they are the same but with different values attached). Every single mob in the game will only ever hit you for one of 20 individual values. <br />
<br />
Those analysing this have also seen that the 20 values are a linear progression and can be expressed as a value multiplied by an integer between 1 and 20. This value is described as DAMAGE INTERVAL - or DI. <br />
<br />
The actual hit the mob connects for will be a formula which includes the above portion plus a DAMAGE BONUS (DB). We can express *all* possible mob hits, therefore, with the following equation :- <br />
<br />
Damage = DB + (DI * X) where X is an integer between 1 and 20. <br />
<br />
All mobs in the game have a specific DB and DI. This varies wildly, and provides some differentiation. <br />
<br />
There is a wild variation in this. And as I'll go on to discuss, the variation can make a big difference in the way the mob can be fought. <br />
<br />
Now, unlike To Hit, players *can* effect this. Why? Because the integer used in the formula (X) is determined by your Armour Class. In reality, it is only effected by *part* of your Armour Class - but we can ignore it in the interests of clarity. It *also* means that because there are only 20 possible values, once most of the values for this Integer (based on your AC) are grouped at the low or high end, raising or lowering your AC will stop having a noticeable effect *for that mob*. <br />
<br />
Other mobs will still show a difference based on your AC value but for a single mob, there is a Collar and Cap on the amount of reduction to the damage taken that your AC will offer. This is what leads to the ultra-common mis-conception that AC is &quot;capped&quot;. <br />
<br />
Conclusions so far <br />
<br />
1. You cannot effect your Avoidance. The mob will always hit you the same as anyone else of your Class and Level <br />
2. The mob can only hit for 20 values <br />
3. AC will reduce the damage taken when the mob hits you <br />
4. Below a certain level of AC, the damage taken will stop rising <br />
5. Above a certain level of AC, the damage taken will stop falling <br />
<br />
AA, Defensive and Stonestance <br />
<br />
Now, this is fairly straightforward. But today we have some additional skillsets which effect the way this basic formula operates and udnerstanding how this works will help with the way mobs are dealt with <br />
<br />
Combat Agility - this will effect the mobs To Hit. There isn't much more to say about this other than that it is the only player choice that can be made which will change the Avoidance between two players of the same class and level. <br />
<br />
Combat Stability - this will effect the Integer. It appears to work in the way AC does - it changes the distribution curve for the Integer. This means that Stability will not change the maximum hit a mob can land. It also means that for very high level &quot;uber&quot; mobs which are hitting &quot;over the top&quot; and your AC is not high enough to start mitigating, that Combat Stability is unlikely to be useful. In other words, Combat Stability can make a good AC a little better or make a nearly adequate AC into a good one. But it will *not* make a poor AC useful and it will not lower the damage taken when your AC is already excellent for the mob you are fighting. <br />
<br />
Defensive - Now, this is important. Defensive basically Divides the Integer by 2. This means that for most mobs - where the DI is about a tenth of the DB, the damage taken will be reduced by roughly one third. It also means that for mobs with a low DB and high DI, Defensive can make a much larger difference. *But* it also means that mobs with a high DB and low DI, the effect of Defensive can be very small. <br />
<br />
Stonestance - this is almonst identical to Defensive, except it divides the DI by 10 instead of 2 and only lasts for 10 seconds. What it means is that for mobs with a low DB and high DI, Monks can take virtually no damage while Stonestance is up. <br />
<br />
Here are a few examples :- <br />
<br />
Mob DB 200, DI 20 <br />
<br />
Minimum hit 220 <br />
Maximum hit 600 <br />
Minimum w/Defensive 210 <br />
Maximum w/Defensive 400 <br />
Minimum w/Stonestance 202 <br />
Maximum w/Stonestance 240 <br />
<br />
This is a pretty standard &quot;uber&quot; mob for melee damage. <br />
<br />
Mob DB 1, DI 40 <br />
<br />
Minimum hit 41 <br />
Maximum hit 801 <br />
Minimum w/Defensive 21 <br />
Maximum w/Defensive 401 <br />
Minimum w/Stonestance 5 <br />
Maximum w/Stonestance 81 <br />
<br />
This is a less usual mob - Innoruuk for example where drastic differences to damage can be made with Defensive or Stonestance. <br />
<br />
Mob DB 400, DI 10 <br />
<br />
Minimum hit 410 <br />
Maximum hit 600 <br />
Minimum w/Defensive 405 <br />
Maximum w/Defensive 500 <br />
Minimum w/Stonestance 401 <br />
Maximum w/Stonestance 420 <br />
<br />
So for this type of mob with a huge DB and little DI, the tanking skills are worth very little so a &quot;agro keeper&quot; like a Paladin or SK is as good an option as any other. <br />
<br />
so there you have it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is a softcap, straight from a developer's mouth:<br />
<br />
+Item AC is around 500 for a warrior, less for other classes. +Buff AC is around 400ish.<br />
<br />
After that it pretty much doesn't do anything.<br />
<br />
Furor will even confirm theres a softcap, and he has more item AC than probably anyone and I garuntee you he knows combat mechanics better than anyone.<br />
<br />
Let's not get into this stupid argument again. There's a softcap, it's been established by many people, and I had a developer confirm it for me during Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">devs said there's no hard cap.<br />
<br />
so a 2700 AC warrior will tank &lt;b&gt;better&lt;/b&gt; than a 1800ac warrior... &lt;b&gt;however&lt;/b&gt; he will not tank 50% better (1800+50% = 2700)<br />
maybe like 5-10% better /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Right, it's a softcap, diminishing returns as you stated. Yes a warrior with stupid ammounts of AC will tank slightly better. It's something like 1/10th effectiveness past a certain point, if not less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Softcaps and 'diminishing returns' are not the same.<br />
<br />
Of course 'serverwide' is misused with obnoxious frequency too and since even the allegedly 'brilliant' guildleaders are screwing up that one I hold little hope that any AC discussion will be meaningful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kether:<br />
<br />
There is definitely a point at which AC stops yielding any returns, and that is the soft cap.  It's just a bit higher than anyone previously believed.  The current &quot;soft caps&quot; are the point at which AC ceases to yield a meaningful effect when compared to the ability to upgrade it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">rangers only need atk anyways imo! bring on the vengeance items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh well, from personal experience, tanking Yelinak for about 40 minutes under a rotation, that little paper provided by Thicket holds some water.  It does however, have one glaring mistake.<br />
<br />
There are many different softcaps for a lot of stats, and of course they differ on a per-class basis.  From agility below 75, to wisdom/intelligence point/mana ratio at various softcaps (200 wis/int, 255 wis/int etc), you WILL find diminishing returns in just about every stat in Everquest.  Even some stats like +mana and damage below a certain level have or at least HAD at one point, hardcaps.  Both exist, both are well documented.  This is to make certain that certain classes are going to be better at things than others, that no caster will ever tank like a warrior, that no uberclass will emerge.  There are class lines that we can continue to try to cross by pumping stats to ridiculous levels, but to no avail unless GROSSLY over pumping a stat.<br />
<br />
AC has a softcap for many different classes.  +500 item ac is around if not THE softcap for warriors.  For other classes, that number reduces proportionately.  From my own parsings, it seems we benefit from around 350-400 item ac, and although the numbers were inconclusive (within the margin of error) over 350, there were some static gains.  After that, (note: ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT ITEM AC LATER, thats the numbers added up on the armor, not the number in your stat box) nothing that I fought impacted the damage curve of the mob I was fighting.<br />
<br />
There have been some hypotheses on Steel Warrior about the impacts of ac in Planes of Power, but most have been shot to heck and back with logs.  YES there are only 20 integers a mob can hit you for.  YES the curve is affected by your ac to a point, reducing the modal damage of the mob hitting you as your ac reaches critical mass.  YES ac does help over that &quot;softcap&quot;, but at 1/10 to 1/20th of the value that it did under that point.  I also believe there is a hardcap on + ac items, though I haven't seen it personally, as my gear has plenty of ac, yet none of it does much of anything over my unbuffed &quot;1200&quot; ac stat, though it does SOMETHING (probably within the margin of error, around 5 percent).  I tank just as well at 1200 ac unbuffed as I do at 1400+(the mob's damage curve stayed the same, on Yelinak AND Bastion of thunder upper bosses (though admittedly I got killed removing some 500 hitpoints to plummet my ac down to 1200 unbuffed 3 minutes after when I began the test set with 1200 ish unbuffed when the mob enraged lol.  Oops.  Tanking without your breastplate and legs is bad when they add buku hps :P).  Also, during some parses of the effectiveness of 2handers versus 1handers, the same damage curve was evident after losing around 100 item ac between my weapon selections and my bow, the exact same modal number came up both times.  While the sample ac removed was smaller admittedly in the weapon parsings, the fact remains that the damage curve of the mobs hitting me (planes of power xp mobs to a velious boss, to a planes of power boss) remained the same after a somewhat sizable ac loss.<br />
<br />
Buffed ac is on a completely seperate table from my understanding, as buff ac most definately DOES drop the mobs modal damage substantially in large increments.  I have not seen any cap on spell ac yet, but I again, believe there is a solid defined cap on spell ac too, as there would have to be in order to achieve balance in the classes, the reason that the ac softcap on worn ac is there in the first place.<br />
<br />
This is why no enchanter will tank like a warrior, even with 6 thousand hitpoints and 1400 ac (which can and does happen already).  Granted when I punch eldritch rune after my arcane dies I feel like I'm cheating but hey, 10 aa in an evening is 10 aa :P  Praise be to bot enchanters and clerics.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, we tank a lot better than clerics do now, yay us :)  Whether that's intended or not, I don't know.  I'm certainly glad my cleric tanks better than my enchanter does though, and softcaps make it possible.<br />
<br />
If there was no softcap on ac, warriors and knights to some lesser degree, would have retired long LONG ago.  This is why they are much needed, sought after, and able tanks.  Without softcaps in place, the lines would be blurred far too much between the classes, and this is why they exist.<br />
<br />
I will continue to believe in and preach the softcap until the day comes that a mob's modal damage changes SIGNIFICANTLY between 1300 and 1700 unbuffed ac (which can happen to the priviledged warrior), and someone posts the log to prove it :)  I'm glad they exist too, because without them, the warrior class would fall over and die :)</div></div><hr />
