<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">According to Diamond Ochre, a Shaman trained in the Lakotah Tradition:<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaman (pronounced SHAH-maan) is a word from the language of the Tungus people of Siberia. It is a proper noun and does not denote sex. Both male and female would be called Shaman. Plural is Shamans, not Shamen.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
According to http://www.deoxy.org/shaman.htm, both males and females practicing shamanism are referred to as &quot;shaman&quot; with no altering of the form of address based on gender. Also, not once is the term &quot;shamen&quot; used, while &quot;shamans&quot; is used very frequently.<br />
<br />
Don't take my word for it, do your own research. I just wanted to help put a stop to the misconceptions, especially since some people actually correct others saying that &quot;shamen&quot; is the correct plural form...</div></div><hr />

It's all been done before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks for the info, im very interested to here other stories of RL shaman, so if you can ring them out of Mr. Ochre, by all means post them here.  Especially what types of practices he uses, etc.  Its always more fun to play a character when you can roleplay a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bahimirion, there's a post by you on the thread there, and I quote i in its entirety:<br />
<br />
&quot;Shamans, not shamen.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's buried about 2/3 down the thread, and contains no rationalization, and no indication whatsoever that the above is anything more than your personal, subjective opinion ;)<br />
<br />
It's generally easier for people to believe and accept information backed up by sources and/or research, hence I posted that - admittedly anal-retentive - info above.<br />
<br />
No offense meant, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Then you didn't read the whole post, did you? Unless apparently I am actually Merriam and/or Webster in real life and as such everything written in the most respected and popular dictionary in the country was in fact written by me and filled with my 'personal' and 'subjective' bias.<br />
<br />
No offense taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh.  Not only has it been done before, there's an active thread still on the front page:<br />

Doesn't anybody take the time to look through any posts before posting a new topic?  C'mon... the other thread wasn't even halfway down the page yet.</div></div><hr />
