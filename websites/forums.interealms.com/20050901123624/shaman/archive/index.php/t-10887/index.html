<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to ask how many other shaman are really into thier characters.  I started mine two years ago on a blue server and haven't looked back.  I had no twinking and loved leveling the class even if it was hard at times.  I really get satisfaction from playing and wonder if it is just me.  I have started out with many differant people on my server who now have alts that are level 60 plus.  Many people got bored with thier mains and decided to play something else.  I for one have never had the urge to really level something else, because I am still really enjoying the shaman.  There are things I want to do with him and look forward to doing.  I guess the big pay off is we mostly get our power post 60 with malo and torpor and I want to see the fruits of my labor.  I have yet to really twink anything and would like to know if other people find the shaman class as interesting.  I find it to be one of the most diverse classes and really love being one....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can also say that my Shaman is the only EQ character I play.  I started him in late March of last year and have been enjoying him ever since.  I've also gone un-twinked the whole time and really enjoy some of the harder times I've had with him as I look back on it.  Also, I probably should be lvl 60 by now but I've been spending too much time on tradeskills at the moment :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">im makign another shaman to pair with my GF .. thats how much.<br />
<br />
There is no other calss that can compare in my mind . NONE . Im still amzaing myself with the things i can solo. I have a few grips , but who doesnt  ? By far the best class int he game from ability and just imagination. The idea of being a shaman alone is cooler then other classes imho.<br />
<br />
<br />
again ... nothign better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Started mine in March 2000 as a total newb, no twinkage here either. I've played with a few low level alts but nothing keeps my interest like the shaman does. The game has worn me down a few times but I just take a break and when I come back it's usually more fun than it was before. One break was over a year off. The diversity is amazing for the class. I'd die of boredom with a melee class and couldn't stand bieng one of those pansy robed casters.<br />
<br />
At 61 I'm having more fun than I ever. I've barely scratched the surface of raiding high-end stuff and got plenty to look forward to killing/questing/tradeskilling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd created a gnome necro on Fennin Ro when the game first came out because I knew how powerful they'd be based on their spells.<br />
<br />
After reaching level 13, I was realizing how powerful the social aspect of the game was, and that I really really wanted to be able to help out others, and thus created Borgax, and never looked back since.<br />
<br />
I've never played any other char in nearly all these 4 years.  I am very happy to have found the class that fit my personality and was so much fun to play early on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My necro has not seen any play time since my shaman became able to slow my ranger's mobs.<br />
<br />
It's just sick how a shaman can act as a lever for other characters, multiplying their effectiveness.  I lock down mobs like an enchanter (slow is almost as good as mez), heal well enough for most exp spots, and can put out some damage if needed.  Overall, it might be my favorite class, or at least tied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yatta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My first character was a Wizard, which I got to 57 - I loved the class up to that point, but at the time the only real viable xp was quad kiting... which bored me to death after 4 straight lvls of it. Started a cleric, got it to 52 - and quit for a while.<br />
<br />
Came back, lvld up a necro on 7th to 61 - and FINALLY found THE class when I started Yatta.<br />
<br />
Shamans are the ultimate class. If you can get past the buff-whore aspect (which usually filters out most of the ****ty shamans) you're left with an incredibly versatile &amp; powerful class. Definitely my favorite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree that the shaman is a pretty rockin' class, but I find myself playing alts more recently, mostly due to the lack of places to solo at 61+.  It's this facet that is the most likely reason to give up the ghost on ol' Dross.  Sorry if this isn't proper content for the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nah beastlords are better than shamans for everything but healing themselves and other people.  <br />
Shaman is an outdated class, a relic of the past soon to be replaced with a shiny new froglock beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Perhaps if shamans were a tad bit more reasonable for healing, we'd be ok.  But as is, we pay far too stiff a price in that department for our slowing ability.  Which, I might add, is pimped out to Beastlords in a big big way.  65% slow is sufficiently slow for any reasonable purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman for nearly 3 years now and never would consider another main.<br />
<br />
Its about versatility, about doing what I want to do when the whim strikes me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My opinion? Best damn class. I enjoy playing other classes for variety but have been doing the Shaman thing two years now. I love gimping mobs, I love mobs pounding hte snot out of me when I gimp them, and I like the cheers when my cleric gets Dex cast on him. <br />
<br />
Okay, I hate healing, I hate hasting. Does anyone actually enjoy doing this as a Shaman? Blah.<br />
<br />
Please remember folks, I'm not even HoT-quality shaman. I have no Malo, no Torpor, no JBB, not even a goldanged Ikky BP. My Mana pool (HP included) is near-laughable, and I've never solo'd anything tougher than one of those stupid Ranger Gorangas in ME. Yet I love the class. Don't get me wrong. I think we could stand improvements, updates, and what the heck, a gimmick or two, but all in all, I wouldn't trade my Shaman for any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I picked up EQ from day one it release - March 16, 1999.  I played a paladin first, because I am still under the impression of old UO rule: tank mage are the best class in game.  WRONG! at least in EQ. After 2 months of playing paladin I got tired and started a shaman.  At the beginning the only reason for me to start shaman was becuase it's the only class that can Sow at level 9.  I love to explore the world, and after 2 months of playing I figured out in order to do exploring I must have sow.  <br />
<br />
But once after I started shaman, I'm hooked.  I tried numeous other classes, monk, wizard, druid, necro, cleric, ranger, warrior no one class can keep my attention away from my shaman for more than 2 weeks.  At low level I love shaman cause I can help people by buffing healing and sow, I can play as a caster as well as a melee.  After 34, I start to soloing with my pet almost everywhere in Norraoth.  Yeah I die alot during the proccess, but in the other hand almost every zone in norrath have my foot print on it.  And I encounted almost every spicy on the land of Norroath! Of course, I enjoy grouping too, and people love to have me in group, because I'm a shaman!<br />
<br />
Now I'm level 62. after 3 years of playing Shaman I still havn't get tire of it.  People say at high level shaman do nothing but slow and be a buff whore. Not really. There're always new things for me to try and new zones for me to explore.  Recently I just got the Spirit Call AA.  I LOVE to call my puppy army out whenever it avalible and watch them chew on the mob's back.  Then I spent my points into RC 1, when I cure my group in ToV for all kind of dot and slow, they cheer to me like I'm a hero!<br />
<br />
Bacially I will just say I love my shaman so much and I for one never regertted playing a shaman for 3 years.  Yes I know there're a lot of other classes in EQ that's fun to play.  But I think shaman represent me the best, and I love this class the most. <br />
:D</div></div><hr />

What finally sold me on shamans? They get sow at level 9, I thought it was the most amazing thing since sliced bread.<br />
<br />
I played him up to level 45, dumped him for a bard that I got to 30ish. Started up my shaman again, got him to 51 and dumped him for a BL. Dumped my BL at level 40, and started my shaman again, he is now 55, I will probibly be taking him into end game, mostly because the thought of getting another char through 45-55 makes me cringe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">been playing this character since aug 1999.  I have no desire to play anything else.  Sure we've gotten beaten pretty bad with the nerf stick, but I dont have any trouble getting groups, and do much more with duo/trio or 4 person groups anyway.  If you feel stuck with your class let me make a suggestion.  Forget the tank/clr/enc combo and make up an all caster group, or better make an all shaman group and go play around, youll be amazed at how awesome non-traditional groups are.  My favorite so far; shm/nec/clr/enc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I started a rogue first, back in November 1999 and quit him when I saw what a shaman could do.  Still love my shaman after 3 years (March 2000) and still my favorite character, although I love my rogue as well.  But I dont think Id love my rogue as much if I played him by himself, he's a lot more fun because of my shaman I think.  I have really enjoyed playing an enchanter though as well.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it all over, would probably try something new, just to change things up, the thought of going through the same class all over would probably make me quit for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm not overly impressed with the shaman class. It's a stagnant class with a very low &quot;wow&quot; factor. If it weren't for the fact that slow is so ridiculously uber there'd be no reason whatsoever to even consider the class. Although i've become fully aware that being the N'th shaman on a raid, where N is greater than 2, is dead boring because slowing doesn't stack. I'm also not convinced that my superior slow balances out the utility (CC,haste,mana regen) an enchanter brings.<br />
<br />
I'm only level 52 though. I'm hoping getting Kraggs at 58 will give me more power. Certainly in healing but also in mana regen so I can add some offensive grunt to an XP group. Certainly prior to that sort of level, and the tough mobs of PoP, I would rather have a chanter than a shaman in my party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Started my Shaman the first month my server was open, and<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I started on Innoruuk in summer of 99. Played a human druid to level 15. That was essentially my boot camp for EverQuest, my first character where I learned the basics of the game. Innoruuk wasnt a very stable server back then, so my brother and I packed up and moved to E'ci because it was one of the lower population servers at the time.<br />
<br />
First character on E'ci was a barbarian warrior. Played him to 8th level and spent a few of those levels hunting with a shaman. When that fellow hit 9th level I saw him cast spirit of wolf, and I knew how handy that spell was from playing the druid. I decided to play a shaman, gave all my patchwork armor I had made to my brother to hold, deleted the warrior, and created a shaman with the same name. I didnt know much about shamans then...just knew they could heal, had a lot of buffs, got spirit of wolf 5 levels sooner than druids, and could wear chain (unlike the flimsy druid). That was July of 99 and Rathelon has been my primary character since then. <br />
<br />
I have a 52 warrior and a 46 ranger also, and I've had a 30 monk plus tons of lower level newbies, but all of them were just distractions or utility characters. Havent found any class that I enjoy like my shaman, but I havent invested nearly as much time or effort in any other character either (not even the ranger who is 3 years old).<br />
<br />
I'll still make other characters to play, because I'm still curious about a lot of them. But I still have unfinished goals for Rathelon, so he'll be around for a while yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The mere idea that beastlords will replace shaman outright is ridiculous.  They are overpowered and never should have been introduced into the game at all, but they will not replace a shaman overall.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have to wait 65 levels for a decent slow, and then have to turn in a rune to have a chance at getting the spell at all.  If I wanted to be a gimped melee with overpowered abilities given to me because of Verant's insistance that people play the class, I would have chosen a beastlord.  As it is, I am more than happy with my 53 shaman, who can 75% slow starting at level 51, heal for 583, add regen for 15/tick, massively debuff, dot for 1k+, bind/gate, and buff the hell out of anyone.<br />
<br />
Wow, the sky isn't falling, and I'm having fun!  Too bad I'm about to be replaced, I wish Sony would have sent me a memo.  I had no idea my class was a relic that has absolutely no business being in the game.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">then have to turn in a rune to have a chance at getting the spell at all <br />
There are only two options for the rune rewards for beastlords and other hybrids.  50/50 shot at getting the slow spell, PLUS they only have to get a total of two runes to have a good shot at getting all 65 spells.  We have to get many many more..... for a power how much greater?  Or is it greater?  Seems to me that DPS is always needed while gimpy heals and replaceable debuffs won't be.  It irks me to no end when I log on for VT they are talking about how there are no shamans online for that this early, then the beastlord pipes up with a &quot;who needs shamans anyway?&quot;  <br />
Bah.  We're a finger's breadth from being replaced, and if these expansions keep setting our power backwards relative to other classes, my illusion will become your reality.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Xanden spake thus,<br />
<br />
<br />
As it is, I am more than happy with my 53 shaman, who can 75% slow starting at level 51, heal for 583, add regen for 15/tick, massively debuff, dot for 1k+, bind/gate, and buff the hell out of anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
reality check.<br />
<br />
You do not 75% slow at level 51. Slow is awesome of course. It is the thing that gets us groups, that makes VI consider our class over-powered, and the only real reason to play a shaman. <br />
<br />
Your massive debuff is highly resisted (malo line) or questionable value (cripple line). And way overkill in an XP group at that level.<br />
<br />
Our buffs end up translating to 410 HP (at best, this assumes melee character) and a bunch of stat buffs with marginal return.<br />
<br />
E-bolt is solid. Highly resisted, insane agro, and often doesn't run to completion given you have to slow first and watch agro. The damage it does is about equal to 20 seconds of a decent melee. In almost all cases your mana is better used slowing and hasting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kaarmekieli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't think that agro is a big problem for us nowadays that we have these rock solid agro holders called paladins.<br />
<br />
In normal exp session in BoT for example, after slowing, I normally stack Nife, Saryrn and equipped pet on mob. Those alone generate about 110 -130 dps, without fear that mob will jump on me. Add epic, SC pets and rain -&gt; DPS is close to 200, which is a lot compared to any PC dps imho. Can even toss Tnarg's or 2 if needed without mana problems.<br />
<br />
All this with equipment that you can get from HoT and max tier3 zones in pop...so nothing special.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah...I have played my &quot;leezard&quot; in small guild basically since i started EQ May 2000 and have never seriously or half seriously thought to play any other characters. <br />
<br />
Our &quot;greatness&quot; becomes visible in small encounters where we can &quot;save the day&quot; with our wide varity of abilities...buffs, CC, heal, damage, slow, pulling...Killing big highend mobs is naturally fun, but e.g. saving your exp group from sure death with your individual skills is more fun. These are those &quot;great moments&quot; in this game at least for me.</div></div><hr />

Got him to level 51 and he's still my first love.  I took a 4ish month break and had 6 RL friends and me decide to start up on the new vazaelle server.  I started an iksar with max wisdom (bleh).  I took him into the low 40's before I decided to switch to ac/hp gear and have never looked back.  Damn I wish I had started a max sta ogre shaman!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I kinda agree with Landragoran; lvl 65 shaman here with 100aa on TP server.<br />
We are really outdated, our ability still remain in old world, PoP just not for us.<br />
I still remember how sad I was when I turn in 2 spectral parchment (traded my band of visionary) and get 2 SAME aim of the Gindan about 2 months ago.<br />
our mastery &quot;debuff&quot; hasnt been update since, there is no new Cripple, there is no new or improved slow (lure, for example) to compare BST's lvl 65 spell (oh and btw their slow rarely get resisted even they dont have malo/malos)<br />
<br />
Shm is my main and will always be, I am too much into Barbarian shm I think; the tribunal: fairness and justice. I even made my Alchemy trophy today (yea what a sucker I am to get alchemy that high to 186), I buffed the raid like Verant want us to do...<br />
There were good there were bad memories, but sadly shaman is not in spotlight anymore; our own hybrid BST has bypass us too much ...<br />

As for thinking beastlords will replace shamans, sounds like mass hysteria_023 to me.<br />

If you ever get replaced by a beastlord in an exp group, and the exp group does better than when you were in it, then it's more of a personal issue than anything else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I started a barbarian shaman because I loved the way that barbs looked and I wanted to be able to melee and cast.  I have been twinked a little bit along the way but nothing outlandish.  It was all very appropriate for my level.  I love being able to do a little bit of everything in my group and having an important role in raids.  I haven't leveled as fast as I could have but I'm still having a blast.  And for those times when I get tired of the higher game, I created a shaman on a different server.  I won't be retiring to start a beastlord anytime too soon.</div></div><hr />
