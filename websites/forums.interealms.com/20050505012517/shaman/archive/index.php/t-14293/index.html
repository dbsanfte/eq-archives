<br />
If it's a pick-up raid, fully expect there to be petty bickering, arguing, and loot mongering.  It is your raid, and if you make it clear to everyone that this is mainly to get your tear for your epic, then how would that be greed?<br />
<br />
There might be a couple jerks who would accuse you of greed or whatnot, but who cares?<br />
<br />
The most important part to a successful raid, especially of Fear, is a good beginning.  In PoFear, this means a good break-in.  Some more experienced folks can give you tips about that, but if breaking in takes an hour, people are going to start wandering off, flooding raidsay with bitching, and generally losing interest.<br />
<br />
That's about the extent of my experience with Fear.  Good luck on the tear =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One method I've used for fear raids in the past, is to gather together 2 elite groups (what &quot;elite&quot; means is up to you!) and ask them to turn up an hour early.<br />
<br />
Trying to break the plane with 36 people can be more trouble than it's worth, unless you are very organised. So take in the 2 groups, made up of people you trust to know what they're doing, and just kill the roaming mobs near the zone in.<br />
<br />
You can either find a good enchanter to mezz the adds as they come to you, or the ghetto tactic is to give each group a porter, and when you're going to get overwhelmed with mobs, evac to the Feerott and start again. As long as you kill at least one mob per trip to the plane, you'll eventually clear the wnaderers. I think there are about 12 of them around the zone in area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are going to have a VERY hard time with the break-in.  Looking at your level, and assuming that 51+ means mostly &lt;60 you are going to have to be very patient, and very conservative.<br />
<br />
Grippa has the right idea, get your core peeps up there early and schedule enough time for a break-in wipe.  Have a good friend hang out and kill cyndi while organizing groups of those who arrive for the main raid.<br />
<br />
Raid-channel spam the plan for a west wall break-in so nobody wanders off and trains the rest of the raid.  This is often the end of a Fear raid.<br />
<br />
I'm sure things are easier now with better equipment, people with nice AA's, and the possibility of 60-65 level help, but don't get complacent.  Make some Kilva's potions for tanks, make a stack of insta-heal potions for everyone if you can afford it (at least keep some in your pocket).<br />
<br />
One thing I remember about fear is wierd resists for slow (it has been a while).  Make sure everyone, particularly in the break-in group is prepared to do whatever crowd control their class can contribute.  Bards and Necros come to mind as helpful and underappreciated help in this area.<br />
<br />
Good luck..took me 8 trips to Fear to finally get my <br />
Tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, the zone break is key.  Great idea to bring in 2 groups early.<br />
Go for levels, experience in the plane, and ability to work together for<br />
these groups.  Good idea to have at least 2 FD'ers, 1 evac'er per group,<br />
and overkill on crowd control.<br />
<br />
About defaulting the tear:  Just tell people that you're defaulting the<br />
FIRST tear to yourself (if you kill 2 demi's, 2 tears can drop), and that<br />
all other epics will done based on how far into their epic the player is.<br />
Ask people to bring proof.  Also, to avoid being called greedy, you could<br />
cover the cost of coffins, essence emeralds, and peridots (this is<br />
standard practice for raid leaders) and, when the costs of these<br />
reagents has been covered by loot you receive during the raid, offer<br />
to split the extra coin between any players who did not receive any<br />
drops during the raid.  Even if you don't have time to do this, or don't<br />
make enough money to break even, telling people this beforehand will<br />
go a long way towards squishing their whining.<br />
<br />
I dunno.  Just be assertive, tell people to keep raid channel clear, if<br />
you have guildies or close friends appoint one or two of them to keep<br />
people in line while you're giving instructions and whatnot.  And don't<br />
hesitate to TL people out if they're being a nuissance, training camp,<br />
breaking mezzes or what have you.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most important rule of fear breaking you have to stress: &quot;If invis drop, just Die where you are and get /loc (should have hotkey).&quot; Make sure you remind folks of that. Most fear break-ins go bad cause someone invis drops and they run around passing aggro while they run TO the camp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should you run the 2 groups invis to the west wall first and then start killing? Or is it ok to do this by the portal?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">NEVER break in at the portal.  You get too many adds from too many sides.  Just go to the WWall and you'll get plenty of mobs that will come to YOU.  <br />
<br />
Two things here.  Once the breakin has gone nicely, you might want a two-boxing cleric to log for awhile, while you get the rest of the raid situated.<br />
<br />
As far as the tear goes, I don't think this is greedy at all.  There's only a single piece of armor that drops for Shammy's off of yard trash, so I don't expect you'll get more than two Shammy's that are at the appropriate level in their epic, anyway.<br />
<br />
REMIND everyone that 1. aggro means stop and die and 2. If you sit in Fear, the mobs go out of their way to hit you (camping is impossible, anywhere near an aggro)<br />
<br />
Oh, and raise your paw if you remember when the raidleader said &quot;charge,&quot; you ran to the portal and Fear dropped like a n00b hitting &quot;a&quot; when he talked to his guildleader.    Ahhh, the &quot;good&quot; old days....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Run them to the wall and batten down the hatches.  Once invis drops, you'll start getting wanderers.  Lots of wanderers.<br />
<br />
If people haven't been there, be sure to warn them about the Scarelings - little imp things, that proc a shadow step bit on you.  They proc, you get ported out of camp.... if that happens, prepare to die instead of training the camp, if you have lots.<br />
<br />
Here's an old Fear guide a guildmate did - http://www.crimsontalon.com/pages/guides/fear.htm<br />
<br />
Feel free to browse &amp; see what can help.  It hasn't been updated in a year, so there are undoubtably new spells &amp; such that might modify what's there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can/should mounts be used in Fear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Absolutely, but make sure they're shrunk, as break-in usually gets pretty messy and it's hard to target everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The raid didnt go bad because of lack of anything, but when i went in to check it out it was being farmed, and they had just killed the golem for a tear MQ for an Alt *sigh*.  Not much of an issue, i have a new one!  And thanks for this new advice, ive been talking to fear veterans and every one of them said send around 2 65 groups to the west wall and begin to kill.  O yea, what exactly is the spawn time for fear mobs just so i know when they would be up, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I believe Fright and Terror are on a 72 hour spawn cycle, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Golems are on a 3 day spawn timer.<br />
<br />
Mobs are on a 12 hour spawn timer i believe, may be 18.<br />
<br />
Last time I hosted fear we had 6-7 groups, when making groups pick 2-3 groups as break in groups. These will be stronger than the others, they should have 3-5 enchanters and a few clerics. It's a good thing to have the MT in this group, and either a) go with them, or b) send someone in that knows what they are doing, is trustworthy, has been to fear before, and can type while under pressure.<br />
<br />
During the break in those 2-3 groups zone in first alone, they had west to the wall, be in communication with these groups. Quickly find out if many didn't make it, find out if the mobs in camp are quieted down ( mnezzed ). If the break in group is safe ( won't wipe on how many mobs are in camp ) figure out based on how many mobs are in their camp if the rest should zone in or not. if there is only a few mobs in camp and chanters have lots of mana, send the rest in to finish securing the camp. Otherwise let the break in team finish off the mobs and get ready for the mobs you will be bringing with you. After that start pulling ( use a pull group in fear, have pullers pull to group outside of camp. clr brd enc enc rng shm works well in pull if you have the clr / shm / enc to go around. <br />
<br />
We created a channel that the pull group MT and ST were in. Our ST pulled from the pull camp to Main camp, use this channel to keep in communication when the ST can grab one from camp, when the pull group should pull more. KILL.<br />
<br />
Remind EVERYONE if they get aggro outside of camp EVER just die and get a loc. I don't care if its only one mob. get loc and die.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps anyone else doing the tear ( stupid golems are never up when I plan my raids ... GRRRRR )</div></div><hr />
