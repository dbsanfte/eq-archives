<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was shmoozing around the necro boards and came up with this thread http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=23971 and man it got me mad lol. my main for 2 years was a necro and unless the mob cant be slowed (which im not high enough to have encountered yet) there is nothing that my shammy couldnt solo than my necro did at the same lvl. the overwhelming consensus is necros are better soloers in almost ALL circumstances on the necro boards which i guess is to be expected. So what do you guys think? My necro is lvl 61 and i havent touched him since i started my shammy and i doubt there is anything my necro can do that he wont be able too at that lvl. feedback please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say a chanter takes down the uber mobs better.  Most of the stuff a necro or shaman can take down solo anymore, isnt considered that uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the overwhelming consensus is necros are better soloers in almost ALL circumstances on the necro boardsThey are. Aside from DPS a necro has no real group utility (except group taps, mind wrack, and DMF). I still like necros in groups...but to many people who think &quot;Holy Trinity + 3dps!&quot; a necro sure doesn't come to mind.<br />
<br />
I have a necro alt who's level 56 and solos PoV golems. Not with me boxed, not with outside buffs, I just zone in, give a shout for a group, and if there's no takers, I move to the northeast corner and kill the golems for 3% exp in 56 a pop. Conversely, a level 56 shaman is powerful but for different reasons. At 65, If it hits for under 600 and summons but is fully slowable, we can kill it. If the same applies and it hits for 200 or so and is unslowable, Chances are we could also kill it. With a necro, the only difference between the first and second situation is the first does much more DPS.  Nonetheless, a necro could probably manage to kill both, my means of Mujaki/kite/summon on the first, and ToD pet tanking the second.<br />
<br />
When you get to higher levels, Necros can still agro kite stuff in PoFire (or lower tiered planes) where we're usually stuck root cooking. Yes they're better soloers, and there's nothing wrong with that. You want to rock at soloing? Here's the Door. (http://www.blizzard.com/diablo2/)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Although it chaps me to say it I have to agree that they are better soloers.  Just the fact that they have FD is enough for me to concede the title.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got to agree that necros are much better soloers than shamans.  They simply have more options on what to kill and how then we do.  Our main source of dps is dotting ( I tend to think of dog dog as a persistent dot ) and we have 3 lines of dot: poison, disease and now magic (curse).  <br />
<br />
If a mob is immune to poison and/or disease, my dps just dropped to near nil since the only magic based dot I have atm is the epic.  As such, yes I can kill the mob, but don't make any plans on how fast.  Necros on the other hand have the same 3 lines that we have, plus a tap dot line and a fire dot line.  If some of their dots are useless due to mob immunities, they switch out spells and rock on with something else.  TO make matters even more favorable for necros their undead only slow caps at 70%, so if the mob is undead, they slow it and their pet tanks while they dot and FD to shed agro.<br />
<br />
Necros hands down solo more efficiently than shamans can.  On the other hand group a shaman with even one other toon that's capable of dealing good dps and a shaman is near unstoppable, especially if the mob is slowable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I'd agree that is the common conception, I'd disagree that a Necro offers no group utility.  MW is a viable substitue for KEI in many cases, Necro's can mez/slow/charm undead which is limited but it's there.  Vitae is a nice healing augment if you don't have a cleric healing.  Their pet can act as a split tank for CC.  Snare is always a good thing in dungeons with runners (ldon)... <br />
<br />
Necros do very solid DPS even if all their extra uses are ignored.  Their utility is very situational but they can most certainly contribute to a group in more ways than just DPS in most circumstances.  In the right areas they can make a very large impact, in the rest of the zones they still do very solid DPS and have a few little tricks that can be lifesavers at times... (FD+Res! :D)<br />
<br />
If anything I'd say necros are one of the most underestimated classes in the game.  I liken them to bards.  A good one will make a solid contribution to the group but if you're not paying attn. you probably won't even notice where it's coming from... Just that the group is rocking. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree that necros are the most underrated and underappreciated classes in the game. Let a necro into your group and notice how much faster mobs get killed. I would take a necro into my group any day, they have sick dps and really make a group better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Great CC - they take an add and aggro kite it while the group kills one of the mobs.  By the time the group kills the first, the necro's can be down 50% with necro pet, shaman pet, and necro+shaman dots running.  Throw on a spirit call and it can be fun to watch too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kinda depends on the mob bucko.  An undead mob can be more easily soloed by a necro, due to undead charm/slow combo.  The named mobs in Ruins of Lxanth or whatever are far more easily soloed by a necro, who can charm a common trash mob, haste it, and slow the named, and have SPanky the necro pet beat it all to hell.  <br />
<br />
But without the special conditions, shamans are generally better large target soloers.  Specially on anything that summons and can't be feared.  However, necros have proven that a few talented members of their class can accomplish amazing feats like Lodi and g-wurms and such.  Then again, shamans solo those particular fights with such ease as to make them laughable.  <br />
<br />
In the end . . the &quot;better&quot; class is obv shaman.  We are a first rate support class, 2nd rate solo class for exp, 1st rate solo class for large targets, and 4th rate DPS class.<br />
<br />
Necros are a 3rd rate support class, a 1st rate exp/solo class, a 1st rate large target solo class, and sadly, a 4th rate DPS class.<br />
<br />
What's sad is that shamans are wanted for their group support which is 1st or 2nd rate, and necros are wanted for their DPS, which is 3rd or 4th rate. <br />
<br />
That's why shamans are better than necros, because we're better at what we're needed to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necro's are 4th rate dps? Don't know what you've been smoking or what kinda lazy necro's your grouped with but necro's can lay the smack down pretty damn good. Thier dots are awesome, they get a ton of em, thier mana effecient and thier pet lays out some serious dps. Throw in taps, poison nukes and the fact that they can regain mana better than just about any class in the game with just lich and you have a class that can do some serious damage and keep it up. I have a 61 necro, and when I 4 box I have to keep him grouped with my ranger, shammy and 58 druid cuz he consistently kill steals em without me putting alot of effort into it. And the funny thing is is that my necro's got the lowest number of hps and mana in my crew, except it has more mana than my ranger but only by a few hundred.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Its nice to be proud of your class but really lets face facts here.<br />
<br />
But like everyone else said, who's going to be picked first for a group?  Shaman or Necro?  Let the necros have the one thing they are proud of.<br />
<br />
I actually feel sorry for them because so many people don't know a necros full potential.  I personally will take a necro over a wizard or mage anyday in a group because necros can heal also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">necro pets do own but mage/bst pets are still the best.

You're then left with pet dmg and smallish nukes.  3rd rate at best for burst dps, which is all that really counts in a full group most of the time.  <br />
<br />
My point is, we are much better at the thing we are wanted for than necros are at the thing they are wanted for.  <br />
<br />
Comparing the classes against each other and neglecting to mention that would be bad logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tetrass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Among my various toons, one is a 55 necro.  My shaman is only 36 at this point so I can only speak on the first 36 levels with real authority.<br />
<br />
First off I voted Shaman on the poll since the question specifically asked who can solo uber mobs best.  If you talk about undead uber mobs specifically, necro wins without debate.<br />
<br />
Secondly, necros kick the crap out of everyone but bards for general soloing.  Druids come in a respectable third.  Soloing well is not about doing any one thing best, it's about doing lots of things well and thats why those three classes are the best soloers.  Shaman absolutley have better than average solo ability, mainly because they can do 3 things:  slow, heal and Cannabalize.  Lots of classes can solo, but few as well as a necro.<br />
<br />
Next, and I say this with the kindest and most forthright intentions: if you believe necro DPS is poor in a regular group situation, you are mistaken.  It is absolutley not maximized in a group environment, but assuming they know what they are doing a necro still kicks out some very good DPS.  <br />
<br />
Finally, it is painfully obvious that shaman are more wanted for groups but saying that shaman are much better at what they are wanted for than necros is specious at best.  Such a statement assumes the only thing you want a necro for is DPS.  In general, groups look for a shaman when they need slows and heals.  Every group needs slows and heals.  Groups looking for DPS start out looking for rogues and work their way down through whatever perceived ranking they happen to believe in.  Groups simply don't look for a necro, because what a necro is best at is soloing, however a necro absolutely can fill the role of DPS in a group while providing a number of other utilities, such as CC, mana regen and patch healing.  What mentioning any of this has to do with the logic behind discussing who solos what best escapes me however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I play both 65 Necro/385 AA Elemental/VT geared and a 65 Shaman/80 AA fairly decent geared(full ornate) Both characters have full spell books LDON dots and all. I have 2 boxed them both for all most a year. I've done close to 100 LDON adventures 2 boxing them as well. In group situations shaman can in no way keep up with the dmg the necro can do. As a necro I can rap off consitantly with poison nukes 1600+ dmg and many 2.8-3k criticals and not even dent my mana pool. My life taps can be casted at 2.8 seconds for over 1k on ave dmg with many 1800+ criticals. Group heals maitain a nice balance of heal for all members other than MA..shaman shines in on that with Quin and Tnargs if needed. I rarely can get off more than 1 rain/nuke on a mob with my shaman when I have a healthy level of DSP with in my group and being a necro lover i'll more times than not have 2 necros if not 3 with in a group. Nice thing about a shaman is he can act as DPS/Slower/ and main healer and go with all DPS on LDON. <br />
<br />
<br />
As far as who is the better soloer..hard to say since ive duoed rather than solo with either. My main source of EXP for the last few months before I became a LDON addict was POF. Shaman dots are far more resisted then dots from my necro with out a doubt. What does that mean? nothing other than necros can run alot more efficient in &quot;that&quot; situation. <br />
<br />
<br />
My advice...Necro/Shaman pair is an icredible combination. I never ever go with out a group with my Duo.<br />

<br />
I've seen 3 years of necro whining that they suck, I'm glad they are looking at themselves different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">While I will say that my experience in playing a necro is rather limited (a few twinks over the years), I do make it my job to be well aware of the skills and capabilities that another class can come up with and do. In all my reading, nothing comes across as the God class like a necro does.<br />
FD, freaking nice pets, snare, DoTs, FD, Rezzes (at a hefty cost), Undead slow/mez/charm/lull, life taps over time, did I mention FD?<br />
Now as to what we can do and what they can do, I really do think that soloing any uber or non uber mob is all relative.<br />
I can solo Rushka (I miss the days of Shady slaying....I remember my first time soloing him :( ), a PoD, cliff Golems, GWs, etc and never break a sweat, as can a necro.....I can solo Lodi, could a necro??? Could a necro solo down to the Fungi King? <br />
Dont compare apples and oranges, in the end all you get is fruit salad.<br />
Now as to group utility, I rank Necros right up there with Chanters ; as to SUSTAINED DPS, they rank with beastlords toe to toe. As for BOOM DPS, mages of course and wizards hold that hands down.<br />
Dont underestimate necros, a good one will be like a god send to your group, mind wracking, slowing adds while your rooting, pet off tanking etc.....they really can do it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Treasure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think I speak from pretty good experience here when I write this, as I've played a 65 necro for 4 years and a 65 shaman for the better half of a year (granted im biased obviously). 65 Necro was 100aa's before he was banned, and I was forced to play a 65 shaman full time. 100 aa's on it about now. <br />
<br />
Most of the posts have been about right, Necros own for soloing thats the truth, its what they have and what they are proud of. Situational I believe is the key word here however. As a Shaman I can take mobs down I could never take down as a necro, or would rather avoid in favor of another mob. Summoning mobs are a large chunk of these. On the other hand, there are a lot of other mobs which are either Heavily MR (thus slow resists, even after malos) or just plan mitigate Shaman abilities. What makes a Necro so powerful is not just the versatility of the dots, the fact that a necro has about 101 different escape methods, or the impact of the pet, but rather the factor that all their spells, or all the important ones, are between hard to resist and lure based. Almost all the fire spells land without a debuff everytime, rarely will there be a resistance. Splurt (mr based) will be resisted once in a blue moon. Lifetaps and tap dots are lure to uniresistable. Even their poison and disease dots are harder to resists, also this is true of horror (neg 30 adjust compared to 0 adjust on bane).<br />
<br />
Now what really peaved me was the comment on DPS. I dont know what groups your killing in where mobs die in 15 seconds, but if the mob is up for more than 30 (which is ALWAYS the case, especially in LDON where even the best groups average 40 seconds a mob) then dots are worth it. Bane and Horror are made for patch DPS, and are the most powerful (dps wise) 2 dots in the game, averaging 80-100 dps depending on focus items. As a Shaman I Bane every mob I get a chance to, usually in LDON hards Ill get off a Bane and 2 Cold nukes at best, giving roughly 4k+ dmg to the mob. Thats After Malos (Have to malos on hard), Tugurs, Quiesence. Imagine a necro, who has both faster (much faster) casting nukes, and more damaging at that, coupled with a more powerful curse dot. I imagine, if cards are played right, with BoT and Horror, a necro would still have time for 2 Neurotoxins. Minimum of 6k dmg, in upwards of 8-10k dmg on one mob given a crit or POP focus items. This is patch only dps. Anything with upwards of 100k hp, a Necro IS the best dps class, better than a wizard if resistances are high. Im talking 300+dps from one person. Meager dps indeed.</div></div><hr />

Put that way Landragoran I tend to agree with ya a bit more. And yes necro's get slighted by ignorance, but its them who have perpetuated it by being mostly soloers. Most of the people here on this board know what each class in EQ is capable of, but alot of people who don't visit messageboards don't even know what thier own class can do. Necro's mostly solo so they don't show off thier mad skills as much as they could.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, long story short, I started a Necro and Shaman.  Everyone told me to do the SK/Shaman combo, but I’m happy with the choice I made.  Both are now level 65 and it’s wonderful to have the best of both worlds.  Both are unique and have their strengths and weaknesses.  I’m firmly planted dead center on this issue, one is not better than the other – their just different, at least from my perspective.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>iamashaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">sure necros are useful in group, they can do a lot of things other classes cant. the only problem is its like playing craps with classes like this u win some but u lose most, 75% of the necros i group with are jsut there to do there decent, good but nto great dps, but when **** hits the fan they are about as usful as wizzy thats oom. but when u get that other 25% it really makes the group that soo much more fun:)<br />
<br />
i guess this idea of craps can apply to all classes including shaman(u guys read about the shaman with 600ac and 1700hp at 65 LMAO) but it applys more so to classes like necros imo. and of course war who are normally either uber or crap:/ not much most of them can do though hopefully then new melee patch will fix this.... anyways back to the point about picking the right class/char is luck fo the roll.. i am not in and uber guild but i am working on getting into elemental zones jsut because i know the ppl in there cant be complete morons if they reached these zones they must have a pritty good idea of how their class works, which makes for a MUCH more efficient group. i group in bot a lot and it seems like most ppl know what they are doing, but sometimes i feel like im back in KC:/<br />

I get groups with in-game friends, or if I build them, but the common preception is that necros are not a group class. <br />

I've been in LDoN groups where the necro was doing almost all the healing.  Between Tigirs and group regen, there isn't that much healing left to be dealt with, and the Vitae can handle almost all of it.  Its no exaggeration to say that I have done LDoN groups as the only healer, and only had to heal maybe 5-6 times.<br />

I agree completely.  Like bards, the difference between a well-played and poorly-played necro is huge, and they can be an impressive addition to most any group in the right hands.</div></div><hr />

All in all I'd have to say that necros are the best *situational* soloers.  We can solo anything they can and probably more, BUT at the same time they are more efficient (compare the cost of their dots to ours) and have more DPS.<br />
<br />
I will still take a necro partner for duoing any day - we make an awesome couple :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Medasinman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Medasinman, I never root cooked as a Shaman until PoP and level 61+. There are tons of places a 46 Shaman can go and tank in the face if you are interested. Just stay out of PoP.<br />
<br />
I only play my shammy as my alt, so I admit I don't devote as much time to him as I do my main. I only bring up root cooking as it was mentioned in other posts. /shrug<br />
<br />
I too tank mobs with my shammy if I do solo, Giants in GD, HGs in RM, whatever I may be soloing, I debuff, dot and pound away at. I have no illusions of trying PoP mobs unless I am soloing there with my necro, and those places are limited as it is. But thanks for the advice, I do understand what your saying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Actually there are several mobs that necros can solo that we can't. <br />
<br />
Anyone that thinks necros have a hard time with summoning mobs hasn't seen a well played and geared one work. They don't need to slow them, they don't need to snare them, they don't need to root them. <br />
<br />
They can heal, and do damage with every cast all while In the face. Add in AA's for simultaneous crit damage and heals, and its just sick. Not to mention they can regen mana fast all while fighting. PoP really pushed necros to the forefront of abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Anything a necro can solo without charm can be soloed by a slightly less equipped shaman with less effort and slightly more time (unless it's snare kiting stuff in Fire, in which case the shaman spends more effort).<br />
<br />
With that being said, the necro is an extremely versatile and underestimated class. On top of having every single soloing tool at their disposal, they also get quite a few highly useful group spells such as ZToV and MW.<br />
<br />
Necros have always been powerful, it's just that enough good necros don't bother with conventional groups (I'll give you two guesses, but you only really need one), so most people have never had the chance to group with a skilled one before PoP and LDoN.</div></div><hr />
