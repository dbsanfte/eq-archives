<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faroah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if this is the proper board to ask this(couldnt find equipment). <br />
I've recently inherited a 56 shaman together with my 61 Ranger.  I've twinked him a little but I really dont know what to get else, Best idea would to ask you all ;)<br />
 I can basicly farm stuff with those 2 characters..so yeah<br />
Here's the profile http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=484158 Anyone have any ideas? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You've got some very nice stuff there, such as the solstice and the pauldrons.  However, I'd think about seeing if I could get a JBB, Fungal Tunic and something else for the range (either bene tali or Divine Inspiration).  You're doing a nice job of sititng on the fence at the moment, but I think that wis &gt; HP &gt; AC atm for you and your duoing.  If you were tight with a guild, I'd say forget the FT and push for 60 and Torpor but it doesn't look like that from what you posted.  With Torpor, HP &gt; AC &gt; Wis and everything changes.  Expect to make more than one major change in your gear in the next 5 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, I 2 box a war and a shammy, I still go hp/ac and I feel it is the right way. As long as you are semi competent at 2 boxing you will still be able to use a shammy just like everyone else, you will can, root park and tank and teh face.<br />
<br />
Also, there is no reason not to shoot for 60 and torpor. There are spots that 2 peeps can farm for torpor, or you can add a group and there are more spots. You can always farm cash and buy it too, whatever floats your boat. Since 60+ means planes, you really are going to want to treat the shaman as a partner as you level him and work on his spells and gear.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the gear help :)<br />
<br />
barbed rubicite bracers(buy)<br />
shadel bandit ring(farm)<br />
barbed dragon boots(buy)<br />
heiro cloak(buy or farm)/shimmering terrorhide(buy or farm)<br />
Fungi tunic(buy or farm)<br />
Chokidai hide paldrons(buy or farm)<br />
Sandwich of foul smelling herbs(farm)/talisman of benevolence(quest with a cleric and war)<br />
<br />
These are some easy or good value type of upgrades that will really help your hp out. From here start looking at quest armor or raid type drops, although there are of course other buyable upgrades around :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faroah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And what would that 2spot for Torpor be? ;) Emp in Sebilis?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice btw you two =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">from what I hear, ya get a rogue to let you in and do emp till you are insane. Or you can go for juggs and hope to get it from a named. I am not sure what I will do to get torpor, but I will definately try to get the drop myself. I will try emp, juggs and gwurms untill I get the spells or the cash to buy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are good, and you get the shaman to level 58 for the 2k heal, you might be able to duo Guardian Wurms in skyfire - they can drop torpor.</div></div><hr />
