<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, <br />
<br />
    Just wondering if anyone has any opinion on best enchanters for weapons for certain classes. My main is my paladin lvl 60. I also play my rogue with my wife and friends we're all in the upper 40 range now. Ive really only ever done the + X to weapon enchants. 7 to my pal's 2h and +3 for rogues weapons. <br />
<br />
I was debating getting +4 for the rogue which has me wondering if i should just look into get some of the higher enchants. Was going to get the supplies and find someone to cast for me. Want to make sure If i do this that i spend money I'll be happy with. I was looking at the unholy enchant and the crusader for my Paladins weapon. Not real sure for the rogue's. Anyone have any suggestions? Anything particular one that they really like? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for rogue, fiery is probably the best. Procs like crazy, 5-10 times a fight is common, and it can crit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks mill. Saw you mention that one in another thread. Have the stuff just need a caster to give it a go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was thinking about lifestealing for my pal to try too. Partly because i happen to have some of the stuff for it and didnt realize it. <br />
<br />
