<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Guys!<br />
<br />
Out of all the EQ web sites out there I knew if I came here that shamans are know to have the best ability to work things out. Can't be helped I guess when you play the best class in the game  :D <br />
<br />
So I have a little question...<br />
<br />
I was playing around with the hotkeys command whereby I wanted to hit a key and have several commands acted on. But, I am running out of lines so I am wondering is there a way to 'group' commands on the one line?<br />
<br />
EQ..<br />
<br />
/target Playername /pause 4 /cast 5 /pause 20 /assist Palyername /pause 3 /pet attack<br />
<br />
then maybe go on to the next line if the above runs out of length room.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys!<br />
<br />
Regards, Ridgey  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fumorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know this can be shortened down to:<br />
<br />
/target Playername<br />
/pause 4, /cast 5<br />
/pause 20, /assist Palyername<br />
/pause 3, /pet attack<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably not what you're looking for, and I don't think it can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, the pauses come after the command they share a line with, so that should be:<br />
<br />
/pause 4,/target Playername<br />
/pause 20,/cast 5<br />
/pause 3,/assist Palyername<br />
/pet attack<br />
<br />
Very intuitive, I know...</div></div><hr />

WoW! That was a quick reply  :p <br />
<br />
So Kamidari it is possible to have extra commands on the one line? Is there a limit do you know?<br />
<br />
