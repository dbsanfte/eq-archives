<br />
On evac, 50% of the time you zone normally and then zone back in at the point where you ported from (rather than the evac point).   Zoning out of Yxtta into Kodtaz put one of my group members to a random area in Kodtaz where we had earlier killed a named, hours before.  You will be forced under the world if a person is standing on the zonein in many zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pvping a wizard and I fell through the world, apparently she followed because shorty lafter I popped at the succor point she did as well...bummer for her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I fell through the world zoning 7 or 8 times tonight. It was great fun lol.<br />
<br />
My guild told me it was because I was a fat Ogre though and had nothing to do with the patches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lmao :D<br />
<br />
The night before last our chanter got stuck in some barrels in an Ruj LDoN adventure (no we don't know what he was doing arsing about near them in the first place) One of the group said &quot;I told you we were scraping the bottom of the barrel picking him&quot; :D<br />
<br />
We ended up using Coth to get him out. I think in this case it should have been renamed to Call of the Numpty ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We had several people in our guild who could not be ported to Wakening Lands a couple nights ago.  We joked that SoE had somehow added the requirement for the Tooth keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was movning my SK to UP so he would be ready to raid tonite. I get in and everything is fine, im not moving or even touching the keyboard when BAM, im undeground in a totaly different part of the zone surrounded by see invis aliens.  Thank god for FD and thank god there was a guide online that answred my /tell<br />
<br />
<br />
Fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I &quot;died&quot; from a dot.  Pop up at bind point in PoK with all buffs on, including the dot.<br />
<br />
I proceeded to &quot;die&quot; again, over and over, in a death loop, for the next 5 minutes before I /q'd.<br />
<br />
This happened to a few people in my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We hit TT last night and upon zoning into PoNb several people ended up at TT and not the zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can &quot;fd&quot; in Kod`taz.  Train a wall sit/duck rapidly 2-5 times and you fall through the world, sending you to safespot + clearing all aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MurojTruewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fell through the world once on my way to a MM adventure last night, in Gfay. Basically ported me to Kelethin area, not a big deal and really the only issue I had last night after patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bearchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Havent done a Bugs Bunny yet and fell into the world but I did have a mob run toward me to attack several times before he actually hit me. It was like watching an instant replay about 10 times. Finally I grew bored and rooted the damn thing which allowed me the pleasure of killing him.<br />
<br />
Happened more than once too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">fishing for rares yesterday in vxed... about 40% of the time zoning out of vxed into KT I'd appear out in the middle of nowhere in the zone.  Had to force myself down to warp to safepoint.  This happened to other members of my party as well, many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I fell through the world for about 15 straight zone in attempts in earthlast night. I got around it by riding in on a horse, maybe it was a fix, maybe it was luck. Same issue with the evac problem, fortuantely for us, the mobs were pathing back by the time we landed. Yay, patch inc. Good... I still need ele chain arms from quav.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gnome guildmate got killed Thu night, appeared at bind point in PoK, and promptly fell for 20K and died again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Same here Jeones, went on a TT raid last night, aobut 10 of 50 zoned inside her ring, rather than the GY.  ~grins~ One of the people in TT's ring was a mage with enough Pdots to summon the rest of the raid to her.  Was just about the fastest raid setup in PoNB I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was running through kithicor last night from highkeep to rivervale when I fell through the floor and popped up at rivervale zone. Was pretty handy actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lol, ya know they're going to fix this one fast. Not because it's a problem for a lot of players, but because a few can use it to their advantage. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the guild was goofing around on saturday, and had lots of lvl 1 wood elves trying to race thru kithicor at nite.<br />
<br />
i got rooted and hit with a necro DoT, one of the darkness ones.  died quick, and proceeded to die about 20 more times until the DoT wore off.   nothing like a screenfull of &quot;Loading, Please Wait. . .&quot; to make your day. i was amused, until i thought about how pissed i'd be if it was the regular 'toon.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The DoT death loops are common now it seems.  It only happens to certain people.  Previous to the DX9 changes I have died during the Time Innoruuk encounter with his DoT on me only to appear at bind with all my gear and buffs and no change in xp.  I've died recently with DoTs on me and no death loop occured.<br />
<br />
I've never fallen through the world or gotten stuck or warped back to previous locations far away.  Though if I do stand close to obstacles like rocks or concave walls or other PCs/NPCs, I will get knocked back some.  I have also zoned into Natimbi to have almost all the ground and walls not appear and then when I zone out, I will usually crash.  It only happens in Natimbi it seems and once in plane of fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Try running up some steps double shrunk,  you kinda have to jump to get up them in the first place .. but you will be repeatedly warped back down the steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think many of the zoning and falling under the world bugs happen if you zone with lev on.  Only times it's happened to me was with lev.  Also, I think the falling death loop might occur if you died by falling and it just keeps happening.  Not sure, though.  Had some fun watching a dude in PoK the other night who had a death loop like that.  Watched him for about an hour before I finally left.  He never got the hint to try and log out. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've seen several double dot deaths, mainly due to Korucust's ae.  Lev definately seems to have something to do with falling under the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Lev and zoning in onto someone else is I think what causes falling under the world.  I have zoned with lev on into a non populated zoneline and have had no problems.  However if I zone in and drop onto someone else then I end up under the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">They ****ed with the actual 'size' of things, the fundamental rules of 'EQ physics' have changed aswell.<br />
<br />
This is a **** up of monumental proportions, I am astounded they have not patched it yet, these bugs are trivial to fix.<br />
<br />
I dont know about you guys but I getting sick to death of spinning 270 degrees and bounced each time I back into a corner/wall to allow me to channel. People can't position mobs, the whole ****ing game is broken and they do nothing?<br />
<br />
My point is, this is a 3d, first person game where positioning is mroe important than anything else...and its broken?...nice testing. Did you guys on Test get this? Speak up!<br />
<br />
This is ridiculous, suffice to say I had no second thoughts about watching ER, Nip &amp; Tuck and even a bit of the wifes video'ed soaps, followed by an early night in preference to playing a broken game.<br />
<br />
I'm pissed off cause I actually enjoy EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vittra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Camping collector's scyte outside PoFear iz.<br />
Hammering at the greencons and i just fell under the world.<br />
No lev whatsoever on. <br />
Whats up with THAT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I had problems getting the boat from Ned Landing to Abysmal Sea. After 3 attempts I followed the boat and ran to the bow and zoned when it stopped.<br />
<br />
My guild mate had no problems though. strange!</div></div><hr />
