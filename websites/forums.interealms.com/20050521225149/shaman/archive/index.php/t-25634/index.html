<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok in the intrest of improving the game, if you come across a bug please let me know. There is a QA that is actively working with Me and the Co-leader of Botsquad to identify bugs, test them and get them fixed. <br />
<br />
I know this guy is doing his damn best to help make EQ playing a better experience for us all.<br />
<br />
Currently bugs that have been pointed out and should be fixed soon:<br />
-Vxed agro bug near the end. If you got too high on the wall you would be rushed by all sorts of mobs<br />
-Melins Meditation had a stacking problem with C6 you were only getting 350 mana from it instead of the 400. (EDIT: Funny little peice of knowlege... Players can resist gm slay player spell seeing as the wizard we had testing this resisted it 3 or 4 times.)<br />
<br />
(random other bugs that i cant think of off the top of my head)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The tent/tree in WoS: If you push a mob into this tree it will warp elsewhere out of range of heals and start summoning players there and killing them one by one.<br />
<br />
I assume this is a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does the disproportionate (in relation to the damage they do) aggro from shaman DoTs count as a bug or is that a feature?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats a feature to Nullify a Shamans general godly uberness overpowering type of thing :).<br />
Seriously though thats a well known bug but perhaps they should be pestered with it so they dont forget or sweep it under the carpet.<br />

<br />
<br />
Who confirmed this to be a bug? You only get 350 mana due to the hard cap that was put on &quot;mana pool&quot; buffs or at least that's how it used to be.<br />
<br />
The cap is/was 750 iirc and C6 gives 400.</div></div><hr />

Well when we showed it to the QA he agreeded that it shouldn't be happening and that he would have a Dev look into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The tent/tree in WoS: If you push a mob into this tree it will warp elsewhere out of range of heals and start summoning players there and killing them one by one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My 3 biggest peeves:<br />
<br />
* Zone-in time for Emerald Jungle and Trakanon's Teeth is exceptionally long for many players. This has been broken since DX9 was added 10 months ago. The time it takes to zone in to Plane of Knowledge and Bazaar is also a lot longer than it used to be. Zone time into these zones may be reasonable when first starting your EQ session, but it doesn't stay reasonable.<br />
<br />
* Intermittent video glitch, where all the textures disappear so all you see is sky when facing certain directions, especially west. Must restart EQ or reboot to fix it. It can happen to multiple people in your party or raid all at the same time, but apparently not to everyone. Plane of Torment is especially problematic.<br />
<br />
* Message queueing doesn't work properly anymore while zoning, you often miss messages (group chat, guild chat, etc). Messages that are queued sometimes get duplicated or out of order.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bunch of other bugs, some new some very old:<br />
<br />
* Certain focus effects still aren't filtered properly -- duration extension effects such as Extended Enhancement and Extended Torment always show up even when your Focus Effects filter is set to not display them, but only when you cast them on another player or NPC. They filter ok when you cast on yourself.<br />
<br />
* Trying to give a quest item to an NPC while you're invisible causes you to become visible to NPCs, but you do NOT get a message that your invis faded, and your invis icon does NOT drop from your buff box. Very old bug.<br />
<br />
* Necro pet names have those old numerals after their name when they fail FD. &quot;Goner00 has fallen to the ground&quot;<br />
<br />
* The target window and Target of Target window in the default UI are way too small to show the full name of many mobs. Make them wider.<br />
<br />
* Iksar Shamans don't have a usable vendor for their 51-59 store-bought Kunark spells. Every other race/class combo has one. Necros have a vendor right in Cabilis for these spells, why don't Iksar Shamans? Our workaround is to mule those spells.<br />
<br />
* Some spell sounds have long been messed up. For example, Acumen buff landing makes the glug-glug drinking sound. Enchanter spells make a very obnoxious &quot;nyaah nyaah nyaaaaaaaaaah&quot; sound while the chanter is in scaled wolf illusion form.<br />
<br />
* Certain buffs AND debuffs cast by higher level players block the exact same buff/debuff cast by a lower level player, even when the buff/debuff effect is exactly the same from level to level. When the effect is identical, the buff/debuff should refresh. Focus of the Seventh, KEI, Malosinia, for examples. I'm noticing this after OoW release and buffs+debuffs from 66+ players.<br />
<br />
* Dranik's Hollow &quot;Firepits&quot; expedition has blank black textures unless you modify a weird video setting in options.<br />
<br />
* You can't run downwards when floating and mounted. I don't know if this is intentional or not, but it really ought to work. Workaround is to dismount whenever you need to push yourself to a lower elevation.<br />
<br />
* For certain race/gender combos, cycling through the F9 views while sitting causes the view to appear at standing height when you return to first-person view. Workaround is to stand up and sit back down again. Female Iksar (Luclin model), for example.<br />
<br />
* Recent problem with your view (first-person) switching from standing height to ducking height when you back up against a wall, even though you are not ducking. (Auto-duck is not turned on.)<br />
<br />
* In Options, General, the Accept button for the current font partially extends off the right side of the dialog box.<br />
<br />
* Bugs with the new group-shifting options in the raid window -- group leaders shift out of position 1 when you add a member to their group; multiple people in one group can incorrectly display as a group leader in the window; group leader status for a raid member can be turned off, but not on -- we need to be able to set a raid member as a &quot;group leader&quot; so he can start inviting.<br />
<br />
* Planar Projection lasts 10 min for all encounters that I've timed EXCEPT Aerin`Dar. PP duration for that event is screwily unpredictable.<br />
<br />
* Chat window text gets blurred while zoning due to the screen freezing right in the middle of scrolling in the &quot;loading please wait&quot; line of text (if the chat window is full, which it usually is). The screen should wait until the chat window fully updates before freezing.<br />
<br />
* Handing multiple stackable items to an NPC one at a time causes them all to stack in the first slot of the Give window. NPCs don't accept stacked items anymore, so the items ought to be fitted into the next slot in the window instead of stacking by default.<br />
<br />
* The tabbed Abilities dialog box does not stay on the last tab you were using if you restart EQ. On the Hotkeys tab, the hotkey bank does stay on the last bank you were using if you switch characters, however the bank number display gets reset to 1, which is incorrect if you were on banks 2-10. Pressing the left or right arrow to switch banks fixes the erroneous bank number display.<br />
<br />
* Various mount problems: Group buffs and MGBs sometimes don't land on other players when you're on a mount; /random messages are sometimes not seen when you or the roller is on a mount; mobs sometimes summon you repeatly when you're mounted even when you're positioned right on top of them.<br />
<br />
* Mobs have started casting Fear inside dungeons a lot.<br />
<br />
* Lev sometimes causes Hide to fail (rogues).<br />
<br />
* Advanced Pet Displine AA (/pet focus) doesn't stay set after you zone or suspend your pet.<br />
<br />
* Mirao Frostpouch in Plane of Knowledge is incorrectly identified as a Poison Supplies vendor. He's actually a potion vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In Plane of Time when clearing trash from Saryn or Terris Thule trash from phase 5 warps down.  This is after the God herself is dead and clearing trash so people can loot.  Not sure how or why it happens, but it has happened a few times to us recently.  I did report it in game, but maybe this will help too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Great list Nytmare. I have seen most of these.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Didnt think Guild Chat or Group Chat etc had ever queued.Thought it was only tells or has it been broken that long i forgot it ever did ?<br />
<br />
<br />
* Some spell sounds have long been messed up. For example, Acumen buff landing makes the glug-glug drinking sound. Enchanter spells make a very obnoxious &quot;nyaah nyaah nyaaaaaaaaaah&quot; sound while the chanter is in scaled wolf illusion form.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just hate the fact Canni doesnt make a sound when cast.No biggie just a pet peeve of mine.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Grr I hate this one and sometimes its a real pita and should be fixed asahp.<br />
<br />
<br />
* Mobs have started casting Fear inside dungeons a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Been lots about this on the Sony boards and apparently it was an intentional change when they made the mobs more intelligently cast.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Make the chat filter for NPC Spells not include PC pets. I will love someone forever if they fix this. I don't give two ****s if Mrkittiekat's warder is casting Hobble of Spirits Eff and Spirit of Ironiniu Strike every 3 seconds, but I DO care if Tallon Zek is casting Planeshift.<br />
<br />
Please, for my sanity and that of many others, allow pet spellcasting to be filtered out but NPC spells to be left on.<br />
<br />
Likewise, let NPC Names only affect NPC names and not that of pets.<br />
<br />
Edit: the spell spam thing is so bad that if I was guild leader of my guild I would require all pet classes to have /pet no cast engaged 100% of the time on raids. Sadly my guild leader is a beastlord (sigh) and thinks his stupid wolf pet is the MVP of raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lots of good stuff for me to look into when I corner the QA. Probably going to be next week before I get a chance to do much with the list due to our Guild/Org database being trashed due to a crappy host who didnt feel they needed to update when security patches came out. So my time this week is being spent rebuilding our dkp site and forums whee.<br />
<br />
Continue posting bugs you come across and I will spend some of my many bored hours testing them.<br />
<br />
This Saturday we should be killing Terris and Saryn, I will try to have the QA there to watch the fight in hopes that the bug of trash from phase 5 poping down happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shoulda also said that when it happened some people were spread out a little from the corner the gods are in.  Like near the table area in the middle.  when we were huddled in the corner kiling them as from from the middle as possible nothing happened.  so to make it happen again you might need to make sure people are spread out some from the corner near the table (TT and Saryn are the last 2 we kill so we have time for VZ, so TZ and VZ are down when we do them if that has anything to do with anything).  <br />
<br />
Not sure exactly how to re produce it, just seems like it happens.  We have /bug it several times.  I wish you luck in reproducing it (if that's a good thing... :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Time phase 5 mob can agro through floor.    It can be avoided if your raid member don't stand below them.  ;)     Before phase 5 dialogs finish, run whole raid force into VZ and TZ room or around centor table can avoid agro phase 5 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for the info on the mobs agroing from phase 5 and jumping down. Due to having a GM showing up to watch our time raid this saturday I will try to have people reporduce it.<br />
<br />
The QA has been busy as hell this week so havent had a chance to show him some of the other bugs that were mentioned but these should be pushed through testing a little faster now atleast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My 3 biggest peeves:<br />

<br />
<br />
This happens to me occaisionally as well, but have always been able to recover by taking the far clip plane down to zero and back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">* In the skills window off your inventory screen -- highlighting the Alchemy, Tinkering, or Make Poison skills allows you to make a hotkey for them, but this hotkey doesn't seem to do anything. Why are hotkeys available for those particular skills?<br />
<br />
* The lower half of Dain Frostreaver IV appears invisible to many (if not all) players. He looks like a floating upper body nowadays. DX9 bug?<br />
<br />
* Now that the guild window has tabs for Note and Tribute columns, the Notes and Tribute numbers don't match up properly with the character names when you look at those tabs. (Guild window is set to show logged in players only.) A work-around is to re-sort the list by clicking on a column header.<br />
<br />
* Brown Potion is one of the items from chests in 65-normal LDoN dungeons, Miragul's theme. Its effect is Disease Awareness I which is thoroughly useless at that level. This item should be removed from the chest loot table for upper level dungeons, or replaced with something worthwhile.<br />
<br />
* The ladder at the very top of Temple of Terror (Shm/Shd/Bst guild) in East Cabilis is on the wrong end of the opening. Players who need to get up there have to perfectly time a forward jump from the top of the ladder to reach the landing on the opposite side. Work-around is to get levitated once you're at the top of the ladder. How many thousands of Iksar newbies have been unable to get up there, ever since Kunark was released? This ladder needs to be moved to the proper position.<br />
<br />
* Vendor prices are rounded poorly, often ending in 9s instead of even numbers. For example, 'That'll be 103949 platinum 9 gold 9 silver 5 copper for the Giant Black Drum.' when it should say 'That'll be 103950 platinum'<br />
<br />
This problem appears to have started with the patch of April 8th, 2003. For example:<br />
[Thu Apr 03 17:30:49 2003] Muxzog Gradok tells you, 'That'll be 1 platinum 5 silver for the Tackle Box.'<br />
[Thu Apr 10 19:05:30 2003] Muxzog Gradok tells you, 'That'll be 1 platinum 4 silver 9 copper for the Tackle Box.'<br />
<br />
<br />
This happens to me occaisionally as well, but have always been able to recover by taking the far clip plane down to zero and back up.<br />
<br />
Thank you, I will try that next time.</div></div><hr />
