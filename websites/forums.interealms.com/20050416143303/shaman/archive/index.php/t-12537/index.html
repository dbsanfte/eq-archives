<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi<br />
<br />
I have read about the Archers and sconds in the Echo Caverns but can never find them. Could someone please post on how to actually get to them. <br />
<br />
I have searched the boards for &quot;echo caverns&quot; &quot;sconds&quot; &quot;archers&quot; but no luck to where to actually find these mysterious mobs.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they are behind a fake wall.  If you zone in from the secret entrance in SH (like you are going to fungus grove)....<br />
<br />
Immediately when you zone in turn right, there is a wall.  Click it and it slides back and opens a secret area  the scounds and archers are back in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Henora<br />
<br />
I have always thought that was where the spell merchants were only. I will go and take a closer look around.  Your reply is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you are looking to get XP off them.. they give the same amount of xp that FG shrooms give, and since they don't stop meleeing to try to cast slow/shroom/whatever on you, they do more damage (more healing from you, less mana, blah blah)... fg shroomies much better, although the archers are great cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Minkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What lvl can you start going to these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Larbonal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Didn't they also make those archers summon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Update<br />
<br />
1. Yes Archers summon.<br />
2. Very easy to take these guys out. Both archers dropped two bows a peice that sold for 20+ pp each.(to bad there wasnt more of these guys)<br />
3. Never Never try to take Duke Norfin alone. :) he hits like a tank, I havnt seen my dog go dead so fast in a long time.<br />
<br />
This would be a good spot 55- 60 at 61 they are light blue so not really worth the effort, but im trying to hit everyspot in this game at least once.<br />
<br />
<br />
Duke Norfin fight<br />
<br />
1 Cast malo. it lands imagine that :)<br />
2 He runs up to the archer spot. by the way this is where your at.<br />
3 Intercept him with dog.<br />
4 Cast slow.  RESIST &gt; dog dead.<br />
5 Duke hits you for 240 320 200... <br />
6 Run like a little girl to zone. <br />
( make it to zone because sow hasnt worn off yet.) Noticed on the way out I picked up Marshal Galeron as well. Not sure if he aggroed on the fight or my run out. He hits just as hard.<br />
<br />
Im sure like everything else once slowed hes dead but havnt tried a rematch yet. Any one else do this guy?<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thelordtrey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another quick question on this subject.<br />
<br />
I went here after reading the post (52 shammy, JBB, no epic/horse) can drop the archers like a bad habit and I can break the front 2 named Scounds in front of the building (sorry dont remember their names).  <br />
<br />
My question is are there any others you can safely pull?  The only &quot;a scound&quot;s in that fort thing are hard up against the Duke SK trainer and i didnt have the courage to try to pull either b/c i didnt want to die to what I expected to be an absurdly large HT.<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is because Im not sure what the respawn times are on the archers and the named scounds (at least no more specifically then a long time =)) and I end up sitting around waiting for repops at full health and mana.  The xp is pretty decent and the loot from the archers is nice Im just curious as to if there is anything else in that area to safely pull to get more bang for my buck out of my KEI (I saw a pair of scounds in front of the caster guild builiding, but the enchanter trainer is right on the other side of the wall as them and I figured that would be just as bad as the SH trainer).<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>VeldamirVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">u can single pull this stuff at 56 i believe.  u can pull most of the guards out without agroing guys you can't kill, u can kill both archers, and 3 or 4 mobs by the bank i believe.  I haven't done this in some time as the exp is fairly slow here, but if you want me to go get the names of all the pullable/killable mobs i'd be glad to do so.</div></div><hr />
