<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">the new patch to Beta WoW is disgusting.<br />
<br />
its almost impossible to solo.<br />
<br />
and to group ? you need the perfect setup, warrior, cleric, dps, dps, dps, dps.<br />
<br />
double u tee f, is blizzard thinking !?<br />
<br />
people just being shadows, or logging in as an &quot;unknown&quot; race.<br />
<br />
sony has infected blizzard, i blame this on the furor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm.  to group you need a tank a healer and DPS.<br />
<br />
Sounds familar. Like every role palying game in the entire world since the dawn of time.<br />
<br />
Soloing though would suck if they are making it harder. I thought WoW was all about quest based leveling anyway isnt it ?<br />
<br />
So the question is, do you mean its harder to level solo by killing things or harder to solo through quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the bugs. You realize your playing a FREE beta right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like your character was a Mage. I heard there was some nice improvements to the other classes like hunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would not get overly upset about this. Blizzard has clearly been playing around with the gameplay dynamics of WoW for a while now. Before this patch, most people were soloing. Pickup groups tended to form very briefly for difficult quests, then dissolve as soon as the quest was complete. The only time I ever grouped for long periods of time was when my EQ friends logged on.<br />
<br />
I think they are trying to encourage more grouping. They did add the Quest Share feature this patch, which is huge. Part of the reason there was so much soloing was that everyone would be working on different quests at different times, so it was hard to make grouping worthwhile, given the enormous experience and loot rewards from quests.<br />
<br />
At some point, Blizzard will decide what type of game they want, and then we will all decide whether their decision makes for a fun game. If you don't like the current gameplay dynamic, use the suggest tool to let them know. Right now, I think they are experimenting to find their ideal balance between the relative efficiency of grouping vs. soloing.<br />

It's beta. It's free. A lot of things are broken right now - that's what testing is for.</div></div><hr />

The blue text at the top is of a blizzard rep, its your standard mmorpg grouping rules.  This last patch made the game alot harder.  At the moment folks are saying too hard, maybe it is.  And maybe thats a good thing. Or maybe its just ac and regen rates are a little off.  I got owned today by 2 mobs 4 lvls below me. Prepatch i coulda taken 5 with out a problem.

you should work to have fun in a game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you should work to have fun in a game?<br />
<br />
Because work is rewarding  and rewards are fun?<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, if you want fun with no effort, go buy a level 65 400AA toon in EQ and go have fun. Remember, EQ, you know that game your playing now or used to play, was much slower and you loved it. You played it for a long time and enjoyed it and got hooked on it. It was a game based on work = reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>xanier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, I think one should have to work to get rewarded. However, I do at the same time understand there are those who want nothing more then to log in and slaughter thousands of mobbo's and then log out. I happen to totally agree with hard core and easier servers to accommadate both types of players. Just my 2cents. But Yes one, imho, should have to work to get a max level character. <br />

How's the tauren shaman? Good class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How's the tauren shaman? Good class?<br />
<br />
Ive only played two classes to near max level.  Yet have been listening to all my friends about the goods and bads of their classes.  Those two classes Ive played being a dwarf pally(pvp server) and a tauren shaman(carebear server).  These are both faction specfic classes so I wanted to see the benifits of both.  They are both fun and totaly different. They are the back up healers/rezzers/grouponlybuffers of WoW.  Honestly I love my pally alot more than my shaman.  But dont get me wrong I love the shaman as well, its alot of fun, yet not what you imagine as a eq shaman.  As well its not the EQ pally you automatically think of tanking, its the back up healer, dps pally, constantaly buffing group memebers.  They each bring their own basket of similar goodies to the table.  They are pretty balanced with a unique view of bringing the same food to the table.  As a shaman i lay down 4 totems,quested items, one for each element. In my own opinion too many totems.  As a shaman grouped I drop a earth totem to take of X amount of damage from every melee attack to all of the group or if im grouped with another shaman i drop a str totem to add melee dps. Then a water totem that boosts the regen of mana or hps to the group.  Third a wind totem that could add more agi (ie 50% of dps to dps melees),or a proc totem that makes ever memeber attack 3x every 5th hit, or a totem that anulls the damage of every spell cast 1x. Fouth would be the fire totem, i can cast a nuke totem to nuke the closest mob for X amount over X anount of time or add a fire proc of X amount to my group mates which wont stack with the wind totem.  Once its all balance youll slap down 4 totems and melee if your not the main healer(i hate being main healer not sure if we can pull it off in big fights). So the shaman sounds fun right? Yea it is.  Well the tauren shaman has one aspcet that puts them to the bottom of the list.  At the lvl of 40 of every class/race you get to buy mounts for 100 gold(alot of money, a good few weeks of farming cash).  However tauren dont have mounts.  They have a skill called Plainsrunning. Same speed as a mount etc but if a mob hits you you drop to normal run speed.  Imagine being mounted in EQ and if a lvl 5 mob hits you you dismount and go to normal run speed.  Yea its pretty terrible as you could imagine.  Hopefully this could be resolved by the end of beta.  If its, not I recomend anything but a tauren. Every class has to pay 100gold(alot of cash) for a mount except for warlocks(necros w/ uber pets) and pallies and any class of Tauren.  ATM i would not recomend a tauren shaman, go orc or troll.  I love the tauren look of the HUGE COW, but with the state of plains running  its not worth it. Sadly i wont get to play WoW when it goes live, due to my 5 year militarty contract.  However im trying to feed back as much as i can to make it aswome.  Im on my 12th beer, i hope that made sence.  If not ask Questions!!!<br />

<br />
Don't worry, it's just beta... it will probably change. Surely they wouldn't do something this atrocious to the game.</div></div><hr />

It might be changed in such a way that I would stop liking WoW, but others might like it a lot. My point was that Blizzard appears to be experimenting with radically different valuations for soloing vs. grouping. They will decide what the ideal is for their game, and then we will vote with our wallets.<br />
<br />
It's simply too early to tell. Each patch has made huge, sweeping revisions to the game mechanics. Some things carry over while others do not. This is Blizzard's chance to experiment with all the possible gameplay dynamics without enraging paying customers.<br />
<br />
Some of you are apparently suffering from some kind of SOE-induced post-traumatic stress disorder. Just because SOE is a poorly run company doesn't mean that Blizzard will be. Of course, there is also the chance that Blizzard will fall prey to the same incompetence that we all know and love.<br />
<br />
Given that we have no experience with Blizzard MMORPGs in retail, I think I'll just wait and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think Lineage II had a better idea. All classes can solo in thier own little way. The big balance is that all classes level at approximately the same rate, soloing. The groups are morphic in that you can replace anyone in the group with any class and still be as or nearly effective as you were. <br />
<br />
Of course, there are situational advantages to using certain classes in certain situations, but those situations are always changing. Your group uses tactics, and MOBS use tactics.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine being kited by a caster. I think this would be great. Use some RL mechanics in it. If I have a ranged attack and you do not, and I'm in a place you can not get to...guess what, you better run or your gonna die. There is no &quot;special magic&quot; that enables you to hit me regardless of weapon range.<br />
<br />
Now the mob might run behind a building for cover, but that makes SENSE!<br />
<br />
Or how about coming up on a Group of mobs. Mobs that use GROUP tactics.<br />
<br />
Nah, I think I'll pass on WoW, it is sounding less and less like something I would like. Wonder how EQ 2 is going to compare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">OH NOES A BETA PATCH THAT ISN'T PERFECTLY BALANCED AND HAS SOEM BUGZ TEH SKY IS FALLING TEH SKY IS FALLING!!!1111!!11<br />
<br />
Time to settle down kiddies.  The game was too easy before.  It may be a little to hard now.  There are certainly a lot of bugs to be worked out before we can have any objective opinion on that though.  All this proves is that Blizzard made a huge mistake in deciding not to have an NDA, because people are obviously unable to handle beta information in a remotely appropriate manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I really do not understand the Fuzz about all this patch from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I play a warlock. Now for those who are not into WoW let me explain what a warlock is. Think of an EQ shaman with only 3 DoT's (that do not stack with the DoT's from other warlocks like ours a long time ago), no slow and no tanking ability so that dog dog has to do the tanking.<br />
I am level 51 now and my pet still has level 39 abilities, I have a large number of spells that do nothing (I have see invis but there is no invis in the game just to name something) and Oh yeah I can create Soulstones (a &quot;rezz-yourself&quot; that can be traded)<br />
My DPS is lower at level 51 then my mage at level 40 (by a factor 2.4)<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
I am still having a blast.<br />
<br />
The game is fun, the game is entertaining and sure Blizzard adjusted the &quot;walk in the park&quot; to the level cap but at least they have a plan where they want to end with classes (being a beta this plan is adjusted every now and then but that is why we have this long beta)<br />
<br />
And Kurt, I still solo stuff 5 levels above me. Even with the most underpowered class in the curent beta. 8)<br />
I think WoW will be a great game a game that has the best of a lot of current games (including EQ)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's amusing hearing the EQ raider mentality again after spending most of my time in the Grey after I quit EQ and now that I have access to the WoW beta.  &quot;Carebear&quot;, &quot;kiddie&quot;, &quot;whiner&quot;, &quot;Diablo kiddie&quot;, &quot;BNet kiddie&quot;, etc... how joyous to hear those wonderful terms once more reminding me and my dollars of what we're missing. :)<br />
<br />
Those who know me from previous &quot;raider vs. non-raider&quot; posts know that I am an advocate for the non-raid player that make up the vast majority of the potential customer pool for any MMORPG.  I posted my initial impressions of WoW right here on the Crucible in the WoW section.  It's a little premature after the last patch to say the sky is falling, but having said that, it might still be a good idea to get indoors.<br />
<br />
I'm going to reserve any more in depth comment until I can play at least another week and see if my intuition is correct or if it's just the huge class nerf I suffered (I chose undead mage as my first character because both racial traits and talents were &quot;done&quot;).  <br />
<br />
I still have a lot more faith in Blizzard at this point than SOE, but my former boundless optimism has suffered a harsh dose of reality.  I just hope Blizzard shoots for the 4 million person market a la Diablo instead of the 400K (*cough* more like 300K if even that *cough*) EQ market.  In the end I'm not out any cash and it's their game and not mine, so that will be the sum total of my &quot;whining&quot; (one last nod to the EQ raiders- you know I still love you!). :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean seriously, if you want fun with no effort, go buy a level 65 400AA toon in EQ and go have fun<br />
<br />
<br />
this is ignorance.  what's the point of making a self-righteous comment so general that you've stripped it of any meaningful insight<br />
<br />
player behavior belies your bull**** statement.  most players have alts.  MANY players have leveled multiple alts to 65.  if mindless grinding is fun, what percent of people start their alts at lvl 1 with noob gear and level up in groups or play like a true new player with no twink gear?<br />
<br />
the answer is because grinding isn't fun at all... achievement is fun.  many many people LOVE to level up alts but that's to see the levels and AAs come.  grinding a la EQ is not fun.  if you say it is you're full of **** or an ******* or both.<br />
<br />
believe it or not... twinking isn't a natural consequence of MMPOG.  in fact in many games that preceeded EQ, twinking and powerleveling were not common.  in fact as late as kunark there was a serious stigma to twinking out a toon but that in EQ terms has gradually lost any sort of resisence because players have realized that pointless grinding in eq is just a waste of time.<br />
<br />
and for those who say, well I powerlvl cause there are no groups.  how shortsighted can you be?  there's NO GROUPS because IT'S NO FUN and people have better things to do not the other way around.<br />
<br />
the true answer is that, a certain level of effort for a return is what makes ANY game.. computer, board game, athletics fun.  shigeru miyamoto probably the most respected video game designer has a famous quote paraphrased along the lines of &quot;ideas dont make games fun it's the hard work of managing player risk and reward...)<br />
<br />
if you argue that other games must be like EQ... a game that's so out of wack that twinking is almost mandatory, ebay is an option and grinding makes play a game at time akin to work, you're the worst sort of conservative holder-on and syncophant<br />

<br />
Games need time sinks or they won't work. GET IT? How Blizzard designs it will make all the difference. In the end, they realize they must either make super hard grinds like they have in the past with easy as hell content. You thought eq had hell levels.. you obviously do not have a level 99 in Diablo 2. Blizard knows hell levels better than all :) <br />
<br />
I don't see their forumula changing. People in beta are learning the fastest quests to get leveled up.. and the less people required to achieve things in a game, the sooner the game nears it's end. Their choice as I see it is to make a really fun game, lots of levels and things to do that are fairly easy, and just dish out expansion after expansion every 3 months.. lots of content and people racing to the end of one.. just like everquest except more expansions because the content doesn't have time sinks..<br />

<br />
Am I understanding you correctly here:<br />
<br />
Something like the EQ shaman epic quest where you do a hand in and die, and your mates actually kill the mob and then res you - thats fine.  But if there was a tough, challenging quest that you had to do on your own, stand on your own two feet - now that you wouldn't like?</div></div><hr />

I spend eight to twelve hours a day actually working a tedious job, the last thing I want to do in my time off is 'play' a tedious videogame.  While some degree of challenge is not only fun, but necessary for enjoying a game, there is a balance that must be struck to avoid crossing the very fine line between realistic effort and plain old drudgery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldnt say needed, but if your main healer is a druid, its nice to have a rezzer and backup healer around.<br />

EQ retunes AFTER deploying to production.  Say after me, testing=good.  I don't know if I'll play WoW, but I'm pretty much done with SoE (only compelling arguments from my former guildmembers will get me anywhere close to EQ2).  I've liked past Blizzard games (although only as single player or LAN games, the internet multiplayer community turned me off, not a Blizzard issue), they generally do a good job responding to players.</div></div><hr />

Only one difference: Sony plays this kind of crap to paying customers, Blizzards WoW is still in Beta.<br />

Just out of curiosity, what game hav you been playing these past 5 years? Because as far as I can tell, EQ has gotten less and less about &quot;Drudgery&quot; and more and more about &quot;Instant Gratification&quot; as its gotten older. First Year EQ was about 10 times more tedious than this current version. Every single expansion, with the possible exception of Gates, has made the game easier and easier. Gates was a return to the more classic &quot;style&quot; of play, long runs to zones, rare spells, very difficult areas (who remembers trying to kill Fire Giants at lvl 45, or trying to break Fear, even at level 50). You didnt see a bunch of people bitching and moaning about Fear, and wanting that armor &quot;easier for the masses&quot; in those days. Now, if a player cant get what he wants within a weeks time, they BITCH. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is probably trying to figure out how to keep WoW playable on the long term. Its something they have a problem with in their games. They have AWESOME games . . . that last 6 months. They want more from this one. The Diablo 2 Model isnt gonna cut it in a game like this and they know it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can tell you one thing that has changed dramatically between the old days and now:<br />
<br />
Back then an unbuffed player with the very best armor didnt have more than twice the hitpoints and armorclass and 3 times the resists than one in regular armor. So back then survival and success in the very toughest zones was much more based on the players intelligence, skill and guts than on equipment.<br />
<br />
So if you think the game has gotten easier then YOU are probably right.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard decides to implement equally huge differences between players of the same level as we see in current day EQ then WoW will face exactly the same problems at EQ does now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Yayo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I applaud them for making the game more difficult. What concerns me with WoW and EQ2 is that you'll reach the end too quickly and will be forced to seek another game in 3 months time. This is exactly what I've always liked about EQ.. its longevity. <br />
<br />
Idealy, I want a game that takes a long time to reach the end but that road to reach it  doesn't feel overly tedious. I want the strategic depth of EQ raids. Will WoW or EQ2 offer this? I have a feeling they won't. <br />
<br />
The only game so far to openly admit that they want their game to be difficult is Vanguard.<br />
I just hope one of these new games will bring back the difficulty of pre-expansion EQ.</div></div><hr />

For the past two years how much of that is tied to the release of untested / crappy expansion after untested / crappy expansion?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  If my memory serves me correctly, top end Kunark armour for shamans was jaundiced bone - not sure of the precise numbers but an FoH barb shaman probably wouldnt have any more hps than a non-raiding Ogre shaman.</div></div><hr />

I have already conceded this point multiple times in multiple posts. The gap is too big. And if WoW is around 5 years from now, please come see me to discuss the &quot;gap&quot; there, because its hard NOT to create one. <br />
<br />
Two people are running, one is faster. After a short time, the faster person isnt THAT far ahead. However, as time passes, the faster player gets farther and farther ahead. Now granted, the distance is HUGE now, and unnecessarily so, IMHO. But I think its starting to close. The accessibility of KT by single groups of dedicated, skilled players who choose not to raid is helping a LOT. There is EP+ level loot dropping there, and in the Trials. Many drops are BETTER than some Time items. <br />
<br />
WoW is looking for the right balance. Let them look, please. If they adjust it too far one way, then I am sure they will come back, thats how BETA works. EQ had a nice balance, right up until Luclin or so (Maybe NToV). VT was the true beginning of this MASSIVE player gap.<br />
<br />
I also remember something else about those old days Spirit. The game, up too about mid-Velious, was seperated more by LEVELS than gear. However, people caught up, and now, levels 1-65 in EQ are a joke. Before Velious, GETTING there was the game. Now, getting there is where the game STARTS. Hopefully, WoW will be able to maintain some sort of linear progression that doesnt really allow this type of gap to exist, but I am not sure it will be able to succeed.</div></div><hr />

Lots of good points there Blazz. And I certainly agree that 1-65 in EQ very very quickly becomes boring beyond belief if you have done it before with one or two characters.<br />
<br />
But where WoW has a big advantage is that almost none of us (Boooh, Ceno! LOL) will have tried to level up a character in WoW when it gets released. And just the fact that it will be all new zones, mobs, quests and spells will mean that a lot of us will enjoy the levelling of a brand new character there far more than getting 20 more AAs and a slight upgrade to a spell or maybe start twink #7 in EQ. The people working for Blizzard are hopefully intelligent enough to learn from all the mistakes EQ made/makes so WoW wont have to wait 5 years to be able to compete with EQ in the fun-&quot;deparment&quot;. The competition will start the minute it is released and from then on its up to Blizzard to keep people interested. And since SOE has decided to make EQ2 the more casual oriented game I doubt EQ will change much. Sadly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I posted my initial observations of Phase 4 (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23268) in the World of Warcraft forum.  In a nutshell the game is still fun, but far less entertaining than it was.  The tedium (&quot;difficulty&quot; to some) has increased fivefold.  I too am hoping these design decisions will be reversed before it's too late.<br />
<br />
While I am no prognosticator, at the rate they're going just implementing the various classes in WoW I don't see any way they could possibly ship the game this year. I love Blizzard's commitment to near perfect, stable releases but their sales department has to be crying in their beer right now.  If they beat Q1/2005 I am going to be seriously impressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I would have to disagree that 1-50+ is boring beyond belief after multiple times.  If it is so for you it is your own fault.  I take my alts to different zone to level up.  I'll also have to tell you that any of the grind highway is boring beyond belief the first time up (Kurns-&gt;PC-HHK-&gt;DSP-&gt;DL-&gt;Teir1-&gt;PoV.<br />
<br />
Level 8-15 in OoT<br />
Take a group to TD for the 20's (the yeti things) and again the 40's (The Parrot looking Aviaks)<br />
Make silly pull calls appropriate to the area (i still have a &quot;Incoming %t, Polly wanna die &lt;squawk&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
If the leveling and growing isn't the fun and the game is keeping up with the Jonses this isn't a MMORPG nor is it EQ, it's just a twisted version of Monopoly that no one can ever permanently win.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that taking alt #5 to the same 7-10 zones to level up as Alts2-4 went to is boring.  That is not the fault of EQ.<br />
<br />
It's yours.  <br />
<br />
And every game of this type that lasts long enough will have to deal with the problem the players themselves create because it effects the longevity of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Standard MMOG design. Start overpowered, nerf hardcore, gradually scale back nerf to desired levels. People seem to get less pissed if they are nerfed once then given small boosts as opposed to getting tons of little nerfs in rapid succession (being pecked to death by birds).<br />
<br />
Oh, not every MMOG requres perfect teams to do anything.<br />
