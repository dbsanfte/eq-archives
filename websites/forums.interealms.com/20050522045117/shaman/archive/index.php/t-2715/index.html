<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Something that's struck me funny is how on so many other servers the prices on Shaman spells is so ridiculously out of hand.  I'm curious if Shaman on any other servers have tried what many of the shaman on Tribunal did.<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, and still going on, there was a kickass Shaman on Tribunal named Myzr who was in one of the Uber guilds on Tribunal and amazingly enough still managed to not be a greedy loot whoring uber like all the rest are, or at least so they say. :p <br />
<br />
Anyway, from what I remember Myzr took all the excess shaman spells their guild got and would sell them for guild funds, of course after equipping all his own guild with said spells and keeping spares as needed I assume.  The interesting part is that Myzr was not greedy, despite the implications of a name sounding terribly similar to 'miser':eek:  and capped his prices at 1k/5k.  1k for non leet spells, and 5k for the biggies such as Malo, Avatar, Bane, Pox...<br />
<br />
The net effect was that this trend caught on and in a large way still is in effect among many of the upper level Shaman on Trib.  I paid 5k each for Malo, Torpor, and Avatar from a shaman in another guild as recently as a month ago. :D  As far as I know, Torpor typically sells for around 10k on Tribunal even now that the demand has gone up much more than the supply.  At least, I know several shaman that cap their price at that if/when they have one to sell.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Now Myzr kicked this trend off, or at least that's what I hear since I was too low level to be effected back when this started up, but it continues on to this day.  I talk to shaman often who will simply refuse to pay the 20k+ prices some spell farmers ask for high level spells, and the result is that after enough tells about how their price is too high, even these farmers start to bring their prices down to more reasonable levels.<br />
<br />
So, get together on your server with the other guilds and work out an inter-shaman trading community.  It pays to work together, or rather it at least costs less. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE:  I'm a relatively new Oracle, so if one of the older Tribunal Shaman wants to correct the facts here, feel free.  The gist of this post is that you non-Tribunal Shaman should try to do something similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh yeah, did I mention that the Shaman Community on Tribunal ROCKS? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice thought and love to see it work, but naive to think it will. There are now guilds bidding for Malo for their shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice idea but in my opinion, it just wont work mainly because of the Rich, which is why the prices are so high in the first place.<br />
<br />
So many times I seen I quote &quot;Buying Torpor and Malo Paying obscenely well&quot;, I cant blame them however, after all they have the money and want the spell.<br />
<br />
Other little things give players hints on how rare and expensive our spells are as well.  <br />
<br />
For example someone posted 2 days back a Shaman offering 750k for Malo, at the end it was told he was only kidding BUT at the time no one thought he was kidding, no one had the spell to offer even for that much.  <br />
<br />
By doing this he only made it worse for himself and other shaman on his server because it gives other players an idea on how rare this spell really is which in turn makes the spell even more expensive knowing the rarity.<br />
<br />
So in a nutshell its our fault, the Shaman class, why the prices are so high for our spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I am not one of the &quot;uber&quot; shaman on The Tribunal, but I can verify the outline of Sciek's comments.<br />
more recently, another shaman posted a &quot;first come, first served&quot; give away of some of the less-rare spells (Form of Great Bear, Acumen, etc.)    ....   Unfortunately Demyte is in an Aussie guild - my play time never overlapped his  8(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I for one don't EXPECT the Ubers to blue-light special these spells. Not their responsibility or job to sell spells at a discount. Sure as Stuttgart I wouldn't.<br />
<br />
The fault does NOT lie with us - the fault lies with Verant. Christ - quit with the victim routine. WE didn't institute programming placing these spells on MOBs that are hard as heck for small guilds or a pickup group to kill, nor did we make them rarer than a KKK Grand Dragon at a Nation of Islam meeting.<br />
<br />
On Xev there are people with  HUNDREDS  of thousands of plat. You think THEY are gonna let a spell walk at 5k for an alt just because Shaman_01 is broke?<br />
<br />
Fek no.<br />
<br />
Yes I know, I should quit my whining, worship at the altar of Nixx and go get my VP key. <br />
<br />
Glad things are working out for you Tribunal guys. Sheit ain't like that where I hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not even a nice thaught.<br />
<br />
I would much rather live on a server with lots of spell farmers then on a server with price controlls.  On one you can get your spells cheep if you can get them at all.  On the other you can get your spells easy but expensive.<br />
<br />
I would rather have a copy of Torpor now for 40k then one 6 months from now for 5k.<br />
<br />
High prices motivate people to a) go manufacture copies of spells buy killing everthing that drops them,  b) bring that spell to market instead of just letting it collect dust in the bank.  <br />
<br />
I personaly don't think a lot of people are &quot;farming&quot; spells but high prices do encourage people to bring spells to market.<br />
<br />
If you want to create a shortage on your server then go ahead and implament price controlls.  It sounds great but it is a stupid idea.<br />

Shaman sent me a tell last week <br />
<br />
&quot;You got malo?&quot;<br />
<br />
no<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a copy for sale, how much you paying?&quot;<br />
<br />
000000000pp buddy. Go rob some other shaman thanks.<br />
<br />
Eventually I will get malo, and my kunark spellbook will be complete. Only shaman spell I ever bought were a few of the group buffs ( 500pp each ), 55 pet (1k)<br />
<br />
Hell I paid 5k for mod rod 2 for a mage friend. Thats the most I ever spent on a spell, and its the most I will ever spend.<br />
<br />
I will either loot malo myself or my guild will get me a copy. Just a matter of patience and principal. If you cant wait for the right opportunity then you deserve to get jacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;get jacked&quot; <br />
<br />
What that mean?  <br />
<br />
If I buy Malo for 150kp  (paid 12.5 kp for mine) it would be a volantary transactions and just fine.  Both parties get what they want.<br />
<br />
Charity is also very nice...  If joo want to practice charity then that is a guud moral thing to do and very kind.<br />
<br />
&quot;0000000pp buddy.  Go rob some other shaman thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
No one is robing anyone LoL...  If joo not want it dont buy it.  If joo do then who was doing the robing?  Seams like both parties agread to the transaction.  I have yet to have anyone reach out of my computer screen and force my index finger to click the left mouse button over the trade button.<br />
<br />
Charity is very nice...  I practice it both in game and in real life.  Forcing others to participate in the charities that joo like is not nice or moral or guud.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, Faern understands that the player's aren't in control of drop rates, and Radag hit the economic points dead on.  Am I reading The Crucible?  This is amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">People are out to rob you on somethings, like malo. They want to find out how much you are willing to pay, basically it has nothing to do with what its worth, or what is reasonable. If you let it happen, then you are a sucker and it will continue to happen to other people. <br />
<br />
I'm not forcing anyone to do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's true that if all shaman refused to pay 30k for Malo etc that we could drive the price down.  But people aren't willing to do that.  Some of them have 30k+ burning holes in their pockets, plus Guilds definately aren't willing to wait.<br />
Personally, it'll take me 6months to get 30k, so either way, I wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">30k... last two copies sold on Brell went for 90k and 85k. Sick I say!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Words have meaning?<br />
<br />
Rob == to take somthing away from by forse : to steal.<br />
<br />
When the transaction is volantary no one is getting robbed.  No forse is involved.<br />
<br />
&quot;what its worth&quot;<br />
<br />
Things are worth just exactly what 2 people are willing to trade for it.  No more no less.  Price points can very quite a bit from trade to trade depending on the opinions of the participants and the value each places on the items in trade.<br />

<br />
I FEEL like I am being robbed if I pay more than 5K for any spell. Therefore, I don't. <br />
<br />
You enjoy manipulating the economy to make plat? You get a kick out of it? Fine. Personally thats not why I play, so I choose to stay out of it. I get much more enjoyment through HELPING PEOPLE instead of wringing every last plat out of them I can.<br />
<br />
Having giant stacks of plat will only get you so far in this game.<br />
<br />
Having giant lists of friends will get you everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the spells arent that rare or hard to obtain, quit whining so much ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As a shaman who has bought or traded for many of her spells, I think it is cool that someone is selling them at reasonable rates.<br />
<br />
At the same time, it's really not the way things can work for everyone.<br />
<br />
Say you, or your guild, are forced to pay 50k for Malo.  Well, not forced, but the guild decides it is a 50k investment they are making in you to help everyone.  Then one day you are in a guild group in the Seb crypt doin exp, you kill Chottal and lo and behold another copy of Malo.   Well, you have no need for it anymore, and the guildbank is down 50k for your copy.  I think most guilds are going to try and get that money back.  /shrug<br />
<br />
As I said, I have bought many of my spells.   I made the money for buying my spells from selling other spells.  <br />
<br />
A group of my friends and I lived down at Juggs, doing Tola and Prot as much as possibly, back before the drop rates were tuned.  This was our concerted effort to get me Torpor and it worked, my copy of Torpor is from Tolapumj.  They knew how powerful of a spell it is and how much more it could allow us to do.  So in the process, we outfitted the majority of our small guild in all their Kunark spells, our friends in all their Kunark spells and sold the rest for whatever we could get.   <br />
<br />
Money from our spell sales (in part or whole) allowed people in the group to buy things like a Cowl of Mortality, RBG, Orb of the Infinite Void, Lodi Shield, etc.  Money to our guildbank from spell sales financed purchases of 2 copies of Blessing of Aegolism and a copy of Group Focus and Warsong of the VahShir and more.<br />
<br />
So, did we sell extra shaman spells?  Heck yeah.  Tirgirs and BoN are still good sellers.  Now we do Juggs to get sinew (or try, sigh) for Chardok Quests.  Do I feel bad selling them?  Not at all, I checked if any friends needed them first.  No one is forcing you to buy any of the 56-59 spells, none of are of critical importance.  I could have bought those spells if I felt I had to have them the moment I could scribe them.   I waited and got them myself, but I was level 60 when I scribed them.   I don't regret that choice.  It is certainly the choice I would make again, especially with the drop rates being increased.  (edit:  I did actually buy Pox and was gifted a copy of VoB)<br />
<br />
I don't see how what we did was anything other than a win/win situation.  Lots of people who cannot or are unwilling to go farm Kunark spells got Kunark spells from us.  I got a copy of Torpor.  My guildmates and friends made money for buying other spells we needed and for really nice equipment upgrades.<br />
<br />
Just as a note, I've never sold a copy of Malo or Torpor.   I've never seen Malo drop, and Torpor only once, which is my copy.  I was deathly anxious I would never get either of those spells.   Not because I wasn't willing to buy them, just because they didn't exist on our server at the time I was wanting to scribe them.   Personally I think there are several shaman on our server who would be happy to see Malo or Torpor for sale, at most any price.  It just isn't available at all it seems.<br />
<br />
Perhaps again it all comes down to playstyle.  Some people, like myself have the time and resources to farm plat.  I do not have the resources to *farm* Kunark Dragons, or the Kunark spell dropping dragons in WW.   Some folks like Krakster are very against buying spells.  That's cool too, that's their choice.   My choice was to stick with my small guild and do whatever I could to get my spells, how ever I could.  They helped me every step of the way.<br />
<br />
I would imagine with the manaburn teams becoming larger everyday that soon enough we will see plenty more kunark rares on the market.  More supply=less demand=lower prices.   I mean afterall, just yesterday 12 wizards killed Sonty (on Prexus I think) and grats to them on a copy of Torpor.<br />
<br />
Wow that's some rambling.<br />

PS - I don't give spells to Uggok.  He have to buy all spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree in theory, Krakster, but don't be so hard on people selling high level spells.  The chance that the spells are actually the property of the seller is pretty small.  Spells won on guild raids belong to the guild and the sellers have an obligation to their guild to secure the best price possible (high level raids are NOT cheap, with all the dots, pearls, coffins, emeralds and what have you).<br />
<br />
The one time I had a spare copy of Torpor for sale it was agony.  I've always given away the less valuable spells (focus, bear form, 55 pet, whatever) but I just couldn't do whatever I wanted with Torpor, it was too valuable.  Torpor was not mine to sell, the guild trusted me to sell it for a good price to get a much needed cash infusion.<br />
<br />
Since I had one spare copy of Torpor and one shaman who still needed Malo, ideally I wanted to do an even swap, but I couldn't find anyone with a spare Malo.<br />
<br />
I couldn't stand to sell Torpor to friends for 50K and I didn't have the freedom to sell it for 5K, I ended up trading it for several other spells needed by my guildies.  No money changed hands and hopefully everyone was happy, but it definitely wasn't an easy couple of weeks deciding what to do.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, did I mention that the Shaman Community on Tribunal ROCKS? :D <br />
<br />
yes, the biggest jerks seems to be mostly other classes.<br />
<br />
and yes, our spell prices seem to be more reasonable than other servers. however, i really attribute this  to what seems like a smaller oracle population than other servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First off, I like Sciek's sugestion, better still his intentions, however Faern has the jist of it.  It isn't the responsibility of the haves to equip the have nots.  If it happens, then I salute your marvelous community and hope to see similar on mine, however, I wouldn't count my chickens.  Uber john owes me jack squat, what he does with his stuff is his own business.<br />
<br />
As for the economics, I'm with Krakster.  Although ethically it isn't robery if 2 people consent to a price, thats simply semantics.  In practice these are often critical spells that majorly increase our effectiveness to our guilds and those we service.  If the going rate for torpor is 40k and you are unwilling to pay more than 10K, AND the you are being shot down for not having them (peer pressure, passed over on raids, whatever) then its more like extortion.  Extortion is similar to robbery, but the extorter is demanding outrageous fees and the extortee consents due to a sense of necessity (feigned or otherwise).  Either way its wrong.  The fault here though is VI's, they buggared the drops and allow this economy to exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gloriana, I understand that entirely. Spells obtained through guild efforts are a different subject imo. Running a guild can be very expensive, im sure. 'Dots, Emeralds, DS potions, portalfrags, coffins, etc etc etc add up quickly. If a guild gets their hands on a spell and needs to sell it for guild funds or trade for other spells, hey, thats great. I've got no problem with those sorts of transactions.<br />
<br />
Its all a personal decision. If I ever get spare copies of Ultra rare superpowerful spells, i'm sure I might sell one if I dont know a guildie or a good friend that needs it. And if I do sell one it will be for 5k, and absolulty no higher. I can always use a little extra plat for dots for cleric friends, pearls for mage friends, emeralds for me, and alchemy money. I just dont like the &quot;OMFG I WON THE EQ LOTTO B/C I LEWTED A SPELL OMG /who all 60 shaman /tell malolessshaman_73 OMG I HAVE MALO PAY ME LOTZ OF PLATZ OMG I PWN&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/shrug I guess I've just had really good luck and our perhaps smaller community of Shaman are a bit nicer to each others pocketbooks than some servers.  Or mebbe we're all just poor bastids and we know none of us can afford to pay the prices you fellas do heh. ;)<br />
<br />
I don't mean to suggest that it's anyone's responsibility to sell for a lower price than they want.  I just thought it was really cool that on Tribunal our prices are typically a lot lower than those reported here for other servers so I thought I'd share what happened that at least in some way contributed to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That's my point, I would argue that the majority of high level shaman spells are obtained via guild raids: on the way to Trak, farming Juggs, Kunark outdoor dragons, Queen/King Chardok raids.<br />
<br />
While it is not inconceivable that a single group might be able to get 59/60 shaman spells (guardian wurms, Emperor, etc.) the majority of those selling high level spells are selling them for their guild.<br />
<br />
But I agree with you, if I ever got a copy of Torpor or Malo that was my own copy to do with as I wanted and no guildmates needed, I would probably gift it to a friend (of course, my two friends that needed it to the most, now have it! /wave Snoww /wave Tanuden).</div></div><hr />

As far as prices all I can say is I spent 3 months looking for Torpor.  When you go that long trying to get one item sometimes you pay more just to finally get it.   I ended up getting a good deal on Torpor but if I had to wait much longer.  Who knows how much I might have been willing to spend to get it.<br />

<br />
I just find it rude that since 60, I've logged about 300+ hours specifically on KUNARK raids/mobs that drop these spells and have seen ONE 60 shaman spell drop (Malo thankfully heh). 300 hours for one spell is just plain rude, especially when you work full time and EQ is a GAME hah.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Maybe I'm a little strange, but I find this conversation slightly ironic. To paraphrase, it's perfectly acceptable to spend hundreds of thousands of plat to buy something you're not in a good position to obtain by yourself. Buying torpor instead of getting your guild to raid it with you. <br />
<br />
But any shaman who even suggested buying the Epic MQ would be trashed to Fear and back. Yes, I agree, taking down very high level boss mobs is very different from taking down one of the golems in Fear. But for some of us, it's simply a matter of scale. My guild couldn't raid Fear if we wanted to. I must wait until another guild is willing to take me and allow me to loot it (not to mention the final fight with Rak). Oh well, maybe some day. Besides, I couldn't come close to paying the 10k for it anyways. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">joo welcome krackster...<br />
<br />
Econimcs is a fairly simple subject...  just amazing how few people know anything about it.  Mez glad to help joo out and give joo a little simple lesson.<br />
<br />
If joo want to do a little charity and give or sell away the spell joo loot and / or sell them at very cheep prices then that is fine.  Even very nice.<br />
<br />
I personaly have benifited from this kind of behavior and was gratefull.  I have also done the same kind of thing for others.<br />
<br />
I also agree wid joo that this is a game and I dont spend much time at all sitting in da tunnel buying and selling.  I personaly don't like sales people very much IRL and even less in da game.  When I get things I want to sell  (very rare) I do so at cheep prices bucause I hate sitting in EC.  More commonly I just give stuff to my guild or newbs.<br />
<br />
In all the years I have spent in EQ I have made exactly 2 big trades which worked out too my advantage.  Both where initiated buy the person on da other side.  In one I sold my JBB for 40k and in another  a copy of Torpor for 40k also.   I did not auction either item even one time.  Both the shaman I sold 2 where very happy to get the items in question and in the long run I replaced both at a much lower price.<br />
<br />
Please explain to me how this is robery?<br />
<br />
An effort to fix the prices of rare spells at a low price will simply reslult in the spell becomin more rare.  I don't view this as a guud thing at all.  As you have so kindly pointed out,  this is simple High School economics.   I just can't beleive that this dumb idea springs up so many times in both this game and IRL.<br />

Then any other copies will be given to shaman that I deem worthy. (It is my right to do so. Sound prickish but a hot boxed powerlevled bot ain't going to get a free copy of torpor)<br />

If the guild goes somewhere and gets a spell I will determine where it goes. (Repeat after me: It's good to be the king!) If we have an up and coming shaman it goes to them. if not and none on the horizion then I will start hunting. I might even make it a quest to get the spell. Since I am a bit of an avid roleplayer. (Or make em choose, jump through the quest hoops, or pay what I paid, I am not sure yet.) <br />

Or hell I might just hand it to the next shaman I meet. I don't ever knoww what Snoww is going to run into tonight, and that is why I love the game. You never know what is going to happen.<br />

Charging obscene amounts of money for spells is pathetic, even if that is what &quot;everyone else&quot; is doing.<br />

I'm an oracle in an excellent guild of Saryrn, Ancient Council.

An effort to fix the prices of rare spells at a low price will simply reslult in the spell becomin more rare.  I don't view this as a guud thing at all.

<br />
*burp* <br />
<br />
price fixing never works irl, never will in game. fix it too low, people will by em all up and sell higher (the &quot;real&quot; price). accusing people of robbery does nothing -- they're just charging what the maket will pay :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't even have to go to high-school to work that one out.<br />
<br />
If you feel like you're being robbed... don't pay it. When every other shaman on the server has it (HA!) except for you, and three people are trying to sell it. Then you get to set the price. If you don't think Torpor/Malo is worth XXpp then don't pay that much. You may have to wait longer than RichShaman01 but you may get both Torpor AND Malo for the same price they paid for just one.<br />
<br />
Half the reason people pay too much for things is because they respond to &quot;How much will you give me for it?&quot; or aren't patient enough. I always throw lowball prices at people when they're trying to sell things. Sometimes they get frustrated after a few days and crack. If you see them there a few days feel free to bug them too. Gotta wear them down... ;)<br />
<br />
This isn't just &quot;a game&quot; either. In a game you can win. In EQ the only person that wins is Verant when you hand over your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have been fortunate with spells. Focus, Malo, Torpor, VoB all came from my guild. I paid 10k for group focus and I think its worth every penny, though it was most of my cash.<br />

<br />
But again, it's simply a matter of scale. My old guild just merged with another. I finally had the resources to kill Dire almost six months after I started my epic. :) But Hole and Fear are out of the question. So I have to find a guild that will let me tag along, hope the golems are up, allow me to loot an epic drop (most guilds reserve epic items), and raid after 6pm PST or on a weekend (this being by far the rarest piece). No amount of camping, playing, begging, kicking, balancing or petitioning will make this combination &quot;drop&quot; any faster. ;) <br />
<br />
It just seems unfair that shamans who try their best but don't have the resources to get such piddly things like their epic will be called cheaters. But for everyone else, it's okay to &quot;play as the game best allows you.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Krakster illustrated the classical dilemma for some Shaman - spell acquiring mechanism.<br />
<br />
The Hand is probably the # 3 guild on Xev. They can kill any Antonican MOB (with alts I am sure), any Kunark MOB, any old-world Planar MOB. I am sure they can clean Dane 425's clock as well as Tormax. (Non zerg-rush style)<br />
<br />
He is fortunate enough to be in a guild that GAVE him his spells.<br />
<br />
GAVE.<br />
<br />
He did not have to work for them, he simply had to log on. Sure he attended raids, but I'll bet dollars to Abashi donughts that the focus / purpose of the raid was not to acquire Shaman spells.<br />
<br />
Now I am not begrudging him his spells. Gratz, more power to you etc.<br />
<br />
At least he had the sack to ADMIT his guild gave him spells. <br />
<br />
Does Faern wave good-bye to The Well in order to get his spells? Cuz mounting a Juggs raid is a VERY dicey proposition for our postage stamp-sized guild.<br />
<br />
Well of course not. But some do. They do so out of frustration with spell drops, their class and a perceived inability to succesfully complete encounters because they DON'T have the spells that others do.<br />
<br />
Hey - I put in a TON of hours on toons in Sebilis. As many or more than Oracles hunting in the lotto spots.<br />
<br />
But The Well ain't taking down Sev, Wuoshi, Gor, and we certainly aren't invading VP any time soon.<br />
<br />
So I have two choices:<br />
<br />
1) Whack HG's and The Ghoul Arch Magus until I am ally with U Guk Frogs and the bane of every Druid in Rm so I can get 80k to futher line the pockets of the Ubah's on Xev<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2) Wave goodbye to a great bunch of people and seek greater pixelated pleasure elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Now anyone who knows me in game knows I can be a burr under your saddle, so of course option 2 ain't my style.<br />
<br />
I'd rather bitch, spend the time and not have the spells than have some l337 fekker hand them to me from a MOB I have never even seen before.<br />
<br />
Again not knocking you Krakster - your guild is large and in charge - but not every one has that option.<br />
<br />
Kudos tho for being honest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm on Stormhammer, and yeah, I already pay $40 a month for dwindling leet customer service. However, I DON'T have buttloads of plat.<br />
<br />
It saddened me to see that once I got to a level where I needed more necessary spells, I had to pay a lot more money. It seemed like such a backbiting situation. For instance: I applied to an all 60 guild, and one of the first questions they asked me was, do you have Torpor? Not, how long have you played, how well do you know your class..but do you have a spell that costs 50k?<br />
<br />
On SH, we have these anon guild mules that sell spells..they are most likely from Leviathan or TR. I would love to find out who they were selling for, simply because it would be very interesting to catch them in a situation where they really needed me to cast a spell....that I don't have because of the price. Oh? Torpor you say? Lemme look....NOPE! Don't have it, sorry. I'll shout for a rez for you.<br />
<br />
One person has suggested to me that these uber spells could be considered like uber weapons..but hey...once you get a spell, you have it always. You don't loose it when you die, (unless you delevel), and it is beneficial to others in most cases. Equipment is NOT the same as spells...spells make the caster who they are and very beneficial to their guild or group.<br />
<br />
Hence....I continue to feel that spells shouldn't be treated like the mother load. I NEVER have a problem handing out buffs when I'm running around....and I never ask for donations. That's just me..but I know a lot of folk are like that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>oldlurk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">...instead of getting your guild to raid it with you. <br />
<br />
<br />
I play since July 99, did a few pauses, still no torpor.<br />
<br />
I am in a good standing guild, was on Karana and now on AB ( www.justice-divine.com ).<br />
<br />
We killed a few kunark dragons (they were on rotation on Karana) and a lot of Trakanon / Jumpy / prot.<br />
We raided a lot of chardok bosses for epics.<br />
We cleaned VP a few times.<br />
<br />
Today when a kunark target is up we have other priorities.<br />
<br />
In the past i always thought it was a question of patience, did not bother to look to buy the spell, i was sure to loot it one day.<br />
<br />
But as we no longer raid those targets susceptible to drop torpor, i tried to auction in the last month for a Torpor.<br />
<br />
I did not find any offer and every time i was in the auction channel i saw at least 2 to 3 other shamans looking to buy torpor.<br />
<br />
Looks like more patience will be required...</div></div><hr />

Or just take the popular alternative, retire shaman and make a melee twink.  -Gives you perspective on just how much of an accomplishment getting a shaman to 60 is.  <br />

However, &quot;just log on&quot; is a bit extreme. If someone says raid, or &quot;I need help&quot; no matter what for, I drop what I am doing and head there. <br />
<br />
I went 3+ months without torpor and I was in a guild that wouldn't put out the effort to take down targets that could drop my spells. I did alot of emporer camping, I understand how much is sucks and how rare they drop. When that guild fell apart I made it a point to join up with a guild that had a better chance of providing me with my spells. (not the ONLY reason I joined The Hand, I have a RL friend in it and a few longtime eq friends.)<br />
<br />
Obviously that is not an option for everyone. But I also understand how much of a pain in the ass it is to aquire these spells, and THAT is why I will never sell them for tons of plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">There is no way to enforce an embargo like that on a blue EQ server.  The temptation to defect from the agreement is enormous, the chances of you being identified as the defector are negligible, and there are very few ways for the cartel to punish the defector even if they are identified.  Prisoner's <br />
<br />
That is why this will not work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, if you could get the cartel to work...<br />
<br />
The &quot;lower prices mean lower supply&quot; theory is not really a very significant problem here.  It is generally true in the real world economy, because producers choose what specific things to produce based mainly on the marginal cost of production and the demand for them.<br />
<br />
Shaman spells don't really fit this model because people rarely choose to kill spell-dropping mobs primarily to get these spells to sell in the marketplace.  The main source of these spells are the Kunark dragons, Chardok royalty, and VP.  These targets have a wide variety of other very desirable drops.  A decrease in the price of torpor will not lead to a significant decrease in the killing of these mobs, and will therefore not significantly constrict their supply.  The same is true, albeit to a slightly lesser extent, of Chottal.  So, you may see a very slight decrease in availability, but only a very slight one.<br />
<br />
A real-world analogy is something like selling restaurant grease.  Just because the price of grease goes down does not mean that less grease is produced, because the grease is generated largely as a by-product of cooking food.  If I own a restaurant, I will sell my grease to the grease man anyway, since no matter what I have the grease.  The exception, of course, is if the price of grease falls below my costs to collect and store it until the grease man shows up.  Then I'll just throw it away.  This caveat is not relevant to this situation unless the price of the spells was set very very low by the cartel (less than 3k I'd say).<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is pretty much an example of people who think they understand economics mindlessly applying a basic model without thinking about whether the model's underlying assumptions apply to a particular situation.  It is the kind of thing that gives economics a bad name, but it plays well on talk radio and the WSJ editorial page ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Recently Me and my friends were up in maidens whacking gorangas. I got a tell from an old semi-friend asking if we have any lucid shards drop If I could give him a tell.  I said I would be happy to, for a price. <br />
<br />
He asked what price. <br />
<br />
I said group Aego, and if we get a second shard Group focus.  (Aego was more important for our high preist, than focus for me.)<br />
<br />
He said that was highway robbery. I then asked him what thier guild was selling the spells for on the open market. He asked then replied 25K plat each.<br />
<br />
I then replied who was robbing who. He replied we are robbing each other.<br />
<br />
Exactly. If they would have charged a resonable amount for the spells I would have sent him a tell without a second thought. Happy to just be a help. But what goes around comes around.<br />
<br />
Well behold 4 minutes later The guy spawns with the shard.<br />
<br />
Boom We whack him. (I won't mention the deliberate trains by the other group of uber twinks that all happened to be unguilded at the same time yet have the ability to withstand a 15 pull and drop it on our laps while we are holding the corpse for the fellow to arrive and loot.) ( I died 5 times holding the corpse so they couldnt loot the shard and cock block the other guild)<br />
<br />
We get group aego. Yay Breckenridge.<br />
<br />
24 minutes later the fellow spawns again, back to back. Amazing. We drop him again, Boom Group focus. <br />
<br />
What goes around comes around, after 87 Guardian wyrms (and no torpor) the spell gods conspired to let me friggen have a break. Finally. <br />
<br />
Faem it sucks that you are in that position. I know. I was there. Keep plugging away. Sooner, or later you will get the spell. It isnt worth the pain that not having it caused, but it is worth the 50K plat I paid for it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">We keep tossing around economic principles but you folks left some important ones<br />
<br />
The marginal utility of money: Each dollar's (or plat) value is relative to that of the dollar next to it.  $100 is alot if you are starving, nothing to Bill Gates.  <br />
<br />
The common law has a definition of reasonable value borrowed from economics (used in every US state to help courts determine what something should sell for): What a reasonable buyer would pay a reasonable seller, with neither under undue pressure or influence?<br />
<br />
The economies on servers are a reflection on the fact that Verant did nothing to address a year or more of (benign?) neglect regarding Kunark drop rates and placement.  I fully believe these pricing issues were caused by 1&gt;miscoding of Malosini at Juggs, 2&gt; the decision to put keys spells into Veeshan Peaks at higher drop rates figuring people would raid there enough to balance out the drop rates, 3&gt; and then a few months later to remove all incentive to go there by creating Tov coupled with the key issues.  A year of flawed distribution has created a supply problem.  The options for guilds to hunt locations of more value before Veeshan Peak was mined out hard created tremendous pressure on the poor supply.  <br />
<br />
We all have our pet theories on what caused the economies.  Not the point in this discussion and there are lots of threads hashing out our favorite conspiracy theories.  Regardless, we now have inherited economies where certain single class defining spells (unlike weapons or armor for which there are alternatives) cost more than entire sets of Thurg multiquest armors.  Shaman are cursed with more of these spells than any other class.<br />
<br />
And to argue that spells should cost a little or alot, or is worth it to wait or pay a premium to get them fast, is ignoring the fact that 40K or 90K is &quot;fair&quot; or not depends on individual circumstance and perspective.  If you fell into a guild that gets them easily, or can generate that kind of money, the economy helps you and your friends, and is not easily shrugged off.  If you are in a mid range guild, the issue is the ability to raise the money and will they be there when you raise it.  Those in small or no guilds due to play hours or real life commitments, or relationships they dont want to sever are in real trouble and have to rely on the &quot;karma&quot; or the &quot;largesse of strangers&quot; method.  <br />
<br />
Verant can fix this in a minute and effectively set a ceiling for spell costs: Put L60 for under dropped spells on a vendor for a high but set price.  Would the market adopt that price automatically?  Not necessarily, there are lots of items that vendors buy for 10-100 pp and then try to resell at values that are outlandish.  Having a vendor sell all L60 spells for all classes for 10-50,000 pp would not cause all spells to cost that much, but would serve to cap values and stop the preception of price gouging.<br />
<br />
Verant is in an awkward position. I dont think they believe they can be seen as directly tampering with player economies in this way, irregardless of how much their actions (or inactions) have caused them. But on the other hand they know they will lose player base over time as people abandon the game in frustration because the guild system that they insist we use can virtually turn into cartels.  (And, on some servers, actually have from what I read.)<br />
<br />
We all understand that there are items that the most uber and committed of players should get first if at all.  The issue really is should class defining spells be among those.  Or should they be readily available and Ancient versions or other effects seperate the uber from the ordinary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">If you want something at your price instead of theres, you have to be patient. It will all come in time. Take me for example, I auctioned to buy torpor for 10k for weeks until one day, the only person i ever saw that had it at all said he would GIVE it to me and he did. I didnt know this person. Several days later some friends and i were killing GW in SF trying to hopefully get malo, and what should happen to drop , but torpor. All i could think was WOW, so i stayed in the auc channel , WTT torpor for malo. I kept at it and anyone that said they would by malo, i responded with &quot;Sorry i'm just looking for a straight trade for malo.&quot; <br />
That way 2 shaman would be happy and i wasn't trying to rip anyone off. about a week or so of auctioning i finally found someone needing torpor that had malo. happy ending for us both. <br />
