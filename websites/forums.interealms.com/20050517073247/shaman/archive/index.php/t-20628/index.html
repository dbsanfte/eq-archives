<br />
Was just accepted into open beta this morning. Downloaded the game (1 gig download that expands to 3 after setup) but can't get in due to &quot;congestion&quot;. <br />
<br />
Will let ya know what I think after I play it a bit.<br />
<br />
One thing that is a little weird - the dwarven men look like old geezers and the dwarven females look like &quot;12 yr old human children&quot; (according to the lore). Ya ask me they look like something out of hentai. Makes ya feel dirty just looking at one. ;) <br />
<br />
The other graphics (per screenshots and watching a friend play @ his house) are very nice.</div></div><hr />

If you actually tried logging into the game you would find it has a Loduss Wars theme to it all.<br />
<br />
Dark evles run really cool (they run some what slanted, lean forward like a dash dragging their weapon or weapons for a strike.)  There are power moves for fighters and some interesting spells for casters.<br />
<br />
Plus, it did an amazing job of balancing the classes.  <br />
And your race has a more defining role in your class.<br />
<br />
Additionally, your character actually speaks out loud a different language (latin?) during their spell casting.<br />
<br />
The Graphics are amazing best I have seen yet!<br />
<br />
And yes the game is male oriented but then on the other hand it is a bit silly to dismiss the idea sex sells.</div></div><hr />

Yawn.<br />
Actually there is a whole 2 faces per character model! That goes along with 2-6 styles of hair and 2 hair color choices.  It is a pretty looking game but mostly seems to be hack and slash so far.  The translations didn't always work out well so you can find many errors in quest text, spelling, etc.  Fun to play around with in beta but I can't see buying it for what they offer so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I took a look at some of the screenshots and some of the game play movies and this game looks really good.  Why isn't anyone talking about it like they talk about WoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The main reason this game isn't getting good press is it's a Korean game there aren't a lot of player-run sites to drum up the masses and their support in the US basically sucks.<br />
<br />
The original Lineage predates EQ but was very literally based on UO.  The game's been developed for the internal Korean market even more than FF was for Japan (since there's more MMPOG players in korea than the rest of the world combined) so from what I've seen it very much reflects the hardcore Korean powergamer mentality.  There's quite a level treadmill, with PvP/keep sieging as the endgame.<br />
<br />
on the plus side you can grow and eventually ride dragons...  ingame the character models looks better than screenshots and some of the structures are impressive but the landscape and environment seem less than premium... esp compared to WoW where content is packed in there... more dreadlands than eastern wastes in character.  the lore and translations also suck... which leads to a bit of head-scratching with the storyline</div></div><hr />

http://www.winternet.com/~mikelr/assets/Nitpick.jpg <br />
<br />
Nitpick compensates for his general weakness as a Warrior by pouncing on errors, however irrelevant to the discussion, and using them to discredit the enemy. For example, if his opponent in a sports forum conflict casually mentioned the Cubs' 4-2 victory in the 1908 World Series, Nitpick would quickly counterattack with something like, &quot;4-2 !? Any moron knows the Cubs won the Series 4-1! Someone so ignorant about baseball history can't possibly know anything about salary caps!&quot; Even if the minor point is conceded Nitpick will return to it whenever pressed in the main arena of battle. Nitpick can be easily bested by even Rottweiler Puppy, but he is very tenacious and will never admit defeat. Nitpick is a close ally of Artful Dodger</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I checked it out in the beta, and it's one of the most pointless projects I have seen so far. I've beta tested 10 online titles before this one and so far, each one of them had more idea in it. L2 just presses on pretty pics and testosterone filled teens, maybe some such old geezers as well. Anyone can &quot;attach&quot; any theme, if they really try, to anything, but it still doesn't hide the fact that the thing is pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it's not pointless dude, just inaccessible.<br />
<br />
if you've beta'd all those titles I'm assuming you've tested/played UO or NWN.  were those games &quot;pointless&quot; to you?<br />
<br />
****, even if you played EQ beta or early release there wasn't much point other than seeing yourself run around killing stuff.  proper story wasn't really added until SoV, and honestly each expansion is a throwaway.  there's about 20 pages of plot at the beginning of each expansion then it's set it and forget it.  what's up with the dain dorfs thesedays?  you'll never hear about Zeb now that PoP's over<br />
<br />
Lineage has a theme and story, it's just very badly translated because UNLIKE the JAPANESE (this **** isn't japanese for you all playing along at home) and more like AMERICANS, koreans generally can't give 2 ****s about any other country and proper localizing products isn't a priority.<br />
<br />
it's a pvp at heart in any case.  i'd expect better feedback on this thread on vault's DAOC forums or UO boards</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not likely you will be annoyed by stupid little kids.  Rather, you will probably be assaulted by gangs of raving Korean Lineage 2 fanatics.  Just make sure they don't know where you live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sigh... i guess i am getting the childish responses... some info on Lineage for Litgruv.. .its a MMORPG already released in Korea, it went through Beta in Japan and Taiwan already, not sure if released.  It is a PvP as well as Clan v Clan and Guild v Guild game.  The object of the game is to hold castles, which allow you to tax people selling items.. ie if Sony put a 10% tax on everything sold in bazaar.  You can also affect the respawn rates of mobs to allow faster leveling by your allies.  <br />
<br />
It is a PvP game but what people dont' realize is you take a HUGE PENALTY for GRIEFING... you get 240 &quot;karma&quot; points for the first killing of a person that doesn't fight back, 480 for the second 960 for the third etc... when you have karma points you turn RED... when you turn RED you very easily lose items.  You see very few griefers.. definitely less than on Sullon Zek, or any of the other Zeks for that matter (yes i've played for a bit on all).  <br />
<br />
<br />
Gear &gt; levels &gt; knowledge on this game as far as i can see... 14 dark elf warrior and 15 orc mage.<br />
<br />
The Good.<br />
<br />
Awesome graphics.. much better than anything i've seen before, including WoW screenshots.<br />
<br />
Awesome gameplay.. though its mostly hack and slash.. clans are already using teamspeak and working out pvp strats, boss strats and castle strats... think being one of the first to play EQ and trying to figure out how to kill mobs...<br />
<br />
Awesome guild/clan system... you can create a clan by yourself at lvl 10 but if you want to have your guild name and symbol near your name.. you have to pay in both adena(plat) and sp(kinda like exp points)... basis of clan and guild warfare.. 5 clans make up a guild(i think) and you can make alliances.<br />
<br />
Shamans get lifetap and rangers are overpowering... a great change from EQ.<br />
<br />
The Bad<br />
<br />
Horrible, Horrible Login server... you basically have to spam your login to get in.<br />
<br />
Ummm the Exp grind is worse than EQ.. think 50-60 all the way through from 10-60 on this game. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Lag.... in the cities its very very laggy.. fortunately you aren't in the city for too long.<br />
<br />
I'm almost certain open beta is now &quot;closed&quot; .. we have been trying to get more CD keys for people at our store but we haven't been able to short of buying them at Fry's.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you guys were wondering why there were GM events on EQ..its because of Lineage2... they always do GM events when new MMORPGs come out to make you guys stay... ex.  DAoC, AC2, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the exp grind is pretty damn cake if you dont solo, just past 10th, if I group with just one more player be it another melee or a caster the exp rate tripples, add 2 more and you never have to stop killing. add in quests for some extra cash (and there are 3 quests in the orc town that all involve mobs that spawn in one area) and you have a game where you can equip yourself at the store, and you can log on for as long or as short as you want and still make progress. <br />
<br />
no I dont know jack about the game beyond this point, the differences between this and EQ right now seem to involve an almost total lack of time sink compared to eq, getting acceptable gear/cash/skills is simple and easy. if you want to get uber you can but if you just wanna log in and smack some stuff around with a friend or 2 to kill an hour you can do that too.<br />
<br />
I will keep playing this one for a bit, gonna snag lvl 19 and have a look at orc monks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmm interesting. I like the idea of PvP, but like mentioned above, i dont want to be forced to PvP. Sometimes id just wanna get on and relax, not do battle. So having some sorta huge penalty system is a very interesting way to allow both people to exist.<br />

It looks interesting ill say that, worth looking into more. Thnx for the info  Ninth</div></div><hr />

I had a &quot;red karma&quot; caster try to nuke me on my way back to town. I kept running, stopped next to a pixie (these are sprinkled around newbie areas from what I've seen so far, kind of &quot;newbie guards&quot;) near the ramp, started powering up a powershot (trueshot on steroids) and before I could get it off the pixie handed him his ass.<br />

<br />
If you can't be bothered reading throught that here's a few quotes<br />
<br />
Tried L2, came online, and in a hour allready got 3x ganked by a way higher lvl guy, who left with the nice greeting &quot;j00 suck n00wb&quot;<br />
<br />
Killing of newbies and killstealing are common everyday occurances in L2<br />
<br />
Had the open beta for LII on our computer for about a day before it got deleted. It's probably a very good game if you like that sort of thing, but the griefers were way too rampant for our liking<br />
<br />
Good PvP is the Holy Grail of MMORPGs - if you could acheive it then you've automatically added massive and varied content.  But like the Holy Grail you can never quite get to it.</div></div><hr />

Actually I was looking for Horizons info and came across those quotes - which seemed very much at odds with your posts.<br />

OK I went to lineage2.com, took a minute to find:<br />
<br />
http://boards.lineage2.com/tm.asp?m=146169<br />
<br />
in this game, pvp is not fun, its more like those bully crap existed in Elementary school, you pvp whoever u like and anytime u want, when ur name becomes purple, you can hit anyone u want in the game, kill any player character u want, as long as u can take them down. I personally witnessed, and experienced being killed by a high lvl fighter, or mage every now and then. Was killing mobs, and ppl was badly injured, out comes a fag and instantly hit u with (mostly) power stike, bam, you dead, lost 5% to 11%, all that hard work of soloing (will discuss teaming further below) is gone in less than...what... 3 seconds, even whats stupid is, a mage was outside of town, talking to his friend, or whatever the crap he is doing, saw a low lvl character came out and doing whatever he is going, one magic bolt of death, and wahla, the lowbie is dead.<br />
<br />
I think the single PvP system is a bit weak personally. I am above LVL 20 and I have been in my fair share of fights. First of all there are people and clans who basically live to PK and KS. I saw a lvl 25+ kill steal off of a lvl 12's group then appologize several times, after frustrating that group he singlehandedly pked each one of them. Personally I am pissed off, but b/c he was in a very large clan and is allied with a even larger group of people, who would hunt my character down till they brought it down to the very existence of lvl 5, I didn't want to accept the consequences (i'll admit it).</div></div><hr />

They all love the game and have lots of great things to say about it.  They've been trying to get me to play, but I am adamantly refusing.  I learned my lesson when I listened to them and started playing EQ.</div></div><hr />

I am not too sure on this but from what i see the boss mobs drop rate is the same as every other mob.. which is .015 % usually.. so sure.. if you want to spend ALL your time raiding for nearly non existant loot sure! This game is built around clan/guild warfare and yes mob drops will be important but i think its more about farming adena and buying uber lewts... ie holding a castle allows you to tax the population that sells in your castle... and you can split the adena(pp) among you and your allies.   Just my thought, but i think this will be more of a &quot;money&quot; based game rather than raiding game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the info.  Still, this is a game where unless you are in an uber-guild you are definitely a 'have-not', and there's already IGE type companies moving in to cash in on that.  Its simply that the mechanism is taxation of territory, rather than raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Huh? You guys have the colors mixed up.  Purple means you've just done PvP within the last 30 seconds, and people can kill you without penalty.  RED means you have KARMA you need to work off, either by dying or killing mobs near yer level :P<br />
<br />
  The problem with this game's system is that people can KS, be pricks, loot your stuff after 2 seconds, yet if you kill them you go red, and The Horde(tm) sees a red person, and kills you with its mob mentality.<br />
<br />
  Still a fun game, just dont be an orc shaman :P Seems the gimp shaman thing followed over to L2 /duck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Lol... i play two of the more broken classes in the game and concentrated on my Dark Elf Warrior &gt;Assassin&gt;Phantom Ranger because it is all the more broken til the release of the game (when casters can cast at longer range than you can shoot arrows, thereby negating kiting ability during pvp).  Orc mages are also some of the fastest levelers.. you just aren't doing it right.... no soulcry... just use lifetap(shaman huh?) and then bow kite(shaman huh?) for a couple shots and then melee it down with your dual fists(shaman huh?)  you should have virtually no downtime(i don't) and are able to solo whites pretty fast.  Do it before they nerf dual fists for mages in the release...once you hit 20 you should resemble something more of a shaman... HoT, Buffs, Dots.</div></div><hr />

Yep... already see the IGE'ers are trying to move in.  Different scenerio though... because in this game you can kill them  They recently took over School of Dark Arts(lowbie dungeon) and had the same character (Dark Elf Warrior) equipped with the same item(dagger) farming for adena(plat).  Anytime you said anything to them... all they said was &quot;Me Chinese&quot;.   I wasn't there but heard the story... but i think someone ended up killing them all because they arent' there anymore and from what i gather(since the world is so small, think original EQ only norrath.) they aren't plat farming anymore... rather trying to dupe.  I've seen it and the GM's have seen it... GM's come within two minutes of your petition usually... unless its a petty petition .... then they don't come at all.  ie if you petition about falling through the world.. 2 minutes and you are up and back running... petition about someone pking u...and that petition sits and sits... for hours... <br />

About being in uber-guild, yes you are partially correct.. if you aren't part of uber guild #1-10.. you probably aren't going to own a castle, be able to have your own dragon, be part of the throne room defense in a castle siege.  But honestly though, do you think you deserve it?  But then again, you think you are going to be worthless like the 5-6th shaman on a raid... or a under lvl 60 on any post PoP raid.  Simply not true.  20-50 ubers don't hold a castle... its a joint effort between hundreds of people.  Sure the lvl 20's might be out in front of the castle trying to impede the onslaught of hundreds while the lvl 62 guards shoot arrows from above... but they play their role.  And surely, if the castle does get defended... they would get some money and rights in the castle.  The cool thing about the game is its not so much the content in the game... but what you make of it through politics.</div></div><hr />
