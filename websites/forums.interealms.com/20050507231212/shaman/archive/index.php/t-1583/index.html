<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shakoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">By now, every pally and cle are drooling at the Tunare elf BP made from smithing. Anyone heard similar thing for shammies? I mite hafta go back to Grobb when I get back online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I saw human made stuff that barbarian shamans could wear at least. Bracer was ac 12 hp 30 mana 30 all resists 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They're still trying to figure things out right now.<br />
<br />
Trolls do not get their own cultural armor, they can wear the Ogre stuff. But, since it is religion restricted, I don't believe Inny worshipping Trolls have any - unless they can wear the DE items. <br />
<br />
There should be chain and plate items discovered soon (they've found both for Iksar), the AC on them appear to be SS quest quality with the stats a bit lower but better saves. <br />
<br />
It will be an interesting couple of weeks, sort of makes me wish I didn't go selling off some extra BD's :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Must be nice to actually have a God... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sheesh some of the stats on the plate stuff is insane, we actually have some of the best armour in the game - made by players! I have little doubt it's going to be a PIA to make but hey, its makeable.<br />
<br />
If anyone spots any nice stats posted on the EQT boards then do repost them here, if theres a CT chain face item thats &gt;9ac and 30hp and mana then I'm going to mopping up puddles of lizzie drool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So far they've only found the bracer I think, Seredith.<br />

They're still busy working on it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, they've basically found the recipes for &quot;new&quot; barb, troll, ogre and iksar stuff but, for the most part, since there are more hi elves, dark elves, wood elves around period and more of them into smithing... well they'll find out what their armor is faster than barbs, trolls etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mez original shaman  Radag was an iksar grand master smith 202 skill....  mez no longer have Radag but mez very happy that players can make equipment that fits into the low end game.  For a long time now skills like smithing have been broken.  The only skills that where truly vialbe where tailoring  (very hard) and jewlry crafting (very easy).<br />
<br />
Mez hope a lot of richness has been added to the trade skills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The armor made while working on the Coldain 8th Shawl is Shaman wearable.  Its the same stats as the Royal Frosted Velium stuff that drops in Icewell.  Its no drop.  <br />
<br />
For someone that has a high smithing skill already and a decent amount of cash the Gloves and Vambraces aren't bad.  BP/Legs are pretty decent too.   For someone not in a raiding guild its not bad gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Trying like heck to crank out a piece of the Ogre Velium War Splint, should be wearable by Ogre and Troll Shaman, should be imbuable to Rallos, Casic and Inny according to the in game text. I'm figuring it should be on par with the Elven chain that's being produced. Down to the lack of funds and availability of Blue Diamonds and Velium right now. Man I am dying to see the first Troll super weapon cranked out, if it's on par with the armor that's been produced it should be a real jaw dropper, would love to be able to use the old Glowing Wooden Crook again. :) The Barbs have new recepies in game too but I haven't had the time to look in and se how they're doing with 'em.  Headed back in game now to raise some more funds and see if I can't scrounge a Blue Diamond or two. Good hunting Sisters and Brudders.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Helana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was the one who made the BP, its not green thats highelf, its similar to mithril armor but a bit lighter in color.  There is no &quot;solving&quot; of the recipies they are known its just a matter of them being 250 skill recipies and very few barbarians have that skill.  That combined with some pain in the butt components to get and blue diamonds also being part of it.<br />
<br />
I have the skill and actually attempted some pieces of chain but they all failed.  Ill have some chain stuff posted up on eqtraders within a few days likely once i get more components tho =)<br />

Only armor made so far is Plate, although there is a set of Ringmail, and Boned Leather - not finished yet.<br />

There are also recipes shown, but no armor made yet, from Ogre Cultural &amp; Iksar Cultural Smithing.  Trolls appear to get no armor, only weapons -  heh, get to recycle your &quot;old weapon&quot;...<br />
Kragia says ''The Dark Stranger, he tellz me dat...' Kragia furrows his brow with concentration, 'Shortsword of the Ykesha, Runed Falchion, Electrum-Bladed Wakizashi, Obsidian Shard, Gigantic Zweihander, Enamelled Black Mace, Sharkbone Warhammer, Glowing Wooden Crook, Staff of the Observer, Crested Mistmoore Shield, Shimmering Orb - dem all good'<br />

im quite frankly amazed...VI made a tradeskill item...that is well, good)<br />
<br />
51 AC is helluva nice =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i'm sure helana would rather post her findings herself, but the chain armor is damn good :)<br />
and i'll wear a few pieces :)<br />
<br />
some of it is certainly better than kael/ss gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Unless they have been overlooking something at EQtraders, it looks like the chain armor sucks badly.  <br />
<br />
The plate BP has an AC almost as good as warrior Skyshine.  The chain is barely better than Rune Etched from Hate, and significantly worse than Kunark stuff :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Helana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just thought i'd drop a line here to let you guys know ive completed most of the chain stuff and the results are up on eqtraders.<br />

- More AC than Cobalt/Champion's/PoG. 10 less HP than Champion's/PoG. Nice mudflation!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I would wear the pants over JB pants.  Less mana, (3wis, 35mana) - less ac, but 40 hps.  Unfortunately my AC is now hovering at like 1000 even.. or just slightly less, can't really afford to lose 2 more ac.  bah.  If these had been just slightly better (2 or 3 more ac anyone...) I probably would have done something stupid like blowing lots of time, plat, blood, sweat and tears on doing smithing.  <br />
<br />
Compare it to the way the cultural plate stacks up...(from a priest perspective)<br />
<br />
&lt;table border=1 align=top&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD align=top&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blessed Full Mithril Legs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt; AC 40, WIS 10, hp 40, mana 40&lt;BR&gt;Plate/Elf/Tunare&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=top&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;+26 AC, +8 Str, +8 Sta, +8 Wis, +30 HP, +30 Mana&lt;/td&gt;&lt;TD align=top&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forbidden Rites - Thurg&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;+24 AC, +10 Wis, +3 vsCold, +80 HP, +40 Mana&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=top&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Akkirus - skyshrine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;+31 AC, +5 Sta, +10 Wis, +1 vsMg, +1 vsFire, +1 vsCold, +5 vsPos, +1 vsDis, +80 HP, +70 Mana&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
These player crafted pants are definately better than Donals and Thurgadin, by a wide margin, in my book.  <br />
<br />
Hell look at those Tunare pants compared to the warrior Skyshrine legs.<br />
Greaves of the Myrmidon: +40 AC, +9 Str, +9 Agi, +9 Dex, +4 vsMg, +40 HP<br />
<br />
Clerics are comparing their armor to Skyshrine and Shaman crafted armor compares to Kunark/Thurgadin.  The man is holding shaman down.  First umbral armor, Elyasian armor vs Shojen... now we get shafted in the crafted armor too?? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">some of the chain pieces have been made<br />
AC is similar to or slightly less jb, bracer 12, arms 16. legs 22<br />
all pieces have 30 HP 30 mana<br />
bracer 5 wis, sleeves 4 wis<br />
<br />
with the stacking nerf I will trade my jb pieces for that, especially the sleeves  and bracers are nice (no, I don't have a jbb I'd take off for that).<br />
Failed on one bracer on patchday. haven't tried it since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">True, when comparing the chain and plate the chain sure does pale. I think if enough smiths do feedback on it the chain stuff will probably get tuned up a bit. At least I'd hope so. It would be nice if there were a non-tribunal/imbued barb-smithed armor too. (Rallos/agnostic barbs can wear stuff smithed by humans)<br />
<br />
I'm anxious to see the iksar stuff since my monk is the smith in my family. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Grooooooaaannnnn back to killing noobie monsters to get stuff for smithing skillups. Not just for me, but also my ogre alt, who made some CT cultural armor for me way back when. I wanna make the ubah weapons and have him make the ubah armor.<br />
At least all that time I spent working on tradeskills might actually pay off now.</div></div><hr />
