I went and turned in with no problem to spirit.  So you can still turn in Rak with ally faction.  I was the test dummy and it worked :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lost my tear the other day. What happened was that one Rak was already spawned, once I handed in tear he didn't say anything. When another shaman turned in scale he went agro. <br />
So, to make sure and get it done right, kill any present Rak'asiir and spawn a new one when the reaver pops again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I done Rak Monday night 5/13...completed epic all the way thru Kirn...went back and done the rathe part 3 times..became max ally..didnt do Neh Ashiir, went str8 to Rak...we spawned him and he dropped the scale for me after a long 15min or so fight with 3 mage pets (2 lvl 44, 1 lvl 49 pet)...so, yes you can hand in the tear with max ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Before turning in the tear you SHOULD have max ally. Thats atleast what I had when doing my epic, without skipping or overdoing any part.<br />

<br />
I disagree with this... I was Ally before handing in the tear. I did not recive Max until after I gave the scale to the spirit and got my poker.</div></div><hr />
