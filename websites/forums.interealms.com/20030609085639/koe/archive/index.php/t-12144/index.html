<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Nope, I haven't fallen off the face of the earth :P I have just now taken up running after god knows how long. Yep, my ass is out of shape! As soon as I get used to the running regimen I am setting for myself, I will be returning to the game. Also, I am prepping for my next Microsoft exam to get me closer to the MCDBA certification.<br />
 <br />
See yas soon! :)</div></div><hr />

Get that beer gut gone and come back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So I ran my first mile in probably 10 years tonight. This was step 1 in at least inching may way towards some kind of physical health. Although my legs felt like gunny-sacks full of wet cardigan sweaters after about a half-mile, it seemed productive and rewarding when I was done.<br />
Ok, ok, a mile isn't much, but it felt good to be actually trying to get back into shape. Tomorrow's run will most likely be the same distance, but with a bit more pain, but hey, that is the way it goes, eh?<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice and easy, Cane, work into it and just keep pushing it a little farther each week, you'll see the results, but resist the urge to step on the scales for about a month, then you'll really see the difference.  Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kluden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cane...my good man...let me offer some advice:<br />
 <br />
I, in the not too distant past, started a hard core strength and cardio regime.  You must limit yourself when you start.  You have a lot of energy right now, and  you will feel the &quot;want&quot; to push yourself.  Do not.<br />
 <br />
I suggest not even measuring how far you run.  Distance is not a good communicator of how well you are doing when it comes to a cardio program.  What you should be doing is timing your runs.  Start with 10 minutes with a 2 minute cool down.  That  is the way to go.<br />
 <br />
The end result, after about a month to a month in a half would be you, running for about half and hour with a 2 minute cool down.  On average, emphasis on average, the body does not start to &quot;burn fat&quot; during cardio excercise until about 20 minutes into the workout.  After the 20 minute &quot;barrier&quot;, the body is burning around 95% fat for energy.  That is why 30 minute jogs are the pwn!!! :)<br />
 <br />
Good luck, and if you need any ideas on other things to do, call me or pm me...I knows a few things :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey Cane, nice to see here and not on VV. :-D thanks again for that advice on the exam, good luck finishing yours. See you later in game man!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ladara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Woohoo a topic I know about :-) Thus begins my physical fitness article, hehe. If you aren't interested, then don't bore yourself reading it all :-)<br />
 <br />
Cane, I have to agree with Kluden here, you should measure your time not your distance, after all some days you are going to be moving slower than others, but your body is still benefiting from the exercise.<br />
 <br />
Also, I cannot stress enough the importance of stretching! In addition to my daily workout routine, I stretch 3-4 times a day. In the morning, before my workout, after my workout, and before I go to bed. The stretching before working out will keep you from accidentally pulling muscles, you don't want to get shin splints from running. Stretching after your workout, and in the morning, and evenings, will help you stay limbered up and keep your muscles from getting as sore. (There are other advantages to this too, such as you learn that the more limber you become the more you can twist and contort into all kinds of positions during your sexual encounters, lol) Anyways, moving on, I am sorry, but that saying no pain, no gain is for the birds. Yes you should have a little muscle tension, minor aches, after all you are working muscles you haven't in awhile, but if you push yourself to the point that you are &quot;hurting&quot; then you are doing more damage than good.<br />
 <br />
You need to also keep in mind that your body burns the most fat when you are between 70-80% of your target heart rate. Don't push yourself over that 80% we don't want you to have a heart attack. A good link with a target heart rate calculator to find an estimate of your target heart rate is:<br />
http://stevenscreek.com/goodies/hr.shtml Check your heart rate about every 10mins during your workout. If it is to high, back off some, if it is to low, push harder.<br />
 <br />
A really great link to go to is: http://www.reeboku.com/<br />
You can sign up for a free account, once you have an account, there is a physical fitness questionairre to go through to determine your level of fitness as well as determining which exercises you might prefer to do considering your likes/dislikes. It creates a workout plan for you to follow, and you are able to monitor your progress. You can also monitor your progress on your weight, strengthening, and measurements. It also has a &quot;Body 360&quot; section that you can go to. From there, it shows you each muscle in the body, and which stretches, exercises, and strenth training you can do to target that specific muscle. It is just an awesome site in my opinion! I recommend it to everyone.<br />
 <br />
Also, keep in mind that weight is not important, measurements and your body far percentage are, after all muscle weighs more than fat, you could start losing inches and fat LONG BEFORE you start losing pounds, so buy a measuring tape, chart your progress, and go by that, not what the scale says. The scale is your worse enemy. If you absolutely have to measure, than do not do so more than once a week, and always weigh on the same day at the same time, your weight flucuates throughout the day. Here is a link to a BMI calculator, http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi.htm, and a link to a Body Fat calculator http://www.he.net/~zone/prothd2.html Mind you the most accurate way is to have your body fat measured using a electronic calibrator, or worse case scenario a pinch test. You can usually find electronig calibrators for about $40 online. I highly recommend keeping up with the percentage of body fat you are losing, and not the scale. Last but not least, here is a link to a Calorie Calculator http://stevenscreek.com/goodies/calories.shtml so you can keep up with your caloric intake each day after exercising. Naturally, if you are taking in more than you are burning during your workout, then you need to cut some calories, but do not cut back on protein!<br />
 <br />
Additionally, I cannot stress more.... water, vitamins, and diet. You don't have to starve yourself, just make small changes to your diet. Use cooking spray or olive oil instead of butter. Cut back to 1% or 2% milk instead of whole milk. Have snacks such as fruits that have natural sugar instead of processed sugars in them, and use raw sugar in your cooking, not processed. And eat lots of meat and consider protein supplements, especially with you being a male, you don't want to burn muscle instead of fat. The extra protein will help you from doing so. Eat whole grains and whole grain flour instead of white bread and bleached flour. Remember colas are bad, they are pure sugar, and your body turns it into fat, very quickly, if you are a cola drinker, then limit yourself to one a day. The little stuff adds up and if you think about it, you can find little ways to cut back, without having to make such huge sacrifices. Please read this link about water and how it helps you to burn fat, I think you might find it very educational:<br />
http://colonhealth.net/free_reports/h2oartcl.htm<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Also, you can do little things to help yourself get physically fit, too. Such as, when you go to the store, part at the back of the parking lot and walk up to the front door, instead of parking by the handicapped section, hehe. Also, use the stairs instead of the elevator. When you are carrying stuff up or down the stairs take several small loads for the extra benefit of walking up and down the stairs, instead of trying to carry everythind down at once. When you are watching TV, do a few situps and pushups during the commercials. If you think about it, I am sure you can come up with several other little things that you can do throughout your day to make a difference. Again, the little stuff adds up!<br />
 <br />
Also, keep in mind that a very common disease that you men have to deal with is Prostate Cancer. Don't know anything about you, but you should start having regular testing for this at the age of 45. Ethinicity plays a big role, African-American and Latino men have a higher chance of getting it. Height plays a role, men over 6-feet have a higher chance of getting it. Heredity is obviously a factor. Diet plays a big role too, high animal fats, and low vegetables in your diet increases your chance of getting it. Diets high in tomatoes (lycopene) and oils found in fatty fish (omega-3 fatty acids) such as salmon and mackrel decreases your chances of getting it.<br />
 <br />
Early prostate cancers are detected through testing before they cause any symptoms. More advanced prostate cancers can cause a variety of symptoms, including:<br />
 trouble starting urination urinating much more frequently than usual the feeling that you can't release all of your urine pain on urination or ejaculation blood in your urine or semen impotence bone painSo there is my health lesson for the day, hope that it was helpful to you, Cane, as well as to the rest of you men...maybe I should post one for women, hehe. I hope that some of it helps you all. Remember, you don't have to starve yourself or burn yourself out exercising in order to make some significant improvements in your weight and physical fitness level.<br />
 <br />
Hope you have a great day!<br />
