<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I cant believe i stuck with EQ as long as i did. The game just got worse and worse till i hated it and i still played. At least i moved on to WoW. EQ SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EQ was good, and I will remember it fondly.  Yes it had bad parts, but I choose to remember the good parts and move on.  WoW is fun for me so far, so I will stick with it.<br />
<br />
Bashing SoE and EQ gets me nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I played EQ for 5 years. Don't regret a moment of it one bit. As Zatriz points out, it had it's share of excellent content and goings on. It was just time to move on for me.<br />
<br />
Besides, some of the &quot;lesser&quot; times in EQ helps me appreciate the games I've played since then, and definitely helps me appreciate WoW. <br />
<br />
Though I do sometimes find myself reminiscing about times of old in EQ, back with my first guild, then up through the creation of my own guild. Fond memories indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, I've moved on to WoW, but there was quite a bit of fun for me in EQ, and probably still is to many. I don't regret playing it, at least not much :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EQ will forever be burned into my mind. Some awesome stuff I still remember, as well as some stuff that maks me want to burn my eyes out.<br />

Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah - EQ really stepped this game genre up to an entirely new level.  I'll never forget my many &quot;firsts&quot; on EQ.  Nothing bad to say about it in past tense here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">EQ was great - loved it. I loved my first girlfriend too, but  wouldn't want to be climbing onto her now (shudder)</div></div><hr />

What Mill said. I will also never forgive SOE for the trainwreck that was PoP.  Flagged/locked content for 3/4 of the expansion? Right on- it's not like I had to pay for all the content but get access to 1/4 of it.  And the best was casual obtainable gear with +50 hp while raid gear had 200.<br />
<br />
Laugh, I'm still bitter thinking about it.  PoP pretty much ruined what few good memories I had of EQ- I still despise SOE and always will. :)</div></div><hr />
