<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I play on Rallos Zek, pvp.  For those of you who don't know how it works, any player within 4 levels of you (above or below) can attack you, and loot any (1) non-weapon (aka can't loot, primary, secondary or range) non-nodrop item you have.  This creates an interesting challange in the game, and that's why I like to play there, the uncertainty.  no camp is so safe that other humans can't come in and attack you.  I'm not a PK (player killer) though I do get involved with pvp combat.  That means dropped gear on this server (stuff that can be looted) is next to worthless to me, as paying a ton of cash for something that could be taken from me the next time I'm sitting at half life and a Wizard feels like shopping.  So I wear only no drop items (I keep a few trinkets in my bags to use, as items in bags aren't lootable either Ikky BP, BAM (for mana prev II) CBB (for DoT eff. II) ect) I'm level 49, and for the most part resists &gt; wis/mana.  AC = wis/mana.  and HP and STA ect are gravy.  But the gear has to be no drop.  I can't afford MQ armor from Thurg ect.  (you think its expensive on YOUR server... Gauntlets of Firey might: 600pp. MQ Thurg BP is pretty much priceless)  And while I've been on a hate raid... doing planes raids isn't something I can do with any great ammount of regularity. I'm also an Iksar (which limits some choices) If its a weapon sheild, or range item, I can buy it without worry (already looking for a reduced price Sarnak Battle Shield)  My wisdom is about perfect I think for how much I use, more would just be gravy.  What quests ect should I be looking to do (most tradeskills are 170+ so I'll be doing PoTC pretty soon)  Any suggestions?<br />

Stop being a puss and wear some real gear. When I was on rallos 95% of my gear was droppable and expensive. Wearing the best possible gear gave me an advantage when attacked (and when attacking). Shaman are a great defensive class and do real well when attacked, except when wearing s'hit gear. Look at that MR! You're a walking target that says, &quot;Kill me for lacking the guts to wear anything but no-drop!&quot;<br />

What you should really be doing is trying to find camps that are defensive. At your level the wizard brothers in Neriak 3rd Gate would be a great camp, but you can't touch it because your gear is so lacking. Chardok slave room is another great defensive camp because you have to pass through see-invis mobs to get there.<br />
<br />
Stop living in fear. You'll never be respected as a strong pvp'er if you're running around in a gimp suit.<br />

PS: I moved off the server at level 54.</div></div><hr />
