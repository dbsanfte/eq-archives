<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there any new spells on lucy yet, from OOW?<br />
<br />
I heard on the chatchanel that there were new spells on lucy, last week, but I still don't see any. ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you really want to look at the awesome new spells knowing they'll probably be hard as heck to get?<br />
<br />
Look at the difficulty progression on useful spells.  Used to be all Vendor Buyable.  Then you simply had to fight in sebs.  Then those Planar Runes, and then the horrendous GoD spells, and the make-a-casual-player-wanna-cry ancient chaos of mind spell...<br />
<br />
I'd rather them keep the limit as it is and fix the game they have.<br />
<br />
But no, to answer your question, haven't seen any yet.  I'm sure they'll have some up soon though... the expansion is about a month away.<br />
<br />
But you know, increasing the level cap is a nice way to make sure that, no matter how badly the content of the expansion sucks, most players will buy it just so they can keep up level-wise with everyone who does buy it, and then solo or duo some uber raid mobs from newly old planes ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They need to make GoD spells dropable. Plain and simple. All spells should be dropable unless they are buyable in a certain expansion. These upgrades in GoD might be for the &quot;GoD shaman&quot; but guess what, no one wants me unless i have them and even then its questionable if ill be of use.</div></div><hr />
