Hey everybody, I wasn't going to bother posting this here, but I wanted to hear a few opinions on the subject.  I've been sizing up the Wicked Bone Atlatl for about a week now.  I finally managed to scrape together 13k to buy it, and the bargain price poofed, back up to 20k.  <br />
<br />
I'm having a hard time justifying to myself that i want to spend that much on it, even though it seems like it would be a rather large upgrade.  My understanding is that Haste of Mith effects all healing type spells HoT included.  <br />
<br />
*If you peek at my gear don't laugh at me, the neon green monster was a gift, and we're starting to farm wtov for kael armor.  The forest loop will be replaced by a silver hammer earring (at least), and I'm holding out for the IH4 neck item from the PoI factory.  I'm hoping towards bile dripping belt down the road a little.<br />
<br />
Sorry, i got a little off subject, thoughts on the Atlati?<br />

I think the Atati is a nice piece of gear. Haste of Mithaniel does work on all beneficial spells including torpor (and gate, invis, etc).  Just a note, the POI &quot;neck&quot; item is actually a head slot item.  If you're hunting the the mob that drops the torque, you might consider getting the shoulders that drop in the same place (also with haste of mithaniel).<br />
<br />
Check out my magelo (link in name) for details!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deyhawke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Eeeeek!  Head slot, holes in research.. Thanks for the info, I'll just have to drag the gang kicking and screaming out of Valor :rolleyes:  Any idea on how rare those guys in the factory are?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Moved the Manaetic Q's to a new thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They are not rare at all. There are 3 of them and my guild usually moves from one to the other. I have seen at least one shoulder piece drop and as many as 4 drop in one clearing of the bots. I would suggest more then one group. It is a fast respawn on the regular mobs in there.  Polished tin mail bp's drop in there pretty regularly which are pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Oops, spawn time is a week on them I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unless you just have money to blow, I'd wait for the price to come down. Unless you have Torpor (or Tnarg's?) the haste isn't all that useful since it doesn't work KM. <br />
<br />
It does also cut the casting time on all buffs, which is nice but not worth even 13k imo. ... then again, my wallet is still recovering from buying Torpor. Mine was a gift, and I love it, but I'd be hard pressed to justify spending even 10k on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya, it drops Tnargs down to 3.0 sec cast time. Pretty nice in itself. With Quickbuff2 and this I have a 3.2 sec Torpor. One of my favorite items next to my circlet.</div></div><hr />
