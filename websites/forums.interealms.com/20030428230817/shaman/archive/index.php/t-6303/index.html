<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well i was thinking last night as to why i picked the shaman...<br />
Its the spiritual nature of him. I didnt check stats and spells , it was the idea of what a shaman was that brought me to what i am in EQand still keeps me to a extent.<br />
<br />
Yes , my name is Litgruv and im a spiritualholic. Fascinated by how the universe could work and enjoy possibly more then anything in life , sitting around just randomly pondering the woders around us of th tings seen and not seen, the begining and ends ot come , what religion means and such.<br />
<br />
i guess im a philosopher at heart.<br />
<br />
I dont have a religion or a set out belief system. I grew up a christan and lived with it fine till a point in my life i questioned everything and i cant quite settle back down on the idealism in that religion , or really any religion. Ive spent a decade studying past cultures and religions trying to get a idea of whats going on. I see things starting to surface , reduntant ideas and thoughts that i discard just to see if they come back. But before i get to deep on my ideas ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Where you all coming from ?<br />
<br />
and if you tell me to hit the search button on this im going to turgur you !! ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im asking , since we are spiritualist in the game, why not discuss/debate our real life spiritualness ?</div></div><hr />

HAHAHAAH!! I love this response, sweet :)<br />
<br />
I must admit, I didn't choose the shaman class because of my sprituality, but because I wanted to play the warrior priest class.  Little did I know it was a cleric ;)  When I log into EQ I leave my pregant wife, my expenses, job concerns, and my spirituality at the server selection screen.  I play to have fun, weither that be chatting up a storm or trying to be the best shaman I can.  EQ is a diversion, not so much an extension of myself.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of the &quot;spirit-talker&quot; and all, but If I wanted to try and extend my personality into the game I'd have played a paladin. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I pretty much chose shaman because clerics sounded lame, paladins sounded like warrior wannabes and I still wanted that cleric/fighter hybrid that the shaman was supposed to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well dont get me wrong lol. Im dont play a shaman cause in real life i wish i could wear feather and dance around fires ;)<br />

What if your spirituality? What is your &quot;opinion/perspective&quot; of &quot;Life the Universe and Everything&quot;  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wow, deep question.  Deserves a serious answer so I'll do my best to give a thoughtful one here.<br />
<br />
I don't know that I think of it as spirituality, but I am very concerned with matters of philosophy and personal growth.  Spirituality probably fits.  My own personal philosophy is that I have a code I try to live by, and it's something like this.  <br />
<br />
Be honorable.  Be caring and concerned.  How you treat people is more important than what you have or what you accomplish. <br />
<br />
As far as a belief in a supreme being of some sort... yes, I think there is one.  No, I don't presume to be so all knowing as to be able to discern his/her/its complete nature, so I think maybe lots of religions have merit.  I imagine that Cosmic Truth, whatever it may be, is too big for just one religion.  I am very much opposed to persecution based on religious beliefs or personal lifestyle differences.<br />
<br />
I do like the shaman because it has kind of a mystical feel.  I thought of that when I first made Meg, but hadn't really considered it recently... yars of exp grinding prolly made me lose sight of it :)</div></div><hr />

Ah ha !!<br />
<br />
Now we are getting some place. Truly a admirable philosophy on how to treat yourself and others.<br />
<br />
But lets talk on the big stuff a lil more.<br />
<br />
One thing that stands out in your reply if your &quot;cosmic truth reply&quot;. That seems to be a view im coming to lately as well. Its almost like all the religions hold a piece of the puzzle and its only when you take those pieces and put it together do you even begin to see what could be termed as &quot;cosmic truth&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ive been in search of &quot;God/The Superior Being&quot; for a long time now. at some point the idea that we are that superior being got in my head and i cant seem to shake. Like , the universe is all just one being/thing/whatever. tha ti see &quot;god&quot; everyday when i see the sky , my GF , myself in the mirror , the poeple on this forum. you and I are as like atoms to it. so &quot;it/him/her&quot; is really just us :)<br />
<br />
<br />
so how far out in left field am i now ?  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I chose shaman because that's the spare account a friend had.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hardiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Aethiest Shaman here.  I liked the spell line and wanted to be able to cast Spirit of Wold for cash (made Hardiman back in mid-1999.)  Additionally, I saw a shaman as being a major buffer and not too intense of a class to play, as opposed to Enchanters and Bards and stuff, and that was perfect for my play style at the time because I was in college and preffered to play my video games stoned 100% of the time.  Pretty easy to put the pipe down for a sec, click your Slow hotkey, pick up the pipe, and watch the chaos ensue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Norrath &lt;- Me ..........................................................................................................................................You are here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Let's see. I first played a mage to 13, high elf with red hair. But I hated the cries my elf made, and I hated the way she looked, and I hated being a walking target without my pet. And my pet died so fast.<br />
<br />
So I was about ready to chuck the game when I got Luclin. I looked at the Vah Shir, and was hooked! I always love cats, and love the idea of playing a cat-person. So after deciding on a name (Harvyst, after Harvest my cat, but Harvest was rejected by the name machine), and a coat color (peachy, like my cat), I had to decide which class.<br />
<br />
Warrior, well, I wanted more excitement than wack wack wack. Wacking was what I did for 7 years on a mud, and I was bored with it. Rogues appealed, but again, there's that wacking aspect, which I wasn't sure I would like. Bards, well, they just sounded silly. Singing songs, running around, it never felt like they had a definate 'role' to play. So that left Beastlord and Shaman. Beastlord - well, I had just had my fill of playing a magician, and they are both pet classes. Admittedly, a beastlord is a pet hybrid with a monk, so they would fare better than my late mage, but I still was not ready to deal with pet pathing, pet aggro (back then they could train all of crushbone by getting lost), pet poofing, etc.<br />
<br />
Plus everyone was jumping on the beastlord vah shir wagon.<br />
<br />
So that left Shaman. I liked the spells I saw - healing, augmenting stats, diseasing and poisoning, it looked like I had plenty to do and would be wanted in groups (as a mage, I got tired of nobody wanting me in any groups). <br />
<br />
I started my shaman, and within 2 days, never played my mage again. I was in love, and it's been a love affair since then. I love people walking up to me and going 'KITTY!', I love the desirablity in groups and raids, but the ability to solo as well....<br />
<br />
As a Vah Shir Shaman, I'm agnostic by default. So we tend to believe in the spirits, rather than the spirit of &lt;insert god here&gt;. Which makes the Vah Shir the most spiritualistic of them all, since they believe in the spirits of nature, the spirits that are there, of past and of the future beings. Hang around Shar Vahl and listen to the shaman standing by the pool outside the castle, they have a good story abou the current fate of Luclin. And then there's the whisp quest, of the whisperling trapped inside of a scorpion body, which you can rescue....<br />
<br />
I think Shar Vahl is the best newbie town for baby shaman because you get a feel for the spirituality of working with the spirits, plus notes like &quot;never force a spirit to your aide, all you need do is ask&quot;, etc. It makes it seem much more than casting spells.<br />
<br />
As for my own personal spirituality, I'd rather not bring that into the game. My own religion, personal beliefs, have little to do with how I play my character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I suppose philosophy-wise I might be called an eclectic pagan or a shamanistic free-thinker. Too much of a mixture of beliefs to pigeon-hole me. I have some different Native American tribes' blood in my veins, so maybe this has influenced me to take the nature path.  :)<br />
<br />
Why did I pick Shaman from the character creation screen? Because of all the choices, I felt I could most identify with a shamanistic character. Also, I was very curious to see what my role would be in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
so how far out in left field am i now ?  lol <br />
<br />
Hmm... I like the whole concept of pantheism a lot.  I do believe that God is in everything and every person, which is why we all have unique gifts and insights.  My concept is that we need each other, because none of us are complete without others.  We become closer to God by gaining closeness to nature and other people.  Valuing each person's uniqueness and differences enables us to grow as people, because we learn to widen our view of the universe.  <br />
<br />
I do tend to think that God/Supreme Being/Ultimate Consciousness exists, not exactly as a separate entity, because I think we are all connected through God, but as a separate self-aware consciousness.  I do think that there is an interdependency there, though, in that God could not exist without us as well as vice versa.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, now how far out in left field am I? :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
2.  Up until I was 7-8 I HAD to go to Church. Methodist or Baptist. All I remember is: a) I didn't like it, b) I didn't understand it, c) In some way it scared me.<br />
<br />
So I was given a choice. I chose not to attend organized religious functions if I could help it ever again. <br />
<br />
Now do I believe in some white guy with a brown beard and sad eyes who promises life eternal.<br />
<br />
Fek no.<br />
<br />
One day, we will be visited by people / things far superior to our way of doing things.<br />
<br />
And on that day - everything we think we know will change forever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone is at the center.  Since the universe is infinite, it expands in a equal distance from any point you choose to consider.  Therefore, any and all points are the center.  Think about it and apply it here...<br />
<br />
I was raised in Christian tradition, but not everything there rang true for me.  I started searching for different answers to my questions somewhere around age 12 or so.  I've studied almost every major world religion to some degree or another, a lot of different philosophies, pagan and occult traditions (including shamanism), you name it.  I've taken a little bit of everything and worked into my own philosophy/spirituality and keep revising as I go.  Taoism and Buddhism play a big part, but there are a few areas where almost every belief system overlaps, and in those places we tend to find things that ring True.<br />
<br />
Hard to summarize everything while I'm at work and I'm being inundated with mundanity and inanity.  If you want to know where I'm coming from, read the Tao Te Ching, it's very short and the biggest single influence on me.<br />
<br />
By the way Lit, the picture in your sig cracks me up every time I look at it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">For me, it has not been a search of finding the truth.  The Truth found me many years ago.  I simply must wait here in this life for events to transpire as they have been foretold in the ages past.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is cryptic and strange to most folks, but this is my path and not for others.<br />
<br />
As far as EQ is concerned...<br />
<br />
I started a shaman on the advice of a friend becuase I did not understand the game at all.  However, I can see now looking back, how this was choosen for me.  I &quot;grew&quot; into the class.  I feel right about this class and interacting with it.<br />
<br />
I have played all the other classes to some degree.  Clerics and Paladins struck me as being religous and not spiritual.   A shaman has a level of mysticism.. a path of knowledge that few seek.<br />
(This is not how I want to say all this, but it is sometimes hard to put feelings into words.)<br />
<br />
I do not expect anyone to understand me, except that playing a shaman in this computer game feels right to me.<br />
<br />
Toh</div></div><hr />

WHOA!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Interesting topic.<br />
<br />
I consider EQ to be a role playing experience, even if I am not perhaps playing a specific role.  When I log on I leave my baggage at the door as much as possible as the game is 'pretend'.<br />
<br />
In game I have no qualms in game killing lions, tigers and bears (oh my!) but in real life I dont even squash bugs.  <br />
<br />
In game I have no qualms of making and eating 10lb meat pies, but in real life I am a vegan.<br />
<br />
I started a shaman with the intent to have fun at this different class then what I had tried before.  The religion was just a footnote in the characters personality file really.  When I wish to play to the role I will get philosophical regarding the in game religion.<br />
<br />
I know I am different from most people, I have learned to deal with that.  I have my small zen books on the desk and I share passages with my guild.  I have put people on ignore for discussing horrible things that I can not stomach the thought of.  If I recall the first person I did that to was laughing at a TV show launching cats over or into a wall.  I was very upset.   I normally gross/freak out people when we compare what everyone is munching on for dinner during a group or raid.  hehe  But sometimes, it does spark some lightbulbs or intelligent conversation.That being said, if I had a desire to search for others with the same spiritual nature as myself, I would probably lean toward Buddhism.  <br />
<br />
Im just earthy crunchy like that, I guess. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It all boils down to faith - and faith comes in many flavors.<br />
<br />
There are those that have faith in the existence of a supreme being and choose to acknowledge that faith through the practice of organized religion.  Call them religious.  They say, &quot;I have seen the light - it is truth and good&quot;<br />
<br />
There are those that have faith in the existence of &quot;something out there greater than we can understand&quot; but disdain many of the bad things surrounding organized religion.  Call them agnostic.  They say, &quot;I see light, but wonder about its source.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are those that have faith that science is the unfettered search for the truth, uninfluenced by archaic religious dogma.  Call them scientists.  They say, &quot;Light is but a series of photons that behave both as particles and waves - sometimes simultaneously.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are those that have faith the billions of religious practitioners and spiritual people in the world are wrong and are certain their belief in &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; is the truth.  Call them atheists.  They say, &quot;Light?  Dark?  What's that got to do with reality?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then there's me.  I try to observe things that go on around me in a spiritual way, believe some things are inherently good, some things are inherently bad, and situational ethics are a cop-out for the intellectually challenged.  Much of what we see is currently unexplainable, and therefore should be investigated thoroughly by the means available to us.  Call me undecided.  I say, &quot;The light is shiny and good, but why does it exist in the first place?&quot;<br />

You know , that alone is a powerful statment. i mean i can see strong evidence that we indeed have the freedom to shape our reality and experiences.  what if the faith you place in  ideas is what brings them into YOUR reality. i mean that would explain all the different religious so fast. belief in it makes it real. did jesus acend to heaven and be come lord ? well maybe to a christiant cause they place faith in it and help create it.<br />

Ludicrous and true at the same time.<br />
<br />
Ludicrous - you would have to find some really hot guy in volcanoes and the sun pulled across the sky by a team of horses.<br />
<br />
True (from a certain standpoint) - a Science Fiction book published in the late 1700's, I think, described a voyage to the moon that was remarkably similiar to the way we actually got there.  Did he foretell it, or create a blueprint that people followed?  Does it mean we'll see Star Trek transporters and faster than light travel in the future?<br />
<br />
If I have to pick a belief, I'm going Christian.  What other religion espouses universal love of each person by the creator (and family)?  Who wants to be reborn as a cow, be trapped in a spiritual world where one's insolent descendents forget you, or poof like a corpse in EQ (no GM's gonna restore you)?</div></div><hr />

After all, an atheist must have faith that there is no God or gods.  In an infinite universe, I find that anything is possible.  Even God, gods, and spirits.  So rationally I can accept the fact that there is a God, but I find it extremely hard to sit and listen to some fellow mortal preach about him/her/it to me.  As if they knew more than I did about the supernatural somehow, and wanted to be sure I didn't believe in something different from their beliefs.  <br />
<br />
I guess I'm kind of anti-religion.  Religion is the death of God.  It's where faith goes to die.  It's a cop-out for all the nervous planners of the world who want to be sure they are covered once Death's shroud covers them.  <br />
<br />
I've studied the major world religions in university and in the people I've met in my travels.  Mostly it's a bunch of hogwash with a few pearls of wisdom inserted to make it valid at all.  Methodology of faithful living just bores me.  <br />
<br />
Having been raised in the Christian religion, i can look back at how few of the people I knew that were actual Christians.  If you claim to have faith in Jesus who said above all, &quot;Love thy neighbor as thyself&quot; and yet you treat other people like dirt, I am convinced that you have no real faith and are just performing lip service to a local cult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everybody should have a basic working knowledge of the 4 largest belief systems (Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) at the very least.  In amongst all the drek are the fundamentals of living a spiritual, stable, sane life.  Curiously enough, they're what all four beliefs agree upon.<br />
<br />
It's not enough to live and let live, for me.  It's to live and help live.  I'm willing to give a person a hand, but I won't spoon-feed him.  I don't believe the world owes ya a living, but I believe in offering aid when I can.<br />
<br />
If I see a guy standing on the corner asking for handouts, I won't toss a buck at him.   I offer to meet them at close restaurant (or McDonalds, should true food be too far) and buy them a decent meal... if he takes it, wonderful.  If he refuses, he can find his own way.  I made an effort.  It's amazing how many beggars get indignant when you offer to get them food instead of cash.<br />
<br />
I find that representing the Tribunal most closely matches that philosophy.  You earn your way by your deeds.  Beg for cash?  Here's an easy job to earn it.  No?  /bye.   I frequently stop to give a hand to somebody working hard at fighting something that's clearly overmatching them.  I may &quot;accidentally&quot; inspect them mid-battle.  If they comport themselves well (ie, say &quot;thank you&quot; and not beg for pp/gear/buffs), I may go out of my way to find something amongst my trader that they can use.<br />
<br />
My religious beliefs other than that?  Raised Catholic, recovered, thought the ministry might be a good way of helping, became ordained, decided organized religion is a crock, got my PhD in religion and my very own DD (that's Doctor of Divinity, not Direct Damage) as a community church minister... which I stopped doing, once folks started focusing too much on &quot;church&quot; and not enough on &quot;community.&quot;<br />
<br />
So now I work taking 911 calls and dispatching cops, ambulances, and firefighters.  Good work any way ya look at it.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely.  Spirituality is a personal philosophy and belief system.  Religion is, sadly, a codified, and often dogmatic form of spiritualism.<br />
<br />
Everybody should have a basic working knowledge of the 4 largest belief systems (Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) at the very least.<br />
Not to nit pick, but your western centrism is showing.  Here are the top 12 religions of the world by current population from http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ):<br />
<br />
1. Christianity: 2 billion<br />
2. Islam: 1.3 billion<br />
3. Hinduism: 900 million<br />
4. Secular/Nonreligious/Agnostic/Atheist: 850 million<br />
5. Buddhism: 360 million<br />
6. Chinese traditional religion: 225 million<br />
7. primal-indigenous: 150 million<br />
8. African Traditional &amp; Diasporic: 95 million<br />
9. Sikhism: 23 million<br />
10. Juche: 19 million<br />
11. Spiritism: 14 million<br />
12. Judaism: 14 million<br />
<br />
It's not enough to live and let live, for me.  It's to live and help live.  I'm willing to give a person a hand, but I won't spoon-feed him. <br />
<br />
Well said - like the &quot;Give a man a fish - feed him for a day.  Teach a man to fish - feed him for a lifetime.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sound like a very generous person that has thought through your spirituality very well.  I wonder if childhood Catholicism is a common thread in people with this trait.<br />

Since the universe is infinite, it expands in a equal distance from any point you choose to consider.  Therefore, any and all points are the center.  <br />

I was there at one point, but stuff happend to me that showed me the universe is NOT like that.  I came across evil spirits[demons if u want to use christian thoelogy trems].<br />
<br />
Theologies that teach the crap that WE are god, have a very weak line of reasoning about evil in the universe.  They are basically a lie to cover up a more important truth: ie the cosmic struggle that is going on around us.<br />
<br />
Also my girlfriend met someone who has been resurected. I have heard his account of what happende to him, while his body was dead;  and it confirmed what i knew anyway.  There are seperate spiritual entites in the multiverse. Humans are seperate spiritual beings form the creator,<br />
<br />
sorry pal,  quit smoking that weed, and reading that crappy new age stuff, cos u just gonna delude yerself; i have a few friends with similar views to yourself, one of them takes LSD to help him experience his oneness with the universe. Need i say more?<br />

good thread tho )<br />
<br />
btw our universe (physical universe) as opposed to the MULTIVERSE wich includes the spiritual planes[heaven, paradise, sheol, hades etc] cant be infinite, if its suposedly expanding all the time.  How can infinity get bigger?</div></div><hr />

I am thinking on a larger scale than &quot;physical universe&quot; in that statement.  MULTIVERSE does not appear in any dictionary I've found, so I dislike using the term, even though I understand what is commonly meant by it.</div></div><hr />

i dont smoke pot , or take drugs of any kind except a drink once in a very great while.<br />
<br />
I have studied meditation and tend to reflect on things all day long. This is where my ideas come from. These are ideas that when i think of them i throw them away for sometimes years to see if they keep showing up. Some of them do.<br />
<br />
In my &quot;thoughts and theories&quot; i dont discount evil, hell in my world its even some what required  to maintain strength which is something i value.<br />
<br />
I cant disreguard my ideas on the universe being a great being we are part of , cause its in science all aorund us. To a extent we are walking universes , are we not ? our atoms that make us op are charge positive , negitive and neutral. Just like people are &quot;charged&quot; that way.<br />
<br />
Did you know that years ago they took pictures of the universe , the ones they had , and put them in a computer so they would interconnect and expanded out and out and they found a design.<br />
<br />
The design was that of linking stars/galaxies which connected to clusters. This design was identical to the layout of oyur and my brain system. The way the synapses connect ot the neurons.<br />
<br />
Was a very intresting imagei saw before me and i think its when this idea of us being 1 huge being came from.<br />
<br />
not from pot and not LSD or stand upside down and beaitng my head with a hammer to achieve a out of body experience. Observation and reflection upon the things i see aorund me is all.  You might be right , i might be completely entirly wrong. I definetly omit that and take it into aco****.<br />
<br />
But when something shows itself again and again even after you throw it out the window, makes you look a lil closer at it and wonder why it keeps poping up.<br />
<br />
Im not just a quick thinker. i didnt get asked this and form this opinion in 5 min. this is atleast a decade of hard searching , pondering , meditation , study and rebuulding my belief system and forgeting hat i was told when i grew up to try to remain unbias and thats ahrd ;)<br />
<br />
Her is another idea that you might find intresting to ponder.<br />
Thought is theorized to take shape in the form of vibration. Now... lets ponder on this being true. lets say , you and me have a vibration rate of about 7 beats per second, give or take a few for the level that the thought is upon ( hate/love/etc).<br />
<br />
Now if spirits and devils and angels exsist , perhaps they just vibrateon a different pattern of life and and htis is why we dont see them. ever take a pencil and shake it real fast ? it start to  &quot;disapear&quot;.  Something to think about ;)<br />
<br />
As far as your GF's friend . Well death is a intresitng subject. When you die you will go through a very trumatic experience, i mean its hte end of you , whats more scarier then entering into a void of the unknown , not knowing if your going someplace or not , oor if your will be rewarded or punished. I cant believe in anyone's &quot;near death experiences&quot; simply cause its too easy to have halluciations. the mind is so much more powerful then the average person knows. it most definetly can create a delusional state and create a reality for itself that overwrites the reality all of u share. They are very real and highly believeable. i have has some .. hmm... intresting .... experiences to say the least , yet i force myself to question them never endlingly cause i just dont know if it was dilusional or real.<br />
<br />
There is alot in this area that cant be stood on cause its like the old biblical story of the man that built his house on sand and the man that house on stone.<br />
<br />
I guess what im aiming for is not taking the house thats built on sand which mommy and daddy gave me as a child , or that the world has handed me by default , but to search out and find my own boulder to build my house on. Its a large task , some have told me im crazy for doing it this way , some have admired me and praised me. All i know is , its the only way for me ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
ps: hope some of that made sense and please forgive grammar , tying to type on this topic which i enjoy talking about and answer calls at work :p</div></div><hr />

Western centrism isn't showing but adversion to Judaism certainly appears to be showing.   Replace Judaism on that list with Hinduism ... since classing &quot;Secular/Nonreligious/Agnostic/Atheist&quot; is a stretch at best as a single religion.

but the brain holds a electrical charge for up to 30 days. many people are&quot;dead&quot; for more then 20 min and brought back, ive seen so many stories about childeren falling in pools that are dead for more then 20 mina nd come back to life.<br />

maybe he was experiencing a delusion brought about the truma of dying. he thought it was the end and couldnt cop , so a delusional state was induced to escape it. BTW , you never went into full detail what he experienced , i would like to hear if it you are willing to share.<br />

<br />
actualy im a lil confused on what your meaning here. you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Litgruv i disagree with you Gnostic ideas&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
Who said i dont believe in souls and some christian/non-pagan idealism , why cant we all still be god ? part of 1 greating being , perhaps the soul is the spiritual animation given to the flesh bodies we have that is infact a peace of the lifeforce of the universe ,which is again us. why the need for seperation? . Perhaps we are talking about the same thing infact , just from different points of view my friend. perhaps alot of religion is like this cause you can not deny that true teachings of christ and buddha are very close to each other in their messages , yet are regarded as complete oppisites of each other cause of the origin of the messages.<br />

I don't believe there's a satan who predertermines our sin. I think an individual is ultimately responsible for their actions. This goes all the way back to our neanderthal ancestors clubbing the cromagnons on the head to get better stuff. The number one  motivating factor for any sin is to better one's self, and to gain advantage.<br />
<br />
I don't believe in the efficency of religion. The influence, yes, but not the efficiency. The many interpretations of the Bible for instance, rarely take into account that this is from the viewpoint of a bunch of goat farmers who thought they should get back the land they were chased out of. On top of that, the interpretations are are varied and disingenuous. They are trying to assign doctrine to the rants of goat farmers who got translated by sheltered myopic scribes.<br />
<br />
I don't believe that God, who created the universe, is as interested in our lives as we would like. I used to keep goldfish, but I didn't give them my undivided attention 24/7. We're on our own for the most part, but he'll occasionally clean out the gravel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well , you might label me as a new ager (which in complete honesty im a lil offended by , but not much ;) ), but i grew up under the roof a minister. i have studied with buddhist monks, ive had deep and mutiple talks with community leaders in many different religions, attended indian drums circles , sat in church , let me tell you brother i have been searching , im not talking from internet research . I have put my hands into and in some cases tried to live the point of views i speak about. its not failing to comite to anything i feel. I believe its having a open mind to changes and the realization that what you &quot;think&quot; is right could at anypoint turn incorrect. im happy you have faith that is deep rooted in something. I chose to not opress your ideas because they are different then mine , i chose to listen to you and embrace the things you say that could be correct while keeping free enough to reject the things i dont feel are correct.<br />
<br />
I think your not seeing the big pitcure here that im speaking of. To me there is room for all beliefs and religions i feel. To me im thinking they are like , vaults of knowledge on the human spirit , ways to remember pieces of ourselves , so im not going to be leading a crusade to rid the world of people that believe other things , i will crusade against the people that think they are right over everyone else and we need to believe them cause they are right, since they are right how can anyone else possibly be right.<br />
<br />
Again , no failure to comit here i feel. Ive done my sunday schools , ive attended my masses , i have comited in the past. but what you see now as &quot;mixed up, and vague&quot; i view as having a open mind and questing for truth.  Mixed up a lil ? Sure i am , how can you approach the vastness of enternity freshly and unhindered as possible without being a lil confused and mixed up ? <br />
<br />
I think the problem here is that you group me with people you have talked to in the past , this is a problem i think is a human behavior. We have similar experiences so we group them up in a attempt to organize and streamline the experiences, i do it too.<br />
<br />
Example : My GF gets mad at me at times cause i do whatever, well she will get VERY mad cause its sorta what her ex-hubby did. more to the point its something he did before that lead to worse things. she automaticly will group me up with him and ill get treatment like i am him, getting heat for things i havent done , but for things he has done. When i let her vent and explain it to her , she realizes it and appoligizes and we deal witht he actual issue WE have , not her and her ex-hub.<br />
<br />
See where im coming from ? I believe its important to &quot;try&quot; to treat each person as a new interaction and look at them openly. Not judge them for things they have yet to say/do  :)<br />
<br />
But hey , i think we can at this point agree to disagree ;)<br />

When did you meet God?  In what service you were at , did you feel the presence of the holy spirit?<br />

Cos if you not got a damascus raod experince, then all your thinking is a waste of time. You may as well be an athiest.  You are typical of a religious person.  go trough the outward formulas, but you not prepared to let God TELL you what to do.(admitedly its scary).  What is your concept of sin?  i bet you got a load of pshlological bull**** eplanation as to why YOU are not a sinner???<br />
<br />
God will never have a relationship with you, unless you are prepared to work with HIM.  Stop scating on the surface of the pond, and ASK GOD to lead you towards him.  Rember if we are dealing with a all powerful beign then HE can intevenne in our lives, but you have to have the faith . And GOd is not an electric kettle, parayers are not answerd instantly!!!  infact god wont answer prayer AT ALL if you have not delat with the issue of your sins.<br />

i have to admit , its difficult to explain things to you cause you are constatly grouping me with things you have dealt with and thinking you have me all figured out. I dont believe this is the case. I dont need to be &quot;fixed&quot;. I dont need you to tell me how my beliefs are incorrect. <br />
<br />
You seem very defensive in your replies to me, if i have come off as attakcing your belief system in my dismantling of it AND others , please dont be offended.   ITs truly not mgoal to question your faith and make you prove them to me. IM simply trying my best to state my findings.<br />
<br />
&quot;hope that helps&quot; <br />
<br />
Well again , i appreciate the desire to save me , i do see your desire to help , but i dont need it ;)<br />
<br />
&quot;You are typical of a religious person. go trough the outward formulas, but you not prepared to let God TELL you what to do.(admitedly its scary). &quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
Bro , i have left behind my safe christian pillows and let it all go so that i can experience the knowledge of god and the universe as it was intended. i do feel that i should not need a minister or a religion to know what i should be doing and feeling. i believe if there is a god i shouldnt need someone to tell me what im saying , if he is so strong and powerful and able to affect my life , then let him speak to me. why do i need you or anyone else to tell me what he says ?<br />
<br />
i think experience is the real truth.  not what a book is telling me , not what you are telling me here , not what paster bill says either. religion is sujective to perspective i think. pastor bob might interpret things differently then i do inthe bible or whartever book , so who should i listen to ? why them over me ?<br />
<br />
<br />
So to sum up , i appreciate your attepts to enlighten me, it shows to me anyway , that you care enough about your fellow man to try to help them when you think they need help , but i also feel alot of what you speak is clouded by religion and borderline close minded, which IS understandable cause you think you have your truth and you ofcourse think i should know it cause its working for you.<br />
<br />
Well at this point i need to come of lunch and i dont wanna type and not give you the maximum attention you deserve on this topic. so i will bid you good day and leave with this.<br />
<br />
If you wanna still debate things , im very happy and excited to , but i get the feeling , which might be wrong, that your on a crusade to save me , which is not what i desire form you or anyone ;)<br />
<br />
Debate more ? yes<br />
But that will require you to open your mind and quesiton yourself as i am ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">what u call open minded id call clueless, it obvious that you resecnt your father and have rebeled against him as an authority figure.<br />
<br />
dont get lost in the woods with the rest of the clueless hippys  !<br />
<br />
yeah iv met some like u before, he CLAIMED he was open minded, but he was not really open to God talking to him; his father was also a minister(who he had a dubious relationship with)<br />
<br />
If G od is Truth, then why dont u ask god to SPeak to you in the written word.  as we live in the west, start with the Bible.  Dont move away from the bible till you know it backwards.  You will just get lost in the jungle, if you try to undersatnd ALL religions.<br />
<br />
FOCUS u hippy headed lay about!<br />
<br />
Let GOd speak to you from say the book of isaiah, or Hebrews, 2 very powerful books, and very spiritual.  when u read, dont just open the pages and read, pray first, and ask for guidance.<br />
<br />
You WILL NOT find God thro philosphy!  I am a clever and educated person, but i have learnt to be child like in my faith, and in me relationship with the Father.  Just as  Christ told me to be.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me that you have a problem, appreoching god, because of your past realtionship with your father.  be honest with yourself.<br />
<br />
/hugs<br />
<br />
edit:  maybe u are wise not to trust everything a pastor tells you.  Thats corect. some christians are fakes!!!!  it takes time and a spiritual eye to spot them.  I met God when i was 13, i am now 30, and have learnt alot in those 15 years, i have seen frauds, and devout genuine folk, bleesed by God.  At the end of the day  the only person you can Trust is God/jesus Christ, and not yourself! <br />
<br />
If God designed the universe, then He knows how it works, and can help us cut thorugh all the chaff flying around!  remerber that the worl we see now is NOT the one god made.  its the one humands have desicrated.  Its easy to get mislead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">ROFL ... wow.<br />
<br />
Ok , well im going to end this interaction. Your not really basing any facts and being extremely closed minded and boderline insulting ;)<br />
<br />
just a few FYI...<br />
<br />
I love my father and respect him more then anyone in this world.<br />
Im not a hippy.<br />
I dont smoke Pot.<br />
<br />
You make assumptions my friend without knowing the facts to which are my situation. Its this mentality that drove me away from christianity . The willingness to attack anything different from itself without quesitoning why they themselves believe the things they do. The blind belief in something frankly scares me. <br />
<br />
<br />
To end this , dont worry about me my friend , im doing ok on my quest for enlightenment. I certainly have no desire to be saved from myself and will try my best to keep a open mind and roll with the punches that are handed to me as i walk my path ;)<br />
<br />
So with that ill end this topic since its you and me alone. Realize i respect you very much and just cause i dont follow your beliefs doesnt mean we cant still respect each others beliefs ;)<br />
<br />
I wish you well my friend<br />
<br />
