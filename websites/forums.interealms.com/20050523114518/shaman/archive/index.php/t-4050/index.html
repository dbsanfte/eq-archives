<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zazk Buffurbootay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello there, Zazk here,  long time lurker, first time poster. Got tired of monks 2 over 50 ( diff servers) 1 warr over 50. Burned out of melee only. I have hit 52 since starting in April. Mostly solo. I have very sound tactics for soloing. Very much an ac/hp shaman. Over 1900 self buffed and 900+ ac. Defense, Piercing and Alteration all maxed.<br />
<br />
2 Questions for you helpful older brothers.<br />
<br />
1. To link a messge with a heal for example would I macro <br />
/cast 1<br />
/%t being fast healed by Zazk<br />
<br />
2. When I am raiding with my guild I am the yungun so to speak. SHould I jbb and secondary heal? Let the older ones slow and dot etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/cast 1 <br />
/%t being fast healed by Zazk <br />
Think the 2nd line would have to begin with /say or /gsay.<br />
<br />
2. When I am raiding with my guild I am the yungun so to speak. SHould I jbb and secondary heal? Let the older ones slow and dot etc?<br />
Throw some slows around if you want. Realize that higher level slows will overwrite your slows so you may see them wear off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thx for the kwik reply .... I appreciate it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agree -<br />
although I like to have the announcement line repeated - for example: <br />
/1 %T is slowed  (assumes /1 is your raid chat channel)<br />
/say %T is now slowed     (assumes the raid channel is mixed with the battle spam for at least some of the raiders)  <br />
<br />
all depends on your raid/guild.  Do they want to see the message, or not.  Usually slows, Malxxx, tash, OOS should be announced.  some raids like to see all the heal messges, others consider that a lot of spam.<br />
<br />
I am trying to convince our clerics to set up the CHeal rotation tells and announcements on a separate cleric channel.  We use a shaman channel if we have more than one shaman trting to slow or maloxxx or cripple, so the announcement stands out more.</div></div><hr />
