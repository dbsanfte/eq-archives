<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This has been discussed before, I know.  But I have yet to see all the arguments plus and minus discussed.  Maybe this needs to go into the FAQ.<br />
<br />
I just hit 60 and am pondering whether to continue levelling, work exclusively on AA's, or some combination.  The factors as I understand them:<br />
<br />
Higher levels mean fewer resists.  I can't land anything on a desert giant in PoS, for example.  This is a very compelling argument for me.<br />
<br />
Higher levels mean I resist more spells cast on me by mobs.<br />
<br />
Higher levels mean more HP/mana and better spells, to the extent that I can get parchments/runes for those spells.  I have almost all the 61-62 spells right now, so that argues for levelling at least to 62.<br />
<br />
Higher levels mean little or no XP in old-world zones.  Since soloing for XP is difficult in PoP zones, this ties me to the LFG command.  On the other hand, an hour spent LFG in PoT and an hour grouped in PoS is going to net me significantly more experience than I could expect in two hours soloing in Chardok or Sebilis.<br />
<br />
More AA's mean more functionality.  Cann V changes the class dramatically and putting XP full into AA will give me Cann V faster.  In addition, MGB and RC make me more valuable to my guild.<br />
<br />
AA points come faster at level 60 than they would at 61+, killing the same mobs.  (On the other hand, if I move on and kill tougher mobs at 61+, I may be able to AA at the same rate per hour spent, Idunno).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I find it pretty sad that you even have to ask that question. IMO, there's something badly flawed with a game design where whether to level or not is even an issue. But it is, and I've ranted enough on the subject so here's my take on your question. <br />
<br />
Advantages of lvling to 65:<br />
- Your character will be more powerful, more quickly if you're at least flagged for PoV/S and lvl to 65 before anything else. <br />
- Don't have malo, torpor? It's probably cheaper and easier to get the lvl 65 versions. <br />
- Want to join a high end raid guild? lvl matters. <br />
- You'll get AA faster at 65 just because of the zones you can hunt in. <br />
<br />
Advantages of staying 60-61:<br />
- Better solo exp (or at least more places to solo for decent exp). <br />
- You can actually get decent exp outside of PoP. Even if I can double the exp in PoP, there's still something to be said for actually doing a fun dungeon crawl as opposed to pulling singles in PoV for the rest of your eq career. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't consider any of the above all that important. The main question you need to ask yourself is; 'what lvl are my friends and where are they hunting'? <br />
<br />
Since I have malo and torpor and don't have cann5 yet, I don't mind staying 61 for a while. I'm basically waiting to see whether this next expansion addresses the issues I have with EQ atm and that will determine whether I start to worry about putting time into getting flagged and leveling or bow out after 4 years anc concede that while it's been a fun ride, it's time to move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My personal choice was 61 then go for can 5.  that got modified to 62 because the those spells are really what everyone wants as buffs and the ubrade to chlorblast is huge.  500 hp in pop is a why bother.<br />
<br />
After can 5 i am going exp all the way to 65 before any more aa.  The difference in aa exp fromt he level 65 people to the level 61 people is negligable and at 61 aa exping anywhere off of pop is pretty dang worthless anyway.<br />
<br />
You can aa outside of pop at 60 but what aa exp you will get in 8 hours outside of pop you will get in 1 hour in pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thurdar, I don't think it's broken to make that choice.  AA grinding *is* levelling in one sense.  Some game systems don't really have a concept of &quot;player level&quot; at all, ALL your choices are the equivalent of AA grinding.<br />
<br />
But your point about where all my friends are is the most telling one.  Most of my guild is in BoT or working hard to get there now, and they're mostly higher than me.  Therefore, I'm going to need the levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye - who do you play with?  Where do you want to hunt?  If you and your friends/guild are headed to tier 3 Pop, level on up.  Otherwise ....<br />
<br />
I stayed at 60 for a while, working on AA.  Exp was good - get a group in PoP or duo in Seb Crypt/Emp or at Juggs, could see AA exp growing.  Then I leveled to 61 because I got the pet.  Love the pet, but ... exp in non-Pop went from okay to incredibly bad.  ToV would be good if I could be in the exp group, I guess, but Seb/Chardok/Velks/Seru went from acceptable to undetectable.<br />
<br />
I need malo and I need torpor.  Everywhere they drop is now almost zero exp for me (I am overlooking VP, as there is no one in my guild with a VP key or any interest in a VP key.  For that matter, I don't know whether exp there would be any good at 61, or not).  <br />
<br />
In Crypt/Emp with a group, killing was easy.  EXP?  i finally went to 100% AA just so there was some chance of seeing some movement.  In 9 hours of steady killing there, I got 1% reg exp and 5% AA exp.  We cleared the Crypt, the area up the ramp where the PH spawns for the monk's Whistling Fists quest, and most of the roamers in the area, as well as the Blood/Emp room (no enchanter, so we did not pull the other skels in the Emp room)<br />
In that time, we had 18 or so pops in Emp room, 3 were Emps, one dropped no spells, one dropped some Nec spell (Nec in group was not impressed)and the third dropped two Wiz spells.  I ended up with my usual lousy rolls, got two second rate 2hs weapons (Nathsar and something else) a couple of gems and maybe 150 pp as my cut.  Not very motivated to go back.<br />
<br />
No need to yell at me for not being uber enough to solo Emp or GW's.  I am simply saying that, for this shaman, in a guild not ready for Tier 3 PoP zones, I am wondering if I should go back down to 60 so I can pretend I am making progress towards Canni V while camping mobs that have a chance of dropping the spells I really want.   As for helping my guild - At level 60 I could land slow and malosi/malosini and Bane of Nife on mobs conning red and yellow.  My resists were adequate, so I didn't need to heal myself.  I could spend mana healing (Kraggs is better than nothing) tanks between pulls, so clerics could med more.   Our one shaman higher thqan me, at level 65, was doing the slows.  t Level 65 (or 62, or whatever) I would be landing more spells on the first try - but that is not essential where we raid now.  I need Canni V, and I do not want to be restricted to tier 2 zones and pickup groups.<br />
<br />
PoP is fine with me - I just have reconciled myself to playing through the Velious and Luclin content, with my guild, before heading up to 65 and Tier 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this is EQ......<br />
<br />
LEVEL &gt; ALL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I 2-box a lot of the time I play because I play odd hours from most of my guild and I like to be able to take a break or get something to eat when I feel like it. But duoing with my 60 ranger in Sebilis is still pretty decent exp at 61. Its actually quite fun too because you can easily end up with 4 or more frogs at once if you are not careful. I got 20 percent exp in 61 there without really trying.<br />
<br />
But if Thurdar thinks it sad that you have think about whether to level or not then its even sadder that its better exp and more fun to play with smaller groups in a damn MASSIVELY multiplayer game (as they like to call it).<br />
<br />
My advice would be to make damn sure you are enjoying what you do and where you do it. I fail to see how it is so much better getting 4 times (or more) the exp in another zone if its boring the hell out of you. But if all of your friends are in BoT it looks like a nobrainer what to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You have your plusses and minuses well layed out...<br />
<br />
Now you need to consider the personal aspects:<br />
<br />
Where are your friends/guild at? Are you doing Kunark mobs? Velious mobs? Luclin mobs?  <br />
<br />
Do you have your flags for valor/storm? Do you have the ability to get flagged easily?<br />
<br />
Does your guild have other shaman with MGB?<br />
<br />
Do you have Malo?  Do you have Torpor?<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I hit 60 the day before PoP release, with almost no aa built up. (I had malo and torpor banked from our VP raids.)<br />
<br />
I immediately leveled to 61 (giving myself a chance at Ethereal Parchaments) and began building aa.  Soon I had level 62 spells waiting to be scribed, so I switched back to real exp, and leveled to 62.<br />
<br />
When I finished off my 62 spells, I leveled to 63 and went back to aa work.  I immediately got a 64 spell and leveled to scribe it.<br />
<br />
Now I am at 64 grinding out aa points.  I plan on finishing MGB before leveling to 65.<br />
<br />
My guild is made up of characters between 61 and 65.  we have all been leveling up pretty quickly and exploring tiers 1-3 in pop.  We have only a couple people with VT keys, have never fought the emperor in Ssraa, some of us have ST keys (yay me!), some have Primal weapons and NTOV gear, but most do not.  We are all in WTOV+ gear.<br />
<br />
Basicly we are still at the upper end of velious and the middle of luclin.  Raiding for us is mostly first brood dragons for ST keys, and forays into ST and NTOV -with the ocasional hit on a Luclin mob.  The additional levels and spells is nice, it makes these mobs a lot easier.  It does mean that when we hit Ssraa for nameds or to farm bane weapon components we are JUST farming -its not an exp group.  The mobs are green.<br />
<br />
For us the advantages of leveling up have been greater than the disadvantages.</div></div><hr />

Thurdar, I don't think it's broken to make that choice.  AA grinding *is* levelling in one sense.  Some game systems don't really have a concept of &quot;player level&quot; at all, ALL your choices are the equivalent of AA grinding.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess the reason it bothers me is because the choices you make aren't based on how you want to advance your character. Level uber Alles in EQ, so if you really want to advance your only reaonable choice is to level. ALways been that way but more so given how exp works in PoP. <br />
<br />
 My problem is that the choice of whether to level or not comes down to game mechanics (flags), what level your friends are, whether you managed to get lucky and find torpor, malo... The barriers are too arbitrary and artificial for my tastes. How I want to advance my character never really came into the equation when I was debating whether to stay 61 or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i hit 62 and finished out my last 9pts of canni 5. imo it was the way to go. it's made the game that much more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />
