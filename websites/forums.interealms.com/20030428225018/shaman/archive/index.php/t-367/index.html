<br />
This link to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was posted on our guild site.  I was wondering if any of you have any opinions on the article.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rolano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, when you have a game you need to put a warning label on that says the game is addictive, you know you have a quality product, and the fact that these people are starting a lawsuit  to get a waring label on the boxes, well.... &lt;sarcasm&gt;All I can say is,  GIVE ME MONEY, you OWE me for breathing. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's interesting to see this.  I find it rather disturbing that a player would go to acts such as suicide over a set of binary numbers.  I don't think SOE should be blamed for this.  It's his fault he got that deep into the game he was so addicted.  *shrug*  Just my opinion.  I play Everquest for fun and a break from real life stuff, I still always find time to hang out with my friends, do school work, and chores around the house with little to no difficulty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A psychologist diagnosed him with depression and schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack of desire for social relationships, little or no sex drive and a limited range of emotions in social settings <br />
<br />
id be fairly willing to bet he had this problem before he started playing EQ.  Id also wonder at the parents who let their 21 year old son stay home and play video games for 12 hours a day, without holding a job.   His parents most likely paid for his EQ subscription, paid for his cable internet, paid for his food/rent while he was playing and not working.  And they have the balls to sue VI because their game is addictive?  They should be locked up as accessories to murder, then.<br />
<br />
Do gambling addicts get to sue casinos for their games being addictive?  hell no.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Didn't we see this crap with heavy metal bands like Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne being accused of satanism and inciting people for suicide?<br />

Same story, different decade, /yawn.<br />

His parents are to blame 110%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I feel for the women, however, that is no grounds to blame others for not addressing her own apparent shortcoming in raising her child.  Various chemical imbalances can cause a variety of problems, but it is a parents job to be involved with the child to understand what is going on with them.  This whole thing comes across as a cry by the mother to find someone at fault for her childs death, but has she considered where the fault &quot;could&quot; truly like.  To those who thinks this is harsh, sorry.  The harsher truth is many people cannot accept the reality that they are infallible and look for a scapeboat make themselves feel better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I don't think that EQ was the cause of his death, or that the lawsuit has any real basis (as opposed to legal basis, which is a different realm altogether, kind of like The Grey - biring your own air), but I am struck by the responses here.<br />
<br />
Rather than attempt to wax philosophical (I am not very good at it), let me just say that I do not think/believe that any suicide is the result of a single triggering event.  And I think it is just silly to claim that EQ led to his suicide, where another game, such as DAoC, would not.<br />
<br />
From another angle - with over 400,000 paying accounts, how many suicides would you expect to see per year?  Keep in mind that a majority are US based, and many are teens and preteens.   If there are 100,000 US teens playing EQ, and EQ had no effect, positive or negative, on the number of suicides in that population would be expected to be about 10 (1997 stats)<br />

shows that 2.8% of high-schoolers in a survey had actually hurt themselves - (it doesn't mention whether any of them did it because they got KS'd on an mob they needed for their epic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Floda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hear if you cast a spell backwards, you hear satanic messages</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A warning label, wouldn't be &quot;that big a deal&quot;. I don't see the harm in warning mmorpg virgins that this hobby can potentially be a huge, huge, huge timesink. Most of us agree that these games, while not as addictive as narcotics, or nicotine, or alcohol, ceratinly have addictive qualities hardcoded into them. <br />
<br />
Let's be honest - would you buy this game for your kid if they were a junior in HS, prepping for their SAT?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quintella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is the type of thing that makes me very angry.  I understand her anger and frustration with the loss of her son but suing?  I would understand more if she were suing to get her sons records.  Warning lables?  &quot;This game may become addictive so if you are prone to addiction don't play?&quot;  Of course the game is made to pull you in if it didn't it still wouldn't be around.  There is no end and you have to find a safe place to hide to log out so it makes us want to play longer?  Of course I am not mentally disabled but I never said to myself  &quot;OH I don't have a place to camp think I'll stay on for another hour and be late for work.&quot; Anyway, I had to quit reading the article when they started talking about &quot;gender bending&quot;.  That's a crock.  More power to the man who can play a woman character well.  Sorry for the spastic post.</div></div><hr />
