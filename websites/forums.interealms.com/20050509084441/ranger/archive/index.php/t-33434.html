Now I'm also curious as to what classes you guys might plan to take. (Final classes, not the starting generic classes of course). Closest thing to a Ranger would be the Elf Silver Ranger, Dark Elf Phantom Ranger(considering dark elves are cursed elves here) and the human Hawk Eye, which are all archers.<br />

I can try to help you with it although you can always check out game details from online sites for the game.<br />
<br />
L2 Orphus (http://www.l2orphus.com) and Lineage Warcry (http://lineage.warcry.com) are some of the sites I visit myself.<br />

Edit: Corrected a class name.</div></div><hr />

On the official website, the current version listed is only for the level 20 job change. I heard that the current patch on the NA version is the Prelude version. As soon as they update the Chronicle patch, they'll include the second tier job changes (e.g. Blade Dancers, Silver Rangers etc).<br />

Human Wizard is a first tier(job change) class, you'll still have to select a second tier class later at 40. Your choices includes Sorceror, Necromancer and Warlock. <br />
Warlock is basically a human summoner. There are three scenario as to their summonings, his/her pets will provide support to the caster's offensive capability, or he/she will support the pet's offensive capability, or both caster and pet will be on the offensive. Striking a balance will affect how well the caster perform. As such, they have several different types of pets available.<br />
Necromancers are basically offensive support human mages who reduce enemies's effectiveness in combat through debuffing and dots.<br />
Sorceror are basically the &quot;Big Guns&quot; of the human casters. They provide high damage offensive spells in combats and includes in their arsenal AoE spells. Thus in large skill combats, a group of them can effectively wipe a large group of enemies or concentrate their firepower to destroy a very powerful enemy. However, they do have their draw back of being unable to protect themselves and thus have to rely on groups and tanks to protect them.<br />
<br />
Dark Avenger is a second tier class and well...closest thing in EQ would be a Shadow Knight. They are basically like the Paladins (Lineage 2's not EQ's) except that their magic are evil and beneficial to self only(like poison and life taps) whereas Paladins' spells are more beneficial to others.<br />
<br />
That is the basic description available on the Taiwan Official site. You'll have to check forums for more in-depth description from players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, in case anyone is wondering, there are only two classes which are considered dual wield classes. All other classes can dual wield but do not gain as much bonus from these weapons compared to the two(with the exception of spell casters as they get generic weapon bonus which applies to all weapon types) as they do not have dual wield mastery. That said, any class can dual wield without penalties, they just do not gain bonuses for them as they would with single/two handed weapons depending on your class.</div></div><hr />

Ok, this is getting just a little freaky.<br />

My original surname was SwordSinger, this was when you had to petition for it. Then I petitioned several levels later to change it to Bladedancer. At that time, it was still an original name. I have seen several on my server with it now.<br />
BTW, you have to marry in or be born in to be a Bladedancer, we don't take applicants. :)</div></div><hr />

Blade Dancer which is a dark elf class and Swordsinger which is an elf class are the only classes with dual weapon mastery, they are sort of bards but not quite, probably closer to a skald in DAoC, they do good melee damage and they have short duration (like 1-2 mins) group buffs, Blade Dancer's spells are offensive type buffs, Swordsingers are defensive type buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Woah!  Wait!  What?  I was pretty sure that the only classes that got Dual Weapon Mastery were the Dark Elf Blade Dancer and the Human Gladiator.  I'm pretty sure Sword Singers don't get Dual wield...<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, how about a breakdown from someone that knows more than I do.<br />
<br />
What's the difference between a Blade Dancer and a Gladiator?  Gladiator has more self-buffs and does more damage, but the Blade Dancer is faster and has &quot;aura buffs&quot;?  And where exactly does a Sword Singer fit in?  Can they come close to matching the damage output of a BladeDancer without having Dual Wield Mastery?  Just some questions I have.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you're right, for some reason I thought it was the Swordsinger but just looked it up, it is the human Gladiator.<br />
<br />
not sure on the comparison between the 3 in tearms of damage output, i'd assume Swordsingers are less damage then as dual weapons are suposed to do more damage than single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keltan</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hhmm..  Well, here's the breakdown as far as I can tell:<br />
<br />
BladeDancer<br />
Dances/Aura<br />
Drain Energy<br />
Freezing Strike<br />
Hate<br />
Magic Resistance<br />
Sting<br />
<br />
<br />
Gladiator<br />
Detect Weakness<br />
Fatal Strike<br />
Hammer Crush<br />
Light &amp; Heavy Armor Masteries<br />
Sonic Attacks<br />
Stun Attacks<br />
Sword/Blunt Mastery<br />
<br />
Hmm...from that list I think a Gladiator sounds a bit better to me.  They get Dual Wield AND Sword Mastery, plus better Armor, Extra Sonic Damage...<br />
<br />
Basically the BladeDancer gives up all those for better Magic Resist, his Dances (which affect the party?), and Drain Energy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redoran</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SwordSinger Elf<br />
A mix between a Bard and a Fighter. The Swordsinger has a lot of team buffs based on their songs, and most of the songs are defensive buffs. Not as good at solo but very powerful in a team because of their buffs. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Gladiator Human<br />
Can dual-wield one-handed blunt swords.  They shine in one-on-one fights.  They deal a massive amount of damage in a short period of time.  They are the most powerful melee damage dealer.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Blade dancer Dark Elf<br />
Comparable to the Gladiator with a minor difference. Hit points and stamina are less than a human, but they do more damage. Uses a sword and can dual wield, giving up armor and shields to do that. Great one-on-one and multiple target damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
From what i gather, Blade Dancers are what EQers would consider hybrids, they get a lot of melee skills with spells and abilities to back them up, but Gladiators are pure melee, and all they do is dish out damage.  Swordsingers are well....bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyluvia</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Crim's question was answered already.<br />
<br />
Where did you get those class description Redoran? I read on forums from players who were in the Korean beta that the Blade Dancers are not really that great in 1v1 combats (in this case, it applies more to PvP really) as they heavily rely on their dance, especially the poison one (which has low success rate btw) to really allow them to fight toe to toe. Otherwise, they are usually pwned. &gt;.&lt; However, they are really good group wise as their buffs provide increased offensive capabilities to the group (increase damage, crit chance etc).<br />
<br />
Btw, I would consider both Blade Dancer and Sword Singer as bard type classes with different focus. They really complements each other though and its good to have both in groups most of the time if you can.</div></div><hr />

Yes, currently, the Silver Ranger is the strongest PvP class. Long range, high evasion, high accuracy, high(if not highest) damage and most of all, fastest running speed. However, the recent patches are fine tuning the other classes against archers. Mobs now run faster, with at least 4 types of mobs Silver Ranger cannot out run at all. Shields have increased parry chance against arrows.</div></div><hr />

Hmm.... Thats interesting. It would be better to confirm it with the NA Lineage 2 customer service first though. There were lots of conflicting reports about this beta info and whats more, that they say you might get to keep your character isn't something that EB can say for sure really. Last I heard, it wasn't decided yet if there will be a server wipe before P2P or that the Beta servers will go Live instead with whatever data they already have. (They did that for Lineage 1 IIRC) This is something that its better to confirm with the officials than to take a retailer at their words. :)</div></div><hr />

Erm... Mine is in Chinese. Problem was I didn't know there wasn't a &quot;reply&quot; feature so I didn't pick an english name when I started. However, as far as I know, server 2 has the largest english speaking player population amongst all the server. I wouldn't ask you to move server though, as server 2 is also the most heavily populated server (which also means peak hour is the hardest to log into). Still, I heard because of that, server 2 is also the one with the best hardware amongst all the servers.</div></div><hr />

Server 2 is the oldest server btw. Most of the old Closed Beta players are in that server. Thus this server has the most number of players. Anyway, Taiwan's time is GMT +8, you just have to watch for the timing. Between 4pm-1am is their peak hours. (Most players are students). Server maintanience is done everyday at 11am to 11:20am except Tuesday where its done 11am to 12pm. Most of the players from the US and Europe should not have an issue unless they are playing during their daytime hours. :)</div></div><hr />

P.S. For the record, Singapore banned Half-Life for about a month, before the resulting backlash from the players made them reverse their decision. The reason for the ban was some parents complained that the game was too violent and that it distract the children from their studies etc. Which IMO is a silly reason.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, for those who like web comics there is a pretty good comic series based on Lineage and Lineage 2. There are both official and unofficial comics actually. NCSoft has always been producing such tibits for the enjoyment of player community.<br />
<br />
Official Lineage 1 comics can be found at Downloads (http://www.lineage.com/download/stuff.html) section of the www.lineage.com (http://www.lineage.com/) website. Scroll down until you find the weekly comic combo box. (Only thing is, Adobe Acrobat Reader is required. Thats something I find irritating.)<br />
<br />
The unofficial translatedersion of the Korea NCSoft comic for Lineage 2 is done and hosted at KRPG (http://l2.krpg.com/bbs.php?id=l2&amp;category=8&amp;menuid=142). <br />
<br />
Of the unofficial comics, my favorite is the Lineage 2 Kids (http://www.legion-of-honor.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1233) series.</div></div><hr />

Chronicle 1 expansion will be made available upon retail. There are, planned for, 21 chronicles in all, with each chronicle, new areas and contents are added, expansions which are free for download.  :D]<br />
<br />
Edit: I just found out that the NACB is play-tested in pre-Prelude state. So expect at least a GB worth of download (2 CDs) installation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyluvia</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game was designed to be pretty much a level grind. The game focus is pretty different from Everquest's though. So if you're expecting it to be like EQ, you'll be disappointed. That said, the main focus of the game is in the massive PvP fights, especially castle siege and pledge vs pledge wars. This is an open PvP game and the main draw is supposed to be the PvP fights. However, it is not to be said that PvE contents will be lacking. The NACB is in pre-Prelude state, comes Prelude and Chronicle 1, there will be additional contents added, second job change and the map area of the game will grow. Additional Chronicles will be adding more land mass, new continent and dungeons and quests.<br />
Anyway, I do hope you can give it a go longer. Btw, the max level is 75 currently, two job changes at 20 and 40. The low level is awfully boring as you and thousands of others are basically doing the same thing over and over. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those who wish to get into beta soon, and you will definately play the retail, you can get the pre-order package and use rhe cd-key from the bonus CD and get into the current phase of closed beta. If you just wish to try before ordering/planning to buy, you might have to wait till open beta starts (there will be a wipe for closed beta anyway I heard). Currently, people are specualting that closed beta is ending soon, and that open beta might start somewhere mid-March. But thats specualtion. :)</div></div><hr />

Actually, I think they are trying to catch text conversion errors I think. Part of the problem in the Taiwan beta was that people couldn't read the quest text. In any case, open beta will start with the prelude patch, and retail with the chronicle 1 patch. Main things to look out for are the quest conversation texts. I wouldn't worry too much about the game bugs atm. Also, I think there will be a wipe for closed beta, so just enjoy the game for now. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although, mages in this game are actually sort of fun. I may make a mage alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyluvia</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most, if not all, the rangers here who wants to play Lineage 2, are going either blade dancer or gladiator just because of dual wield. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, for those who do not know, anyone can use any weapons, but if you do not have the skill for them, you will not have bonuses applied to using the weapons. That said, there are no dual wield daggers currently in game. Swords are the only weapons which can be &quot;crafted&quot; into dual swords (take two swords, which meet the minimum grade and requirment, and give to a NPC smith to combine them I think, can't remember).<br />
<br />
Only two classes have Dual Wield Mastery, they are Gladiator (Human) and Blade Dancer (Dark Elf). However, many healers (especially Prophets (Human)) use dual wield weapons also as the m.attack rating on weapons rarely affect their spells and also that their weapon skills is Weapon Mastery, which applies to all weapons they use as it does not specify which weapons. Fighters also get Weapons Mastery (stops at level 3), but they will begin to use specific weapon mastery upon choosing specific class path at level 20. Weapon Mastery for mages and healers progress up to 24 levels throughout their job path.<br />
<br />
Note: There is no penalty for using items not designed for your class. However, you will not be able to use them as efficiently as the classes who have the skills for them. E.g. Shillien Knight will get a lower increase to their attack rating when using a dual katana compared to a Blade Dancer who is using the same weapon. However, without Expertise (Grade level) skill, using a weapon or armor of a higher grade than what you can use, will result in a penalty. This is to prevent twinking. Expertise (Grade) is automatically gained when you reach the level, its level dependant.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you can. You should really see the list of swords that can be used to combine into dual wield swords. Most people prefer to use two swords of the same kind to turn into dual wield swords. However, I have seen people with dual wield swords of two different swords, but that is rare. You do look nicer with two swords of the same kind. :D<br />

The trainers will display skills you can train only. Skills open up upon job change/when you meet the level. So don't worry about it. However, do note that you will not have enough sp to get every skill at the start. You will have to choose what you want and get them. (Some people try to work around this by killing themselves and lose their xp/level, dying will not lose sp). At high level though, you will have more than enough sp to gain every skill available to your class but you'll have to manage your spendings well at the start.</div></div><hr />

I'm only L10, but up until L7 I was able to 1 shot everything, now I'm able to Ice Bolt snare yellows and kite them with ease (been doing that since L7).<br />
<br />
I guess it's probably too easy cause there's no resists. Yeah, sometimes Ice Bolt won't snare right off....so I run out a little ways and do it again. No biggie.<br />
<br />
Anyway, besides that, the game is neat so far. I like the fact that I've done most of my levelling while working on quests, so it doesn't quite feel like I'm just grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redoran</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for some reason i lost a lot of interest in L2. It may have been because i played the TW OB, which was hard because no one spoke english.<br />
<br />
It just feels like there is not much to do in this game ya know? I know they have up to 12 chronicles planned and US is not even in chron 1 yet, but what it has right now is what EQ'ers would call a perpetual state of &quot;farming&quot;.<br />
<br />
Log in, kill, earn gold, kill, earn gold, kill, earn gold...go buy new armor,kill, earn gold,kill, earn gold. Log out.<br />
<br />
I think ill wait a few months after L2 has gone live, after a few more patches and chronicles, after it has settled it self in a bit. For right now, i think im going to vomit succubus hair after all of that &quot;xp'ing&quot;.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh and Dranex, you think Mages are overpowered? Try archers. I have seen level 5+ kite around and kill Dark Horrors, which are level 17~20-ish.  Basically they buy a bunch of arrows, gather up all the dark horrors they can, wedge them in between some stairs and a wall by the DE dungeon, and then pluck away and dont get hit, its gargantuan xp to say the least and the GM's dont seem to want to do anything about it. With Chron 1 comes some archer balancing though, this should be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyluvia</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dranex, its easy to kite now, wait till Prelude and Chronicle 1 where run speed for players and mobs are adjusted, you'll find kiting to be really dangerous. You can almost never 1hit stuff that are white to you when you're 10+ really. Not unless you are overequiped.<br />
<br />
Actually Redoran, that is an exploit which you can be banned for, making use of area design to get mobs to get stuck. But GMs cannot be everywhere and they have to see you to catch you. Its not possible to stick a GM round every protruding corners in every dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redoran</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">of course its an exploit, but more power to em!</div></div><hr />

It will be interesting to see if they actually do adjust run speeds, and what problems that might cause.<br />
<br />
In any case, it won't really cause many problems for kiting, since you can snare.<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm suprised I even can kite, given that every spell I have has a 9 and a half minute cast time :D</div></div><hr />

However, different mobs have different run speed, at higher level, the speed increase (this is after patch).

<br />
The classes are really imbalanced for such a late stage of beta IMO. Pretty much everything seems to own a melee fighter. Hell, casters can fight in close quarters without breaking a sweat. Am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyluvia</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I would agree casters are pretty strong at the start. It is not impossible for a caster to fight in melee range I would agree also. But to say that melee fighters are weak, perhaps is to judge them too harshly. Also, you are looking at a generic class type right now. After the first job change, different classes will begin to shine in their respective fields. Also, you must note that mobs hit pretty hard at high level, unless you plan on killing greens or blues throughout your entire leveling, meleeing is not an option for damage casters. Healers however can gain heavy armor mastery (but that is pretty high level), which allows them to last longer and sometimes even tank mobs for the group. A good example would be a 6 people group consisting of 5 prophets (human buff focus healer) and 1 bishop (human pure healer) which I read about once.<br />
The game is group oriented with soloing being an option. It is rare for a player to be able to solo a high red mob and except to have no problem. Downtime is a major factor here also. I would have to say though, the most overpowered playstyle would be the archers.<br />
P.S. In case you didn't know, mana is an issue for archers as bow consumes mana per shot. Higher grade bows consume more mana. So overequip will result in very high downtime.</div></div><hr />

that's pretty much the case with all beta's because you get a bunch of 16 year olds who are playing beta just to play for free since their parents won't pay for the game for them, plus since characters will be wiped some people don't care about their characters reps, will be different once it goes live i'm sure.<br />

balance changes a lot, for some stupid reason NA closed beta is 2 major patches behind the actual game, we're in pre-prelude, past that there is prelude and cronical 1 which make a lot of changes to the game, those will be in NA when it goes live though.</div></div><hr />

I don't know the reasoning for this, but NA Beta seems to be going the same route as Japan Beta, they both gets Prelude patch in the open beta phase. Taiwan is going p2p with Prelude patch. I'm just thinking they haven't fully converted the other two patches to really use them for beta. Not sure though.</div></div><hr />

Well, we call that PK actually. The system works such that PvP (duels, wars etc) will result in no penalty to the person doing the killing, normal death rule still applies though to the person who is killed. PKing has pretty heavy penalties like a high item drop rate upon death, killed on sight by guards/guardians. Yes I agree it sucks to be pked, but that shouldn't stop you from trying out a game really.</div></div><hr />

One thing concerning PKs, they normally don't make it to the high end games. Mainly because the penalties for dying at high level is very very sever. On the average, PKs normally prefer to hang around the mid-20s or lower. Whats more, I do know some people who takes PKs as people who declares they want to be the &quot;rabbit&quot; of the hunt, and hunt them.</div></div><hr />

The game needs to naming filter in the worst way. Already seeing l33tsp34k names, aLtErNAtE CaPZ, celebrity names, etc etc. Totally disgusts me.

<br />
Daefaroth[/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
<br />
graphics are awesome, truly breathtaking, but i have some issues with the gameplay mechanics actually.<br />
<br />
Movement:  Point and click is nice at first, but the thing is you have to keep clicking to a new point of destination like in Diablo 2 which can get annoying if you are traveling far.  However, you can use your arrow keys to move, but dont even think of turning, for some reason (they may have fixed this in US) the camera would get all crazy when you tried to turn with the arrow keys.  Unlike EQ, there is no feature (numlock, Enter) where it will auto run in a straight line (none that i was aware of or told anyway).  Also, Kiting becomes somewhat of a workout for your fingers with the camera.  Assuming you have a mousewheel (mousewheel flips the camera 180 degrees in front or behind you quickly), you attak target, click mousewheel, run forward, click mousewheel, fire, click mousewheel, run, etc...you can get used to it no problem, but its uh...tiring.  This was what did when i created an archer, and apparently thats how most of the tai's on my server did too, because they all told me the same thing in their strange tai way.<br />
<br />
Targeting: Targeting isnt that bad actually, but most of that information is serverside, so it will be pretty slow during open beta.  During Kiting, it can be annoying if there is another mob standing next to the one you are kiting, because it is very easy to misclick and i miss the f8 button. The only thing i have against the targeting is that if you are sitting idle with nothing targeted, and some mob aggro's you, it will not auto target it for you like EQ, which is really annoying if it is an archer type unit or caster type unit (basically most of the mid level and high level mobs).<br />
<br />
On a good note, unlike EQ, if you are fighting a mob, and a similar mob spawns right next to the one you are fighting, it will not pop-aggro you, which i think is a very nice little touch.<br />
<br />
Another big thing they need to look at is Kill Stealing.  This maybe a habit among Korean and Taiwanese players, but i hate to stereotype.  The way experience is given is that more exp is given to the player who dealt the most damage...herein lies the problem.  If im a fighter and i start meleeing a mob and get it to 60 percent, then say an archer runs by and does a powershot and kills it, archer will gain more xp, even though i aggroed the mob and drained it that far.  That maybe somewhat fair i guess, but it gets worse: If you are hunting a quest mob, it will only drop quest pieces to whom ever delivers the last strike.  So if i bring a mob down to 11 percent, but some         mage/archer decides to do some kind of powershot and deplete the last 11 percent before me, they will get the quest item (and some experience)even though i had bought the monster down so low. Perhaps they need to make it to where the loot items actually drop instead of just 'appearing' in your inventory, and then place a 25 second time limit in which no one except the original aggro-er &amp; groupie can loot it, and after the 25 secs is over, its FFA.<br />
<br />
The L2 combat system is pretty good, much better than EQ. MUCH MUCH better.  Especially if you played a warrior in EQ, youll shed tears the first time you play a fighter class. Not only do you get actual skills you can use during combat, but later on, you can cast spells as well (dark elves get lifetap type spells and goodie-two shoes get heals).  Although it is accepted that in actual PvP fighting, Fighter classes dont do as well as Archers or Wizards.  Fighters literally have little to no chance of resisting or deflecting their ranged attacks, although i hear this changes in the Chronicles 1 patch where they super nerf archers. They also need to retune some of the 'priestly' classes and make them more dedicated healer types than the genero-wizardtype_09 that we have now.<br />
<br />
About the actual world, the place is kind of dead, and that would be the case if it was only for TW OB, but it was like that in KO p2p as well...<br />
I mean, even though we have different races with different alliances and alignments, they are not enforced at all.  I realize there is an alliance among all the races, but i am dissapointed that dark elves can walk around freely in the elven town and even set up shops under the world tree if they chose, the guards dont do anything. Some of you may like this, but i personally enjoy games where there are hated factions and NPC's who enforce these things. I like having to work up my faction enough so i can enter a city to trade in, creates a little diversity.<br />
<br />
Speaking of diversity, 4 hair combinations, 2 hair colors, and 2 facial structures for the most part. Better than EQ when it came out, but not better than all the other MMO's right now.<br />
<br />
Item/weapon/armor design is very nice though. The level 1 default newb gear you get looks better than most everquest plane of time dropped items. If this game is flawless in any aspect it is visually.<br />
<br />
Lastly, why do females dwarves look like 11 year old girls?<br />
<br />
Yes i know that was a lotta bitchin, but i was really excited about this game, been looking forward to it for the past 3 years, but after playing it so much, i didnt enjoy it as much. Like i said in a previous post, i will be waiting a few months after this game goes live so i can play a patched, bug free, more content version of what is out right now.</div></div><hr />

Actually, there is a dedicated healer, and that is the Bishop second job class for human. Human Mage -&gt; Cleric -&gt; Bishop. The Elders and Shillien Elders of the two elf races are hybrid casters, which is kind of like druids if you look at it.<br />

The CD-Key on the disk will get you into Closed BETA and carry over to Open BETA.<br />
<br />
And you don't purchase the retail copy when it comes out if you don't want to. You'll only be out five dollars for four weeks game play. Still a pretty good deal.<br />

They are going to wipe Closed BETA, but rumor has it that any character over Level 20 in Open BETA will carry over to Retail.</div></div><hr />

After I got my invite I went and got a Bonus CD for my Bro-In-Law. That's how he got in to the Closed NA BETA.<br />

The rumor seems to originate from players in the NA BETA that were in the Koren BETA when the characters were carried over there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyluvia</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Althought that'll only be really effective if you hunt twinks only as level 5 players are mostly still using newbie gear. Most of the PKs are level 4 spell casters while the higher level ones are mostly dagger classes. Those I meant so far anyway.<br />
<br />
And Oro, do give the game a longer try. Most PKs don't last into the upper end of the level range (currently max is 75 levels) as the conditions for dying and gets a lot more harsh. Reducing Karma also gets a lot harder as you can only reduce Karma through killing mobs around your own level. In betas, as there will be wipes, most people who try cares less about how their reputation ends up. As long as no one can associate the PK's name with their retail character, they don't really worry too much about dying etc. The upper end of PK level range is usually mid/late 20s. Beyond that, you tend to need to group to progress and making too many enemies isn't too good an idea.<br />
<br />
Note: I have no idea if there will be a guild of pure griefers/PKs or not. But I'm sure most server will have policies against them. Also, NA NCSoft is in the progress of changing some of the policies in regards as to what is considered griefing and such to suit the NA and European L2 communities as the policies currently are more suited for the Korean community.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyluvia</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, most of the races are created using one element thus there are only four races created. The full &quot;lore&quot; is below and I'll quote part of the webpage.<br />
<br />
Creation of Races (http://www.lineage2.com/background/legends02.asp)<br />
Einhasad was goddess of creation and created forms using her own spirit. Her children used their own powers to create life from these forms. <br />
<br />
Shilen instilled the spirit of water into the first form that was created. This is how the race of elves was created. <br />
<br />
Paagrio instilled the spirit of fire into the second form that was created. This is how the race of orcs was created. <br />
<br />
Maphr instilled the spirit of earth into the third form. This is how the race of dwarves was created.<br />
<br />
Sayha instilled the spirit of wind into the fourth form. This is how the race of arteias was created. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the Arteias race will ever come into the game as a playable race or not, but personally I don't think so since they are supposed to be able to fly. In any case, reading the full text will tell you that Humans are created from all the left-over elements and that rather than the Goddess of Creation, Einhasad, it is Gran Kain, the God of Destruction, who created them. <br />
<br />
Also, reading through the rest of the lore/legend/history, you'll find out how Dark Elves came about and how the world came into such a state.</div></div><hr />

Well, dwarves are not lousy, but they are not very good fighters too. However, dwarves are the only race which can craft weapons and armors. Further more, they are an essential ally for sieging castles.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://lineage2.gameabout.com/upload/news/003(7).jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lineage2.gameabout.com/upload/news/002(8).jpg&quot;&gt;<br />

<br />
Dwarves have mainly two classes. The Bounty Hunter is important to get the materials needed for the items which the Warsmith will craft. Both works hand in hand. In fact, during the Taiwan beta, there is a clan of pure dwarves, 17 of them to be exact, where there are 2 Warsmiths and 15 Bounty Hunters. Needless to say, their clan is the richest clan in the game, and the most powerful guilds on their server all sought to ally with them for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feeldary</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah, with the bonus CD you get a code to create an account for closed beta, from what i heard.<br />
<br />
but the beta is openning in a week :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyluvia</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yes and no and no.<br />
Yes, because once you pre-order, you can get into the current phase of Closed Beta testing.<br />
No, because unless you are buying it directly from a shop outlet near your place (I heard EBGames and such have outlets within towns/cities etc, as I'm not american, I do not know it too well to say much about it), you'll have to wait for them to ship to you the pre-order CDs which will take a few working days to a week plus. :)<br />
Finally, No, because even if you do get it immediately, you can't log into the game because they are patching currently. Prelude is being patched into the server currently, and servers will be brought down from 10am 21st March to 8pm 22nd March. A full 34 hours patch.<br />

If there is an EBGames store near you, it would have been easier as I heard someone say you can just pay $5 for the pre-order CD. Not too sure about the details on that one.<br />
Also the open beta is going to start soon, considering that they are patching in Prelude and that they did say they are planning to start Open Beta late March.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaffis</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the correct way to do this is to do it in person -- where pre-ordering just requires a token payment that ensures they don't get screwed over for reserving a copy for you. Then, you can elect to pick it up and pay the difference or not, depending on your experience in the beta.</div></div><hr />
