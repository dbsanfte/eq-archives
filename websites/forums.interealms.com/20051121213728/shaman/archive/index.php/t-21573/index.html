<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm playing an emp/psyc defender and currently have hover &amp; fly for my pool powers. does anybody have a suggestions as to any pool powers that may be more beneficial to my class than other powers?<br />
<br />
i know it's all relative to playing style. on that note, i have been doing a lot of soloing lately but group occasionally and plan on grouping more in the future. primary healer of course.<br />
<br />
i've heard good things about the Fitness line with Stamina being available at 20.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dullsville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I personally like the Fitness line myself.  Extra regen, especially for endurance, is always a nice thing.  I've taken it with my Scrapper and eventually plan on doing the same with the Blaster I'm toying around with now.  Granted, I honestly can't say I have much experience with the other power pools other than Combat Jumping/Super Jump, Teleport Foe, Stealth, Hover/Fly, and the Fitness line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This gives a 5% bump to defense to all team mates in a 60 foot radius. It stacks with other maneuvers. So a 8 man force with this skill gets a +40% defense bonus. I and 2 other friends have it. As the Tank I can pop a Luck inspiration + 3 maneuvers and tank 3 or 4 orange bosses without putting much pressure on the healer. Minions are meaningless in thhe same situation.<br />
<br />
Fitness would be a good pick too. Stamina is a wonderful addition to any template.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Superspeed and the Fitness line.  If you need to heal and recover faster hasten is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Fitness with the End recovery if you are End starved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bear in mind that you get 20 powers (not including the base 3). Your primary and secondary sets have 9 powers each, for 18 total. That works out to all of your prim/sec powers, a pre-req for a travel power, and a travel power.<br />
<br />
If you want more, then you need to make sacrifices in your primary or secondary sets. Sometimes it's easy (like Blasters ignoring most of the melee attacks in their secondary set), and sometimes it ain't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have Hover and Fly, myself. I plan on getting Stamina just because I have endurance problems when duoing with a Tanker. I have to dish out most of the DPS, atop healing him. YMMV.</div></div><hr />
