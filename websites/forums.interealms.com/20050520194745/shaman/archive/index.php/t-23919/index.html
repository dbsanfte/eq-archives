<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">that is the Question... (hey you had to know that was coming)<br />
<br />
Well I quit playing EQ back in April. I was not very hopeful for OOW and was frankly P.O.ed with Gates but I have over the last few days been reading about the expansion and so far it seems to be a very good expansion and it has me wondering if it is worth it to come back.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts and opinions are welcome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Really depends on why you left in the first place, and what you would be wanting from OoW.  You'd have to be more specific for me to be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What level are you?  If you are level 65 or near there, then I think you will thoroughly enjoy the expansion pack.  If you are somewhat lower, you will still have fun in it I think, but you will be a little limited on what zones you can easily hunt in.  I am in the second category and for now am limited to soloing in Dranik's Scar (the entrance zone to Omens of War) and it's instanced cave expeditions (requires 3 or more people to start one, but doesn't seem to be a level range restriction like LDON).  So far I haven't fought a single thing in Dranik's that I haven't been able to solo, but it is a bit hard to get singles sometimes.  I also haven't fought too close to any of the zone lines because the closer you get to them the tougher the mobs seem to get.  <br />
<br />
In beta I played around with a few level 65 betabuffed characters and was able to solo fine in Bloodfields with a druid, shaman, and beastlord.  <br />
<br />
I haven't been able to do much grouping except with some co-workers, and for now that is rare because of our different shifts and school interfering ;)   In Harbinger's Spire I was able to group with my friends for a bit, and with our group we were able to handle alot of the stuff, and even a named mob or 2 (I was even able to land slow, but slightly mitigated).  All mobs except for a few somewhere I've never seen, seem to mitigate slow, but it doesn't seem to be by too much.  It is still very useful and helpful, and I am able to stand up to things that hit for 200 pretty easily even with slow mitigated.  <br />
<br />
I know I'm a little low to give you much information on the expansion pack, but I just wanted to give you my perspective.  Most of the details about the added features of the expansion pack, you have probably already read so I won't repeat them for you.<br />
<br />
Welcome back, if you decide to come back! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would just stay gone. In less then 2 months WoW is projected to hit the shelves. I would wait for that and go there. I dont see that much has changed in EQ as far as the mentality of the company, they just released a expansion that is actualy at the level they intended it for, not levels that are not in the game.<br />
<br />
OoW from what i here so far is a ok expansion, nothing exciting, but not disapointing either, so over all a playable and enjoyable experience im sure. But like i said, the mentality of SoE is the same and for me i just keep hitting that brick wall which is their mindset on the shaman and i have no choice but to say my goodbyes everytime i try to make it work.<br />
<br />
So again. My advice is wait for WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well on the other hand those still playing didn't feel the need to leave when 'sownow' left so their values systems are unlikely to accord with his?<br />
<br />
And those busily playing EQ won't have much experience of other MMORPGs out there so aren't their opinions of whether EQ is the best choice of MMORPG is necessarily limited?<br />
<br />
My second hand (worthless to some) opinion is there appears to much in OoW that is good.  However, the good stuff seems to me to come from SoE imitating many of the features in WoW, so sownow would probably be better off playing the real thing, ie. WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He seemed to be asking whether he should come back based on the current expansion. If you haven't played the current expansion then your knowledge is very much secodhand at best. As far as playing the &quot;real thing&quot; i.e. WoW, that is not an option, at least in production. I guess you might get into Beta, which means you get to look forward to everything getting wiped when it does go live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, don't come back.<br />
<br />
The game is exactly the same as when you left.<br />
<br />
You still have to grind out levels and AA.<br />
<br />
You still kill the same mobs over and over, constantly casting the same succession of spells over and over.<br />
<br />
If simply a new expansion is enough to bring you back, then I do not understand your reason for leaving in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;the real thing, ie. WoW.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh yes, and everything in WoW is completely original, not borrowed from any other games, and certainly nothing from EQ.  No sir!  ;)<br />
<br />
But on topic, I've found OoW to be pretty fun so far.  Shamans seem more useful than in GoD...  Longer fights vs faster but lighter hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually I accept that (inevitably) WoW has borrowed quite a lot from the original Everquest, but I think its taken very little from the last few years when Everquest devolved into something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a note that you have to have KT or higher and/or PoFire/Poearth access to be able to grind to 70 in 5 days.  Half my guild dinged 66 on their first kill, but we arent an elemental guild.  There has been a group of 6 that have been grinding almost every day in Tactics for about 4 or 5 hours a night.  The highest of them is only 84% into 66.  If you dont have access to lots of mobs that are 68+ then dont expect to get to 70 soon.</div></div><hr />

There, they will be able to ooo and aaahh at how much better WoW is then EQ and mutually reinforce their decisions to quit EQ.

<br />
Explain to me how not playing OoW, which is 1 expansion that is not vastly different or inovative compared to other expansions, makes it second hand knowledge.<br />
<br />
Your making it sound like things have vastly changed in OoW and that all my knowledge from velious, kunark, SoL, PoP and GoD are all invalid now cause i of a expansion that is 2 weeks old. I still know the company mentality, which was what the bulk of my post concerning my disapointment with EQ was about and i read these forums and other forums and talk to people on how things are going with OoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But then again, maybe its cause im on second hand knowledge that i cant see why /shrug<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Litgruv you don't even play EQ any more yes? So wouldn't your experienece be very much secondhand? Just what you have read?<br />
<br />
Correct, with OoW i havent played it which is why i said in my post up there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OoW from what i here so far is a ok expansion, nothing exciting, but not disapointing either, so over all a playable and enjoyable experience im sure. But like i said, the mentality of SoE is the same and for me i just keep hitting that brick wall which is their mindset on the shaman and i have no choice but to say my goodbyes everytime i try to make it work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like your enjoying OoW and bro i couldnt be happier for you, seeing other people enjoy themselves is very cool to me. But im not in EQ, i have my reasons and this gentlemen asked everyones opinion on if he should return.<br />
<br />
I stated my opinion. Thats about it mate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Litgruv, he asked if the addition of the expansion, OoW, which you have no knowledge of by actually playing, makes it worth coming back to EQ. I questioned your opinion on this as you have never played the expansion. Your opinion that it is not vastly different or innovative is indeed second hand knowledge by definition. You even admit that. That's what I am saying. I have not offered an opinion on the subject myself because I don't know enough about the person asking( likes, dislikes) to even make a recommendation. Yet you not only don't know the person, you don't even know the expansion firsthand. So I am calling you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So I am calling you out.<br />
<br />
For what purpose?<br />
<br />
Again, he stated he was frustrated with EQ in the past. I dont have to play OoW to know that EQ and SoE hasnt vastly changed over night do i brother bear?<br />
<br />
I have read the dev chats, i have seen the spells form i have seen what they gave us in corralation to what we have asked for, i have seen peoples reactions to the expansion i have seen quite a lot of this expansion and its creation now that im thinking about. Just cause i have not zoned in to it and battle a creature doesnt menai have absolutly no right to a opinion to this gentlmens question.<br />
<br />
Is there more experienced replies out there? Ofcourse.<br />
<br />
Should my opinion be taken to heart and listened to? Thats up to him.<br />
<br />
Am i going to give my opinion and try to answer his question the besti can?  Yup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">sorry I wasnt more specific I posted that last night when I was very tired.

<br />

<br />
Let me tell you what i think is your first problem, cause it was my problem too.<br />
<br />
I think your looking for another EQ. Like when you break up with a girl in a bad way and you still love her, you look for a replacement. You will miss many good relationship and girls cause you have a mold that your trying to fit them all into and you will not be happy with them cause of this.<br />
<br />
I suggest you try WoW as i recommended, but do not come into it expecting a replacement for EQ. I can tell you that its not EQ. Take it for what it is, play it for what it offers and try to find that wonder and joy in WoW that you had in EQ when you first came. That wonder was cause you didn’t have a preconceived notion of what to expect and therefore was not disappointed when something wasn’t like something you played in the past. You did not judge you just played and has fun right?<br />
<br />
Take this mentality when you play WoW, when that part of you jumps up and says &quot; awl in EQ this is different&quot; forget it, drop it and ignore it, its a moot point. Experience it for what it is and then decide if you like it based off itself, not what you did in EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trying not to be a fanboi the best i can, but im hooked, i cant help it.  <br />
<br />
Oh and if WoW isnt for you and you like EQ, thats cool too, but just keep a true open mind to your upcoming experiences with MMORPG's cause there is a lot of good ones on the horizon ( no pun intended ), well they at least have potential.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as EQ, i stand by my statements above, despite me not knowing OoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel that SoE is a greedy company that cares about nothing more then cash and couldn’t care less about me and you unless it has to do with them losing money, then they love us and are &quot;listening to us&quot;. This company also in my opinion, lacks the imagination and creativity to properly support this game and until they hire some new people to try to correct these issues then the 2 i just mentioned will no be fixed and like i said, i don’t need to buy any expansion to know what a bad business model and poor customer service and lack of imagination is. My opinion is that if you have gotten away from this company and the addictive game they have, then stay away. Wait for a more positive and fresh train to get on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im sorry i didn’t mean to get into a rant. I know a lot off you like EQ still and you are defiantly valid for that, its your choice and its simply a matter of tastes. Its like me liking chocolate and you liking vanilla, its just different, neither is wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
So with that ill shut up and not ruin your thread with SoE bashing, I didn’t mean to do this much and dont wanna spark anything else.  Good luck on your choice Sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My advice?  Wipe your &quot;slate&quot; clean and try it for a week.  If you come in with all kinds of hate and negativity, then you prob won't like anything.  But that's your fault, not anyone elses.

Lately you've been full of nothing but contempt and venom it seems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Laid back? I dunno. I guess I used to hold back more.

Now if he can just extrapolate that to EVERY for profit company we will certainly agree on a lot more. <br />
<br />
I guess I am tired of the EQ bashing. If you want to point out something and say - yeah, the graphic on the new epic should be better, or the effect should be better, I'm with you. But coming back to the boards for a game you don't even play any more, time and time again to do nothing but bash the old and hold up the new on a pedestal gets old for me. I'm not sure if it's a bid for attention or an attempt to justify a decision or what but there is no need for it.<br />

LOL I 100% agree my friend.  There are more posts here about wow then in the designated WoW forum.  I think peeps who are switching are worried that they are the minority and nobody they know is going to go with them.  It will be intersting when it is released and see what happens.  It will be even better in 6 months when 80% of them come back.</div></div><hr />

You know, I really just have to shake my head everytime I read crap like this.  I'm glad OoW is so far working out decently for many people here and I'm very hopefull that a few minor changes that will again, hopefully get taken care of by SoE, address any balance issues that exist.  In short, no bitterness here, I want people to have fun regardless of what I play.  I would expect others to be as mature because better games are a bonus to everyone.  EQ was a great game and it set the bar pretty high.  Now other developers have to make a sensational game just meet par.  I would have thought that was better for everyone.  A strong WoW means a better EQ.  Capitalism at it's best as competition is good for the consumer.  That's you too chump.  I hope EQ learns from GoD and continues with expansions that sem as promising as OoW does so that when I play WoW, Blizzard is forced to churn out quality products.</div></div><hr />

Those I care about gaming with ARE moving to WoW. Several former EQ guildmates, my wife, brother, brother-in-law, best friend &amp; his wife, plus several work associates. All in all probably close to 30 people right off the bat. Then, of course, there'll be the new friends we make in WoW.<br />
<br />
It's great you're still enjoying EQ. Glad for ya. I wasn't, so  moved on. Currently playing CoH (again) with high hopes and expectations for WoW (after playing in stress test). Honestly, your attitude is really representative of the jaded nature and outlooks a lot of EQ veterans have. I know I did for a long time.<br />
<br />
Those who seem to have this deep rooted hatred for &quot;anything that IS NOT EQ&quot;, seek help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just cause we disagree doesn’t make that a bad thing. You have a view and I have a view, on this point we differ is all. Doesn’t make me right and you wrong or vise versa, just means you see things differently then I.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will give him credit though, he realizes that SOE is out to make money (greedy). That's step one. Now if he can just extrapolate that to EVERY for profit company we will certainly agree on a lot more. <br />
<br />
I see that point for all games. Of course they are all in it for the money, we live in a capitalistic society, I would have to be very naïve to not understand that. But there is a thing called Business Ethics. It is the philosophy that governs the way you handle your business it’s a mentality that you use as a base of all your choices in how you make your money and how you handle your consumers. Personaly   I find SoE has poor business ethics. No they are not the evil overlords of the gaming world, I know they are trying their best or I should say, what they feel is the best, but they have chosen a method of doing business that I do not like and agree with. <br />
<br />
I have found thus far that the business model and the ethics that Blizzard applies thus far are attractive and enticing to me. WoW is more then just a good game to me, it’s a warm fuzzy mentality that I can curl up in. A place where venom from the classes and the players is lessened cause of the company listening to the consumer instead of shoving it down their throats. If there is something the community wants and they feel its wrong, there is a reason and its expressed and communicated. This is my major irritant with SoE, the communication. Like I said, its not the money they make, its how they are making it. <br />
<br />
Hope that clears some things up.<br />
<br />
I guess I am tired of the EQ bashing. If you want to point out something and say - yeah, the graphic on the new epic should be better, or the effect should be better, I'm with you. But coming back to the boards for a game you don't even play any more, time and time again to do nothing but bash the old and hold up the new on a pedestal gets old for me. I'm not sure if it's a bid for attention or an attempt to justify a decision or what but there is no need for it. <br />
<br />
All I can honestly say to that is get used to it. You will run into this your whole life and in this stage of the life of EQ you going to see it a lot. I try to hold back out of respect for EQ and the people posting here, but it slips sometimes, I know you don’t wanna hear it and I know it stings cause your still playing, but don’t read my post is all I can say in fairness to myself and to you. Like I said I DO try to hold it back, but I have a new love and I like to talk about it and share it with people so they can experience what I have found, im like that with all aspects of my life. <br />
<br />
I don’t know about anyone else, but to answer your question as to why we come back here to bash EQ, let me just say that I don’t. I come here for Faern, Gloriana, mcroc, Valgoth, Jin and the 50 or so other posters I have come to respect ( sorry I got sick of typing names :(  ) that I enjoy debating and talking with. I come here still cause im bidding my time till WoW ( crosses fingers ) comes out and is popular so we can all talk again about positive and exciting things like we once did.<br />
<br />
Again, I hope that clears things up a lil. Im not the enemy, im just from another place. I do however come in peace and bring you tidings of great joy for those that wish to hear and desire to use the knowledge I put forth.  Or something like that…..   ;)<br />
<br />

p.s. Happy B-Day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">There is nothing wrong with Litgruv posting - albeit negatively. He is entitled to he opinion. It is generally well known that he is retired and is not intending to return, so his posting can be viewed in perspective.<br />
<br />
As to the original question, I would say OoW might be enough justification to come back - for a non hardcore raider who wants to solo, yes, OoW looks like it is going to have more content for you than did GoD, PoP, etc. No, it hasn't made any fundamental changes to the game, but it has given more content to the casual player than has been given for quite some time.</div></div><hr />

I'm still happily retired for the last 4 months now.  Actually, ironically perhaps, my life is better than it has ever been.  I have no money troubles, I am doing new fun stuff all the time, I'm managing two girlfriends at once, and dating still others whenever I have a spare moment.  It keeps life interesting and unfortunately I don't have time for EQ anyway.  I'm typing this as my girlfriend of the evening watches a movie on my surround sound DVD system, blissfully unaware of the deception I'm perpetrating!  I'm way more evil in RL than I ever was in EQ, muahahahahah.</div></div><hr />

Solo content in Oow is kinda lacking from what I've seen but i haven't seen too much of the expansion to say for sure. It's kinda fun at times, annoying at others. I can't offer you any advice either way man. Theres pros and cons to it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Some thoughts:<br />
<br />
1)  Let's face it: nobody ever truly quits EQ.  The fact that Litgruv and Landragoran (who I hate for getting more action than me) still post here, and that myself and probably half the shaman in this forum have quit multiple times is evidence of the fact.  Liking MMoGs is an addiction, like being an alcoholic: you can stop drinking, but that just means you are on the wagon (or is it off? damn Seinfeld), it doesn't mean you aren't an alcoholic anymore.  So saying that someone shouldn't respond to this thread just because their account is cancelled ATM doesn't make any sense.  It will certainly affect their opinion, but it doesn't make their opinion invalid.<br />
<br />
2)  In this particular case Sownow was asking whether or not to come back.  As someone who has quit, followed OoW's development, and tried alternatives to EQ, Litgruv is in many ways more qualified than anyone who is currently playing EQ exclusively to respond.<br />
<br />
3)  Blizzard makes a lot more money than SoE.  I don't have any numbers to back this up, but go look at the shareholder info for both companies if you don't believe me.  That being said, the two companies are almost polar opposites when it comes to dealing with their customers.  In SWG after a credit duping exploit was discovered, SoE banned anyone who had received any duped credits.  This ended up being a lot of people, most of whom had no idea they'd gotten duped credits, and so all the friends of those people got together to protest.  In response, SoE began teleporting people all over the galaxy, including up in to space (which, being the next expansion, doesn't actually exist yet, though this didn't stop SoE from sending people there).  Penny Arcade did a great comic on it a few weeks ago, which I linked to in a post here (and am too lazy to re-link).<br />
<br />
In contrast, when Blizzard discovered that some people were *gasp* pirating Starcraft, it began keeping a record of any cdkey which was logged in twice to Battle.net.  It hadn't done anything to anyone yet except keep this log, but because it did it secretly and someone found out, there was a big stink.  Rather than ban anyone on the list and preventing multiple CD keys from being logged in at the same time, Blizzard apoligzed for not being up front with their customers, and declared that they WOULD NOT CHECK CD-KEYS FOR STARCRAFT ON BATTLE.NET EVER!  Now of course they did learn from their mistake, and it is impossible to log on to Battle.net with the same Warcraft 3 CD key now for instance.  But the point is that Blizzard cares about it's customer rep, and SoE doesn't.<br />
<br />
Yes this is just differing business strategies adopted by two for-profit companies, and it doesn't make one inherently good and the other inherently evil.  But you can guess which company I'd rather have running my MMoG.  In fact, if Blizzard ever bought out SoE and took over EQ, I'd probably orgasm after hearing it.  Twice.  But since that's not going to happen, I guess WoW is the next best thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">People are talking about exciting things. People like OoW. Whether or not it's worth coming back for, I don't know, it depends on what you liked about EQ to begin with. It has new epic quests, the 1.5 version completeable by non raiders. Tons of gear at VT to elemental levels attainable with single groups. It has instanced expedition zones to exp in. I've seen spells up to 69 so far easily attainable by a single group. More levels, more zones, more spells, more AAs including a res type AA and a group heal for Shamans. Only one locked zone. Mobs have more hps so it's not a 20 second fight, I can easily stack 4 DOTs and have them run to the end for full effect. Mobs range from partially slowable to fully slowable. Graphics are great, effects are great. Don't turn on shadows though, they made my system (3.0ghz, 1gb ram, radeon 9800xt pro 256mb ram) into a slide show. So yes, positive and exciting things happen even in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many people have quit EQ, for good. I'm guessing the number is in the 1000's, but only SoE knows for sure. <br />
<br />
Alcholism is a physical addiction. EQ is perhaps a mental addiction. The two are no where close to being equal. As with alcholism, not everyone who plays EQ is addicted.<br />
<br />
2)  In this particular case Sownow was asking whether or not to come back.  As someone who has quit, followed OoW's development, and tried alternatives to EQ, Litgruv is in many ways more qualified than anyone who is currently playing EQ exclusively to respond. <br />
<br />
Agreed to some extent. His (Litgruv's) qualifications come from 5+ years of playing rather than his status. (IMO)<br />
<br />

<br />
Not sure what their shareholder info has to do with anything, but if you look at SoE's parent company, there's no contest. <br />
<br />
As to the credit dupe, you failed to explain a few things. Not everyone who received duped credits was banned (there wouldn't be anyone left). Large transfers (over 1 million credits iirc) were targeted but only if there was a lack of quid pro quo. I sold several million dollars worth of extractors, housing and guild structures 2 days before the ban. Neither the person who paid me nor myself were banned. <br />
<br />
The issue of teleporting people was an isolated issue on one server. GM's basically got tired of asking people to disperse to reduce lag near C-net. They were ignored, GM's got a little pissy and started teleporting. This wasn't some grand scheme by SoE. I'm guessing the GM in question received a bit of flack from his/her superiors for his/her action. But even if he/she did not, the 'protest' in question was affecting other players (those that simply wanted to move through c-net). <br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard routinely bans players. The fact that they didn't in this particular case was simply because 'they got caught with their fingers in the cookie jar'. Iirc, there was a bit more to it than 'keeping a log'. Scanning hard drives (?) comes to mind, but I really didn't pay much attention to it at the time.... <br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard certainly seems to have a better reputation but this is probably due more to the relative size of the companies. Small companies have a much greater control over their employees than large corporations.</div></div><hr />

In this thread i tried my best to breathe life into the WoW forum, givng people a reason to post there and get together, cause im not the only person excited over WoW. You will notice the positive replies and constructive enviroment the thread created.<br />

This thread i spread some info on WoW, bringing positive input and information to a section of the forum that wanted it and again, the thread was nothing but a positive creation of my own doing.<br />

And finaly this thread you will notice that i recommend that the person play EQ over WoW cause it seemed to fit their situation the best and i did it in a positive and way. I didnt bash EQ and &quot;troll&quot; the thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Look Im sorry you dont like my opinions, but the good news is, they arent your opinions and you dont have to listen to them, hear them or live with them. But lowering yourself to insulting me and calling me a troll just cause i have opinions that differ then yours only belittles your efforts to express your side of the issue. Your intelligent and better then that, so dont bother going there.<br />
<br />
<br />
So like i have said many times before. Im not going anywhere. There is a lot people i respect here, including yourself on some levels, and i forsee them being worthy of respect as we move form EQ to WoW. So to sum up.... Get used to me  :D</div></div><hr />

Just to make it clear, i dont claim to know anything at all. im not trying to come off like im some great and wise forum elder and you all should bow to my vast cosmic knowledge of the EQ universe. I simply have my opinions.<br />
<br />
Sow has a question. I felt i could have input useful to him. I posted.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wanted to be clear there. Cause this thread has hovered around me WAY more then i want it too and i dont like the fact that im in so many replies. This thread isnt about me nor do i wish it to be.<br />
<br />
Infact, baring another personal attack, im done in here, this thread has been side tracked. If you wish to continue discussing my actions on the board please e-mail or PM me. Its only fair to Sow.</div></div><hr />
