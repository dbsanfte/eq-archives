<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My question is if you root a mob and then malo/ID it (thereby lowering its magic/disease resists) will it do the check each tic on the debuffed resist level or the original level?<br />
<br />
I ask because it would seem if you can get the mob rooted long enough to debuff it, maybe it wouldn't break root when it normally would and could possibly last the duration. <br />
<br />
I am asking primarily when I am CC and there wouldn't be any DD's cast on the MOB. I usually go straight to slowing it (if not already done) and only debuff if slow is resisted. But I might throw a debuff if I knew it would help the root stick longer (hate root breaking early....drives me nuts). <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, it does a resist check every 6 second, and the lower the resists are the less likely it is to break root.  Without MD, VP still breaks early sometimes.  With MD, it never breaks early (against pofire mobs).  Same thing for using malosinia with normal root.  It definately extends the duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe that it would check on the revised resist level, but not totally sure about that.  The checks aren't that complex so it would seem unlikely they memorize the original resists.  The best option if you are unsure is to root it, malo, then root again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I checked out your data on PoFire tables camp Jinheim.  I did an AAxp level there last night in about an hour and some change.  VP never broke early on any normal soldier mob, tho it did break early on a cleric mob.  Not sure if that mob cured itself or just had higher innate resistance.  BUt otherwise, with VP3 this camp was ridiculously easy to do.  Just gotta keep watch on the VP timer and recast it right away soon as it pops up.  Then just use only non-dd-dots like BoS, Bane, Grummus, and Epic.  If I had Anaethema I'd use that one too, but I don't have that and I'm loathe to spend time getting it over time getting RGC which is biting me in the ass right now for me not having it, in raids anyway.  Gah, i just hate the idea of 16 LDoN missions just for one lousy spell i only use during raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's a LDoN trap that's curse cured, land.  It's a slow of some sort.<br />
<br />
So you'd be getting it for raids and one rare LDoN trap.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Land!  Don't waste yer points on RGC, PLEASE!<br />
<br />
  Words of apparition drop like fluxing candy in LDoN, and if you just go to CT sewer camp for a couple hours you can secure a 73R and possibly even some boots/rings for your twinks or selling pleasure.<br />
<br />
  RGC is NOT worth 800 points IMO, you'll snag it through research in half the time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can someone please clarify something for me? The CT &quot;sewers&quot; camp, is that the place with all the planks?<br />
<br />
I used to fight in CT a lot before the revamp, I know the layout of much of the place, but I've never fought down there before. Can someone tell me the way to get there and better yet, the best place to find 73R down there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, CT sewers is the planks camp.  Was down there for a few hours the other night, no 73R yet, but gonna keep on trying.  Was our first time down there since the revamp, and the 4 of us started wandering around.  We managed to start the ring of fear event, got about half way through first wave and figured we better get the hell out.</div></div><hr />
