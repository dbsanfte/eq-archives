<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend just went off to the army, so I am now in control of his accounts for a long while. Was wondering which 3some you guys would pick for xping/questing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a woodelf, a dark elf, and me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Paladin/Cleric/Shaman is not one of your choices (hard to tell which accounts have which classes from your poll) but would be the easiest to three-bot.<br />
<br />
Ranger/Necro/Shaman would be hardest but would do the most DPS.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd go Necro/Shaman and just log the cleric for rezzes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Me, a chick DE SK and a chick barb, no matter what class. <br />
<br />
Ideal threesome. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would go with the female high elf paladin, and the female dark elf necro.  The first is sexy in a &quot;I'll kick your ass and look good doing it way&quot; and the second is sexy for obvious reasons.  I like to have the two extremes in my threesomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make 3 beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jhael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only problem with a paladin and a necro, is that you want them to get along too ;) ;)<br />
<br />
I will stick with the tryed and true, 2 woodelves, 1 hot tub, and me!<br />
<br />
Jhael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That is a tuff one... I'd have to say Jack Daniels, Jhonny Walker, and Hose Quervo... but that's my dwarf pally talking...<br />
<br />
If you really want to be able to go after big game, I would go withe a cleric, warrior, shaman trio. The reason being, the warrior has a ton of hps and is very easy to box, the cleric for complete heal, rez, and adding a ton of hps to the party, he will make life much easier, and is also easy to box, finally, the shaman slows, debuffs, buffs, and adds some damage, as well as keeping the cleric alive. While this trio does not have a huge ammount of dps, the staying power is out of this world, and you can add a couple of DPS people to your group with ease.<br />
<br />
I personally don't like playing 3 chars at once, especially my shaman, bard, and enchanter =) the preceding trio will be much less painful to play hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shammy / Monk / SK<br />
<br />
All got a method to escape, probably mosty based on what I would add to my duo thou :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shamy/SK (or pally to hold aggro)/mage <br />
<br />
Been in this kind of group - worked well</div></div><hr />
