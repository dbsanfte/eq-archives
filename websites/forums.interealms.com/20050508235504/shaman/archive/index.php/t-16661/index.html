<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xeoc Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.<br />
<br />
I am level 28, and I am wondering if 34 is the milestone it appears to be.<br />
<br />
I feel like I can't solo right now, because my slow is not that exciting, my dots are weak and I have no pet --- all things that should be mitigated by hitting 34 with the pet and scourge + curse.<br />
<br />
Is the difference in power, particularly soloing, as great at it appears on paper?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I am doing ok in LDoN groups, and 29 here will help with GH, but I feel pretty underpowered right now, and I think 34 will be a big jump.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any insight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The levels from 24-34 are the great Dead Zone for shaman.  Offense is very weak and our healing power is a joke until 29 and Greater Heal.  The good news is that from 34 onwards things just start getting better and better every spell level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I blazed through that 29-34 hump in SolA soloing the ent pulling toward the solB zone. <br />
<br />
Stick it out, as there are tougher spots up ahead (level 51 was a shock, 54 and my gold spots are slowing down, early 40s were a pain). Especially stick it out until you get level 44 with c2 and stoicism, thats when things start getting fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, you do take a big jump in soloing power at 34....but only if you have prepared for it!<br />
<br />
The major factor (and it is, in my opinion, one of the class defining factors) is the puppy, fifi, dogdog - call it what you will - the pet. The pet will, when used correctly, provide your most consistent and reliable source of damage output...BUT (and there is always a but)...<br />
<br />
...although the pet does dish out excellent damage (especially with alpha), it cannot take damage for peanuts....so... you need to be able to tank mobs in teh face, and let dogdog do its damage without getting hit to much.<br />
<br />
In order to achieve this, you, obviously, are going to have to be able to survive the pounding being handed out by the mob that you are tanking, so your armor class and hp will suddenly become very important. Plan your gear upgrades with emphasis on AC and hp, even if it is at the expense of wis/mana. Also, bear in mind that defence skill ups = free AC increases, so make sure that your defence skill is maximised for your level. So make sure that your defence skill is maximised for your level. So make sure that your defence skill is maximised for your level. So make sure that your defence skill is maximised for your level (are you getting the subtle hint here?).<br />
<br />
Having said all that, for the mid-level shaman, tanking for dogdog is certainly not the only way to go. But take it from me, it is the most fun way to go...Muahahahahahahaha!</div></div><hr />

Make sure that your defence skill is maximised for your level.</div></div><hr />
