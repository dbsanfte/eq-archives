*** I have burned bread to go with my wine below ***<br />
<br />
Complaint #1:  Tribute Masters VS Alchemy<br />
Benefit +2 mana regen vs Greater Elixir of Concentration<br />
Benefit +100 mana pool vs Greater Mystical Infusion<br />
Mana Preservation 4 vs * Awareness IV<br />
Benefit +10 saves (5 of them) vs Divine Endurance<br />
Benefit Regen X vs Rejuvenation (this has huge detrimental effects)<br />
<br />
The cost for the benefit is 10-20% of the cost of the potion.  And we all know that Tribute Masters pay more then 1 tribute point for 1 pp (item turnins) which makes the relative costs even lower.<br />
<br />
Example: Benefit +2 mana regen costs 12 tribute points for 10 minutes.  Greater Elixir of Concentration costs 78pp (assuming no failures) and lasts 20 minutes.  So for 24 tribute you get the same effect vs 78pp (assuming no failures).  You can apply this same logic to the above effects.<br />
<br />
Solution: All potions but GATE potions should have their costs reduced by 2/3rds.  If you want a money sink (alchemy is a money sink because almost all items come off vendors, thus the money exits the economy) lower the price point of these potions.<br />
<br />
Complaint #2:  Foraged item requirements for LDoN potions.<br />
Repeat as this thread just shows up every week or so.<br />
<br />
Solution:  Change the Foraged items from LDoN potions to store bought.  You can keep the potions expensive for the group versions, but the invis potion should be in line with the 10pp invis potion players can currently purchase (nobody cares that it doesn't fade).<br />
<br />
Complaint #3: Stacking of certain potions.<br />
The Aura of Heat effect and Aura of Purity effect have stacking issues with player spells.<br />
<br />
Solution: Fix the spells effects.<br />
<br />
Complaint #4: Where's the Alchemy UI?<br />
Some want it such as post #2, pretty bad that it doesnt exist.<br />
<br />
It may be complaining but at least its not about healing.<br />
<br />
