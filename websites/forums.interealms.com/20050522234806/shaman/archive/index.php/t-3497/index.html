<br />
Well it's beena  while since my last posting, but i was still checking the crucible of course..hehe<br />
Hope some remember me :p (Praise RZ shamans)<br />
<br />
Anyway to my question:<br />
<br />
In the back Slot as a 58 Shaman ( Ogre )<br />
should i wear Hierophants Cloak or lodizal shield in back slot?<br />
<br />
If i put the Lody in I have a fungushide stretched shield in shield slot..i play on RZ if this helps.<br />
<br />
Any Ideas, suggestions, flames?p<br />
<br />
Hierocloak: 10 AC 4STR 4 DEX 4 AGI 4 STA 4 INT 4 CHA HP 75 MANA 75<br />
<br />
Lody: 23 AC 10 STR 5 CHA 10 WIS -5 AGI 20 Fr 20 Cr 10 Mr <br />
Effect: Enduring Breath<br />
<br />
Fungus Shield: 32 AC 10 WIS 15 DR<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hp &gt; all, if you feel comfy with your resists in a pvp setting then by all means go with heiro. Else stick with the boost that you get from your Lodi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have both of them already, switch them in and out depending on situation.  Lodi for resists and ac, heiro for hp and mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">like wildaar said.  hp &gt; all (well mostly).<br />
<br />
If you are comfortable with your resists, and AC then switching from lodi to heiro is a good choice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hiero cloak has been making a strong comeback in recent weeks, judging by the more and more auctions to buy them.   I wonder if parachute pants will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't play on a pvp server, but I do know that 20 fr/cr and 10mr is AWESOME for anyone.  On a pvp server, I assume it is even more so.<br />
<br />
If resists are as important as they are made out to be on RZ, go for the lodi shield.  If not, I would probably go for the heiro cloak b/c it has soooo many HP and mana.  The ideal answer, though, is to get both and switch them in and out as you need the resists.<br />
<br />
edit:  btw, what does everyone think of that fungus shield?  32ac, 10wis, 15sta, 15DR.  A guildie got it for me yesterday, and I like it b/c it has good ac, wis, and sta.  I would rather it be an OOIV, but you can't have everything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Do you still have your SBS?<br />
<br />
For me, I think you have low resists... and if you were using the SBS together with the Lodi that would give you a much needed +20 svmag improvement of and of course the nice svfire/cold. You'd lose some AC/hp depending on which item you compare with but I think svmag is more important if you're into PvP.<br />
<br />
If you have the means already, of course just keep and switch between for when you feel comfortable without the resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And using both the Fungus Shield and Hiero gives even more HP.<br />

HP &gt; All.   I recently bagged my Lodi for a Hiero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well he is on a pvp server so there is some consideration for resists I would think.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aye, since I'm on a blue server I would choose hiero cloak over lodi shield any day of the week. Since you're on a PvP server though, I would go with the lodi shield.</div></div><hr />
