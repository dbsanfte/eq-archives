I'm floored. Blizzard is light years ahead when it comes to earning my trust.<br />
<br />
Class has concerns, they post on the boards. Rep sees this. Decides to  create a character of that class and level it to see what people are talking about. <br />
<br />
Rep asks for feedback, talks to devs and actually comes back with news that the devs looked at the class and what they've decided to do to adress the concerns in a reasonable time span. The points which are not subject to change are explained up front.<br />
<br />
No &quot;currently being evaluated&quot; anywhere in there. I think I'm going to like it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Except for certain network issues im very very pleased with Blizzard and their european department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is the feedback I really like hearing.<br />
1.  The guy is actually reading the thread.<br />
2.  You can tell they are actually taking the feedback and contemplating it.<br />
3.  The guy is actually replying to specific comments in the thread.<br />
4.  The guy is replying to the threads in a thoughtful, logical manner, explaining *WHY* things are being done as they are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice. I saw one of them did something like that in one of the warrior boards too. Was a very long post by a player and was pretty well thought out. The wow person came in and addressed each part of it in detail. Even explained why they are hesitant to change certains things because of a particular impact that it could cause. <br />
<br />
I dont want to beat Eq here since I loved playing it so long. But its nice from alot of stuff I'm reading blizzard has been treating us like equal players who have a brain where alot of the times with eq it was players are to be seen and not heard nor talked too.</div></div><hr />
