<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sick of HHK &amp; looking for an XP solo spot, I read a great post here on the Crucible giving great detail on XP spots thruout the game.<br />
<br />
I decided to head to FV &amp; try the valley in the NE corner of the zone that funnels into the ZI to the swamp of no hope.<br />
<br />
Very safe place to pull to with a great number of mobs to pull from. I avoided the shammy frogloks at first (shammy's are bad ass' if ya didn't know :P) but they drop as easily as any of the other frogs &amp; drolvargs... just try not to pull 2 in a row as I usually come away malaised.<br />
<br />
Anyway in the time it takes for 3 KEI's to burn off I have gone from 34-36 easily. Some of the easiest soloing I have ever done.<br />
<br />
Anyways thanx for the post that I got this little xp spot info from &amp; I totally recommend anyone 32+ if you don't mind solo without dogdog to prolly about 37... although some of the frogs are starting to turn lo-blu at 36. Maybe time to head to DL.<br />
<br />
BTW I haven't seen a single sole from FV ZI to the camp spot (good 5 min run) so it looks like a way under camped spot/zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can back up this camp.  Gave it a shot last night.  Killed a few frog warriors and some gobos, and then bumped into a casting gobo which hurt but was still doable.  Im only 30, with ok gear..and I was able to solo them one on one at the zone line.<br />
<br />
Being used to playing a cleric I play my shaman oddly.  I tend to pull with slow, dot, debuff (sometimes) and then root.  Then I beat on it hand to hand until im at half life, back up and heal myself.  Then repeat the process as the dot has usually run off by that time.  Im not sure ive ever seen a shaman back up and heal themselves (granted i dont usually watch shammys solo) so there might be a better way of doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This might be a good spot. I'll never know. I took the FV stone, invis'd, ran around the wall, and took every possible precaution. Still, those halfling looking guys and the faeries see invis and aggro, and they are casters. It turned out with 3 deaths and required a raid-sized sieze of the zone (ty to my guild) to get my stuff back. This zone is extremely deadly. Many of my guildies got agro even though they were mid 40s and up. And not many chars can live with 6 casters casting 200dd spells on them.<br />
<br />
FV is definately one of the most dangerous zones for a char under lvl 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Northbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Uhm what server are you playing on Eilderts?  I have never seen FV be a crazy &quot;die and lose your gear zone.&quot;  It is very safe, nobody there to train you.  You must have had a very bad night.  Sorry bro, but it is a great zone, depending on what you hunt...all the way to like 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe the problem was that I was an iksar, but even if thats true then it's still a very dangerous zone for my kind. Invis doesnt help, casters aggro out of nowhere, faeries get stuck in walls so u cant see em and then nuke u. It was hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I came out of the tunnel into the FV zone I went left (north) &amp; then east to the camp spot... the original post suggested going right out of the tunnel (south) &amp; following the sea wall around to the camp. It just seemed like a longer route than necessary &amp; I had only one incidence when a buddy of mine's invis broke when I was taking him to the camp but we pulled the mob high on the wall away from any other agro &amp; dropped it quickly I re-invis'd &amp; made it to the camp piece of cake.<br />
<br />
I prolly did this run about 10-15 times nps &amp; definately no guards or fairies when you head north out of the tunnel. <br />
<br />
Sry you had such a bad experience, wow I can't imagine what a raid size party would be required for a corpse run, the faireis are on good faction so maybe you would need some good race to go in &amp; drag but I can't imagine why you would need more than one extra person. <br />
<br />
Out of curiosity I'm gonna head to that camp following the seawall to see what the big hubub is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Many of the guys had faction problems, and many were just evil races. It took the combine efforts of about 7 people to get it. Bard finally managed without pulling mobs.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone else think this sounds like Lesser Faydark, and not Fiorina Vie? I don't recall ever seeing faeries in FV, and &quot;those halfling looking guys&quot; sound an awful like the dreaded LFAY brownies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well there are a couple quest halflings that roam along the wall there (wurmslayer questies), and the drixies or whatever they are called are like the butterfly/dragon thingies in LFay. Sounds similar, but it's hard to imagine how someone could confuse the two zones. Evil characters probably have a MUCH harder time here - I've hunted the area mentioned in this thread and loved it, but both my bard and druid are non-KOS except to the spiders and drolvargs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ermanarich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The faerie looking things that he is talking about are probably the drixies. (If memory serves me right that is what they are called) This is a nice hunting zone and at least not on my server overly camped.  I have played a few of my chars there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have a Question to do this spot, should i be a Good race ,  cause i am  a  lvl 31 ogre shaman and usually, use my ranger for heals and buffs for him.<br />
<br />
Though i also have a lvl 31 Troll sk which might be a great duo team now i think about it.I tried Sol A and never been there before so fought at the zone in, was not pretty my ranger handled all the adds till my shaman could zone hehe. <br />
<br />
I am Still at DSP GOD i HATE that zone :( , been fighting zeniaks ,large zeniaks and wolves BUT all hit sorta hard&lt;&lt; shrugs can not wait till i get my pup!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kyull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tried this spot this spot at lvl31, used invis, got there without problem, after a few kills was blinded without warning, at the edge of the pull area, died and found my corpse on the other side of the FG fort.  ??  Nowhere near where i got blind-sided.  Must have been a froggy shammie.  Problem is ya can hardly see em.  It's definetly a tense place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Quadded here as a druid, good spot. You can also go down a bit and pull the 3 giants. If I remember correctly, you have wandering dog people, some kinda leaches, and froglok warriors and shammies to pull from.. shammies being the toughest (for a druid)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">solo'd in this area with one shaman, and solo'd in timorous deep on golras with another shaman.  tim deep golras are not only easier to pull (single pulls - unless you blatantly go out of your way to get to try and get two), they're better exp per kill, and you never have to worry about running out of them.  probably takes another minute more to get there, but if you're an evil race, you don't have to worry about dieing on the way.  the mobs are all melee, so no spell casters either.  did levels 31-37 on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would imagine FV would not be a good place for soloing evil shaman. (Haven't seen been to FV since DoN push, so no idea how it looks now though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Greflin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Getting to the spot described is actualy VERY easy and safe, go along the zone wall left after you leave the cave to DL/PoK. You won't run into the see invis faries. a lot safer.</div></div><hr />
