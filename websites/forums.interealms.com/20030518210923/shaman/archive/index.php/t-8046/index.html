<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged 56 the other night,I am currently at 217 wis, 1499 hp, 2877 mana but only 833 AC so figured it was time to get some ideas. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it were me, and its not, I'd stear away from the wis shaman route and go with the following:<br />
Neck: imbued Ivory ??? the one from chardok ... whatever,its easy to get and cheap.<br />
range: drop the spear, get a goranga idol (ac7, stam5, dex, and 25 HP)<br />
finger: velium fire ??? ... jewelcrafted 6AC/65hp ones<br />
Bracers: drop both, get JBB, or a bracer of sense (if you can't seem to dodge the wis habbit), but the articifer's bracers are nice (smithing crafted), OR go to HoT/Kael/WToV and get velious bracers.<br />
arms, feet and hands: velious armour<br />
back: its a nice piece and could likely bankroll some decent upgrades for you, but it doesn't have HP on it which you'll need, a Heiro cloak would be better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, unless the magelo is wrong, his back piece is NO DROP.<br />
How can he bankroll that into gear upgrades???<br />
<br />
Gear recommendations...You didn't give a budget, so I'll just give some off the top of my head based on what I have and is reasonably attainable/purchasable.<br />
<br />
1. Barbed Dragonscale Boots<br />
2. Coldain Skin Gloves.<br />
3. 65hp6ac ring to replace the jasper drood ring.  (Keep it for tradeskills if you want.)<br />
4.  Chitinous Belt to replace Fear froggy belt.<br />
5.  Crystal Chitin arms to replace your RE arms.  (Turn them in and hope for a nice gem, or save for CR gear.<br />
6.  Quest the Coldain Military Wristguard for one bracer slot.<br />
7.  Buy one of these:  Artificer's Ringmail Bracer, Bracelet of Sense, Bracelet of Fortitude.<br />
8.  Gantru Charm or Goranga Idol for Range slot.  As an alternative, you may want to review the new PoP quests for the Intermediate Magic Manual, and see if that's within your capabilities.<br />
9.  Tattered Mantle, Obulus Death Shroud, or Imbued Granite Spaulders for shoulder slot.  First you could duo easily, third as well (if you get lucky), and second is usually available in bazaar, but that's budget dependent.  Or group grind for it.<br />
10.  Gladiator Chain Leggings from Kael Arena area.  Not too uncommon a drop.  Not a major upgrade, but they are okay.  If you are looking to buy legs, look at some Peerless or Heavy Dragon legs or the new Velium Field Plate legs made with tradeskills.<br />
 <br />
That's all with HP/AC in mind, but not completely dumping wisdom.<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the suggestions, as a follow up question is there something better than just a 6ac 65hp ring..something more along the lines of the bandit ring I already have?<br />
<br />
For the shoulder I'm heading into PoI tonight and hoping to get lucky with the Cog Encrusted Epaulets.<br />
