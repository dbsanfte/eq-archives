<br />
Ranger/Enchanter may be good (haste , slows , crowd control) but i was unsure how well that would work out with the ranger being the prime healer (augmented by breeze/clarity).<br />
<br />
Ranger/Shaman has healing , haste and slows. But the lack of Crowd control may be a probelm (root parking being the limit)<br />
<br />
And of course there is Ranger/Cleric. Rezes, CHs ..but a lack of utility (haste/slows)<br />
<br />
Was going to start from scratch on the duo and wanted to pick the brains of the RangersGlade to hear your opinions , experiences and comments about good Ranger class partners .<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time :)</div></div><hr />

Two boxing all the time gets very boring tho, and the ranger/cleric combo is a better backbone for a full group as well as being able duo reasonably well (pick up a Swarmcaller for slows if you go with this option).<br />
<br />
I've never been in a chanter/ranger duo, but I think the lack of heals might be a problem as we don't get a good regen until 55 and don't get greater heal until 57. Fear kiting would be an option, but that limits you in where you can hunt. Maybe someone who has been in a regular duo with a chanter will set me straight.<br />

I think Fredescu got it right though.  Cleric and Ranger seem better for a full group which always seems to come along when I put in more then an hour or 2 of exp grinding.<br />
<br />
Personally I think Cleric and shaman usefulness is equal for playing 2 at the same time.  But when things get ugly with an overpull or someone's train, there's nothing like having the cleric right there to rez and get that lost exp back quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, personally, I prefer Druid for a partner. The main reason is for the ports. I really, really, like the mobility, not to mention the evac capability. You don't get haste, but I have good item haste. You don't get slows, but I have a swarmcaller. You dont get uber heals, but you do get good dots and DD. All in all, the ability to just get the hell out fast when things go bad is priceless.<br />
<br />
cleric right there to rez and get that lost exp back quickly. <br />
<br />
Well, unless the cleric bit the dust too, which is likely in a bad two boxing scenario. Then you have to travel and/or fight your way back in. With a druid you can just leave, and port back in after recovering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tetrass</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I two box with my cleric all the time.  I know everyone says a shaman is as good or better but I like the cleric.  It is relatively easy to set up a healbot with a nice set of hotkeys and I actually prefer working off of cleric and ranger buffs.  <br />
<br />
When I duo with my cleric, I like to pay as little attention to the second box as possible.  I do sometimes form groups of varying sizes when I want to up the intensity, but for times when I just want to grind xp it is less stressful.  I have a total of 3 buffs that I look for from the cleric, and my own buffs that stack.  <br />
<br />
I realize that with Shammy buffs I'd be hasted and killing faster, but I think the ability to form a full group around the cleric makes them more useful as a second box character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celt</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use the Cleric.<br />
<br />
Never having to worry about resses ever again is priceless.<br />
<br />
Judgement is 925 dd and it's reasonable<br />
<br />
Clerics get 6 mana/tic regen with Blessed Armor of the Risen<br />
<br />
Clerics debuff with MOR and MOK...healing and an additional 15 pt damage shield on hits of a mob is great...55 point dshield between celt and my cleric MOR :)<br />
<br />
Divine auras ....easy peasy crowd control with roots, if it gets ugly healing your ranger, DA is the easy second box cop out..and clerics get two.<br />
<br />
Complete heal..need I say anything else.  Healing 4300 hp per CH is very very efficcient, and thats healing at 2 bars of hp.<br />
<br />
Aegolism, long lasting buff..only irritaters are eagle eye, natures precision, and cloak of thorns :P<br />
<br />
Resses...<br />
<br />
Go wit h the cleric.  The DD  and MOR will speed up kills akin to alacrity, or faster depending on where you are hunting.  Clerics aren't just sit and heal anymore...they are also great for green sweeping with thier pbaes for  places like factioning in droga or what not for your cords...and again..its a cleric...useful on a raid AND in xp grinds....and you will always get a res :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maluvwen</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been 2 boxing with a cleric, and found the Fear line of spells very helpful.  Saves mana that you would otherwise need on heals, and even lets you DD if needed.  Keep up the fear and you do not need a slow (though haste is still nice).  Most fights I can get though with the cleric only casting 3 or 4 times, pretty easy and lets me concentrate on the ranger.<br />
<br />
However, if you are up to it, I think a shaman would be the best partner.  Those guys can do everything.  The big caveat though, is how busy do you want to be on the 2d box.  Me, I like to keep it simple.  Juggling from one keyboard to the next is how you get killed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chanter.<br />
<br />
Chanter provides Haste, Clarity, and some AC buffs.  Slows incoming mobs, and handles adds.  If the ranger is getting hurt too much, throw Bezerk on them.<br />
<br />
Ranger tanks, melees, snares, and heals between fights.  With clarity on, you can heal quite a bit between fights.<br />
<br />
If you are into that kind of thing, you can always fear kite.  Chanters get fear, and ranger snares.  <br />
<br />
Add a chanter pet for a little extra damage.<br />
<br />
Very good combo of skills.</div></div><hr />

If I personally was choosing I'd go Shaman, since they can do the best upping to your damage output and make the mobs die faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajalon</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 2 boxing with a 60 cleric in chardok to get through 59, and though shaman slows would be nice, with blessed armor of the risen I have plenty of mana to cheal 1-2 times a fight if needed.  MoK and MoR are very nice for speeding things up, aegolism can't be beaten, and if the **** really hits the fan, I have a 96% res sitting at my back.  Oh and if I really need to finish a fight fast the cleric can nuke for 925.<br />
<br />
With a shaman, sure I'd slow and whatnot, but I'd also have to constantly canni-dance, and playing 2 characters can be difficult enough at times without having to babysit the 2nd box.  If the shaman had torpor it might even things out somewhat, but that's not really a good combat heal.<br />
<br />
In short, cheal makes up for slow, and the cleric can add utility with MoK, MoR, and keep himself up on mana with risen, not to mention res.<br />

Cleric all the way.</div></div><hr />

I play a 60th Ranger and a 55 Shaman<br />
<br />
I two box with my 2nd acct shammy and it is incredible. We have duoed and held camps in a lot of Velious, Kunark, and Luclin dungeons I would never have believed possible if I hadn't done it myself.  Regrowth, Haste, Slow, Stat buffs, and nice heals. Shammy is constantly canni dancing, but hey.. that becomes a rythm after a while. Our spell line and shaman's spells compliment each other quite nicely. FoN stacks with regrowth and Skin like Nature (plus fungi) to give Shaman incredible hp/mana regen.  <br />
<br />
This is a truely great combo, I can't say enough good things about a shaman-ranger duo team!</div></div><hr />

Their pet isn't uber by any means but it's the most mana efficient dot you will find.  Fast acting poison dots, 2nd rate nukes, and mana-free damage from epic.jbb all add up to some significant damage potential.  Add that on top of the normal 'shaman duties' and I know who I'd prefer to have on my 2nd system.</div></div><hr />

Really think your best best is either a chanter or cleric. Thing about the shaman is i was always waiting on mana and his heals really arent  all that great till  his final one at 60. <br />
<br />
When i did just the chanter and ranger my goal was to make it till end of fight and then heal up. If things get hairy u can alway just mezz it and then heal up and continue the fight. Also the runes spell on chanter is nice and can save your ass.<br />
<br />
The best combo is 3 box it with ranger chanter and cleric. That is what i been doing now and its working great. I been 3 boxing it in ssra pretty well though elites take some prep work and i need at least 4 mana on the cleric. <br />
<br />
In the end i say shaman ok but not that great . Chanter rules and is easy to 2 box with i feel, plus u always  can get a group :)<br />
<br />
Cleric was nice but i felt at times i could do more with chanter, Good luck with what ever u choose !!</div></div><hr />

Still play both at raids some times. But ranger is my main now. Occassionally play wizards or clerics on raids to help out too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harijan</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 b0xed with a shaman from lvl 15-34 on both.  I can say that I still take down reds and yellow with my 2 toons without breaking much of a sweat.  However, I have broken down this argument several times.  If you have a second account and PC, count your blessings and know that any choice is good (I ran into a guy a few weeks ago that 2 boxes rangers on both accounts, he does fine)   <br />
<br />
Cleric comparison<br />
WHoever said shaman heals are not that great has never played a shaman.  at 29 shaman get greater heal (270hp) and a couple other upgrades down the road.  Cleric is better on heals, but throw in a shaman regen that gives 470hp in 4 minutes (also improves down the road) and hp is rarely a problem.  when 2 boxing with a shaman ven if the heals are not as good as cleric<br />
<br />
Shaman DOT are much better than clerics and DD's are comperable.  So your real advantage to a cleric is that they have slightly improved heals until mid 30's when they really pull away, and they have rez.  funny thing is that when I 2box with my shaman, I never need a rez. <br />
<br />
Buffs, no one will argue that any class has better buffs than a shaman.  and that is very important.  I broke 1khp fully buffed at lvl 29 and never looked back. Another important factor here is that shaman buffs stack very well with ranger buffs.  In fact, I have no stacking issues at all until mid 40's.  Not true for cleric and chanter. <br />
<br />
Chanter comparison<br />
Chanters are great, they change the way you play eq and they can be alot of fun, they are a great partner for a ranger, but your down time spent healing sux. You get haste and slows faster with a chanter than a shaman, but they are the same spells so you will eventually see them with either class. On a side note you get stacking issues with alacrity and ranger buffs real fast.  <br />
<br />
You do get mez which is a huge help, best equivalent with the shaman is double root capability for crowd control.  Mana regen, again chanter wins out big time, but shaman gets limited mana regen later on too.   So in summary using a chanter you will trade downtime, instead of waiting for mana recovery you will be waiting for HP recovery, personally I would prefer my downtime to be waiting for mana, safer.  Mez and DD spells are the big advantages of the chanter, mana recovery is nice, but you are trading it for the heals, and that is not a good trade in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Other issues:  Shaman classes can take much more damage that a chanter and probably more than a cleric.  This doesnt seem important, but when 2boxing you will run into situations where the caster will get beaten on for a few minutes either before you notice or before you can do anything about it.<br />
<br />
Shaman melee output is greater than other options.  <br />
<br />
Shaman pet offers a great DOT and damage aborbtion when needed, other classes cant offer the pet buffer.<br />
<br />
Using mez when 2 boxing is difficult because your biggest enemy is aggro on the caster toon.  fleeing with one toon while trying to engage with the other is the hardest thing to do when 2 boxing.  <br />
<br />
You will be happy with any choice and you may even want to try some of the less common combos, I imagine that a rogue ranger combo would be a terrible thing to encounter, I also think a necro/ranger combo would potent, but difficult. and if I couldn't do a shaman I would try a pally I get rez, I get heal, and I get decent damage output.  So do what appeals to you.</div></div><hr />

At 60 you can solo pull just about anything there. Against a slow mob you will take very little damage, throw on a fungi and you're golden.</div></div><hr />

<br />
however, if given a choice of chars to team up with, i might choose a shaman. their buffs stack with ranger/druid and with the slows and offensive abilities of the shaman, there would be very little down time. <br />

Yeah, best thing is to avoid it all together.  But it's bound to happen sometime, especially trying out new places to do it.  The cleric is usually the one to make it out.  Divine Aura, Divine Barrier gives him over 30 seconds of invulnerability.  Plenty of time to get away from trouble or sit and mem gate.  Ranger can draw agro away and hold it long enough to get gate off.  Recovering either corpse has never been a problem for me.  I think it all matters where I hunt.  I did the hole in the early 50s.  Bind right there, zone in, corpses should be right there.  If I'm adventurous and I have a safe pull spot, I just bind the cleric right there.  When and if he drops I /q before it hits LOADING... and log him in about 2 minutes later to res back.  (I forget to rebind for raids sometimes.  UP is not a nice place for a naked cleric)<br />
<br />
Another important factor here is that shaman buffs stack very well with ranger buffs. In fact, I have no stacking issues at all until mid 40's. Not true for cleric<br />
What buffs don't stack other then the Skin Like line of spells?  Cleric buffs are much much better in that respect anyway.  The less my Ranger needs to buff, the more pulling (killing) I can do.<br />
<br />
There's no doubt that a shaman or even a chanter is an incredible partner.  But I recommend avoiding the complexities of either of them so you can focus on one box 95% of the time.  After the buffs are done and it gets down to pulling, the cleric is the lowest maintenence because they don't have to do anything other then a heal once in a while and buff here and there.  Shaman or Chanter you're relying on them to do something at each fight.  That's when things get complicated and tedious.  Getting mob to camp, taunting, kicking, disarming, casting maybe, and then trying to cast on the other box at the same time.  it's no fun.  Sure you might be able to do it, but after a few hours you get tired of doing it.<br />
<br />
Besides, Earthcaller proc is enough of a slow for me :D<br />
<br />
One last thing, fear kiting works well too and opens the door for more fear kiting beyond just animals.  I did Skyfire for a level until some of the mobs went light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harijan</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What buffs don't stack other then the Skin Like line of spells? Cleric buffs are much much better in that respect anyway <br />
<br />
Skin line is a third of a ranger's defensive buffs before 50,  that is significant.  compared to the protect line of the shaman that stacks with skin and offers a light DS.  anyone who would take the single ceric buff over a skin buff+protect buff ain't thinking straight.<br />
<br />
I rather enjoy the 2box while casting and and melee. In fact I do just the opposite, when the ranger goes into melee I have kick and taunt macroed into the combat, and he is automatic from there.  Then depending how the fight goes I concentrate on the shaman healing, slowing and damaging the mob.  Of course there are exceptions to this, but that is the most common scenario. <br />
<br />
I find it challenging not frustrating, and frankly get bored playing one toon now. <br />
<br />
a big part of the question is what level you need to get the second account to before you can duo effectively.  if you are PLing your second account to 50 before you can duo then there is a stronger argument for a chanter or cleric due to their usefulness in the endgame.   But pre 50 (cause thats all I know) I have to say shaman takes the cake.  <br />
<br />
That would be an interesting arena duel 4 accounts, 2 players, wonder who would take it.?<br />
<br />
Again, its a matter of preference.</div></div><hr />

I leveled with a Cleric (RL friend) since day one, and its the best combo by far.  I have 2-boxed the combo, when he couldn't play and was needing some xp. Was easy-squeezy. At lower levels, gotta be careful of the lack of slowing, but once you get a haste item &amp; Swarmcaller or Epic, its amazingly easy.<br />
