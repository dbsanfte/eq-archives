<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Healing has to be sufficient to keep the tank alive for the time it takes dps to kill the mob. Thus heals have to be balanced against the hardest mob a group or raid intends to hit, not the average or weakest. <br />
<br />
Survival: (healing per second * seconds) + tank hit points &gt; mob damage per second * seconds<br />
<br />
65 shaman with all non-god spells and healing aas:<br />
<br />
Burst Heal Cast Time 3.75 secs, refresh 2.25, best haste = 30% thus 2.625 cast time, 2.25 recast, one burst heal every 4.875 secs, or 5 secs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tnargs          260 hps<br />
Tnargs (aas)  335.4 hps<br />
Daludas         310 hps<br />
Daludas (aas) 466.6 hps<br />
Yoppa            357 hps<br />
Yoppa (aas)     537.2 hps<br />
<br />
HoT with AAs presumed to last entire fight and be cast before beginning of fight.<br />
<br />
Q                  70 hps<br />
Trushar         105 hps<br />
Serenity        136.7 hps<br />
<br />
<br />
Q+Tnargs = 330 hps<br />
Q + Tnargs + aas = 405.4 hps<br />
Trushar + Daludas = 415 hps<br />
Trushar + Daludas + aas = 571.6 dps<br />
Serenity + Yoppa = 493.7 hps<br />
Serenity + Yoppa + aas = 673.9 hps<br />
<br />
Thus for a 60 second fight with a 15000 hit point tank, with best possible shaman healing:<br />
(673.9 hps * 60) + 15000<br />
(40434) + 15000<br />
55434 = hps useable by healed tank before death =<br />
/60 = 923.9 maximum mob dps against tank over 60 secs. <br />
<br />
By determining your maximum hps per fight, you can determine the hardest hitting mob you can attack with shaman healing.<br />
<br />
Slow reduces mob dps from 0% to 75%, buit any slow less than 50% leaves a shaman behind a cleric head to head, and if the cleric has any slow at all from another class, he greatly exceeds a shaman once again. <br />
<br />
Shaman to cleric healing ratio is 47/100 so an equal cleric can heal against a mob with 2.12 times the dps as may a shaman, or against a mob which hits for 1958 dps in the above example.<br />
<br />
Shaman to Druid healing ratio is 47/64 so an equal druid can heal against a mob with 1.36 times the dps as may a shaman, or a mob which hits for 1258 dps in the above example.<br />
<br />
HoTs may affect this somewhat. If you have the math, let me know. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think all priests should be equally able to heal 80% of level appropriate single group content, and the current balance is heavily skewed.</div></div><hr />
