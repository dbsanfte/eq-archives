<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krakkle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I no longer play on Bertox, and am looking to put the gear I had to some good use.  Looking for a sub 50 shaman (but hopefully higher than 20) who likes the class and foresees themself playing for a while that could use a leg up instead of someone who will just take it and sell it all (no mega twinks need apply.)  Preferably someone with crap gear now that could make the most use of it.<br />
<br />
It's nothing truly great, mainly stuff like Ikky bp, REIF, 6ac 65hp rings, and other misc items.  For the most part I shirked wisdom in favor of hp but not totally.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Hola,<br />
<br />
Started up a rogue on the new server (Maelin).  Been enjoying the no twink atmosphere (for the most part) and it's rekindled a good bit of interest in the game for me.  My shaman wasn't that high anyway, so what the hell? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wish you were on Karana. This level 33 shammy still has leather on his feet with a few pieces of Ry'gor being the best otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, well Dretch is my main, and really the only character I have any interest in playing anymore...just deleted a 30 druid, and 31 warrior outright.  I have earned the pp for everything I have purchased, (farmed spiderlings for ever /sigh), and am very happy with my equipment.  Personally I'd rather see it go to a more needy Shaman but if you see any gaping holes in my gear, and want to offer an upgrade, I'd be a fool to refuse your generosity.  Oh and about that JBB.... :p</div></div><hr />
