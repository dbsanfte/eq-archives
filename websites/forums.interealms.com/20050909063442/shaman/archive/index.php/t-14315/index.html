<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a direct copy of my EQ files into another folder called Everquest2, then set up a shortcut to the patch file on desktop. I crank up the new version on one account, minimize with (alt-shift-r), then crank up the original version on another account, and I'm fine. When I do it in the reverse order I get some message about eqmain.dll and can't get the second startup running. I have the Everquest2 version running with just about everything cut off (models, sound, etc.,) because I think it helps, but I really haven't tested it any other way to find out for sure. Maybe that's causing the eqmain.dll problem./shrug<br />
<br />
Once both accounts are up and running, I have no problems and switching from one to the other is fairly quick.<br />
<br />
Is there something I need to change in some file to get rid of the eqmain.dll problem? Is it maybe caused by copying instead of actually installing the game in another directory?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
