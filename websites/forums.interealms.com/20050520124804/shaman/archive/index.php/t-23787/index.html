<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinudan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I just hit level 46 and our small group of friends wants to explore some in either Plane of Justice or Plane of Innovation.  While I look forward to hunting I am worried we may not be ready for the mobs in these zones.  The group usually consists of myself (46 Shaman), 51 SK, 46 Enchanter, 46 Mage, and a 47 Druid.<br />
<br />
As you see, we normally do not have a cleric in the group so the healing falls to me with Druid spot healing.  The only Planes experience I have on my other character is strictly aggro kiting stuff.  <br />
<br />
I appreciate any feedback or suggestions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gonna go with &quot;no way in heck&quot; since this is a family forum and all. Advise hitting 51 in Lower Guk, then coming back with some savage Turgurs beatings, and Superior Heals from the druid.  <br />
<br />
You'll level quickly with a steady group like that so well balanced, so getting used to the way things will eventually work I think will help you out.  At 65 (ding, 66+, but you get the idea), in groups with druid healers, I usually split things with them.  They watch the tank, since they have a good big main heal from 58 on.  I do the other healing, and back them up when I can on the MT, since my mana is insanely better than theirs.  You can't be primarily responsible for healing in challenging situations because your job is debuffing the monsters with slow asap, and the tank might take some heavy damage before it lands.  Once that's out of the way, though, you can flip with the druid if you like, and take over healing so he can cast damage.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting :)</div></div><hr />

Druid healing still not above Shaman healing at that level?<br />
Anyways, maybe try PoN, more room to kite stuff if things do not work out. PoI will prabably not work because of those unslowable robots (forgot the name). PoJ zoneout you could try but it is frequently camped.<br />
<br />
I do think you can fight there with this group. It would be interesting maybe to check out the new OoW zones, no idea if there is something that fits, or do LDoNs if you can still stand them. I think the exp in old world zones or even Luclin is much worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With that group I would go live in Nurga and work the quest armor named spawns. Start at entrance and work your way in. You will know when you get too far ... after that CR, back up 2 steps, turn around and fight there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I would honestly avoid the planes for awhile yet. Check out Nurga like Grafsha suggested, or perhaps Dulak's Harbor. I'd stay out of the POJ/POI until *at least* 51, when you get hold of Superior Heal. Even then, healing may be problematic. Also, make sure you have Stoicism (heal over time), I wouldn't pass that spell up if you're main healing.<br />

Still?  *sigh*<br />
<br />
Druids and Shaman have identical heals up until level 58.<br />
<br />
As for your group, I'd say do some Kunark zones.  With modern gear you will tear up Chardok, KC, HS, Nurga, CoM, etc.  I bet Velks is pretty empty too nowadays.<br />
<br />
Stay away from OS, they made it so that the casters chain cast pretty high level spells now :(</div></div><hr />

You and the druid could do poj, but I wouldn't try anything above that.<br />
<br />
Karnors is a good bet at 46 still.  Think I remember alternating between poj and karnors from 46-52<br />
<br />
At 53-54 I started doing some poi, but usually had to have a cleric.<br />
<br />
At 58 was the first time I tried main healing in pon, and while tough, I could do it.</div></div><hr />

Druids actually get a better blast heal at 44 when shaman get their mini torpor thing. The druid should be healing at this point and I would suggest CoM personally, especially with it being a hot spot right now. I've pulled a level in 2 hours in the 40's there on various characters even when it wasn't a hot spot. With a full group you should be able to clear everything from temple to castle and back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Make the druid do the main healing. Their healing water spell is nearly as good as level 55 chloroblast. If you don't have your LoY spells, I'd suggest you all go and work on those together, very much worth it.</div></div><hr />

you will likely be able to main heal in POJ near ZO but thats it. and it could depend on your tank/group gear as well. but i suspect that you could do it. Any other plane i would avoid.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, quested LoY spells included, Shms still win in terms of efficiency.  However, don't expect the tank to enjoy Stoicism running :)  For the most part, we are the same healing as Druids though (greater heal-&gt;chloroblast-&gt;superior heal).</div></div><hr />

Druids and shaman, in terms of efficiency, heal exactly the same till 58 when the &quot;CH&quot; becomes available. And old world zones tend to have a larger exp bonus that newer places. Finally from personal experience with the first OoW zone, I dont think its a place that anyone would seriously want to take a level appropriate toon. Mobs all mitigate, lots summon, met more than a few immune to snare/root, etc. Also meeting up with a mob that procs a 440 point nuke FREQUENTLY at level 50 is tantamount to suicide.<br />
Actually one of the better places to exp at that level with that group would likely be Dulaks, big open zone, outdoors, mobs dont hit that hard, and there are good steady drops of gems and plenty of named scattered about for varied camping....avoid the last 2 boats on the east side, Oceancrasher and Windscorn, they will be a bit advanced for you and its difficult to pull them.<br />
Once your all closer to 50, head into the luggald caves and camp he Soulstripper for those that can use it, just be careful the luggalds are 1/2 casters, lots of clerics and SK. <br />
LoY is a great handful of zones for levels, basically empty these days, even the pharmers avoid it. I leveled my beastlord, rogue, sk and ranger there some solo, some PL and the risk vs reward is excellent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dulak is a great zone at L46 . . . get yourself a Soulstripper while you are there.<br />
<br />
Good loot, some interesting named / drops . . . :bigthumb:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinudan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you everyone for the great information and suggestions!   :) <br />
<br />
I wanted to let you know how things worked out.  As already suggested, PoI was tough for us.  I would be about out of mana after 2 kills, so not very efficient.  PoJ zoneout camp was better, but still seemed a bit in-efficient.<br />
<br />
Nurga was perfect, had great success there.  Dulak was good as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.  We may try some of the other old world dungeons as well.  They are alot of fun, and have enough of an edge to keep things exciting.<br />
