<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the revamp of Sky Shrine, I have not been able to find Sentry Enots! Yes you favorite faction machine and mine is no longer at his post!<br />
<br />
I have scoured SS looking for him. From WL zone in all the way to quest mob hall. I even had a Druid friend track around for awhile and didn't find him!<br />
<br />
Anyone have any info? I have many many helms for him and need to get my faction back with Yelinak ASAP. (Just cause you kill her ince she thinks she can just trash your faction, hrumph!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Enots and Kcor are gone. Instead, go pass the first grate and turn right. Once you're up the stairs, you should see, right in front of you, a black drake with the title of Lieutnant. He will take your helms and toes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hand it into Lt Milven. <br />
<br />
I hear the faction bonus was nerfed though, it's not as good anymore.<br />
<br />
3 hours in Kael Arena took me from kindly to max ally, so yay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll check it out.<br />
<br />
THANKS!!!</div></div><hr />
