<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jurais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I three box a warrior (ogre) , shammy (vah shir) and cleric (dwarf).  My mini group has just reached 43 and I am bored of CoM.  I was thinking of heading over to Jagged Pine since I haven't fought there yet.  I don't care about loot just great exp...  I was thinking hunting gnolls might be fun.<br />
<br />
1 - Will this group survive fighting gnolls?<br />
<br />
2 - How challenging is crowd control with the gnolls?  3 boxing is a little difficult when you are chasing mobs...<br />
<br />
3 - I figured by hunting gnolls I could build up faction with the animals and townpeople there...good choice for maximizing exp tho?<br />
<br />
4 - What other zones would you recommend?  I want to pl to 49 as quickly as possible...pls dont say DL or Karnors...bleh!  My current back up plan is Kedge where I can work up the group's swimming as well.<br />
<br />
thx in advance!<br />
Jurais<br />
<br />
ps...this group is MASSIVELY twinked so it is tougher than typical groups (fully buffed my warrior has 1300 ac and 2700hp - not bad for 43)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I duoed poachers with a warrior or a beastlord and made 2 levels in about 7 hours. i think the loc is neg700 neg1700 if i remember right. it's pretty easy to do and great exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jurais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ty! anyone else have any good info on Jagged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The darkpaw gnolls in the caves do run, but unless they are sowed you should have little trouble killing them before they get too far away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SolB would serve that group well, as would LGuk... old world mobs, tiny hps, great exp.<br />
<br />
Another spot is Kaesora... down near Xalgoz's spawn.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you can still get good exp there 43-49, although this kills your outpost faction (so get your gate hammer first!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That group should be just fine in JP doing the entrance and just inside the caves with no problems.....good steady pulls with as many or as few as you want to handle; the gnolls do run and pathing sucks sour swamp a$$ so look for roamers and runaways to suddenly pop into being next to you.<br />
Killing the gnolls gives great faction hits to the JP peeps and to the Qeynos guards, however it does nothing for your animal faction, so invis is recomended if you plan on running to the gnoll caves...also your ogre will be better off zoning in from Black Burrow to the Gnolls of Brell Serillis caves, no one is KOS there (not even leezards)...the reason behind this is that he is mucho KOS to the druid/ranger factions in JP, but a few hours of grinding on the gnolls will fix that....have him save all the gnoll teeth and turn them in...hehe I was at a higher faction there than my druidess friend :D<br />
As far as the crowd control goes, just root them and watch for the horrid pathing....once you get used to it, you can deal with it easier....heck there is a good chance that your shaman can solo them heh....just as a warning, the Gnoll Warriors are all DB at 57 and only 1 in 5 LB so that may mean that they are pretty much con even or close to it  to your 3 box set up, so expect resists and a huge aggro radius for your squad...have fun, they are a blast to beat on, so-so loot, with some nice odd rare drops (the Gnollish ring of Sorcery and the HtH weapon being the best items) and the exp flies, at 58 I can make a blue an hour on them deeper in, killing warriors, necros, clerics and shaman mobs....oh yeah watch for the clerics, they do Complete Heal (arf) so make sure your warrior has slam hot keyed and your cleric tosses a stun when they are your target. <br />
Have fun and take care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only thing in Kaesora that lowers OT faction is spiders. All the skellies and ghosts have no OT factino associated. Kaesora is one of my absolute favorite dungeons in the game. Too bad no one goes there. Oh wait. Maybe it is good no one goes there.<br />
<br />
XP modifier in Kaesora is insane. You can level to 45 at library so fast. maybe 1 level every 4 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Talon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">in jagged, if you go further behind the gnolls, there's tons of caves w/ these basilisks.  i took them to 43 on my mage, hit for about 75, but they're slow, i never had to heal my fire pet while he was tanking away, so slowing it would make the mob look pathetic ^_^.  always stay dubious, and they aren't social, so no add worries.  there's 3 or 4 caves and each are littered w/ them.  most have a spot where you're just kinda sitting in the middle or to the side, great spot to sit.  i'd recommend those guys.  and no, i don't believe the do the fun basilisk thing and try to stone you.  but i could be wrong. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the regular basalisks dont do the stone stun attack, but the females (the ones that drop the eggs, so naturally are females in my little world :D) do and I believe its a magic based proc...I have leveled a 35 bard alt on these suckers and the exp is excellent at that level, but I believe that at 43ish it would be really bad.....</div></div><hr />

My Cleric lived there since 30'ish. I was doing a level in about 2.5 hours up to 43. Levels 44 and 45 took about 3.5 hours each. There are still plenty of dark blues down at the church (Xalgoz area), but the building next to the church is about 80/20 (lb/db). Even so you could probably get 47 pretty easily there. At 45 I was getting roughly 1% per db kill. <br />
<br />
There are about 18 spawns total in that area with the occasional roamer. Having a 24 pt DS then tossing in one 585 pt undead nuke with my Cleric + 2 JBB nukes from my Shaman left only about 150 hp to melee. Mobs in that area have approx 1300'ish hp's.<br />
<br />
ZEM = 18%<br />
<br />
Hard to beat for those levels. Granted, all of the above is PL'd by my Shaman &amp; Druid with my Warrior standing by in case of bad pulls. Cleric only has mid level gear. Nothing uber by any means. See magelo in sig for details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Talon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yea helf, at about 42-43 they started turning lt.blue here and there, so i quit around 42, a little into 43.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I spent an quite a while in Blackburrow looking for the evil entrance to JaggedPine and couldn't find it. I had a map and still couldn't find it. Would it be easier to invis and go through Surefall Glade ? It seems a bit easier to find in Surefall than in Blackburrow, either that or I'm an idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tymson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I took the advice posted here and tried out JP Gnolls last night.  I'm a 46 shaman and the only notable equipment I have is the Iksar BP and Spine chill Spear.   <br />
<br />
I was getting GREAT xp soloing the entrance to the gnoll cave to the tune of 3 blue ticks per kill, but it was very risky and very hard work.  If you have JBB's this would be MUCH easier, and probably alot safer.<br />
<br />
The warriors were better for me because they slow well and I had fewer resists.   The casters were a pain because it took some time for dogdog to taunt the agro while the mob was nailing me with DD's that took a full bub of HP per shot.   I went through 2 blue bubs in 15 minutes, and could have been much faster if I didn't have to med up so much between fights.   <br />
<br />
It was much safer &amp; faster when a 53 paladin grouped up, which dropps the Xp to a little more than a single tick per kill.  <br />
<br />
Recomendation is: Twinks/JBB's will be great here at 46 solo and all the rest of us poor people should bring a melee or recognize the risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well the best thing I found for taking out casters is to have dog dog attack the caster first and then start nuking as fast and hard till caster dead.  Rains are nice to start out with as they hit multipe times giving more times to interupt the caster.  Then just follow up with best nuke.  If your lucky you never get hit if you dont well OUCH.  Not sure about these mobs yet though they do sound interesting to try out.  How is the loot here?</div></div><hr />
