<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Didn't know if I should stick this in hunting grounds or here, feel free to move at will :P<br />
<br />
I've had my BoT flag for a while now, but never got any group offers up until a few days ago. Currently I'm level 63 (that may be the biggest factor) and have been having some really bad experiences slowing mobs.<br />
<br />
Puller has mob incoming, I malo on incoming (usually have a knight tank), and cast turgurs. More times than not (75%?) of the time slow is resisted! :( Sometimes I can get it to land on second try.. others it takes 3, 4, even highest was 7 times before it stuck! the mob was already at 20% hp then so it didnt matter anyway :/<br />
<br />
It might be because I'm only level 63 (most of the mobs con even)... any other ideas on this? i'd really like to group there more but hate putting my group at risk because I cant slow.<br />
<br />
Side note: when a mob is tashed only, or tashed and malo, i can slow 100% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You just had some bad luck is all.<br />
<br />
At 65 w/ malos they resist about 10-20% of them time.  It is a lot more than pov mobs, but still not too bad.  Just get some levels and it will be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Until you have Malos, you will find that sometimes Malo is not enough.  Even with Malos, actually, you will still get some resists.<br />
<br />
The only advice I can offer is to get Malosinia (if you do not already have it) and use it.  Malo on incoming, then malosinia, then slow.  Yes, you will be wasting some mana but in the long-run it should work out to less mana than you will be wasting by bouncing slow 5 times.  <br />
<br />
I suspect that you just had some amazingly bad luck, though.  In general when I first went to BoT (63 at the time, just malo and no malosinia -- pretty much your situation) I had some trouble but nothing quite on that order.  We are unfortunately all at the mercy of a very streaky random number generator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Must be the level.  At 65 I usually just malosinia on inc because it gets resisted almost never and is really quick.  I save mana from using malo and my rain spells do more damage with malosinia then with malo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tier 3 and 4 is best to malo\malos exp grinding mobs for consistently landing slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is also a big variance in mob resists there - at least in my experience. So you can always try out a different area next time, just to see if there is the main problem.<br />
<br />
Some of the regular mobs (vind?, someone correct if wrong, meant those in the south wing) are very resistant, debuff as much as possible before trying a slow. Obviously 63 - 65 will make a difference too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 61 i have no problem . Resist are pretty rare in south(earth) and east(water ?) i found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">this zone is one of highest resist rate in PoP exp zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To tell you the truth, I'd rather have slow resistance (and not that much resistance at all with Malo and level 65) than PoTactics high level of mitigation.  Every single time I see that message, I cringe.  Feels like SOE isn't letting me do my job :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Resists are a big hassle in BoT, I routinely malos everything, and still get 20% resists on slow on militis.<br />
The wing I realy hate is the one with the &quot;forest giants&quot; (north I think), they are basically immune to cold and poison, so all you land is disease (what doesn't do much damage in the short time it takes your group to kill them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't mind the resists.  It keeps me as the primary slower in that zone rather than a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some where way back in the mists of history I read that Malosinia and Slow have the same resist rate... so going for malosinia instead of slow is foolish because if you stick malosinia Slow would have stuck any way.<br />
<br />
Now I dont know if this is true since I have no hard coded evidence of &quot;PC resist rates&quot; but I can say even at 65 with 355 wis (also rumored to make a diff in resists) I still run into random BoT mobs, even PoV mobs that just dont wanna slow.<br />
<br />
Id love to find some hard info on what the resist adjust on my slow is vs say a beast slow or chanter slow if anyone knows of a way to get this.</div></div><hr />

There's value-added for Malosinia, if you have a DPS caster or weapon procs in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I noticed a much higher resist rate the last time I was in US than I had remembered before.  I would malo on inc and eventually ended up following with malosinia (which many times would be resisted) because I was being resisted with just malo so frequently.  Heck, even after malosinia the US giants were resisting a good 50% of the time.</div></div><hr />

Malosinia resisted is a lot less aggro than turgurs, when I was 63/64 w/o malos I would chain malosinia and then turgurs.. resists after malosinia stuck were less than malos/turgurs at 65 but from what I remember not significantly. I never had malo, but I can imagine the different between malo and malosinia to be significant.. (just speculation)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At 60,61,62,63,64 and 65, I have had nights where I could slow everything and other nights, the cleric and I was doing everything to keep the shaman from biting the dust....:) Not often but it does happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I personally think they have tinkered with the resists in BoT. I hadnt been there for sometime before today...I never had trouble slowing the mobs there with malo/slow in the past. Today though...OMG. I was casting 2-3 times on everything it seemed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What I do if I'm having a bad run on resists... lead with Malo; try Turgur's; if that fails, cast Malosinia while Turgur's recycles.  Alternate Turgur's and Malosinia until slowed or until shaman is dead :-)<br />
<br />
As has been pointed out, Malosinia is lower aggro than Turgur's, so an alternate is to chain Malosinia and then do a single Turgur's when it sticks.  I have rarely had to cast a second Turgur's after Malosinia is in.  You get the added benefit of reduced resists for snare, nukes, cripple, etc.</div></div><hr />
