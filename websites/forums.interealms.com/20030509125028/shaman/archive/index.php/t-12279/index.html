<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zenbudda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'll go ahead and let my little secret out.  But first, i'll give you some parameters as to why I think &quot;this&quot; is the best spot.<br />
<br />
1.  I'm a Troll Shaman worshipping Innoruuk.<br />
2.  I'm a twink with a Fungi Tunic and Icewurm Fang etc.<br />
3.  I have a 51 druid on an alternate account<br />
<br />
So, if you don't mind faction hits (evil shaman's), and if you have pretty decent gear OR you have someone healing you, the miners and clockworks in Solesek A (or Solesek's Eye) are the best exp you are going to find for those levels.  I am going off of spending time in Crystal Caverns, Dawnshroud Peaks, and Eastern Wastes.<br />
<br />
Just choose any decent camp spot, have a high level or non aggro puller, and these puppies go down in about 1 minute.  Once you get to 34, and you get a pet and Winter's Roar, things will go a lot faster.  Mobs are levels 28ish-34ish.  You get about 5% exp yellow per red/yellow kill, about 4% per even con and about 3% per blue.  And the best thing is that I am 35 (about to be 36) and even though everything is blue now, I'm still getting 2-3% exp per blue.  So you think about that.  In 45 kills, you level.  The way I have been working (this is with the druid healing, pulling, buffing etc) i can kill 15-20 mobs each cycle (20 if things go smoothly, 15 if not).  If you do this cycle, uninterrupted, 1 minute per kill, 30 seconds for pull (so basically 2 minutes for total kill/pull....i pull doubles usually) we are talking: 2 minutes for each mob, 15 mobs minimum, each mob gives 2-3% exp, so that's approx 30% exp for 15 mobs, so how many cycels per level?  3 and a half!  each cycle is 2 x 15 = 30 minutes.  every hour and a half you get a level!  not matter what level u are!  and i have troll exp!  <br />
<br />
anyway i tried this solo with pet, wiht sometimes disasterous results because of pet's level.  in any case, I can solo without fungi and spear and druid buffs.  i do, however have to have kei (from nexus for 10p).  <br />
<br />
anyway, for what it's worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zenbudda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wanted to add a few more comments, because I hate it when people say, &quot;oh yeah i can solo such and such&quot; when all along they had a cleric healing them.<br />
<br />
anyway, the pet's level definately generates a lot of aggro in this area and i recommend camping in the little nook where the clockworks begin (there's a 2 part bridge type overpass over the lava that leads to the swinging pindulumn before the castle entrance).  anyway, if you make sure you have dog sit and stay, and can pull to taht spot quick enough, you can solo here quit effeciently.  i've found that if i pull one wiht tagars, and run back to spot, have dog tank the tagar'd mob, then tagar the other, you should be fine (of course).  main problem is when the mobs run.  snare neck would help, but root is your friend.  also, root can get resisted a bunch in a row (up to 4).  just be prepared.  once slowed, all it takes is time.  solo, without fungi, without spear, without any other buffs but my own and 10p kei (heck you could get an aego or valor for antoher 20p).  in either case, i've tried soloing other spots and this one is still king.  <br />
<br />
hope this helps.<br />
<br />
also, at 37 i'm down to 2 blue ticks per kill or 1/45th's a level.  that's still 45 mobs a level which in my book is good!  <br />
<br />
also, the gnome conjerers are a pain in the ass.  make sure you ahve your mr up!  also, get dog away from the conjurer and on pet.  pet is 100% mr to dd (or damn close to it).  once again, slow is your friend (duh we are shaman).  and pray to god you get a few interrupts in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
maybe im generous...but only 10p for kei? u ever hear someone comlain about that? ive heard 1 per level, i usually give 40-50 though (level 37 now)<br />
<br />
and 20p for aego and virtue? i would think they would flat out refuse since i know virtue costs about 30p to cast,not sure of aego but i know that costs as well, prob in same neighborhood id guess.<br />
<br />
i dont know, im just wondering about &quot;appropriate&quot; amount to give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urssus da Greenbottom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't be ridiculous, if there was a set amount that etiquette required us to donate people would not just hope that everyone knew it and keep quiet.  you never hear: &quot;Casting extended kei, minimum donation 40pp,&quot; because they would make no money.  Most people say donations are accepted but not required.  Well, that's how it works on Drinal anyway.<br />
<br />
But I digress:<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I tried this zone a while ago, but I got stormed by a crapload of greenies on my way, and despite their low-con they ended up killing my pet, so I just fled back out to lavastorm.  Havn't tried since then.  Was I just unlucky? If not, could someone explain the proper strategy to tackling the path to the EXG courtyard to me please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zenbudda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah i'm not sure what that guy was bitchin about.  ask any chanter/cleric/shaman on my server about buffs and they would be very happy to get 10-20p for aego/virtue and 15p for kei.  with regeant conservation etc etc this doesn't cost as much anymore.  anyway...enough of the thread hijack...i wasn't talking about what is a kosher amount to donate...<br />
<br />
<br />
don't bring pet up until you set up your camp.  get your buffs lined up correctly so that you can invis yourself, then go to your camp spot and start to prepare.  Always shrink yourself!  Also, having full manna to start out with always helps.  now the place I am talking about is very easy to find.  get into sol a, and pass the initial pendulumn thingy.  when you come into the opening where you can turn left or right (right is a dead end) or go down and striaght ahead (to where the vendor or bartender is).  well we want to go left.  keep going left and don't turn off the main path.  if you followed this right (and assuming no one has killed any of the clockworks) you'll see one sitting in a little cove all by itself.  there is a small room before that little cove.  if you hide yourself from the gobies outside, then you will not aggro them.  anyway, bring out y our pet and immediately tell it to sit!  i usually only worry about hp/ac buff and haste for my pet.  i sually give it a fine steel dagger as well (dunno if it helps or not).  anyway, i start off with a root and send pet in to attack.  if root doesn't hold (these guys are highly mr) just keep plugging away until you get one in.  if you get one of those clockworks that proc knockback, you are just out of luck for now.  just try your best to use the infamous malaise, slow, dot, dd, melee method.  anyway, once you have cleared that clockwork,  tell your pet to sit (i can't tell you how much you really need to pay attention to this).  the key to pulling is to not get hit.  if you got a caster on you (the gnome conjurers and curators) then your dog is going to attack.  just try your best to keep dog in the little cove.  anyway, just go out to the crossing over the lava and you'll see another one.  rinse repeat him.  out across the lava youll see another one.  now, this is kinda tricky.  at lower levels you generate sooo much aggro that sometimes you bring 2 more with that one.  so what I did was malaisement, if others came running just get the heck out of there.  if not, rinse repeat.  the next pull is the hardest of them all.  you almost always get 2.  they are right across from one another.  just slow one, and try to slow the other back at camp.  never let yourself get hit out away from camp (because dog will come running).  <br />
<br />
word to the wise, if your dog gets stuck somewhere, just let him go.  somehow it aggros all the gnomes.  dunno why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did the same thing as a Barbarian Shaman.<br />
<br />
So far, I have never even got close to the exp I got in SolA camping Clockworks.<br />
<br />
I'm convinced it is the best exp in the game (for time/effort for the level).<br />

<br />
From lvl34 to lvl40 you will be gaining about 2-3% of exp per mob.  On top of that, they have low Hp (I'm thinking about 1500hp or less) and don't hit for squat.<br />
<br />
I was able to go from lvl35 to lvl40 in about 8 hours over 3 days.  Once you out level SolA Clockworks and Gnomes, you will REALLY miss how easy the exp was.</div></div><hr />
