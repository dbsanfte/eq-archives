Thanks a bunch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can try the safehouse, many of the servers were contributing to the information as we compiled it.  I can tell you now that Emarr has them all free (unless it was reset at some point since then)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i feel stupid, and maybe it just slipped my mind, but what/where are the drogan slaves?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they reset during patches. Either that or no one has bothered to free the ft2 priest shoulder dude yet on torv which i highly doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It appears that they only reset on patches that change the droga zone file. Otherwise they stay freed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slizarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for the replies guys...after I posted, I started thinking that they probably were reset with patches.<br />
<br />
I'm almost positive i saw the Burnyai (Duggert maybe) in FM one day on my way to Nurga, but he was in prison the other day.<br />
<br />
I have almost a complete set for the FT2 shoulder and I do have a complete set for the Regen Ring but that slave isnt up and thats what prompted the question?  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From my own experience, if your slave is sitting down in the jail area, there's only one sure-fire way to get him out.  Beg, cajole, and wheedle every friend and guild member that you can to head there and help you, so that once you have everyone assembled, your CoH mage can run down and discover another group of people already working on the event.  *laugh*<br />
<br />
Ah, well, at least I never again have to have even the SLIGHTEST urge to finish my coldain shawl!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
I can tell you now that Emarr has them all free (unless it was reset at some point since then)<br />
Hmm, wonder if they were reset or if you were just misinformed. :confused:   Someone has had the ring pieces for sale for a little while but retracted his auction because the NPC wasn't freed yet.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I personally freed the Burnyai Digmaster Duggert today on E. Marr with some friends.  So they are definitely all free now. :cool: <br />
Horgh freed two (Pagik &amp; Asmodin I believe) of the slaves about a week  ago.  The high elf girl in FV has been freed for some time.  Not sure who freed the second slave.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Someone do a server transfer to torv and free asmodin please. I'm currently guildless and can't get any help freeing him, i've had the stuff for well over a month but can't turn it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just wasn't reading very clearly when I first posted.   I was talking about the Nurgan rings, not the Drogan ones :)   No clue how complete those are as the one attempt I made at freeing one sorta bugged on us when we decided to kill the prisoner for fun :P</div></div><hr />
