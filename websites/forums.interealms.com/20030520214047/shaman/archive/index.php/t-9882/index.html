<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kiamak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I found no info anywhere on this PoP ability. So said what the hell and spent 3 aa on it.  I'm very glad I did. For those of you curious here is what it does.<br />
<br />
It's a knockback root that is very low resist.<br />
It has a very fast cast time.<br />
It last 1 min 14 seconds.<br />
It has no stun or damage effect.<br />
<br />
The knockback is great if your soloing and get a slow resist. It moves the mob away out of melee range. It's also great for moving an add off of you. DD will break the root however.<br />
<br />
If your considering getting this ability, it is definatly worth it. Has been a huge help to me in groups and solo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What is casting time? 1 sec or less?<br />
<br />
Does root break early at times?<br />
<br />
Our lvl 64 petrifying root last a while too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was thinking of getting this ability but the reuse time is 2 minutes!  If there are more than 1 mob that comes into the camp &amp; I'm on &quot;Root &amp; park&quot; duty then I'm in trouble.  At first opening a spell slot by not having to mem a root spell was compelling.  But when I saw the reuse time I'm going to need a root spell memmed anyways.  Not sure that makes it worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Advantages are the fast cast time and knockback  - no need to spam your &quot;back off, %T is rooted&quot; key. Plus of course its mana free, and low resist. <br />
<br />
Worth having IMHO, but not before the likes of Canni V and Spirit Call. Not that I have it myself yet :) Still working on Canni V, 3AA to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love this ability in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kiamak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To answer questions:<br />
<br />
Cast time is like 1.5, am guessing, would have to actually check, but it's close to that.<br />
<br />
It can be resisted and also can break early, but it very seldom does.<br />
<br />
You'd always want to keep root memmed. This won't replace it, it's just an added nicety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got the ability and i use it all the time its great.<br />
The knockback of it is ALOT more useful than it may seem at 1st glance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Halor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really think we need a new Best of the Best competitions.  Would be very interesting to see how shaman put these abilities to use.  Though they would probably Spirit Call each other and see who gets chewed down first  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is well worth the 3AA that it costs. The thing to keep in mind is that this is a skill; therefore, it does not follow gem refresh rules. This is a semi-emergency skill. <br />
<br />
- Slow resisted? Must wait 2 seconds to cast root or just click VP.<br />
- Root resisted? Click VP instead of being beat on for the next 2 seconds<br />
- Add joined the group and being on cleric? click VP and it's rooted AND not beating cleric in less time than pulling the MOB away from group through use of aggro and parking.<br />
<br />
Remember, as you level to 65 things are beating you for a ton. I'm only 62, and I'm regularly soloing things that hit for 638! 2 seconds of waiting for spell gems to clear means alot! <br />
<br />
It does not replace having root in the spell lineup, but it compliments us SO nicely! I love spirit call, but VP is quickly becoming a more valuable skill for me to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Togh hit it dead on.  Its all about the gem refresh, especially on a slow resist or something.  another awesome featuer of it is the knockback insplitting up mobs... sometimes a chanter will aoe mez or something and 2 mobs are perfectly stacked ontop of eachother close.. making it hard to remez or for other people to target one and then the other... this ability takes care of that by knockign one back.<br />
