<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this Aa really worth it.  Since stamina really is the only one that matters to a shaman.  Is that worth the aa to get pp5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It gives 47hp for 10aa... it's not a bad aa, it's always there and more hp is always good. I put off getting it until around 160 aa or so, there's better ones to get IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd hold off. I spent a few points to get planar power 1, but the boost was so small, that I kick myself now since there are better things to get unless you have lots of AA. I was just interested in getting it because I have a fair amount of wasted wisdom and am close to the cap with stamina as well. /sigh Oh well. Lesson learned. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PP is virtually a useless AA for shaman. 47 HP for 10 AA's is a sad joke. Innate Enlightenment boosts your maximum WIS by 10 for each 3 points you spend. And WIS is really the only stat you need to worry about much at 65.  Most of the other stats are more than sufficient for what we do if you even have halfway decent stats.<br />
<br />
We have so many decent AA's, that I havent even bothered with those yet. I rarely run out of mana thanks to all the mana saving AA's and effects that I have, not to mention Cana5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PP is worth training but at the later stages. Personly I was around 290 befor I trained it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Planar power raises the cap on stamina AND wisdom. It's a two-fer.<br />
<br />
If you don't run out of mana very often, then raising your wisdom shouldn't matter to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd get it either right before or right after getting innate resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cynwydd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it's certainly worth getting at some point, but when depends on what your priorities are.<br />
 <br />
my equipment choices favor sta &amp; hp over wis, and i was well over my cap when buffed, so for me it was better to get it sooner than later. by sooner, i mean that i got it when i had around 100aa, after having gotten nearly everything that i _really_ wanted, and before going into all the 'well it looks useful, but this is more interesting' stuff. (there was also the fact that it galled me to no end to have fewer hitpoints than my husband, who plays a mage.) If you are more into high wisdom than hp/sta, you would want to wait until later, and get innate enlightenment first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,it's certainly worth getting at some point, but when depends on what your priorities are.<br />
I agree.  One more stamina augment &amp; I'll never worry about casting Endurance of Boar on myself, ever.  PE will be enough to put me almost at 305.  My gear (without conscious thought) has become very Stamina heavy, with my unbuffed stamina at 278 right now.  I was stamina capped for awhile, and for me Planar Power was a good idea.<br />
<br />
I didn't invest in it though until well after 100 aa's were spent, and the 'critical' raiding abilities were already done.  Two AA's can be done in just a few hours with a great group.  FREE hitpoints for that little amount of work was worth it to me.  Would you spend 3 hours camping a 10-15hp upgrade over what what you are wearing now?  Eventually, gear upgrades slow, and the leaps and bounds in improved equipment from one piece to the next lessen and lessen for most of us.  I have money in the bank WAITING to spend on worthy upgrades, but there just isn't that much out there for me.  Investing in Planar Power was worth it to me.<br />
<br />
It is also nice that it raises the cap for ALL your stats, meaning tradeskill related stats, melee stats (for proc fun more than value), etc all go up.  It is kind of neat for me to see EVERY stat (well, except charisma and int) capped at 305 (with wis above that because of IE).<br />
<br />
Is Planar Power a 'valuable' aa?  Nowhere near as much as Canni, SCM, SCR, blah blah blah.  But eventually it becomes worth the expenditure.  Judging when it is worthwhile will vary shaman to shaman.   :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have 202 aa and have no intention of training planar power in the next 50+ aa or so. I will do enlightenment before PP as well ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got it early and I'm glad I did. Free HP is never bad for a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail,<br />
I have 202 aa and have no intention of training planar power in the next 50+ aa or so. <br />
Your choice of course. :)  But with your Magelo as shown (234 stamina), every time you are casting Boar right now you are missing out on 14 points worth of Stamina towards hitpoints.  If you add PE to that (not likely when raiding I'd admit), that would cap your stamina at 305 w/ PP5.  The difference between 280 stamina and 305 may not be huge, but an extra free 40 hp or so seems a worthwhile investment to me at least, especially when you already have almost all of the better AA's done.<br />
<br />
If you were to invest 3x in Innate Enlightenment at a cost of 9 AA's, your wisdom (&amp; int  :p ) would be capped at 310 &amp; your indoor buffed wis (+28 for VoQ, +10 for Bearform) would be sitting at 308 according to your Magelo.<br />
<br />
If you were to knock out all of Planar Power instead  at a cost of 10 AA's, your wisdom PLUS all your other stats would be capped at 305, which would put your indoor buffed wis and stamina both at 305.  You lose only 2 points worth of wisdom derived mana, but you GAIN all the hitpoints derived from the extra 25 points of stamina.  Of course you can always get IE1 later and raise your wisdom cap to 315.<br />
<br />
In addition to the hitpoints &amp; mana benefits from Planar Power from raised stats, there are less directly noticable benefits as well.  Your melee stats (while not a major consideration) also go up, so you have the chance to proc more if you have a weapon that does so, and with a higher strength cap you will have a higher Attack number (&amp; be able to carry more loot unencumbered)  Are these extras important?  Not really, but they are free fringe benefits from Planar Power that you just don't get with IE.<br />
<br />
It just seems to me to make more sense to get Planar Power before Innate Enlightenment for the above reasons, but invest however you think is best so that you have the most fun w/ Grogbat. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In general same reccommendations as above its a very low priority aa and even questionable as to whether its worth getting. What I have done is got planar enlightenment instead, for that you gain 10 wis per level if you have enough wisdom. So from 280 to 330 wis I think is a gain of just over 200 mana. If you really think 10 aa is worth 40 hp then get it, but from my perspective I have absolutely no intention to get it, I will get resists first.</div></div><hr />
