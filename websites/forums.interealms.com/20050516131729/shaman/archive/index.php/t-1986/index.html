<br />
There are currently guilds desperate to obtain the &quot;Luclin Shard&quot; or &quot;Lucid Shard&quot; (bit foggy on name, don't wanna look it up) from ME for the Vex Thal key quest. If you spend enough time in ME, you may come across this rare component and be able to leverage it in a similar fashion. <br />
<br />
Please god don't do this, the Lucid shards are no-drop and cannot be MQ'd.<br />
<br />
If you think your guild or you may be capable of Vex Thal at some point in the future.  Bearing in mind, to my knowledge only FoH, Triton and Afterlife have got there yet.  Then by all means loot your shard and keep it in the bank.<br />
<br />
If you don't think you will do it, the quest is a huge timesink, then ask in zone if anyone needs it.<br />
<br />
If you loot it to sell or MQ, then you are not only giving yourself nothing, you are denying someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe Soupy was talking about selling loot rights, not about looting it and attempting to sell the MQ.  If I'm not mistaken, FoH was offering to pay for loot rights, so this isn't purely a matter of exploitation- it's just a rare drop valuable to only a few uber people that can be traded for something valuable to non-uber people.<br />
<br />
Seems fair to me.  {shrug}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah that lucid shard blows, all the uber guilds send a group of 60's to the cave and kill everything in site just to get it.  They are there 24/7 now.  That place was great for exp and still is pretty good at 56, but killing one every 15 mins is pointless, and even if you are kiling it they will more than likely ks you.  I have destroyed a few shards just out of spite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">destroying shards out of spite is retarded.  Don't blame the über guilds for having to kill mobs that are normal exp places for people, blame Verant for putting the shards there.  Collecting all 10 shards is mega time sink, so pretty much if you aint going to be killing emperor anytime soon (or ever) just send a tell to your nearest uber guild.  <br />
<br />
Remember, it is them who can do you favors.  Like if you need a spell, they will remember who dicked them and who was nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trade for them. Live in your serverwide auction channel and try to note what is in high demand at the moment. One guild on my server was chasing VP keys with a vengeance -- I noticed them offering exorbitant sums (10k for the KC component, 20k for the pained soul component) for parts of the VP key. And so on my way out of Seb one day I camped the Pained soul. Spent about two hours on this camp, and whaddya know, he popped. Traded the Pained Soul MQ for malo. There are currently guilds desperate to obtain the &quot;Luclin Shard&quot; or &quot;Lucid Shard&quot; (bit foggy on name, don't wanna look it up) from ME for the Vex Thal key quest. If you spend enough time in ME, you may come across this rare component and be able to leverage it in a similar fashion. <br />
<br />
So you are talking about camping quest components for keys that other people need and MQ'ing them for cash/spells.  Then you talk about Vex Thal shards and say 'leverage in a similar fashion' Can't blame me for thinking you meant loot for MQ, as that is the only leverage you mention to be similar too.<br />

Personally, I think the solution proposed here (http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=1008) makes a lot of sense- everybody wins, and no one goes away thinking they got shafted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no bum rushing or steam rolling camps, altho if a camp is open or an orb dropping mob is up and its not being attacked we are all over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Brell doesn't have uber guilds.  They have 2 alliances that each approach the size of an uberguild, but not the mentality.  The people in the alliances for the most part are rather friendly.  If you don't need a shard, and you can't use it for anything, and send a tell to someone who can use it, they'll remember stuff like that.  You never know when you might need a res in a far off place, or help with a CR.  You might even get a decent deal on a spell or item you are buying from them later on.  Brell has kharma, sorta.  We remember the *******s of the server.  We also remember the good people.  Brellians are generally willing to go out of their way to help the good people when in need.  As well, if people are farming shards, and thus taking xp camps you like to hunt at, why the hell would you destroy the shards they need, thus making it take longer for them to get the shards?  *boggle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Destroying the shards does seem counterproductive -- you're not getting the farmers out of your hair any sooner, but I can certainly empathise with people who do this... Some so-called &quot;uber&quot; guilds really make a bad name for themselves. I've seen some guilds DESTROY some very very nice no-drop gear when people weren't able to meet their asking price on it. I've seen the same guild authorize its banker to charge new shaman very high prices for relatively common spells (8k for Group Regrowth, for instance). Little wonder that some might feel less than inclined to help them out, and I'd imagine that the poster who talked about destroying shards has been shafted to the point of extreme frustration by the actions of some guilds on his server. <br />
<br />
But anyways... some guilds are quite open about wanting to buy the no-drop components for keys. They'll hit the serverwide auction channel that they're paying 10k or 20k or even 30k for the Shard (I've seen all three prices) and they'll give the names of a list of people that should be contacted if one should drop. It makes sense to me --- they're paying for the convenience of not having to farm the crap themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More than something that is of no imidate use to them it something that likely will never be of use to them. The best compairson I can think of is Veshaans peak. Even tho there are smaller guilds out there that frequently kill dragons in western wastes or other new world targets I haven't seen anyone who wasn't already an &quot;uber guild&quot; when kunark was out ever go and do VP anymore. VT is going to end up the same way i'd bet. The key quest is even harder requiring more drops, a total of 12 vs 10, none of the steps can be multiquested and I don't ever see the emporer being a commonly killed target like trakanon because of the time requirement to get the keys to get and shissarbane weapons to even try and kill him.,<br />
<br />

  <br />
If you aren't on the same server how would you know what they behave like. They could sell spells at reasonable prices and give away any no drop gear they don't need. Just because someone is part of a capable guild doesn't mean they are a jerk out to screw everyone esle over.<br />
<br />

  <br />
Once again how do you know what his guild is like? And it's not exactly an apples to apples compairison. Especially when talking about spells. Sure they may not need it right then and there but they may have other player who aren't on who could use it or new members in the future who could use it.<br />
<br />

I'm just tired of the assumption that anyone in a large and effective guild has to be a jerk. I don't know jaradis at all and he could be the compleat jerk you make him out to be but he could also be a nice guy in a nice guild too.<br />
<br />
Beleive it or not there are still large guilds out there that will help out the little guy and won't walk all over them. I've lost track of how many times we've gone in and broken fear when someone else had trouble and wiped out during thier break attempt or aggre to work with someone else camping a mob like VSR from zone with 2 people and no hope of killing him and spliting the loot.<br />
<br />
You assume the devil and you may find it. Take sometime to actually find out what people are like and you may find someone you can call a friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holdar,<br />
<br />
Did you ever try talking to them? odds are they don't want to be there any more than you want them there. He'll I know I'd be more than happy to leave you what ever you could kill and go afk or even go someplace near by and get exp rather than camping something for a shard but it's something I need to be able to progress forward in my goals just like you need exp to progress forward in your goals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I plan on hitting VT one day, probably a year from now.  I already have 3 shards and plan on collecting them all now, while it's easier.  Right now only two guilds on my server are actively shard hunting, if I wait until later 3-4 second tier guilds will also be shard hunting.<br />
<br />
I look at it this way.  At level 40, I ran out into the lake in the LOIO to buff a friend.  He said, &quot;hey, loot that medallion off that mob.&quot;  So I did and asked him what it was.  He said, &quot;I dunno, it's some quest thing, I already have one.&quot;<br />
<br />
I put that medallion in the bank and 20 levels and 18 months later, it was very helpful when I was completing my VP key quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Taraddar:  <br />
<br />
I'm in a smallish guild myself, but my dealings with larger and more powerful guilds have been nothing but positive- I'm not trying to go on an uber-bashing fest.<br />
<br />
I never said anything about Jaradis or his guild in particular.  I know there are good people and good guilds, but I'm responding to the attitude and content of Jaradis's post (basically that they're entitled to the pieces without compensation, and that if you don't agree you'll affect your reputation with his guild for a long time- whatever that means.)<br />
<br />
It sounds like most guilds capable of using the shards have realized that loot rights on them have value: The value of not having to waste time camping them, the value of getting them before a different guild gets them, or the value of avoiding it just being destroyed or rotting because there is no incentive for altruism.  It sounds like most are willing to compensate people for loot rights to the shards.  <br />
<br />
Jaradis is taking a different stand- that they are entitled the shards free of charge.  I disagree with that position, and with the whole attitude of spiteful uberness in his post.  Blackmail?  LOL !!!<br />
<br />
The one comment I wish I could change is &quot;The idea of an uber-guild asking people not to charge them for an item they need is pretty funny to me, considering the history involved.&quot; - I don't know the personal history of Jaradis's guild, and I didn't mean to imply that.  I was speaking of a more general history of guild commerce- not something I disagree with, by the way.  If I were running a guild and we looted something we didn't need, but that had value to a bunch of other people, I'd definitely sell it to fund something we did need.  Also, how else would you determine which person got it?<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean I dislike large guilds, dislike uberness, or even dislike Jaradis.. just that I disagree with this position, and the tone of that post.<br />
<br />
Like you said:  You assume the devil and you may find it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm not talking about every person in ME, I'm talking about the people that ARE blackmailing people.  Just last week one of my friends was offering 5k to loot a shard.  One dropped and the group of 3 people told her that if she didn't pay 10k they would destroy it.  THAT is blackmail.  One of those people in the group was a ranger that was given Vindicator's Head for free so he could get his Helm of the Tracker, just because he happened to be in the zone at the time.<br />
<br />
If they said &quot;Well we want 10k or we'll loot it for ourselves to use&quot; thats one thing.  But they had no intention of keeping it, they wanted to extort what ever they could.  I've also been in the zone asking for loot rights if no one needed it, and 2 people sent me tells saying &quot;if I didn't pay them 20k they would destroy it and I'll never see VT&quot;.   I refuse to pay blackmail money to those people, they can let it rot before I pay them.   I didn't say everyone that took money for the shard was blackmailing.  I don't have a problem paying someone for doing work I don't want to do, but there is a difference when they turn around after it drops and try and extort you for as much as they can in the 7 mins before it rots.<br />
<br />
And as far as your assumtions of what I do and have done, well I'll let my reputation on Brell speak for itself there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well on the off chance of sounding reasonable..yes you run into that situation. However you are still missing 2 things. It has value to you and it has value to them. Have you tried negotiating a price? I bet you have not. You just simply sent them a hate tell back about them trying to extort money from you. Everyone always &quot;offers&quot; the lowest price.. its called a market economy.  Don't like it.....get the shard yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Have you tried negotiating a price? I bet you have not. You just simply sent them a hate tell back about them trying to extort money from you<br />
<br />
So you can read minds?  You know what I say?  You have no clue so stop acting all high and mighty.  The one that wanted 20k, he refused to come down, I refused to pay, so I told him &quot;No thanks, loot it for yourself at that price&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Jaradis:  Just because you couldn't come to an agreement on price doesn't make it blackmail or extortion.  Fact is they killed the mob, they own the loot.  If you want to buy the loot, you either come to terms on price or don't acquire it.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are jackasses... sounds like you ran into one of them.  That still doesn't make it blackmail or extortion.  You're not entitled to that loot- even if it will otherwise rot- period.<br />
<br />
That said, I wish you luck and believe that most people will be willing to part with loot rights for a reasonable amount.  I know an extra 5k in my pocket sure sounds nice for an item I know I'll never use anyway.  <br />
<br />
Good hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">and it has value to them<br />
<br />
Explain exactly the intrinsic value it has to them, they can't trade it, most likely they are never gonna use it, it has the same value to them as all the rest of the crap useless loot that drops in luclin.<br />
<br />
Destroy it if you want, but if the guilds who actually achieve anything on the server hear about it, you can kiss goodbye any chance you ever have of joining them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The bottom line is what Bigguss said in his last post, and there is NO denying it.  This isn't to anyone in particular, just stating:<br />
<br />
No one has the right to bitch about another guild  destroying a shard anymore than they do bitching about your guild destroying &quot;X no drop item&quot; everyone in your guild and their twink already has.<br />
<br />
Any guild who kills a mob who has no drop loot they don't need can sell said no drop loot for whatever-the-hell they want, they can destroy it, stick it up their ass, whatever. <br />
<br />
It works both ways, period.<br />
<br />
I'm in a guild who is collecting shards and I still say that.  Fair is fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So you can read minds? You know what I say? You have no clue so stop acting all high and mighty. <br />
<br />
Jardis when you pull your head out you let us know by responding again.. till then that is where I believe it is.<br />
<br />
No, I am drawing a conclusion based on your tone throughout this thread. Am I wrong? I highly doubt it.<br />
<br />
Try not to take things as the &quot;world is out to get me&quot; most people are just stating generalities... you are the one taking everything as directed to you.<br />
<br />
As I said, instead of just coming here to whine, which is all you are doing, try a different approach. Learn the art... I bet if there is 30 seconds left on the corpse timer and you slap 10k in the trade window they will accept it. If they don't then you can just walk away laughing.. not come to the boards and cry and whine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Jaradis,<br />
<br />
You say that Brellian's are nice people and will go out of their way to help and such, and that reputations mean something.  Yet afterwards, you cite multiple tales of people extorting shards for what you consider to be unreasonable prices.  If the tone of your post is any indication of how you negotiate a purchase (be it a piece of jewelry or a no drop shard), it is no surprise to me that you get responses like you did.<br />
<br />
E. Marr has come up w/ an amicable compromise, and it is well known to most there.  There may be blackmailers on our server, but so far as I'm aware, the &quot;shard exchange for Uber guild vault loot&quot; policy is working well.  Others, like Gloriana, hope to aspire to using the keys themselves, and have every right to loot a shard for that purpose, EVEN if their guild isn't capable of those encounters now, in six months, or even in a year or more.  Reputations mean something on my server as well.  <br />
<br />
If you establish yourself to be fair, maybe more people will come to a settlement regardings shard loot prices with you.  (YES, there will always be idiots who won't sell except at 2-3 times current market value, but then is the time to walk away nicely and remember their names for later.)<br />
<br />
I've seen guilds split and merge many times.  Old large established guilds completely die out, and lesser 4th or 5th tier guilds unite to raise their capabilities 10fold in only a week's time.<br />
Some guilds left their server en masse for DAOC, Stormhammer, etc.  Times change.<br />
<br />
For someone not completely comfortable (but not unhappy) with their present guild, collecting shard components for a future with an uber guild sounds like savvy thinking to me.  I won't do it myself as I'm very happy where I'm at in a smaller (yet relatively strong per capita) role-playing guild.  If I'm ME and a shard drops, I'll probably see if Glori is on first before talking to Magister, because I already owe her huge for past unasked for kindnesses.  (Sorry Chuk) I doubt Magister even knows what guild I'm in. :p<br />
<br />
I'd never destroy something sought after that I could't use.  That's just mean.  But if I killed the mob, it is my right.<br />
Bigguss said it very well.  You are right in that we don't know you or your guild, but your writing conveys tone and inflection quite well on its own.  That's what many of us are responding too negatively.<br />

<br />
I think it's kind of outrageous if they ask for an insanely high price, but the only way you set a price on something in the first place is by asking it or refusing to pay it.  That's what a free market is all about.  And EQ is definitely a free market, in both the best and (often) worst ways.<br />
<br />
If I find prices outrageous at a restaurant or clothing store, I just don't spend my money there and immediately understand that I will not be able to enjoy the goods offered.  I might be highly annoyed, but that doesn't mean it's time to start cussing out the proprietor.  I'm happy to leave without paying way too much for something, and the proprietor is happy I'm not taking up room that could be filled by some sucker or some clown with so much money that he really doesn't care about the real value of what he's buying.<br />
<br />
On a side note, 5k seems a piss low price to offer for something valuable and that is perceived as rare.  You might have only yourself to blame for not getting the shard.  You could possibly have been trying to lowball him as much as you thought you could get away with.  I don't know if you're willing to admit to that, but if you don't feel that was the case at the time, you should understand that the seller might easily have felt that way.  He might have been willing to sell it for 10k until you told him 5k.<br />
<br />
When I get lowballed when trying to sell items by someone, I immediately double the price on them.  Screw them -- I'm not interested in being played for a chump.  I'm more than happy to walk away from potential deals that just piss me off.  Heck, if you don't, immediately after the sale you have Mr. Lowballer crowing about ripping you off to his pals and telling them you'll cave in right away and that they should spread the word never to give you a fair price on anything.<br />
<br />
An item's value also has no necessary relationship to what it's worth to the seller.  It's a silly dead-end in the discussion to ask what good the shard would do the seller, whether he kept it and never used it or destroyed it(or maybe used it one day).  It acquires value when there is a BUYER.  Exactly as much value as the buyer and seller are willing to agree it has.  Period.<br />
<br />
YOU bring the value to the item by virtue of being willing to buy it.  If you aren't, it may well have zero value.  <br />
<br />
It's like the torpor spell.  I paid 85k for mine.  People occasionally suggest all shamans should band together and refuse to pay more than a few thousand plat for our spells.  Well, there's always a buyer who will pay more.  We cannot fix what something's real value is just by saying so, unless nobody ever works around us to pay less or more.  That's not gonna happen in an open market.<br />
<br />
And you're not going to get items -- ANY kind of items, EVER -- by putting your foot down and sticking to a price someone doesn't want to sell at.  Wouldn't it be lovely to think so, though?<br />
<br />
So what can you do?  Dunno, maybe do without.  Lots of folks do.  Maybe try a bit of charm when negotiating.  Maybe do the work and spend the hours camping the item yourself.  Lots of folks try that method.  Maybe even pay the price the seller wants. <br />
<br />
At any rate, I don't think either a fair or intelligent response to a disagreement in price lies in the direction of becoming upset, or cussing out the seller, calling him names, or threatening his reputation, if you're ever tempted to do any or all of those.<br />
<br />
By the way, I tend to give away MQs etc all the time, and have no talent for making an EQ buck, nor do I have the patience.  But I am well aware of how a market works, and you never see me cursing out store clerks and cashiers in the check-out line.</div></div><hr />
