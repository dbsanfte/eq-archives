<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BubbaQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(For Iz, so I would not derail another thread)<br />
<br />
We in America used to question authority, challenge broad statements, asked people to prove things. When did we just start believing anything the government told us at face value? Did the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; shield us from so much hardship that we now have lost the desire to challenge authority and have become callous to others suffering because we haven't suffered? Or for the younger of you, your parents haven't suffered? <br />
<br />
My parent's Generation (the WWII aka &quot;the Greatest&quot; generation) lived through the Great depression and WWII and with that background gave us Medicare, Medicaid, expanded Social Security, gave us Affirmative Action to combat centuries of racial discrimination, Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights movement, Women's rights (ERA excepted) Environmental Protection, while driving this countries economy through the roof. (This thread is not to debate these programs just to show what they did to make the country a better place).<br />
<br />
Is it just me that all we as a country learned from them is the desire to build and grow (aka the greed) and lost touch with their compassionate side?  Did they give it all to us (or our parents for the young ‘uns) so we are now becoming a shallow myopic country?  They lived through harsh times and tried to build a society that would not make their children live through it.  I have seen people who would step over homeless people to go to an “Animal Rights” rally.  We have all heard about those who shoot and bomb people to prevent abortions.  Every side has their wackos.  <br />
<br />
Look at the old school Republicans and Democrats - the late Barry Goldwater, Gerald Ford, even Richard Nixon on the Republican side; and Lyndon Johnson, John and Robert Kennedy on the Democratic side.  Could they even exist in their respective parties today as a party leader?  Bob Dole wasn't conservative enough.  Bush the elder's view points are quite in contrast with his son - although he will never ever admit it in public - you have to look at what he said 10 years ago.<br />
<br />
This is a condemnation of the polarization of the left and the right.  We used to compromise in this country.  Not any more.  Every thing seems to be a zero sum game.  If you can embarrass your opponent, all the better.<br />
<br />
Have we become such a shallow country that we as a Nation, could not take the body count of an Omaha beach or an Iwo Jima.  And Mill, it is not just the left that would cry out - it is the right would as well, especially if there was a Democrat in the White House (just look at there complaints about the war in Kosovo as exhibit 1).  <br />
<br />
When did we just start believing that what our government told us was right and true?  Did our parents (grandparents) do too good of a job protecting us from the harsh realities of the world and made us believe we could have it all and never have to pay?  Did they protect us from the thoughts that the Government could lie to us?  Did they make us strong in needs and weak in deeds?<br />

My father is 82 years old, was a door gunner on a B24 in North Africa and Italy.  He came back from Europe, became an electrical engineer (his first engineering job in 1949 was working for the company later to become UNIVAC programming computers for the Navy, but thought there was no future in that) and raised 6 kids, put them through college and did not consider saving for retirement until age 55.  He made his fortune AFTER retirement.  His father wandered the country in the 30s and worked whatever he could to make money to send home (my mother’s father was a bootlegger in the Black Hills to make money during the depression and spent some time as a guest of the Federal Government in Kansas).   I hope I can live up to the huge shadow they cast. <br />
<br />
Can we match the drive, courage, and compassion of that Generation?  Or are we too stuck on TV, No fat decaf Grande Lattes, and wanting the world to think our child is THE honor student at Horatio H. Blowhard elementary school – even though they give that award to all students who don’t   excessively  drool. <br />
<br />
Just my thoughts on a day that I have had to read through complete horse hockey rationalizations on why people have suddenly become conscientious objectors after they have been mobilized after serving for years in the reserves.<br />

I don't agree that people are blindly trusting their government or not questioning authority. In fact I think that is something that is trending the opposite way and is a direct result of Vietnam, Watergate and a host of other public scandals that have reduced the public's trust in politicians and politics.  Look at the vociferous debate over the Iraq War and all the other hot issues.  Look at the incredible turnout in the last election- people are becoming more politically aware, at least about the issues that concern them.<br />

Well growing up today is a far cry from what it was during the Depression that's for sure. There's no question the Greatest Generation (GG) tried to prevent their kids from having to go through what they did but that sheltering led to a very self absorbed &quot;Me&quot; generation of baby boomers.  I actually think Gen X/Gen Y is more of a throwback to the GG because of the social upheaval in which they're being raised.  The divorce rate is through the roof, hardcore drugs are readily accessible, all reference to religion and morality has been stripped from the public schools (which are failing on many levels, esp. as surrogate parents) and kids are forced to grow up far sooner than their parents had to.<br />

I think it was ever thus. I don't buy the &quot;good ole days&quot; argument that politicians got along famously until the modern rancor.  One need only read about the political climate surrounding WWI (admittedly an area of study I find fascinating) where a senator was threatened with impeachment for declaring that the Lusitania was carrying war materiel (only the testimony of the New York harbormaster saved him).  People are people, they will step over the body of their grandmother to acquire political power. These things do not change- what has changed is the public's exposure to the rhetoric in this age of instant communications and world wide media exposure in a 24/7 news cycle. That's a recent phenomenon- even Reagan didn't have to endure Fox News.<br />
<br />

Don't look but we're doing it right now but with volunteers instead of conscripts. I think that makes their sacrifice even more noble. The key remains popular support for the effort- given that we have shown a willingness to pay any price if the cost is justified.<br />

I have been wanting to start a thread about everyone's personal WWII anecdotes for going on six months, ever since I got involved in the Veteran's History Project. Should prolly do so when I get a chance.<br />

The same society that produces the morons on reality TV also produces the Marine volunteers that stormed Fallujah.  This same society only recently gave us the very medium upon which we are having this discussion, a level of personal communication undreamt of even by the philosophers.  Despite being led by the likes of Tom DeLay and Hillary Clinton we have managed to bring fledgling democracy to corners of the world that have been under colonial or imperial rule going back to Rome. It is a measure of our success that only a fraction of the populace need understand the greater issues while living under the [I]pax Americana that provides their security and allows their ignorant complacence.</div></div><hr />

I agree to a degree - the 24/7news cycle tends to show a instapundit winners and losers.  Sadly,comprimise  seems to equate to a loss  to the pundits from where I sit.  I think there was far more compromise  in the past - especially in Congress.  Rather than work with the Democrats, the republicans are threatening &quot;the nuclear option&quot; of no filibuster on judicial nominations - which the democrats are doing in retrbution for the republican tactics on clinton's nominees.  Re-apportionment  used to be done every 10 years.  Now Tom Delay and his pack of imps want to do it anytime the Republicans take a new state legislature.  Georgia jsut joined the list.  The sense of fair play is long dead.<br />

We are talking about at most 15 casualties on a bad day -- and that dominates the news cycle.  What about 2000 DEAD in one day in combat followed by 3 weeks more of the same.    Mothers would be dragging their kids off of Army posts and Air Force Bases.   We lost our national will for casualties in Vietnam when we could not articulate a valid reason to be there.<br />

<br />
Don't kid yourself.  You are talking about several hundred thousand  versus 16million - and they are not making recruitig numbers now.  I am not buying the &quot;altruistic&quot; reasons for this war.   Afghanistan is close to the Crusade of WW2, but Iraq is no where in the catagory of liberating Europe and the Pacific.<br />
<br />
Until we leave, they are still under the thumb of an outside power.  Even a benevelent occupier is still an occupier.<br />
<br />
I will post more later.  This may be a topic only you and I care about, but I shall keep it up.  I used to have long BS sessions with people through out my adult life - the best were in a Gasthaus with lots of German beer and having a rabid conservative on one side and a bleeding heart on the other and middle of the road me getting trampled by both.<br />

Much of what you said resonates with me. It seems to me that everything political has become polarised. And it is sold as a single package; all or nothing, black &amp; white &lt;insert cliched metaphor here&gt;, etc.<br />
<br />
I hate it how you don't seem to be able to criticise a particular action or event without being labelled un-american or &lt;insert politician or choice here&gt;hating<br />
<br />
For example, If I say &quot;I think GWB knowingly lied about Husseins WMD capabilities&quot;, I cannot, apparently say &quot;The Invasion of Iraq and the deposingof Hussein's dictatorship has been a good thing&quot;. Or, if I say &quot;I disagree with the Bush administration's stance in selling fighter planes to Pakistan&quot;, I cannot then say I agree with the Bush administration's stance on North Korea's nuclear ambitions&quot;. See, you are either in or out - no selectivity allowed.<br />
<br />
But it is never balc and white, its never all right or all wrong.<br />
<br />
I think that things went downhill when it stopped being about policies dictated by what was right, but about what was popular, and when elections were won not by good policy, but good PR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speak for yourself. The folks on capitol hill clearly saw an easy way to get &quot;war service&quot; on their resumes by agreeing to the toppling of a third-rate dictator in a third-world country that'd been annoying us for a good while. The WMD were an obvious scare tactic to sell it to the American people, and you could see it in Bush's eyes, in Rumsfeld's voice when they said it. They KNEW they were crapping out of their mouths.<br />
<br />
Frankly if you're not questioning, you're not thinking. Doubt leads to questions which lead to answers which leads to certainty. <br />
<br />
As for Iraq going over in the public so well, I attribute that to the fact that much of the nation is deeply anti-Islamic, and one &quot;rag&quot; is the same as another in the outlook of our nation. It hurts for people to look around and admit it, but racism and bigotry will never, ever die until we have a single global culture made of a race of vaguely brownish large-nosed people with slanty eyes and loose hair. Until then it's all swept under the rug and couched in &quot;play nice&quot; terms.<br />
<br />

<br />
The word you're looking for is &quot;desensitization&quot;. Kids are sscrewing younger than ever before. Self-mutilation is on the rise. Do you want to know why? It's not because SpongeBob is promoting homosexuality and it's not because there's too much violence on TV. It's because these kids are bored out of their minds. Cheap sex and mortification are simple-to-acheive &quot;outs&quot;. Everything really IS handed to them. From instant information and entertainment, to cheap plastic toys that do everything for all of five minutes, to even exhaustive schedules as parents try to make their kids live the lives that they never had as children.<br />
<br />
One trend I'm noticing is the overuse of the word &quot;extreme&quot; in everything. The constant high-speed jabber of the TV on kid's stations is sprinked with one-line catchphrases and liberal use of &quot;extreme&quot; . This Sunday I sat down to watch Alive in Wonderland on Disney... Don't laugh, I'd never seen it before. By the time it was halfway through, the commercials had exhausted me and the movie seemed sane. Between the sentence-a-second commercials for Kim Possible, the exhaustive catch phrases from Jack Long American dragon commercials, and advertisements for inane chunks of plastic foam being touted as &quot;AWESOME! WICKED! EXTREME!&quot;, I can start to understand what's wrong with hte modern kids. <br />
<br />
They're simply being brainwashed by excess, period. It's not an excess of sex, violence, &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot; or whatever else the talking heads want you to think - They're just completely numb due to how MUCH is being pumped into their heads.<br />
<br />
I agree to a degree - the 24/7news cycle tends to show a instapundit winners and losers.  Sadly,comprimise  seems to equate to a loss  to the pundits from where I sit.  I think there was far more compromise  in the past - especially in Congress.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is why &quot;extreme&quot; is the keyword of the new century. You're either for or against, 100% right or 100% wrong, black or white. Any in between makes you a flip-flobber or &quot;irrelevant&quot;. You either toe a line or you raise a fist. <br />
<br />

Winner take all mentality. According to both sides of American politics, our real enemies are the other half of the nation's population. This is going to bite us in the ass. Badly. Conservatives are doing everything they can to screw over liberals, while liberals are shooting back by trying to counter everything Conservatives put forth. <br />
<br />
We are talking about at most 15 casualties on a bad day -- and that dominates the news cycle.  What about 2000 DEAD in one day in combat followed by 3 weeks more of the same.

<br />
Comparing World War 2 to the modern day is idiotic, Bubba. Aircraft in WW2 were basicly schoolbusses with wings and some guns welded on. Armor consisted of a tin helmet and a bible in your pocket. Tanks weren't exactly the cream of the crop. Almost all the battles were fought with large amounts of infantry and often got into close range and hand-to hand. It was also fought primarily in open spaces where &quot;classic&quot; warfare could be properly conducted. Perhaps in the Pacific Theater, the Aleutians and Southeast Asia in particular this wasn't so, but by and large, it was.<br />
<br />
Today we have post-space race, coldwar-triumphant computerized technology to fight wars at the press of a button. We have armor that will stop a bullet with at worst a decent bruise that doesn't impede the soldier too much. We have pwder that can seal a gushing, gaping wound with a single application and some minor pressure. We're even working on invisible camoflauge. Most of our fighting is conducted from the air. <br />
<br />
The two are just not comparable. If we sucked down two thousand deaths in Iraq tomorrow, it would be so freakishly inconceivable given our means and ability that the nation WOULD pull out and declare a gross incalculable failure. We're just THAT damn good at this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not criticising, Hyena - again, what you say resonates with me...but...where is the solution? We are all semi-proffesional critics. But we aint offering any alternatives.<br />
<br />
The solution is easy enough for you and I - as individuals we can &quot;opt out&quot; of the regurgitated cabaret...we can make personal choices that allow us to live on the fringe of this multi-media driven drivel that passes for culture, but this is not about you, or I, or Bubba, or even Izmalis...this is about the broader populace?...and I know I sound terribly arrogant and condascending, but so what? I is what I is. <br />
<br />
I choose to live in a very obscure corner of the planet (diametrically opposed to where I was raised), I choose non-materialism, I choose fishing and sailing and keeping my head down...but thats not an option for most, and even if it were, would they have the clarity of vision to swap the big home in the 'burbs and the 76'' TV and the SUV, the &quot;football and porno and books about war&quot; and all that jazz? Probably not. <br />
<br />
So what is the solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bubba, you are just going too far, and yes, you are describing the left, the hippie peace loving tree huggers.<br />

Oh really? How many reasons were given, and how many are true? We didn't find WMD, one of dozens of reasons, and you, being a simpleton from the left, think you were hoodwinked?

Ya, not like the democrats will use their power to block judicial nominees, and their slogan of &quot;Anyone but Bush&quot; really smacks of cooperation.<br />
<br />
Face it, you may hate the right, but no one is as visciously confrontational and obstructive as left wingers man. Christ, can't even have an inauguration without protests. You are just whining here because a traitor like Kerry isn't in the white house. Politics can be nasty, but I have never, in my lifetime, seen such mean spirit as the democratic party and the liberals in recent years.<br />

<br />
this is a point I have argued many times, people are all pissy about very small casualty rate, alot of the country has indeed lost heart, and it is the left, once again, the anti-war, appease-the-terrorists, no fighting no matter what crowd.<br />
<br />
Look, your dad was a gunner? Did he not teach you anything? If there was one thing I learned from my family that served, it was that sitting on your ass and being nice doesn't always work, sometimes you have to use force. 90% of this board are pacifists and think fighting is bad no matter what, what does that tell you?<br />
<br />
I can't believe somone supposedly smart, like you, still thinks he was misled somehow, that shows total ignorance in the literal sense.<br />
<br />
The majority of this board, which is heavily left leaning, never says anything nice about our country and what we are doing in the world. Bubba gripes about greed, how much money do you make Bubba? Your dad made his &quot;fortune&quot;? How many hours do Americans work? We work hard, play hard, and deserve all the material possesions we recieve, greed really is good. it drives people to excel. <br />
<br />
By the way, Americans, both the government, and private citizens, are the largest contributors to charity in the world, how is that shallow?<br />
<br />
Pisses me off that you posted something like this when your stances and beliefs are exactly the reason we are getting soft and weak. Questioning authority doesn't mean disagreeing automatically just because you don't like the guy in charge, which is what you do.<br />
<br />
People don't &quot;blindly&quot; follow Bush either, people are informed, more than ever, about current events. How many people do you think really knew what was going on in WW2? They just knew that the country they loved needed them, and they did not fail in their duty. Are there ignorant people? Absolutely, always will be.<br />
<br />
And yet, despite the actions of our politcal parties, and our pacifist, weakening citizens, we still are the strongest, fairest, most kind country on the planet, people flock to this country still to make a better life, and yet you call this &quot;greed&quot;? news flash, all people, everywhere, are greedy, we just are more succesful at aquiring wealth than most.<br />
<br />
Weyalan,<br />
<br />
you sail and fish, cool, but how is that not greedy? You obviously have enough money for a computer, food, and leisure time, are you rich? Most people would love to lounge about sailing and fishing, I would, but it would require quite a bit of money. Doing what you enjoy is a luxury alot of people cannot afford, &quot;greed&quot; is just them trying to accomplish this.<br />
<br />
So yes, question authority, but it is also okay, to actually back your country and government, that is what the left truly is missing I think, and yes, it is the left that is guilty of this. They cannot even imagine that the very goddamn rights they have weren't gotten by appeasing and hugging a tree, but by the sweat, blood, and tears of our forefathers, they might want to remember that next time they are protesting something just to be a fly in the ointment.<br />
<br />
Millions of Iraqis and Afghanis are free, for the first time in generations, and the right did this, despite the left. It scares the crap out of me how selfish and uncaring the left in this country is, period. Untill people wake up and realize their freedom needs to be defended, and others want to be free and need our help, the world will fester. We cannot be everywhere, but I for one, would rather us fight the good fight somewhere, than cower with our heads in the sand and hope things get better on their own.</div></div><hr />

Debate?  We went into Iraq believing the garbage this administration spewed.  The left gobbles up what they want to hear of the anti-Bush.  But the way we take what the government says as gospel is appalling.  Bush could not have gotten more of a Free pass on the start of that war if he got a 2 for 1 war coupon from the press.<br />

Are you simply irritated that the majority did not share your assessment of the Iraq invasion? That's a far cry from simply swallowing everything the government tells them.<br />

I absolutely disagree - Gen X and Y are far WORSE than their parents.  They have appallingly little sympathy for anything that does not affect themselves.  In my experiancethey have an unbelievable sense of self entitlement without ANY work whatsoever.<br />
Wait- are you describing baby boomers or Gen X/Y? Because that definition almost exactly explains the Me Generation.  I think this may just be generational finger pointing but I will say this: baby boomers were raised by the GG, Gen X/Y were raised by baby boomers- which one of the two were given the better moral clarity by their parents? Which one of the two could speak of hardship and privation from personal experience when teaching life's lessons to their children?<br />

I do not dispute politics was nasty in the past - it was.  But I think people genreally thought it was just business.  Now it is personal.<br />
And I maintain it was always personal. Oy vey one need only read of Senate debates merely in the last century to read of the incessant personal attacks and mudslinging that was going on.  The difference is much of that viciousness was shielded from the public eye due to the absence of the mass media.

We are talking about at most 15 casualties on a bad day -- and that dominates the news cycle.  What about 2000 DEAD in one day in combat followed by 3 weeks more of the same.    Mothers would be dragging their kids off of Army posts and Air Force Bases.   We lost our national will for casualties in Vietnam when we could not articulate a valid reason to be there.<br />
Casualties do not sap the American will so long as the American people believe in the cause in which the casualties are sustained.  Heavy casualties have been borne again and again in our history without batting an eye.  When people get upset is when we sacrifice our boys due to strategic or political stupidity and popular support is lacking (c.f. WWI, Vietnam, Somalia).<br />
<br />
I disagree with Hyena's reasoning on the difference between WW2 and Iraq. We could suffer 2k casualties in a week there but if the Iraq war maintains popular support we'd simply grit our teeth and keep fighting.  In that sense we are very Roman, in fact frighteningly so.<br />
<br />
Afghanistan is close to the Crusade of WW2, but Iraq is no where in the catagory of liberating Europe and the Pacific.<br />
Then you don't talk to enough combat troops, which is surprising given our respective occupations.  The guys I talk to speak of duty, sacrifice, patriotism, liberty, honor, etc... It is by and large my generation bleeding in the sands of Iraq and I couldn't be prouder of them, regardless of whether they personally believe the war was justified. They're there not because Uncle Sam conscripted them but because they were willing to put their lives on the line in defense of their country. I am in awe of them.<br />

I used to have long BS sessions with people through out my adult life - the best were in a Gasthaus with lots of German beer and having a rabid conservative on one side and a bleeding heart on the other and middle of the road me getting trampled by both.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I cannot talk to liberals really, they literally make no sense, and cannot be reasoned with. They often do not even understand the issues which they are speaking about. They are totally blinded by hatred, of the right, and indirectly, of our country.<br />
<br />
They are the type of people who claim to have been misled, when all they had to do is listen to even one speech or read one article. Libs see what they want to see, and they want it their way, without any thought as to the future.<br />
<br />
Of note, our soldiers overwhelmingly support Bush, even moreso than the civilian population, why do libs think they in any way, shape, or form, speak for the soldiers?<br />
<br />
Look at Bubba, he still is implying that Bush lied, and that the only reason we went into Iraq is because of WMD. Bubba sees what he wants to instead of what is there. World intelligence agreed with the administration's assesment, and once again, it was but one reason out of many, we were not just morally and legally right to do it, but were obligated under the UN resolutions we are supposed to enforce. As an unfrozen cave man lawyer, Bubba should realize that it is not proven there are no WMD or Saddam was not pursuing them, we simply do not have the evidence. Circumstantial evidence still points to the conlclusion he had em, and would continue to aquire them. Any thoughtful, intelligent, sane person would have come to the same conclusion all of the world's intelligence agencies did.<br />
<br />
I also question his thinking when it comes to military matters, he seems to think he knows more than the US commanders(doesn't every person who leans left?), and that the only solution to a problem is to throw more soldiers at it. He thinks we cannot wage a campaign in two places at once, I think we can, not only that, but that we have to.<br />
<br />
I can only imagine that Bubba would have been aghast at the idea of fighting Germany when we already were in a large war with Japan. Germany was no threat at the time, we could have focused on Japan alone, right? Germany's navy was negligable, could not reach us with air power. Both theatres totally dwarf what we are doing in the world today, yet we fought, and won, on both, how I wonder? Because the country united, and kicked ass, instead of being anti-US at every policy turn, just because they hated FDR.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not think Bubba hates the country to be honest, I might say it but it isn't true, he is one of the more tame people on this board, I think he is angry at the fact the leadership of the country does things differently than he would like. Rather than trust even a little that they know what they are doing, now it is just a cycle of finding fault with everything. He calls people that agree with Bush, about anything, a blind sheep, even though he may be firmly in the minority, he seems to think, that one cannot agree with government or they are stupid. Thinking like this can bring countries down. Then you get the total America/Bush bashing people like Shrewd, Raspur, etc, that hate our policy, our economic system, everything to do with this great country, but instead of packing up and moving to France where they would really fit in(I mean it, a socialist, pacifist country where you do not have to work much, or fight anything), they sit here and do everything they can to bring the US down, bah humbug, I will not let that happen, I will fight first. Bubba I would say wants the country to do well, but only according to his plans, Shrewd and Raspur for isntance, want the US to fail.</div></div><hr />

We violently disagree here.  The 501st Maintenance Company incident rocked the Army and there was less than a dozen killed.  We are still feeling the aftershocks.  Our POWs are slapped around a bit and we are appalled.  The 24/7 News cycle would drive our national will into the dirt – even the Faux News hacks could not rescue it. <br />
<br />
35 years ago, I would have said yes.  The WW2 folks could stomach the death rates, because they lived them.  The Vietnam Generation of Baby Boomers are stuck in the “Never Again” mode and the Gen X/Y have never faced it and I doubt their will. <br />

<br />
The casualties, to paraphrase Mill, are less than 1 week of WWII.  Everyone wants to feel what he or she is doing is the most important thing – it goes back to my description of our country now.  Is it even near the level of ridding the world of Nazism and Fascism?  Hell, we are told to go shopping as a support to the war effort.  There is no national sacrifice here – the rich and poor are not in the convoys.  It is the middle and lower classes.  At most we have been inconvenienced by having to show up at the airport 30 minutes earlier.  I talk to combat vets every day – I work with 3 in my small office.  It is no grand crusade – it is getting a job done so they don’t have to go back to that crap hole.  They are not doing it for the Iraqis or the Afghanis – they are doing it for their buddies (as most wars usually are – but the WW2 generation also had their mission to get Hitler and Tojo).  <br />
<br />
They do a great job for the most part – as with all things you have the dirt balls (which I think is overplayed in the press).  Soldiers are not saints.  Most would rather not be there but since they are there, they want to do a good job and do amazing things with their resources.  Nobody likes to go to a crap hole, or at least nobody sane.<br />

No, I'm referring to your previous comments on a &quot;winner take all&quot; mentality and trying to score partisan points instead of discussing the underlying issue. My issue with the Schiavo case went well beyond the travails of one woman and her family but to the precedent we are setting. Trying to draw a comparison in Tom DeLay's personal behavior smacks of mere partisanship rather than ideology. If it makes you feel better after Schiavo dies I have a thread all ready to go on the political side of the debate- I am not in the least apathetic.<br />
<br />
No but our &quot;free press&quot; became cowed and swallowed the line of BS hook line and sinker.  It took a year for the press to finally come out and say that they did not do their job.<br />
This is something we'll just have to disagree on. All I heard out of the MSM was Bush bashing on a grand scale leading up to the war. After the war it became a cacophony such that Bush was made out to be (on any given day):<br />
a) Christian fundamentalist zealot devoted to the implementation of an international Crusade to rid the world of Islam<br />
b) Machiavelli's realpolitik protege who invaded Iraq to acquire oil for his Haliburton buddies<br />
c) Idiot puppet regent controlled by the diabolical genius Karl Rove<br />
<br />
I would submit that an attack dog press is no better than a lap dog press- in neither case is the press doing their job.<br />
<br />
I am describing both - the spoiled Baby boomers raising insufferable kids.  The Gen Xers have taken what their spoiled parents did and taken it to a new level<br />
Fair enough, but it's Gen X that is struggling in the postmodern moral detritus of no right or wrong and an ever deteriorating education system. It's not that kids are getting dumber, it's that they're being challenged less and less and excuses are allowed them that would never have flown in their grandparents' homes.<br />
<br />
We violently disagree here.  The 501st Maintenance Company incident rocked the Army and there was less than a dozen killed.  We are still feeling the aftershocks.  Our POWs are slapped around a bit and we are appalled.  The 24/7 News cycle would drive our national will into the dirt – even the Faux News hacks could not rescue it.<br />
Then popular support for the war isn't that strong to begin with, not that the casualty rate is the sole determinant of the nation's will. This is where you may have a point but not from the facts you present.  One of the reasons support for the Iraq War is so high, or more appropriately, why active antiwar sentiment is so low, is the utter absence of privation on the home front.  WW2 brought rationing, blackouts, restrictions on travel, etc... Ever since Korea we've been able to fight wars with a small fraction of our populace engaged and with virtually no disruption to normal living on the home front.<br />
<br />
If you want to invade Iraq that's fine, just don't interrupt March Madness.<br />
<br />
35 years ago, I would have said yes.  The WW2 folks could stomach the death rates, because they lived them.  The Vietnam Generation of Baby Boomers are stuck in the “Never Again” mode and the Gen X/Y have never faced it and I doubt their will.<br />
Like Rome and Carthage, a confrontation between China and the U.S. is looming. I do not believe this is something that will end peaceably the way the US/USSR Cold War did. By that time the victories in the post-Vietnam era will have erased the damage to our national psyche in the aftermath of that self-inflicted defeat.<br />
<br />
Is it even near the level of ridding the world of Nazism and Fascism?<br />
Yes, it is.  Islamic terrorism is a scourge that is not going to go away by ignoring it.  Their aims in the end are little different than that of the Nazis or fascists, as their beheadings and terrorism attest. One can certainly debate that Iraq was the best choice for a confrontation in the War on Terror, but it's hard to argue that ridding the world as best we can of al Qaeda terror is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Soldiers are not saints.  Most would rather not be there but since they are there, they want to do a good job and do amazing things with their resources.  Nobody likes to go to a crap hole, or at least nobody sane.<br />
No, they're not saints which makes their sacrifice even more incredible. Unlike my grandfather, they didn't have to be there. Their risking their lives is borne of free will, not borne of government mandate.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had some great conversation with Hungarians over their dreadful wine.<br />
The best conversation is always over wine. In my frequent (as often as time and funds permit) pilgrimages to America's wine Meccas I never fail to meet unique, interesting people from all walks of life.  Love of wine is so transcendant that one can share a laugh even when diametrically opposed in worldview. Granted it's rare that so vulgar a topic as politics arises when one is mutually experiencing viticultural ecstasy.</div></div><hr />

Address my points then. At least just one or two. Why do you insist Bush only gave one reason, WMD for war, and somehow somone as intelligent as you was &quot;misled&quot;? This is a common theme, I see it everyday in my local paper from ignorant liberals. Why?<br />
<br />
Most important, why do you think we are only capable of one small conflict at a time? Why do you think, that we can only battle terrorism in one country? Is not our military the greatest in the world? The greatest in history? Why would you have us sit idle, when there are bad things happening in the world?<br />
<br />
Bubba, the biggest difference between you, and I, is that I would always favor action, even if it is wrong, because inaction, does nothing. Your father, I seriously doubt, would have been questioning why he was in an airplane risking his life, I bet anything he would have been proud to serve his country, as my father, and my grandfather were. Sure they questioned authority, but they didn't oppose everything the government did, out of a sense of superiority.<br />
<br />
We are free, because of people like your dad, my dad, my grandpa, and every person who performed their duty with absolute courage and devotion to their families, and their country. To question and berate everything, because you have a beef with Bush, dishonors them. You know, it is entirely possible some of these people actually know what they are doing?<br />

It may surprise you, but I agree.  I wrote an opinion paper in college bemoning the coming of the &quot;Nerf World.&quot;  My premise was that the fact that all the corners had to be rounded and padded, all balls had to be soft, and that every one had to get a trophy at an awards banquet teaches that failure is rewarded would cause problems in the future.  That was 21 years ago.<br />
<br />
I actually received a trophy for my little league baseball team being &quot;consolation runner-up&quot; or dead last.  I don't think bullies are the answer, but coddling is not either.<br />
<br />
I have a buddy that says that you should not be a military judge unless you have been in a bar fight - he takes playing hockey as an acceptable substitute.  How can you sit in judgment of others unless you have been bloodied yourself (I will not have that problem - you can tell people have kicked my ass in the past).  <br />
<br />
I do not think it is a conservative or liberal problem.  I think it is a generational issue.  The poor kids I know are just as screwed up as the rich ones.  The ones that seem to be the most functional are the first generation Americans - the parents are the first ones here and the new immigrants.  They seem to have the fire.  <br />
<br />
I drive around San Antonio and see all of these expensive houses and wonder, what the hell do people do for a job here? San Antonio does not have any heavy industry but it is the 12th largest city in the US.  It is all service and medical (and military).  Kinda hard to be a firebreather from behind a desk I guess.  <br />
<br />
I think we may lack a grand National Goal.  We really have no rallying point.  No cold war.  No Space Race to spur the schools in science.  The War on Terror is too etherial.  Iraq is too divisive.  Maybe we need to  find microscopic life on another planet to get us energized.   A national goal of Fusion Energy is a little too high tech and not as flashy (although the end result is an endless clean energy supply).  A mission to Mars may be a colossal waste of money compared to unmanned flights, but the spin-off technologies and the National Drive to land on another planet may be worth the frightful cost.  We could have gone to Mars on what the Iraq war has cost us - so we have the money if we have the will.<br />

thank you for the very rational, good post, I too agree. I may gloss up my words for shock value, but it is true. What have kids, and hell, most of us young adults, had to endure? Nothing.

I remember playing dodgeball, we called it &quot;bombardment&quot; and I got my ass kicked the first time, but soon, I was unstoppable, I would catch any ball thrown, and could gun down even the most innocent little girl hehe. Same lessons need to be learned about sports, and life.<br />

Coddling helps no one, it makes kids little sissy goddamn wusses, no good for anything but taking a big object up their ass.</div></div><hr />

I will have to say your arguments on this page of the thread have been some of the most cogent well thought out and non confrontational. It has been an absolute pleasure reading them. It is beside the point that I agree with them.<br />

Forget an Arab spring, it's a Grey spring! <br />

And that does it, I'm going to repent right now and begin looking for Signs in the book of Revelations. Any doubt that the End Days are upon us has just been removed.  :p</div></div><hr />

Cool we called it bombardment too.  We had teachers play.  It was a badge of honor for a sixth grader to catch one of Mr. Prunovich's rockets he hurled.  Screw trying to hit him, you had to catch his ball if you wanted to be cool.  Hmm that sounds pedophilic, but LOL you all know what I mean.<br />

Mill, are you imagining yourself as Ben Stiller in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story again? ;) Don't forget the 5 Ds of dodgeball!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think we may lack a grand National Goal.  We really have no rallying point.  No cold war.  No Space Race to spur the schools in science.  The War on Terror is too etherial.  Iraq is too divisive.  Maybe we need to  find microscopic life on another planet to get us energized.   A national goal of Fusion Energy is a little too high tech and not as flashy (although the end result is an endless clean energy supply).  A mission to Mars may be a colossal waste of money compared to unmanned flights, but the spin-off technologies and the National Drive to land on another planet may be worth the frightful cost.  We could have gone to Mars on what the Iraq war has cost us - so we have the money if we have the will.<br />

That is spot on.  We have no heroes.  There is nothing that forces us to think, feel, or connect beyond our limited spheres.  It's not just limited to National Goals.  We've become a soul-less nation that has forsaken traditional notions of beauty, virtue and truth and substituted a crass materialism, self-gratification, and mediocrity.<br />
<br />
It's been so long since America has had to sacrifice to achieve a national goal that we don't know how to do it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You guys are still too gloom and doom, you keep talking about materialism as if it is evil, I cannot understand that, how much money do you guys make? Are you evil because of it? The nation, while being much mroe divided than usual, is also better off financially than ever before, the country is doing very well overall.<br />
<br />
Not all Americans are soul-less monsters. I wake up everyday and am very thankful I live here, I know alot of people who feel just as I do, and if America ever truly needs us to sacrifice, America will get it.</div></div><hr />
