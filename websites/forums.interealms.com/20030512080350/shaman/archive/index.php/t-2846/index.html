<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do any of you know where I can find info on which items I need to get a Ring of the Shissar? I have searched everywhere and can't find any info. All I know is that I need a few items from Ssra like an idol, a ring, an insignia and a bag to combine them in. But, where do I get these items and of which mobs?<br />
<br />
Any info you guys have would be totally helpful. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Taskmasters and Commanders through-out Ssra. Sorry, details are fuzy for me as well.<br />
<br />
You get the bag in the basement off (any? select?) Taskmaster. Then the idols drop off Commanders off the First, Second and Third floors.<br />
<br />
I think there's two on the second floor, given you a total of 4 idols you hit combine and tada, yas gots the key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The ring is actually the key to get to the emporers area in ssra and so is likely to be fairly camped if you have any uber guilds looking to get him and into VT.<br />
<br />
As for the actual quest it's self.<br />
<br />
You need a bag off the taskmaster in the basment. Uncommon drop off any of them.<br />
<br />
You need an idol off the commander from the first floor.<br />
<br />
You need a ring from a different commander on the second floor.<br />
<br />
You need an insignia off the general, arbitor or adviser on the third floor.<br />
<br />
All of the items other than the bag always drop off thier mob. The third floor mobs are a full guild raid in difficulty. They are all unslowable. The general hits hard and has alot of hps. Need a good number of clerics in a CH chain for him. The Arbitor as a mean ae gflux with a 1100 point nuke component. Not too bad when your prepared for him but still hurts and great potential for adds.<br />
<br />
You take the 3 other peices and combine them in the bag to get your ring (key). The ring is interesting because it is a nice enough peice to be worth wearing once you've made it but it isn't worth the effort by it's self imo. If your looking for a nice ring to quest for check out the chardok ring. Simular stats and alot easier to compleate altho still time consuming.</div></div><hr />
