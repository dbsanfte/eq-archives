<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well day 2 of the patch camp continues in my attempt to spawn the login server.<br />
<br />
My question is this: How long does it take to patch on dialup?  I have SoL and loaded it with no problems.  Now it seems I am downloading zones that were installed with the expansion.  Mostly old world retextures by my guess.<br />
<br />
Is there any workaround to this?  I have tried the link Arsecn gave in a separate post, but after downloading those patches from mirror sites,  I still had to begin at the beginning!<br />
<br />
I left the download running all night, and it now seems that I will be done around 9pm tonight...there's gotta be a better way.<br />
<br />
VI has truly blown it this time in my opinion.  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, I envy those of you with video problems...at least you're getting in the game =(</div></div><hr />
