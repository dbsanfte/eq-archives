Or at least the character told me I could borrow the book and when I was done with it, it would magically return to him.  What are these books for, are any Ranger specific, etc?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To &quot;loan&quot; a book, you simply buy it off the npc for free, and can then read it.<br />
<br />
Some of the best reading is about the Unkempt Warders.</div></div><hr />

But Verant has a way of stumbling with game lore.<br />
<br />
I think it would be very cool to be the one to return their missing book to the Unkempt Warders.</div></div><hr />
