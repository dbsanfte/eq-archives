In fact it's happened several times to me, end result being my death.  I believe I have learned my lesson.  Situation:  LFG in planes, conan invites you to his group, OK, BRT.  After exchanging niceities, fightin starts, I start to notice the relative inefficiency of cleric to heal/tanks to DPS.  Two slow resists later, mob on me, taunters can't get it off, cleric can't heal quick enough, loading pls wait.  &quot;Ready for rez&quot;?  Gladly.  Do you wish 90% rez? huh?  What lvl are you bob-the-cleric?  &quot;50&quot;.  hmmmm, Ok what lvls are we here?  47 shadownight, 50 warr...ugh.  Of course they are all anon.  Planes need to have a sign above each portal, &quot;Lowbies keep out&quot; Just my little rant  :rolleyes:   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its true...<br />
<br />
I will take a lower level friend along in a group to leech exp, but if I dont know you I am not grouping with ya at less than 60 in PoP.  I would rather go do something else than deal with the lesser hps, spells, mana, resists, and higher agro range.<br />
<br />
I've caught a lot of flak for it.. people say I am being elitist... but I am tired of bad groups.  The person may be a great player... but most of the time the person is not exceptional enough to make up for it.  Its not elitism, its averages.  On average.. its not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You have a choice about whose group you choose to join. If you are exping in the lower planes, you may run into this.  Once you get flagged for high level planes, you probably won't run into much of this at all.  <br />
<br />
In the meantime, remember that you have a choice.  You can always ask people their levels and if they refuse to give them, turn them down.  <br />
<br />
Keep in mind tho, that as a 60 shaman, you are godly to these lowbies.  You will never be more appreciated than by those types.  Sometimes, just sometimes . . . that makes it worth doing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">anyone know the lowest level char that can gain exp while grouped with a lvl 65 char?  For sure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It depends on the player and the class, I've been doing planes since 51 on my shaman. Then again I've got my best ability already (turgur's) and I've been playing for like 4 some odd years now.<br />
<br />
Actually thing that pisses me off more then lowbies, is when a level 65 shaman is in PoN lfg with his gimp warrior or somethin to get him a group, and the shaman is flagged for tier 2 +. <br />
<br />
Then again level 50 to 55 Warriors are just annoying, not only do they suck up healing mana but they can't taunt for ****. Only way I deal with one is if they are extremely twinked (IE EB type weapon/SOD/Etc.).<br />
<br />
Probably same for wizards since at this point they will mostly be spending time medding (unless of course twinked). I digress though, certain classes can survive at lower levels better then others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Level 43 is the lowest level that can group with a level 65 and still gain exp.<br />

Highest level you can group with is:<br />

<br />
If it's the standard 2/3 the level, that would be 43.34...so I'd say 44.<br />
<br />
Got a 48  cleric flagged in execution trial the other day.  A RL friends pocket cleric.  He was /role the whole time, so no one would complain.  After we won the trial we were getting yelled ta for winning.../boggle, guess the group behind us didnt want to wait...so in response we had the cleric un-/role and one of us /ooc'd &quot;Wow, can you believe we just flagged a 48 cleric?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Must say though, came in real handy.  Last night we were doing a minor guild raid on named Forest giants in PoS, trying to grab a few needed medallions.  We were DPS light and cleric heavy, something wen't wrong and we lost most of the clerics.  After fight was ended, we had won, and we're all shocked when we turned to survey the damage to see the little dwarven cleric sitting there.  But we were glad none the less.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
I have no major issues with the lower crown being in the planes.  Alot of times they are perfectly capable of the fights.  I've grouped my SK (when I was 57-58) with numerous 51-52 clerics, with out dying once, my shaman was asked to join 2 PoJ groups last night.  Sure a 50 warrior cant be MT in PoD, but just because someone is a few levels lower than the majority doesn't mean they cant do their job or assist you in yours.  Had a good SK friend of mine, who's since retired, was pulling LCY/RCY in PoD since 52 - he was a damn fine SK.  <br />
<br />
Plus you never know when these same people will one day be higher level than you, in a group/camp you want to join.  People remember those that shun them, do you want to take that chance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm not trying to flame, but a 60 Shaman in pod getting resisted twice? I'm guessing no malo and he tried to slow w/o malosini. I do that when I feel like I am god and I can slow anything/careless.. Also with a 64 cleric and 55 Cleric I died yesterday in pod because a 56 warrior pulled 2 and after slow landed on first he could not get that thing off of me, 2 clerics, 1 level 64.. I died. It happens sometimes you just die get rezzed and then xp for like 3 hours non stop.. Whenever I die as a shaman it's usually MY fault. I cast too early I get resisted and decide I'm going to chain my spell when mt is a warrior.. (with sks chain what you want =] ) It's always my fault, so you should look at that situation last night and see what you can do to improve your game. <br />
<br />
And I was in ssra last night with a 65 Warrior with so many aa he has sta maxed! I got summoned twice out of 50 or so kills.. each time it was my fault not his! (I blamed him though each time just to keep him in his place).. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">could of just been unlucky, reducing the resistances doesn't guarantee a land for a spell /shrug.  IMO it's risky grouping with anyone lower than 54-55 in pop but it's true some classes can handle it better than others, though I do think refusing to group with anyone under 60 is just overkill lol (though true most folks under 60 I know arent' fond of the dip in xp when you add in someone 61+ lol).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Jeez guys, cut me a break here   :)  , lol.  My post wasn't about shunning anybody, bad choices (well, maybe a little  :D ), slowing strategies, or grouping with lowbies.  My entire group was 50-, in a tier one plane.  Not the most desirable situation, i believe we can agree.  And it's not just that they were 50-, it's that they attempted to conceal it.  Now, multiply that by two, combined with the fact that I dont' play much anymore, and it makes me wonder if it is a trend now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lol Zamnon /nod<br />

No I dont believe it's a trend personally as for the group you had just bad form in regards to them /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just going off on my own personal rant/story.<br />
<br />
Got invited to a PoD group, I join, get classes, buff, pulling starts. Defilers btw<br />
<br />
I was the only healer, newly imbbed with my level 58 spells I figured I could handle it :) Plus there was an enchanter so I figured it was a good time to try it out.<br />
<br />
Around the third pull there are three incoming.  I malosini/slow the one tank is on, start a CH cause the tank was already down to 50%. It hits, two spiders on me. I target one for slow, slowed, target the other resist, reisit, dead shaman :(<br />
<br />
Now im wondering what the hell is going on, I cast a CH, 4 slows, and a stotism (Not quite enough to survie a unslowd spider) Emidiatly respawning at my bind point I ask what level the enchanter was.<br />
<br />
I was just about to zone into pod, I ask again what level the enchanter was. I ask 3 more times while waiting for corpse to pop. Im starting to get really pissed off at this point.<br />
<br />
I demand to know what level he is, I finally find out 51. I hate these god damn people, I think you need to be 55+ to be able to go anon/role in tier one zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It all depends on the class. I have on several occasionns botted my 48 cleric (now 50) in a pody lcy group because we didnt have any other healers then me and while I can be main healer i'd rather just let the cleirc do it. Did not have one single death all night and on top of that we were killing faster then the pops. Not only that but my shaman never had to cast a single heal other then torpor on myself. <br />
<br />
It just depends on the class a main tank or wizard is going to be al ot more useless if he is lower level then say a cleric. Just depends on the situation but level doesn't always matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The EXACT forumla is [char level /2 round down] + char level + 1 is the highest level that char can group with.  Thus:<br />
<br />
Level 40 can group with level 61.<br />
Level 41 can group with level 62.<br />
Level 42 can group with level 64.<br />
Level 43 can group with level 65.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think the concealing of levels is not just a trend, but so commonplace that it's becoming almost mandatory. And it's not just happening in the upper levels - or at least the problems generated by it. My char is lvl 34, and it's very frustrating to go into an old world dungeon, or even some of the newer Luclin zones, and find some anon peep running around killing everything in sight. If I get a response to my queries, it usually turns out to be some uber-level who's just slumming or wandering around trying to stave off boredom or whatever. I particularly dislike pairs of anon peeps where one is obviously a very high level and is PLing the other. EQ is a fantasy game - what exactly is there to hide?<br />
<br />
Getting into &quot;bad&quot; groups, coming across players that don't know how to play their char (which is a matter of opinion and style), and other such stuff is just part of the game. You're always going to have peeps that, in one opinion or another, just aren't where they should be or aren't doing what what you think they should be doing. Maybe they already know this, and therefore want their class and level hidden.<br />
<br />
And I particularly find open calls for guild membership by anon peeps to be a bit rude. They want more peeps for their guild, but they're not going to tell you who they are. <br />
<br />
IMO - anon doesn't have much place in EQ. I'm not entirely sure why it was put in.</div></div><hr />

Play on RZ... I think 5% of the server population is not anon.  You can't even con someone to figure out what level they are, just white, Green and Red, and white spans 10 levels.  Try finding a rez when you can't /who cleric all period cause only people 5 and under are gonna show up (if any at all)  And Teir One planes aren't for 60+ anyway, complain all you want about T2+  but I can solo mobs in PoJ at 52... for more efficient in a group, but unecessary.  But then again.. on RZ CoM is a 35-45 zone max, everyone is just a tad bit more hardcore.  ;-)<br />

My shaman is 55 and does ok in PoP but I won't consider taking her to tier 2 until she is minimum 58 and probably 60.  I can get her flagged I'm sure due to all the people Ari has helped flag but it seems pointless.  I know I would be useless there so why go?  <br />
<br />
At 55 I can hit slow without many resists in all four tier 1 zones.  I've been grouping there since 53 with alts of my friends and we do fine.  I did notice 55 seemed to reduce the resists quite a bit.  I don't recommend going any earlier than 55 though unless you are with a group who can handle it easily if you die to slow agro and they have to fight an unslowed mob.  <br />
<br />
On Ari, I won't group with under 60s in tier two unless they are a friend.  Honestly I don't think they belong there.  Tier one, yes but tier two no.  I won't take Jen to PoV/PoS until I know she can contribute to her group so I expect that from other people with whom I'm grouped.  It is nothing more than powerleveling to put a low to mid 50s person in a BoT or even a PoV/PoS group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Where's the challenge if you never die?  Trying to succeed with a less than stellar group is one of the highlights of EQ.  It's one thing to have a cleric group healing or a caster nuking on inc and getting killed, it's another to work with someone that may not be completely overmatched for Tier 1 PoP zones.<br />
<br />
Hard to believe someone is complaining about getting invited to groups.  Try being a rogue or wizard of any level attempting to get a group in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dubarnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I had that same exact problem today.

I'm like uhhh what lvl's are y'all they are like &quot;51 cler&quot; &quot;53 pal&quot; &quot;50 enc&quot;... i'm like uhhh i guess i'll stay.  Paladin informs me she has virtue and has 5K hps right now i'm like, aight well at least she wont die as fast.  We head to SK spiders.  Pulling is going fine killin ****.  Bout an hour later &quot;Paladin tells the group, virtue faded&quot;... ALright well i figure we're doin fine... nope.  Next pull, 2 come.  Kill one then BOOM paladin dead, BOOM enc dead... i gate.  <br />
MOral of the Story:  IF you need buffs that aren't appropiate for your lvl to survive in the planes then dont come (THIS INCLUDES KEI).  Needless to say i will never group w/ people this low again.</div></div><hr />

I don't hide his level at all. I do run him /role as guild rules require for alts but if anyone asks I don't lie about his level.<br />

He's a 55 necro on another server wanting to get a taste of the planes so after LFGing for a while he ends up in a group with a 50warrior 46SK 49ranger for the melees. Thankfully there was a 54 shaman to slow. I watched for a while and felt so sorry for him. Those low level melees get whacked too hard, miss too much and drain the healers mana to lom every fight. Ranger and SK got resisted on snare everytime, they were lucky my necro friend was there to land dooming most times. The downtime between pulls was incredibly painful, I barely saw his xp bar move. I think his rogue pet was doing more damage than any of the melees lol.  Finally after a bad pull they all died and my friend had such a sad look on his face. I reassured him that not all pop groups are this low in levels and to try again tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

Others were 59 rogue, myself (59 at the time), 61 shaman, and a few other damage-types who rotated through the last group spot.  Levels notwithstanding, that pally/chanter knew darn well what he was doing and did it well.  He pulled and mezzed and slung some group heals and was very effective as both tank and chanter.  <br />

I've also played with some real morons who were level 65.  So in general I'm willing to try just about anything.  If the group just isn't working, the people don't know what they're doing or are underpowered, I leave for greener pastures.  It's a lot of fun getting a pleasant surprise when an, um, eccentric group actually works really well.</div></div><hr />

and thats why i mostly group with guildies i hate getting a crappy group where a tank cant take aggro off me if i get a resist.  i personally like grouping with guild members better cause i feel safer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I'm 60, and frankly have been getting tired of being both cleric and enchanter in PoN/PoD groups with 5 smaller folks, so earlier this week, my wife (57, now 58 ranger) and I decided to bite the bullet and get flagged.  We called in some friends and did a little grovelling and on the second night, we both got through.  Even worked so well, I was able to muster a force to get a good friend, a 60 beastlord through the next night.<br />
<br />
So last night, Mrs. Rorgg is watching the Bachelor, and where do I end up?  Nightmare!  Of course.  At least it was a docks group.  I got into the group and said &quot;wow, a cleric and a shaman.  I feel so spoiled, I usually end up doing both jobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
So naturally, you know the punchline.  The only two-pull we had, the enchanter died immediately, and I did crowd control with root.  Plus, it seems like 2/3 of the time, the cleric (relatively low level) was calling Low Mana, and I was on heal duty.  Ah well, I had fun though.  At least people stayed.  When We finally got a group together for PoV last night, I had 3 different 60+ clerics &quot;go LD&quot; or just leave mysteriously before we even started hunting.  Maybe one of my groupmates was telling Short jokes in /tell, they were 2 dwarves and a halfling.  I dunno.  But after 2 hours of standing around, the 3 of us just went and did... yeah, PoN trash.<br />
<br />
And we invited a 46 druid along.  She got 47.  Mrs. Rorgg got 58, I finished an AA.  Figures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">My favorite is this, and its happened to me several times.  PoJ enforcers camp ( I know I am asking for it), I am 2 boxing with 65 shaman and 60 monk.  Someone - who did not get the (*&amp;^ memo that people under 57 with aggro get their asses handed to them by the guards and rats - shows up and starts pulling.  The fun part is, once the guards are aggro they tend to go after everyone.  <br />
<br />
/gu Any rezzers handy near PoJ?<br />
<br />
Other than situations like that, I am all for lowbies in the planes, as long as they do not group with me :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Seems to me the plethora of lower level players in the Tier1 and Teir2 zones is more of an indication of SoE's failure to provide enough content than it is a failure on the part of the players.<br />
<br />
The xp in PoP is far superior to the xp in the old world.  I guess SoE wanted people to leave the old world and level up in PoP.  Then they provide us with a wopping 4 tier 1 zones, which are only good until around level 63, and only 2 reasonably accessible Tier 2 zones.<br />
<br />
Fix the xp in the old world (which would be akin to adding more 55-60 zones), and add more 60-65 zones, and I think everyone would be much happier.</div></div><hr />
