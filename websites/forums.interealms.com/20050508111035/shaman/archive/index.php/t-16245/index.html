<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Oh well this has bothered me for long time now, as my guild have tried out this HOH dragon for too many times and every time we wipe out.<br />
<br />
The problem seems to be on the MA and rampage tank. They drop really fast, and before the first or second complete heal lands the dragon already eat them in one piece.<br />
<br />
I have searched verious strategy boards around without any success. I have talked to other guilds who have done him before, but at the end I couldn't find any real strategy or good enough tips for this dragon.<br />
<br />
The nukes and the rampage are something incredible and makes Yelinak and AOW look like real toys infront of him.<br />
<br />
Any ideas, suggestions, strategy you might have handy? I believe we are not the only guild ever experienced issues with this mob. Also is there anything specific a Shaman can do during this encounter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a few strats we use on him is to just have the MT group to kill the costodien of mar that way were sure to know who is on rampage aslo have chanters grab some charmed pets helps with DPS, hes pritty hard to magic slow so i jenaraly start out with ID and des slow can get him every time then consentrait on regular slow.<br />
<br />
in all honesty the bugger just hits hard and hes fear can interupt CH if you dont have highenuf MR if you keep going down you probably need better tanks or more clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is there a way to avoid his AE Fear? For instance hide behind a wall or something. Or is that unpossible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since HoH is an outdoor zone, objects do not block AE's. The only way would be you being out of range of the AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamsham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bards.  Use them and love them.  Two can be used, but preferably three will work best.  Put a bard in the main tank group and have him sing Psalm of Veeshan and Guardian Rythms while twisting Amplification (If he isn't at the singing cap), this'll put your tanks at 500MR and give them a nice chance at resisting fear.  Put your other bard with your clerics and have him do the same thing.  You can have your third bard singing Elemental Chorus (AOE MR/CR/FR with their drums equipped or puretone /disc).  If you lack a third bard, have whatever bard is closest to all the fighting (depends on your positioning) sing Elemental Chorus in his twist to get the raid MR buffed.  This should help.  <br />
<br />
Please note:  Whichever bard is in main tank group needs to pulse his songs accordingly to avoid rampage.  Once RD pops he can stop his pulse and fade (AA ability) while the other tanks grab rampage and then immediately start up his songs again (bard needs to know what he's doing so he doesn't screw timing up and let songs drop).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">start your chain at like 10% on custudion left, if your MA or rampage dies you will probably wipe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bard with the cleric group, and mt groups twisting psalm and aoe mr is the basics (the higher the mr, the less they stay stunned for).  Chain Abolish disease on the MT(rydda has a wicked dot/maybe slow? proc).  How my guild set up for the fight was we'd kill the trigger down to about 2%...drag him to a corner then have a sk finish off with a super HT (so the entire raid is far back).  <br />
<br />
Then all the melees did a ranged attack so they'd eat rampage before any healers/casters (bards must have songs off before he gets to camp or they will be first).  Also if there is no exp group in the previous rooms, enchanters can charm those spare mobs for killer dps.  Everyone discs basically at the start so they use it up before they die.  It's like a controlled chaos the first few times until you can heal the rampage :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree on this:<br />
<br />
1- RESISTS : Put Bards with Tanks and clerics. If you are low on bards, put those with already high MR in the group. Even at 500MR you can be feared., so if you get 300MR with veeshan, just forget the idea to resist well hehe ;) (you must suck with veeshan + grm btw if you have 300MR). Also do some MR potions, not like 30pp for a fight, is too expensive.<br />
<br />
2- PETS. Everyone that can get a pet should do it. Shamans, DC druids (think they can dc some dogs here), DC necros (armors at zone in), Charmed pet, etc...<br />
<br />
3- Put a SK on rampage : he can tank it with DA for 18sec, provided he survive the first hit. At least u gain 18sec :( and dont need rampage tank to be healed. More chance to keep MT alive this way, because of fear.<br />
<br />
Ryda dar must die in a minute around or you dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what I've read, have duel CHChains running on the MT so if a cleric gets feared, MT still getting healds. <br />
<br />
Also, lots and lots and lots of EQ/AM3 rangers.  We can stay outside AE range (in the hall way to RDs room) and using our Trueshot disc, we can maintain 300+DPS for 2 minutes (as long as ranger has a decent bow).  300 DPS x 8 rangers x 120 seconds = 275k damage.  If RD isnt dead in 2min, I think you have lost the encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First time we beat RD it was with 50 people in NtOv/Ssra level gear and 2 CoD pets/1 bard. -have failed with more a few time though ;)<br />
<br />
We always seem to win when we keep MA/rampage tank alive. Multiple bards is handy as mentioned, and we are lucky to have a few good rangers with the right gear/aa. Also, drag your pets from the outer rooms for CoD, as nearby spawns poof when Custodian is triggered.<br />
<br />
I'm usually doing malosinia on every CoD pet pulled in pre-fight, then when RD pops,we have 2 shaman to malicious decay/grummus slow, usually hits first time, just use 2 shaman in case one gets feared ;) I have turgurs slowed RD....once...after 5-6 casts...in 6 RD kills... so I dont usually bother trying, just throw malos on after grummus then patch heal. Any spare shaman just patch heal MA/rampage on engage (I'll get the others to slow if we have lots of shaman, as I have the most healing aa)<br />
<br />
RD is a pain really, one little slip can wipe 72 prepared people, while 50 can coast through when everything goes right; also funny when MA drops and you spin through 'nearly' landing max haste tnargs on many many DPS classes before tank2 gets aggro ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You need three special groups.<br />
<br />
1) MT + Bard + whatever<br />
2) Clerics + Bard<br />
3) Clerics + Bard<br />
<br />
The bards sole purpose is to sing MR song.  The AE is not difficult to resist, but it is impossible to avoid unless you're a ranger.  I usually resist the AE with about 280ish buffed MR, so 500MR is more than enough.<br />
<br />
When custodian starts to get low, start the CH loop on both RT and MT.  A cleric might get on rampage and die, but hopefully you have enough clerics to replace him.  If you wait for RD to spawn before you start the CH loop, you'll fail.<br />
<br />
As for positioning, you generally want to have the clerics stand near the little tomb looking box thing, and you want to pin RD in the corner by the door, with the pillar.  Before the fight starts, test and make sure that all your clerics are standing so that they are in range to cast CH on a MT in that spot.<br />
<br />
As for your role, land disease slow first off, then blast heal whichever tank you want.  Chain cast tnargs, and only duck out if the MT is at full health.  I have never gotten MR slow to land, and slow only slightly lands on RD, so it isn't really worth trying turgur's.  Your time is better spent healing.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, there are really only two important things:<br />
<br />
1)  Lots of people.  This is really a zerg fight.  You want to get as many people as possible and just wail on RD to kill him as fast as possible.  Melees disc early.  Casters chain nuke.  Someone said that this fight should take no longer than a minute, but I think that is an exaggeration.  It usually takes us just under 3 (unless I am confusing him with MM).<br />
2)  Beefy tanks.  If your tanks just cannot survive even when the CH loop is successfully established, then they just might not be good enough tanks.  Get them some better gear and some more AA, and try again.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Have killed him twice or three times pretty much pure zerg.   4 or 5 enchanters with charmed/malosinia'd/snared wrulons, some bards playing MR, and rangers hitting trueshot.   Basically the strat is kill him before he kills you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1.  You want max MR possible.  Get bards to play AE MR for sure.  Most important thing they can do.  Make sure they are singing it where your healers are.<br />
2.  Don't use complete heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">try all cost to make your MA/RT alive, that is :<br />
<br />
- set up MA/RT correctly at beginning<br />
- put bard on cleric/tank for group song, at lease 2+ bards<br />
- lots of fast heal to back up feared/rampage cleric, <br />
- lots of dps(ranger)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another way to do this to make sure your clerics don't get feared - get two warriors with warcry aa. Make one of them RT one MT - make MT/CLR/CLR/CLR/CLR/BRD and RT/CLR/CLR/CLR/CLR/BRD groups. When Rydda spawns both tanks immediately hit warcry - vola 10-30 seconds (depending on how insane the tanks are on buying warcry) of total fear immunity so you can get the CH rotations going.<br />
<br />
Of course if they can't keep the tanks up it don't help - but it sucks to tank RD and die due to the clerics having ****ty MR even with bard song or just getting an unlucky resist roll. Also if bard gets feared well you then have a group of clerics without MR - warcry is a nice way to stop this happening :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Warcry is kinda useless. I dont have any war toon alts, or dont know anyone having that skill, but i heard warcry doesnt work against PoP mobs. At least it doesnt with Aerin Dar. Anyway, only warriors with insane amount of aas shall have it hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry should of said in my Sig - I'm a warrior - well the main is now - have a 62 shaman as well, warcry does work well on Rydda Dar trust me I've used it a few times now - last kill we did we had two warriors with it and at start of the fight ALL the clerics in our groups resisted the AE - normally even with bard song you gonna have 1 that fails to resist the fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dont use c-heal &gt;&gt; chain SL<br />
get clerics mr to 200 with items and put a bard in their group<br />
Fight directly under him<br />
Chanter charm mobs &lt;&lt; very helpful my friend told me his pet did 31k damage alone<br />
This is a zerg fight in the sence that u want him dead ASAP .. so do it like Velious and sit under him and KILL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When killing the Custodian, have everyone back off except the designated RT and then finish the mob with ranged damage.  Then when Rydda pops you *know* who will be your RT.<br />
<br />
Pre-pull, pull some mobs from the next room and charm them as chanter pets.  Only the mobs from Rydda's room depop, and the extra dps is invaluable.<br />
<br />
Warcry works.  Without warcry crank up your cleric/MT/RT resists via any means possible.</div></div><hr />
