<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in a BoT group yesterday. South Bottom. The puller (ikky monk) was excellent. By the time we had a mob to 4% or 5% there was another waiting and I was slowing it. We had good DPS and the exp was flowing pretty fast (AA exp). I got 2 AAs with that group (in a couple hours). I was very happy with that.<br />
<br />
But is that fun? Basically I was targetting a mob, clicking Malo, Send Dogdog, click Turgur's. Then check my mana situation...do I need to hit cann 5? Got mana for a dot? Buffs good? etc etc....<br />
<br />
I was happy with the way exp was going and I'd jump at the chance to group like that again but I am not sure why. What is it about clicking on hotkeys that is fun? What is it about EQ that has kept me coming back for 5 years?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are three things that can make EQ fun for me:<br />
<br />
1) I am testing the limits of both my own skill as a player and Jinheim's gear/aa.  It's fun when you look back on an encounter and realize that you completely dominated it because you kick ass.<br />
2) Dedicating a lot of time to a project and finally reaping the benefits, and advancing your character.  Getting uber loots is fun, and doing/finishing huge quests is fun.  Tradeskills too, although I know I am in the minority in saying that I like them.<br />
3) This is the big one:  Friends.  Standing around for an hour waiting for people to get to the raid and get groups made is fun, but only because my guild and all my friends are just really fun and great people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To tell you the truth, for me is its people. The game will always be as number 1 on my list because of these people I met and I learned to know through these years, we had fun together (and with fun I do not mean exp groups only).<br />
<br />
For 4 - 5 years ago EQ attracted me because I was a newbie. I was exploring, and still on the learning process. Today I share memories with dear friends since then and we still have fun by hanging out together in the game and in RL. Some of the most wonderful people I met were through EverQuest. I traveled to England and met a few and since I do not regret it.<br />
<br />
To me EverQuest today is a social game. When I meet my RL friends who do not play EQ and try to explain to them why am I stuck infront of a computer for hours, is because I socialize and interract not only with an AI computer enviroment, but with real human beings.<br />
<br />
Sure clicking hotkeys might not be fun, then do a quest, or go and raid, or look for a better guild, you might get to know people who are more fun and bore you less.<br />
<br />
EQ is not a bunch of hotkeys only :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Detron I think you misunderstand me.<br />
<br />
I've made friends and have no problem with my guild. I enjoy spending time with fun people.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I actually enjoy the game too. I have enjoyed it enough to stick with it for YEARS. Yet when I try to think about what it is I actually enjoy doing I can not think of a single thing. <br />
<br />
I guess I am not explaining this very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQ is one of those things whose sum is greater than its parts.  No one thing makes the game fun, it's when everything comes together that it's at its best</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really really dislike that grind exp, do the same thing over and over - avoid it at all costs - seems like work/pain to me.  Just my opinion.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The biggest thing for me is my friends.  Without them I would not play.<br />
<br />
One of the things that has made it fun as of late, is doing Luclin shards for VT access.  No graveyards etc adds a bit more of a risk.<br />
<br />
Lets face it PoP or LDoN has no risk.  You die and poof corpse at a GY.<br />
<br />
You die in Ssra or The Deep for example things are much more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depends on what you call fun.<br />
I know a alot of people who play for the friendship.  Thing is most are women who are 40+.  I know them IRL so i know they are women.<br />
<br />
I like to set a goal and achieve it.  Nothing better for me then that.   I set a goal of where I want to be an when.  So far so good.<br />
<br />
Test of your skill.  The first to do anything Solo or in a Guild.  I remember my guild first Innourk(sp) kill.  This was on a PvP server (Vallon-Teams) and we where all Evils.   No Monks, no Bards and no Druids.  Just the pure evil team BEFORE Kunark( on lizzies yet) .  Hate was buggy as hell but we did it.  One of my proudest moments when all Tanks had died and I waded in with my Gatorsmash maul and landed the final blow.<br />
<br />
It just boils down to what is fun for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That feeling of excitement when you're doing something fun and conquering the unknown.  That's a big one.  Whether it's finding out that my mage friend and I can duo all the shard-droppers in FG, or taking on Mithaniel Marr with the guild -- being with people who are excited and anxious and completely ON, and ready to tear things up ... Might make me an adrenaline junkie, I dunno, but that's the kind of thing that makes me anxious to log in at the end of the day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This sounds like grinding to me.  I've never found it fun but it's a personal thing I guess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I still play, with occasional breaks, for the small number of friends I have, and to go places where I once needed a group that I can now do two-boxing.  Neither my shaman or sk are uber equipped.  We've each got a few pieces of ornate armor.  I don't raid anymore, although raiding was fun most of the time.<br />
<br />
Outside of the occasional grouping with friends, for me, two-boxing places that I grew up needing a group (Pre-PoP) to hold is challenging and keeps me going.  It could be viewed as anti-social, but I enjoy being in a zone by myself.<br />
<br />
I like Droga, Seb, IC, Velk's, WW, Chardok, CT.  I basically have all my spells (although it appears I won't be getting the ones from GoD, since they're no drop, and I don't raid).<br />
<br />
In a lot of ways, the game has passed me by.  I see people that were once guilded with me that have moved on, are in the elementals or higher, and would be considered &quot;uber.&quot;  But, I still enjoy it.  I play for my fun and enjoyment now, and I have several friends that do the same thing.<br />
<br />
One thing for sure.  The game doesn't interfere with RL now.  It's a past time, not an obsession.<br />
<br />
No, I won't have the most leet equipment.  But, there are still challenges in the game that will continue to keep me logging in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yesterday was One Of Those Days (tm). I led one of the most stressful raids of my life, and really just wanted to walk through Guild Hall knocking heads together ... but when it was all said and done and we had the epic drop in our sweaty little hands, and Guild Hall was pure chaos and excitement, it made it all worthwhile. <br />
<br />
I generally spend more time laughing than I do anything else, and usually by the time I log off my sides ache. It's seeing my friends that makes me anxious to log, and I log every single night to see them and hang out with them. If I'm lucky, I log at the right time to see some friends from other time zones. <br />
<br />
Clicking the same old hotbuttons and using the same old techniques to slow mobs gets real old, real fast. I don't know as though too many people can disagree there. Grinding -- which I loathe -- gets a lot easier and more bearable when you can spend three hours doing it with your friends and not even realize the time has gone by.<br />
<br />
Getting new equipment makes the game fun, too. I'm getting closer and closer to a new pair of leggings. I can't say as though I think getting uber loot is fun since I don't have access to it -- the most uber stuff I see is whatever drops off a BOT tower mob, lol. :) But last night a guildy won a roll on one of the wands that dropped off Chaos, and you should have seen him bouncing around (literally, he was jumping all around the corpse) going &quot;OMG OMG OMG&quot; lol. That made me grin.<br />
<br />
Yep, it's the people. Definitely.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Last night, we got our 3rd (i think) Rathe kill, explored the new expansion a bit, got our first Coirnav kill, and I managed to snag 2 elemental drops (arms and bracer), all because of the help of a great number of friends, and also a few strangers (all public raids).  To me, THAT is fun in EQ...oh yeah, and my sig ^_^ fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Because of friends, in game friends and RL friends who play. Thats the reason i still play. I also like my character a lot but that itself would not be reason enough to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The only reason I still play is for the pvp. Gathering 40 guildmates in PoT and grouping up to go kill another guild. Assigning our 3 MA for pvp. Setting up the pvp hotkeys. Stacking the buffs. Grabbing the pumice. <br />
<br />
Running to PoE and zoning in on 60 members of the enemy guild. Fighting for 30 minutes and living. Stealing 3 kills with well timed spear of torment. <br />
<br />
The adrenalin rush is there. The excitement of fighting 60 players at once. Some of which are very skilled at their class (unlike NPC's). You better think, act and react fast or you will die. <br />
<br />
That is what keeps me logging on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm when I started playing EQ I asked ooc &quot;what do you do in this game?&quot; the reply I got was hunt stuff.

Eq is a mixed bag of specific appeals;<br />
Like the appeal of discovery, immersiveness, progression(char development), achievement, social appeal, the nonlinearness(or perceived nonlinearness), the depth of certain systems like the bazaar; some people are bazaarholics, zone exploration and appeal of &quot;mastery&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you believe psychoanalysts who have played this game, the appeal is around the lure of the carrot, and the community essentially.<br />
<br />
Either way its not an obvious thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>lokinoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Fun - <br />
<br />
Go to EC and charm a grizzly.  Buff him up with your best buffs (Focus, AC, Haste, Regin, MR, etc.).  Then run over to the orc camps (anyone with people there) and park the bear.<br />
<br />
… cast gate.<br />
<br />
Sure it juvinille, but it’s still fun.<br />
<br />
If you feel guilty for doing it just go to Halas and buff newbies until you feel you have repented for your sins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I enjoy the game play usually. Raids with guild are usually cool but i think the most fun I have is hanging out with my old friends even if doing a boring zone. I love to kid around in role play. I'm an ogre so the old standard gnome, halfling cooking / eating can still be fun once in awhile. I recently got a gnomish cooking pot that i like to link. I recently dyed my armor all multicolored and started getting teased so I began to pretend I had become a pirate. I talk in pirate lingo now. It's a bit corny but we get a few laffs now and then. Yo ho ho!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I found fun in doing things people said could never be done. Sadly, all my fun was pre 60. <br />
<br />
I still fondly remember the good days, soloing the glacier bear for my totemic helm (at 25) then getting eaten for dinner by a lich :-) Or running my scared ass all the way from halas to freeport cause I heard thats where the good hunting was at 14. Being scared of actually dying and not being able to get my corpse while I was traveling. Camping the testimate of vanner for 39 hours straight before my friend came and finally helped me stop those kill stealers. Or sneaking my way without invis though lower guk.<br />
<br />
But after I hit 60, it was just the chatting, and I found that ICQ is cheaper then everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Fundamentally, it's all about watching your character grow and improve.  Skills were the most obvious, because you get those messages all the time:  You have improved your skill at Fletching, Piercing, Elder Dragon, whatever!  (200)  Today the &quot;grind&quot; more about AA exp, and after every kill you see the exp bar move just a tiny bit.  This is why most everyone says &quot;Ding!&quot; all the time.<br />
<br />
The fun of grinding is not the repetitious acts and hotkeys we set up.  It's just fun to watch the numbers go up and visually see your character become better.  It's a natural human response to want to better ourselves.  If you can do these things in a challenging environment (i.e. pushing your skills) it's even more rewarding.<br />
<br />
EQ's success is based on this premise, I believe, and in conjunction with the fact you are sharing these accomplishments (both large and small) with people you enjoy.<br />
<br />
I hear of a friend of a friend who just made it into Time, or just completed their epic, or just hit 60 (back in the day) and I will always send them a congratulatory tell.  EQ is about growing, and about sharing the growing with friends (and even strangers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Fun in EQ for me is defined by challange and exploration. I cant deny that pulling down uber mob in uber plane is well ... uber fun ;) But there is nothing at all in this world of norrath that gets my mojo flowing more then when your crawling down the sewers pulling mobs left and right and going inot full shaman effect mode. Healing/slowing/nuking/ VPing and rooting, handing CC in a way that would make a chanter jealous.<br />
<br />
Its the adventure, the skills put the test. To define it to a moment.... its when that tnargs you shot off as soon as you saw the cleric get aggro, saves her at 2% and shots her health up enought o get past blood frenzy thus saving the whole group. Its having tanking contest with the Pallies and SK's and Warriors. Its fine tuning your aggro control and reaching a understanding of your nukes and DoTs that lets you gain or loss aggro for specific amounts of time. Its all these things.<br />
<br />
I lost all that for a long time when i started getting high up in the raiding guild i was in. I pretty much turned my back on EQ cause for lack of a better term &quot; The thrill was gone&quot;. I am happy to say it was the best thing i ever did, cause now i look at EQ from a new yet old perspective. A perspective where AA grinding is not king where loot is not god, where groups that everything is coming so fast and hard that no one even hears or cares that you just asked 3 times in 3 minutes &quot; So how is everyone tonite&quot;. <br />
<br />
So thats EQ to me, its not right for everyone, im sure of that, but it works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">EQ has rarely been less fun for me than it has trhe last year.<br />
<br />
Friends make it fun, yes.  But when your &quot;friends&quot; backstab and lie about you all over the server and server boards, as happened with some former guild mates, it isn't fun.<br />
<br />
When you join a high end guild to try to progress, but these people are so obsessed with levelling/raiding higher end content that personality, friendship, willingness to help, don't matter, that's no fun.<br />
<br />
I have to tell you, college and high school kids have about ruined this game for me.  These youngsters criticize me for not being on more, for not caring enough about the guild, when I am making sacrifices they cannot begin to understand just to be on as much as I am.  <br />
<br />
I'll log on after working 12 hours and being sick as a dog and sit around waiting for us to raid.  We raid, then these kids want to keep raiding even though it's 1 AM and I have to be at work in a few hours.  They act like I don't care about our progression because I want to sleep.  That's just insane.<br />
<br />
I think if your feelings don't get hurt by people just being plain mean and rude to you, and you have no RL so you can dedicate excessive amounts of time to this game, it's fun.  Otherwise, it cna be just grinding.  Sony has geared the game to high end content, so unless I want to do the same stuff I was doing 4 years ago, I have to try to play the high end game.  But the high end game is for those who have hours and hours and hours to spend doing nothing but playing, and my fellow guildmembers act like I'm crazy when I want to do stuff like spend time with my husband and daughter on Valentine's Day instead of raiding.<br />
<br />
Sometimes this game feels like a job, like I HAVE to raid and HAVE to exp.  That isn't fun at all.<br />
<br />
It isn't a lot of what I do but the fact that people act like raid hours or aas mean you're a good shaman.  There are some shammies who simply suck no matter how much they raid or how many aas they have; that only indicates how many hours you have to play anymore.<br />
<br />
I hate that they nerfed this game.  Half my server is in elementals now.  Any idiot can level.<br />
<br />
I miss when you had to have some skill to play and when your rep was based on how nice and helpful you were.<br />
<br />
There are days I think about quitting, then I will have fun, mostly from a nice exp group with my friends where we're all laughiing and joking, or when my guild really pulls together to accomplish something that was previously beyond us.  I live for those moments and have to remind myself of them the rest of the time, because most of the time the game not only isn't fun, it's boring and painful.</div></div><hr />

Don't despair.  I think God is going to be a rude awaking to people who lack skills.  I have seen in the past week so many crappy players bitch and moan on how hard it is.  These people are in decent gear but have not really learned 'basic' eq skills.<br />
<br />
Maybe (GoD)  it will bring the the joy of the game to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I do like is just about everything.  It goes with raiding, getting new equipment, hanging out with friends.  This is what makes it fun for me.  Helping out someone that has no clue how to play the game, but at least they are trying.. is fun.  Explaining something to someone, and then after feeling bad for them, give them some equipment or money whatever.. is fun.  Seeing new things is fun.  Listening to the bull**** drama day in and day out is not fun.  Pushing myself as a shaman, especially in groups, is fun.  Taking over tasks in the group that are normally handled by someone is fun (like..being the puller in tipd, without a bard or chanter in the group... or taking over healing duties while the main healer is medding, while being able to dish out dps at the same time).</div></div><hr />
