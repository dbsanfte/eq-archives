<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wanted to take a quick minute and say thanks to everyone who helped and participated in the raffle, it was a fun 8 hours of work, and I had a blast doing it. <br />
<br />
I ended up selling 91 tickets, which fell just short of the estimate, but it was still a great turnout for an event like this.  <br />
<br />
And I'd also like to congradulate the ticketholder of ticket number 126, Boomin the Warrior, on winning the Grand Prize of a Fungi Tunic!<br />
<br />
Thanks again for everyone's support and participation.</div></div><hr />
