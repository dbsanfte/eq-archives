<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kusai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
Is there a link or thread anywhere that has a Most Common Armor Item and Weapon Upgrade List for Shaman?<br />
<br />
I know at monkly-business.com they have a real sweet one there that shows if you have this item, the next upgrade should be this or that.  here is an example of a list from one monk poster who took the time to create it and everybody have benifited from it.<br />

<br />
I havn't played my lvl 52 Shaman for 6 months, but now I have 2 computers and my shaman on one account and my lvl 60 Monk on another.  Been playing them both and they make a good duo.   But my Shaman is so GHETTO!  His wisdom was 162 but now 192 as I recently replaced:<br />
<br />
Barbed Ringmail with Emerald Dragonscale BP (like ac 22 wis 20)<br />
JB Gaunts with CC Gaunts<br />
Sentry Boots with Tribal War Boots<br />
Smiters Girdle with Colbalt Drake Belt<br />
<br />
By having some kind of upgrade list, I think it would help newbies like me out and also lower the amount of What should I upgrade to?  posts.<br />
<br />
Or you guys can just tell me to bounce and get the hell out of here!<br />

I think the bazaar makes a lot of this stuff go out the window.  Spend a little time playing with the search window- you might skip multiple upgrade steps if you find a bargain!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A list like this may have prevented you from downgrading your Barbed Ringmail to Emerald Dragonscale. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well you're almost there.<br />
Now comes golden booties and purple armbands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kusai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not so sure if really downgraded by dumping the Barbed Ringmail for Emerald Dragonscale.  With barbed Ringmail I had 162 Wisdom  unbuffed.  Now with Emerald Dragonscale I got 182 and some saves.  I got me some Tribal War Boots which added 4 more wisdom with no loss of AC over Sentry Boots, and replaced my Lizardscale Shoulder piece with Chokadai something something with AC 6 and 8 Wisdom.  Got that for 1500P.  Replaced my Str 7 Wis 7 veil with an Artic Wyvern Mask.  Dunno if i:m making the right moves, but I can tell you this much, I:m not OOM as quickly as I used to be and thats what I wanted.  <br />
<br />
Now I need to replace my Wis 7 rings with a nice AC and some wis rings.  <br />
<br />
I have Totemic Leggs now and I:m thinking of replacing them with<br />
Brown Chitin Leggins with the same AC as Totemic but 4 wisdom and those seem nice.  I think I can get those for around 1500P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also look at WW legs, the lower end ones can often be found fairly cheap and the AC is quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Kromrif Military Leggings are an upgrade to totemic as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You're asking the wrong crowd how to increase your wisdom.  Read one of a million threads with subject lines of AC, HP or Wis in them and you'll see most people here suggest AC and HPs over Wis.  You've got regeneration spells &amp; cannabalize spells, why do you need wisdom?<br />

<br />
a) Welcome to the crucible. :)<br />
<br />
b) I think it's great that the monks have a nice upgrade list.  Monk equipment is very one-dimensional.  Ours is not. <br />
<br />
c) Individual shamans have very different playstyles, and what may be 'uber' to one shaman may not be to another.  Personally, I think Clattering Bone Necklace(AC: 8 STR+6  STA+6  HP+30)   is better than the Ivory Imbued Collar (AC: 8  WIS+5  MANA+10  SV POISON+10  SV DISEASE+10  SV COLD+2  SV FIRE+2  SV MAGIC+2), for example.  Many other shamans do not.<br />
<br />
d) There are many pieces of equipment that cannot be worn by all shaman races.  Jarsanth and Jaundiced Bone come to mind.<br />
<br />
Combine b, c, and d and its tough to get a common 'upgrade path'.<br />
<br />
e)  Most shamans here at the crucible believe that mana replenishment is much, much, MUCH more important than a large mana pool.  The easiest way to replenish your pool is to have HPs - a LOT of them.  And have a high AC to protect them.  Wisdom isn't a top priority around here.  But that's for another thread.<br />
<br />
PS - Barbed Ringmail is very nice - you traded 8 AC and 50 hps for 20 Wis.  I'd be happy with either tunic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wud have to agree with Snap that there really is not a simple upgrade path for shammies.  If you want to see a fine example of this just go to Bazaar and do a search of shammy chest items.  You will find some that are very close, but have a tweak or two that set them apart.<br />
<br />
You really just want to keep your overall profile in mind when planning upgrades.  Ask yourself fabulous questions like these when considering a new bit of gear:<br />
<br />
1.  Will this item give me more casting powah?<br />
2.  Will this item give me sexy AC?<br />
3.  Will this item turn my resists into poo so I die lots?<br />
4.  Will this item give me more hp so I live longer than girly casters?<br />
5.  Will this item just make me look &quot;special&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think an upgrade path like this would have to be divided in at least &quot;AC/HP&quot; or a more balanced &quot;littlebit of everyting&quot; paths.<br />
<br />
For instance for shield slot you could go:<br />
<br />
Charred guardian --&gt; Shield of Falsehood --&gt; Clay Guardian Shield --&gt; SBS --&gt; Crystal Chitin Shield --&gt; Orb of the Void<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Charred guardian --&gt; Shield of Falsehood --&gt; Crystal Chitin Shield --&gt; Shield of Bane Warding<br />
<br />
All droppable of course, you can start adding no drop stuff in there also to mix it up further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">He said he was playing both his monk and shaman at the same time. It can be tricky playing two comps at once. If your shaman is basically just playing the part of a cleric for your monk, with the occasional slow here and there, you might want to consider just going high wisdom/mana gear and not worry so much about ac/hp. I mean your shaman is basically just medding the entire time anyways.<br />
<br />
If on the other hand,  you like mixing it up with your shaman go with the ac/hp so you can take a hit. Then canni back you mana while your monk mummifies you :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ictus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you are looking at upgrading from Totemic legs (as am I) look at the Jarsath legs that drop in KC off of undead jailer.<br />
<br />
AC 15 , +'s to Wisdom.<br />
<br />
Level 60 Monk and 52 Shaman? Erm yeah, you can do that. I know I am only using a Cleric as Faern and my Monk are on same account.<br />
<br />
* BTW - 2 boxing is as addictive as the Bazaar and once you go back to one account - you'll be bored unless really pushign the envelope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Kusai:<br />

<br />
I should have been more clear, but you should have tried reading this message board before posting to it.  You seem be under the delusion that wisdom is a useful stat.  The sooner you get that out of your head, the better.  You downgraded from 30 ac + 50 hp to 22 ac  + some random meaningless numbers.<br />
<br />
If you had done any research at all you would have found that many shamans went through their 50's with 150-ish wisdom, and it didn't matter a bit.  At your level I hovered around 135 wis, and couldn't find a decent way to shed any more of it.<br />
<br />
Now if you had gone from Barbed Ringmail to something with a useful effect, like a Fungi, Iksar CP, or Velious BP, then that's another story.  Our chest slot has too many options to waste on 20 wisdom.</div></div><hr />
