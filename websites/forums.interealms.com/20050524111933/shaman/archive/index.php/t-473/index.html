<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Who do you play with?  As with the &quot;stage of life&quot; poll, I'm just interested in the demographics of shaman...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What about the people like me who have no RL friends that play EQ? :eek: <br />
<br />
I've tried t get one of my friends into it but he can see how addictive it would be and has resisted so far, but he does ask me how it's going and whats new etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was gonna put &quot;never&quot; on there instead of &quot;rarely&quot; but then there are people who every once in a while run into a RL friend.  I guess I should have said &quot;rarely or never&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, the other category that I was interested in, but seems too broad to cover in a simple poll, is how many people have RL friends that they first met in game.  The reason it's too complex for a poll is that you have to define &quot;RL friends&quot;.<br />
<br />
I would define an RL friend as someone you see in person regularly and do non-EQ activities with.  Other definitions may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I started because of my brother and nephew - back in 1999.  they are burned out at the moment, so I see them even a little less than &quot;rarely&quot; !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soloen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play mostly with my wife, and with friends I have made in the game.<br />
<br />
Oh btw I met my wife when we both played an online game five years ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I play with myself...err<br />
<br />
I often 2box my shaman and mage...or shaman and my 49 halfling ranger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I guess my 7 yr. and 5 yr. old sons will have to qualify as &quot;rarely play with real life friends.&quot; Try as I might I can't seem to corrupt any adults. Even free samples of Evercrack have proven fruitless.<br />
<br />
Pssst...hey buddy, wanna try this Evercrack thing? it's free /wink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail All,<br />
<br />
I play with my RL Friends. When I started I played with the guys I worked with, two were Beta Testers and were way higher than me when I started.<br />
<br />
Now I play with a few RL friends, who I'm way a head of with my main so I play my Alts, its been a lot of fun. I've made a lot of lasting friends over the two and a half years so I give everyone a little of my time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">no choice for me.  :(<br />
<br />
I am a woman who plays EQ... but none of my RL friends are gamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I must be very lucky.  Spouse plays.  Kids play.  Friends play.<br />
<br />
I have banished my kids to their own server, tho.  They went willingly, as soon as they realized I had a mid-range druid on Quellious that I just never played with.  My 8 yr old still has a warrior on Bristlebane, tho... nowhere near my spouse &amp; I's lev... but we kinda like it like that *snicker*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shayleena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had a problem because I have a RL friend that plays on Test Server but my teenage kids play in Tarew Marr, I tried to get them to switch to Test, but I ended up switching to Tarew Marr.  I love playin with my kids and seeing them goof around, I get to see them doing what they love, being funny about it, and we have a great time together.  (they are the ones that got me hooked)<br />
<br />
now... if i could just get my hubby to play  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Quintella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh I play with my RL spouse and we group together a lot.   We enjoy the roleplaying part of the game and it's also cheaper than doing dinner and movie.  My RL friends don't play but have made many good friends in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I started with some RL friends and we used to group together alot. Now, due to schedule conflicts, we don't play as much together, so I play mainly with in-game friends I've met.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well --- I may be the luckest man in the world.   I play Eq with my RL wife and her 2 accounts with her 53 Ranger with Epic ... my RL Twin sons with their epics ... while playing my 2 accounts with my Shamie epic'd, tunic, and Jbb.   One of the sons is a trader who loves to Quest and Camp for rares.   The other son loves to explore and find new things to do.     All are in my guild ... in which I'm a Guild Officer.     <br />
<br />
It makes for fun Raids when all of us load up accounts ... since we almost have a full group between us ---&gt; 5 PC's online.    Hmmmm I wonder if wifie will let me throw up another PC and account.   Maybe it's time to PL up that Enc.<br />

21% female so far . . . .<br />
<br />
I'm not touching those woodelves anymore. <br />
<br />
It's down to 17% now... worse than that if you discount the ones who are playing with a SO.  Like 7%.<br />
<br />
But look on the bright side, there are 72% unattached men - surely SOME of them are gay...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">no one i know IRL plays anymore they all quit years ago (we all started in P4 beta)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fedayeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I try to play whit my friends, but i live in a different timezone, studying at UnI abroad, so either I have to stay up all night or they have to skip work.<br />
<br />
Girls are more resistant to addictions then us men are I guess, since they dont favor EQ as much...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ex Eq player that lurks in the forums....<br />
<br />
Used to play with my RL brother. Now i play Diablo 2 Single player, we both do actually. EQ is just too.. ehh.. slow? Takes like a minute or 3 to kill a mob, then you gotta rest, theres loading times, etc.<br />
<br />
Well, must go back to my trading (Single player trading ***?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I gots me 1 cousin that plays, 1 RL friend that plays<br />
and the rest are ingame friends/enemies</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Oishii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">just recently started playing together with my RL bf... although i've been trying to quit and him playing all the time isn't helping! ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Akhilles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I refuse to login until they allow me to run my own server. I actually saw a website where someone is re-creating the EQ world.. in Dungeon Siege. /shudder</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't vote though, it never works through the proxy at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I play with my boyfriend although we don't group together since he is a lvl 55 druid and I am a 24 shaman.  It is nice that he looks out for me, buffs me occasionally and looks out for shaman specific equipment when he goes on raids with guild groups.  <br />
<br />
Since my computer is currently set up at his place, it is a great way for us to spend time together that is fun and cheap!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My RL friends no longer play EQ, and, sadly, my family is not into computer games :/<br />

So I, I stand alone ;P</div></div><hr />
