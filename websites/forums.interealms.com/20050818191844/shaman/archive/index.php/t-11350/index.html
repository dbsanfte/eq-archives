<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">has been like that for a while, got me killed a couple of times till I figured it out.  Just yell at the bard (or don't heal him, my prefered insta -solution).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm more worried about trying to toror others in my groups. By<br />
the time torpor finishes, there ain't time to mem and cast another<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ancere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It has always been this way. VERY annoying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's the snare component, so Selo's won't negate it... yes, very normal and annoying.  VI's typical non-fix fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That always drove me nuts. If its any consolation, quiescence is unaffected by selos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its important to educate the bards in your group. I have yet to meet a bard that knew about this effect on torpor. I almost dropped from a group becuase the bard would not stop playing selo's. I ask him if he needed to play it and for him to stop and he just replied that he liked having selos on. <br />
<br />
/smack bard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So that's what it is! I couldn't figure out for the life of me why my torpor wouldnt stick when bards were in the group. Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bard and shaman spell/song stacking is working as intented, unless SOE finds you using it to your advantage, in which case they will fix this bug and claim that they had no idea it had resurfaced in later patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yah gettin bards to not play selos is like putting lipstick on a chicken, hard.  <br />
<br />
Fortunately I no longer have this problem as I acquired Quiescence last night for 50k in bazaar muaahah.  I'd do it again in a friggen heartbeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">why is it the bards problem ya had sow sence lvl 9 group sow from 39  take caure of it your sel keep sow on your self and any one els you want to topar your not worries bout how fast ya move cause if ya were you woundt be casting topar=P<br />
<br />
it would be like a bard joining the group and telling ya not to can because the dont like the sound<br />
<br />
would be a diffrent story we we couldnt do any thing about it sow bounces  Selo's problem solved lest your just lazy if ya have your boots ya dont even have to stop moving to cast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">it would be like a bard joining the group and telling ya not to can because the dont like the sound  <br />
<br />
No its not at all like that!! <br />
<br />
Torpor has saved my butt many many times. When im getting hit by mobs ill just torpor through it and let the tank regain aggro. When everyone is engaged on a mob there is no reason to have selos on. In Fact he should be playing something that will help kill the mobs faster NOT selos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And you should be casting Bhi li on your group so they can kill stuff faster too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A giant says &quot;You will not evade me!&quot;<br />
Your Spirit of Bih Lih fades.<br />
You begin to move quickly.<br />
Casting Torpor, your spell did not take hold.<br />
<br />
Group sow has too short of a duration sometimes.  If it wears off while in a fight (highly likely) you are gonna have problems torporing when bard is singing selos.  Now u gotta stop, mem group sow, and cast before healing anyone with torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For myself, it's not a problem. I now know to click off Selo's. The<br />
problem is if we don't have a cleric and I'm expected to heal. I<br />
can't see, nevermind control weather a dying party member has<br />
Selo's up or not. Unless Bhi li overwrites Selo's (does it? I don't<br />
think so, but I'm not sure), I won't know for 10 seconds weather <br />
Torpor will be blocked or not. <br />
<br />
What exactly does Selo's do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Selo's is the Bard group speed enhancement spell, i.e., Bard's version of SoW.  It is faster than SoW, so you are sometimes unable to overwrite Selo's with SoW or Bih'li.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is level based, but I've had trouble in the past with Bih'li not overwriting Selo's, at least on some group members.  It seems that the pulse hits group members at different times, not all at the same time.  I assume it has something to do with lag or a player's connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Does Selos have an atk buf to it, like Bih li? Does it have a<br />
speed component like Celerity? Or is it purley a run speed buf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It is a run-speed buff.  Period.  That is all it does.  There is NO reason why a bard should be playing that song in a group unless for some inexplicable reason your group is fighting on the move.  <br />
<br />
I guess that could happen, but it seems rather unlikely.<br />
<br />
The bard *should* be playing something USEFUL to the group, like haste song.  Or mana song.  Or anything-but-selos song.<br />
<br />
I realize that I can prevent Selo's from landing on me by sowing myself, or I could consta-sow my entire group to prevent it from landing on them.  Why, though?  The problem is the bard, not the song.<br />
<br />
If I join a group and randomly cast talisman of the tribunal on everyone, even though we are fighting non-casting mobs with no procs then people will ask questions.  Questions like &quot;are you dumb?  we dont need this spell&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, to summarize.  If I see a bard singing selo's, I ask him to stop.  If he doesn't, I boot him and get a bard that wants to work WITH the program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Syren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">First off, unless the bard is under 49, not likely if torpor is an issue, selos lasts 2.5 minutes so they are not missing out on singing needed songs to keep it up.<br />
<br />
Second, it makes pulling much faster, reducing the amount of time your puller is not doing damage or reducing the time the group has nothing to attack.  In both cases, increasing damage output.<br />
<br />
Now if the song is causing problems with your healing, explain it to the bard.  So often minor problems can be solved with a little communication.  Not one way communication either.  Ask why they need to keep it up, often I am asked to by the puller if I am not pulling.  Ask if sow or bih li is enough, usually a bard will enjoy having the extra song slot freed up.<br />
<br />
Make a brief speech in group about making sure to click off selos if you are using torp as your main heal.  Then if it doesn't hit, it's the targets fault.  Or use group sow as someone previously mentioned.  Either way, you can have the bard make a quick 'selos' call in group so everyone knows when it is refreshed.  Really, at 2.5 minutes there is plenty of time between pulses if sow wears off to just click selos off.<br />
<br />
How a group works together is up to the whole group.  The people who say 'He shouldn't use X simply because it interferes with my Y'  are poor group members.  There is usually always a solution that works for everyone.</div></div><hr />
