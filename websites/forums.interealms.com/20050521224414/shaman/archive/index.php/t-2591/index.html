The legendary Nixx from Test Server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contestant number 3<br />

Although Tuda got me interested in Enchanters, an Alt which has now surpassed Faern in Levels.<br />
<br />
Eduin gets my vote.  Test is test in name only. <br />
<br />
Eduin may have been wrong (Although he was right much more often), he may have flown off the handle and insulted people on a message board, but by god he cared.<br />
<br />
I'll take passion, even slightly misguided passion over a laissez-faire attitude.<br />
<br />
As Talamay said &quot;When you understand that people are the way they are, you will get along in life much better.&quot; (Or words to that effect)<br />
<br />
Or as one anon said &quot;Anyone who takes ANYTHING said on a message board seriously and personally has larger issues to deal with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amen.<br />
<br />
1) Eduin  2) Tudamorf  3) Sam (Based on what others have said) 4) Zorlac. (I look for Zorlac posts)</div></div><hr />

Also should have Kazlaaz and Ooga who have been on the top of the end game shaman experience for years. Also can't leave off Swiftraven, winner of the server wide Botb, and Gathu who won the longest Botb match in eq  history :P</div></div><hr />

the guy has been all over usenet and various ezboards (graffe's, safehouse, monkly business) in addition to the crucible.  anyone that frequents any of these for EQ discussions has undoubtedly heard of him.<br />
<br />
stusser isn't too far off for infamy.  nothing against nixx, but i'd never have heard of him if i didn't read this board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go read some of the humour posts from Grun, especially the one where he needed an erudite wizzie to save him from the Hill-Giant he was trying to solo when he rooted himself rather than the mob. OR teaching the guards respek in East Karana,<br />
<br />
Millman should be there also. The drunken shaman.<br />
<br />
Banthar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Some history...<br />
<br />
Three shamans have stood out since the early days of EQ and defined the class in the public arena in various ways.<br />
<br />
One of the first was Tudamorf. Alas he joined the chanter cult quickly when he realized that a lot of what shamans did at the time (pre-Kunark) was bunk, i.e. buffing. He was one of the very few that supplied hard data to destroy a lot of the BS that Verant tried to perpetuate about it's game systems. (Anyone remember his AC/Agility tests, his Strength tests, and later his haste tests that made VI rework a whole section of their game because it was simply bust?)<br />
<br />
He also tried hard to make out shamans to be a generalist class that had a very limited role in the big encounters. He had a point, but he overstated it. People did not forgive him.<br />
<br />
The second was Stusser/Sam (who posted above, /wave Sam). He also showed with hard data that a large percentage of what people *believed* about the game was bunk. <br />
<br />
He also could flame like nobody's business and got caught up with his own personality far too often. His protege, Eduin, took all the best tricks from the Sam repertoire. Both Sam and Eduin tried to close the case on shamans as a class, believing them to be an irrelevance in the top end game. People did not forgive them.<br />
<br />
Which leads to Nixx. The arch-enemy of the above players. He was one of the very few who continued to shout the praises of shamans as a powerful force in spite of a lot of the data the naysayers threw at him. Perhaps his perception was clouded by the different, smaller, and possibly more suiting to shamans, environment of the test server.<br />
<br />
But, whereas Tudamorf, Stusser, Eduin and many others continued to rant about shamans as a broken class in the end game, even after leaving the class for enchanter/druid, necro, and monk respectively, Nixx stayed a shaman through and through. He did stuff that nobody else thought possible. He slayed dragons, soloed crypts, and posted many other feats that pushed the boundary of what being a shaman is all about. <br />
<br />
Because of this, i pick Nixx as the most powerful influence on the class. Others have been more uber. Others have taken the shaman case to VI with more success. Others may even have done some of the things he posted about before he did.<br />
<br />
But, i haven't heard of anyone who has come close to playing a shaman and talking about shamanism with such passion and such success as Nixx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Nixx was a talented player.  Not the best overall shaman IMO.  The absolute best of all time would be Alysheba IMO.  Doesn't post much here but is/was the best I ever knew</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">HAR HAR! Banthar said same thing I did, but we are both from WAY back, July 99 registered, so remember Grun and Mill in their Heyday...<br />
Too bad the board wipe probably got rid of Grun's old stories, they were great....So were Millmans</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">No one will ever come close to Tudamorf. Not only was he right on nearly everything, but he had class and a dry humor. One of the best players and people to play this game overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">don't forget Rorgg, who got alchemy overhauled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Also, nothing against nixx he had his opionions, he was against some changes that we covet today.  Any sort of healing change, he would prolly be against can 5 as he thought can 4 was way overpowered... he was happy with shaman as they were in the kunark era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Tudamorf and Eduin share a trait, which is to never admit being wrong, no matter how ridiculous their arguements become. This is a good trait for being remembered, just not in a positive light, and being infamous tend to outshine being famous.<br />
<br />
Nixx was probably the most outspoke person FOR the shaman class on this board, but his often limited vision(tm) for the shaman class, and self-imposed limitation of only posting on one board sorta kills his chances at this popularity contest.<br />
<br />
The same can be said for Thantu, who's only well known here. The difference is that Thantu deals with OOT issues more so than in-game issues, maybe it's because of less time availible, but this results in never being really popular elsewhere.<br />
<br />
As for the other  names mentioned, most only post on this board, and many has stopped playing and posting for a long time so they are not known by the newer members of the Crucible. They would not win a popularity contest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I believe something we all fail to realize is that Boinshar was the first to POST about soloing Yeldema? He didn''t exactly make an entire thread like Nixx, which is why I'm lead to believe Nixx was credited for it. However he mentioned it in his post where he attempted to kill Von I think? =P<br />
<br />
SEcondly, what about Gathu? Geezus the man won server BoTb, TOT1, ToT3, CASter Royal Rumble? Anyone besides me thinks that's impressive? =\<br />
<br />
The most famous, Nixx because he has the most votes harrr.<br />
That would make him famous right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Nixx was the shaman's shaman, good friend and shaman.  He was one of the most skilled players I've ever had the pleasure to play with.  He was a true legend in his time, and will be missed.  There is no doubt that when I think of shamen, I think Nixx.  Nixx taught me things the shamen class could do that I had never imagined, and got so many positive changes done; he's done more for the class than any single one person.  Nixx would rise to any challenge and solo almost anything.  Truly an amazing person.<br />
