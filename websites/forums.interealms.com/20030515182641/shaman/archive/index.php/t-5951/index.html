<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>searro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone knows if u have to be a certain lvl to turn in scale to obtain epic ?<br />
<br />
Thx in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, unless they changed it, there is none, there was a level one who got to level 14 doing it, and has it (now like level 50 or something)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>searro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok yesterday i got Rak scale ,went to spirit sentinel to turn it and it had been eaten ,telling me something like : how a so young shaman got the hand on this ?  blah blah ....<br />
<br />
I was a bit mad but thought i would share the news ...<br />
<br />
So now i think u have to be around 50 to do it .<br />
<br />
<br />
Searro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ouch... Well I just got my epic on Sat, but I am lvl 51, so I know that lvl works...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well sorry you got your scale eaten but thankyou for reporting back.<br />
<br />
I for one am pleased to see this change. It was something many of us asked for when we saw those screenshots of a very low level character running about with a Spear of Fate.</div></div><hr />
