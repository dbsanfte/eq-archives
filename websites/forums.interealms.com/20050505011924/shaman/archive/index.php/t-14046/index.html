<br />
Thats all the right flags.<br />
<br />
your missing<br />
<br />
Mith Marr<br />
Karana<br />
Grummus<br />
Bertox<br />
Terris Thule<br />
Saryn<br />
Vallon Zek<br />
Rallos Zek<br />
and Solusek Ro if you want into Fire</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The quick answer to this is that to get to tier 4 (elemental planes) you have to kill ALL the tier three gods.  That, plus the fact that you must be flagged for the tier three zones through the normal means, not the sidequests....  It ain't easy.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kazgal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hello again, <br />
<br />
Thanks for the fast responce<br />
<br />
I know i have killed argar (the boss in BoT) and hailed Karana<br />
<br />
I know that i have killed Tallon zek and Vallon and got a flag<br />
<br />
how come they arnt listed?<br />
<br />
These flags are driving me up the wall!<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks Kazgal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taoxek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are you actually flagged for tactics and BoT? If not they may not be showing up till you get those flags. If you are you should ask the seer to unlock some memories. Might fix the missing flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kazgal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh 1 last thing<br />
<br />
Do u need to do the Trials in HoHa and HoHb to get in to the MM temple<br />
the reason i ask this is becouse i was told that u can get in the 15% raid thing to get into MM to recive Elemental flag and not have to do the trials</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kazgal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are you actually flagged for tactics and BoT? If not they may not be showing up till you get those flags. If you are you should ask the seer to unlock some memories. Might fix the missing flags.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes i am flagged for PoT,HOH,BoT,PoV,PoS<br />
and that screenshot is after i did the unlock memories</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You have Tallon Zek.  If you had the Vallon Zek flag, it should show up on your list.<br />
<br />
You also have the Agnarr flag (that's the one that says something about Karana).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that from this point on, even if you kill a boss mob or two, it MAY not show up on your flag list until you have gotten OTHER boss mobs.  That doesn't mean you don't have then.  For instance, if you killed the Keeper of Sorrows and Saryn in Torment, I don't think you'd receive her flag until AFTER you had killed Bertoxxulous.  The flag would still be on your character, but it wouldn't show up until you had killed Bert and gotten your flags straightened out with the Seer in PoK.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh, the MM thing.  Yes, you can get into the raid and get the MM flag with the 15% rule, but you cannot get the MM flag without killing the 3 trials.  I believe you could at one time, but I can confirm that it has been changed.  You will NOT receive the MM flag from the seer without the 3 trials complete.  This has happened to about 5-6 people in my guild.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kazgal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">****! im stuffed!<br />
<br />
<br />
I quit this game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why?  Just complete the quests like your supposed to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">http://www.mysticalorder.org/flagmap.htm<br />
<br />
The above has the most detailed planar flag layout that I've seen.  All your questions can be answered there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The complete list of flags you have to do (excluding hailing all the appropriate mobs) is this:<br />
<br />
-Kill Grummus for flag for CoD<br />
-Complete the Carpin cycle in CoD to become /key'ed for Bertox fight.<br />
-Kill Bertox<br />
<br />
-Do the hedge trial for flag for PoNB<br />
-Kill Terris Thule for flag for PoTorment<br />
-Kill Keeper of Sorrows and Saryn<br />
<br />
-Complete any PoJ trial<br />
-Complete Askr's quest for flag for BoT<br />
-Kill Agnarr<br />
<br />
-Kill Aerin'Dar for flag for HoH<br />
-Complete the 3 trials in HoH for flag for HoHB<br />
-Kill Mith Marr<br />
<br />
-Kill Manaetic Behemoth for flag for PoTactics<br />
-Kill Tallon Zek<br />
-Kill Vallon Zek<br />
<br />
Aside from access to BoT and Agnarr, you need every single other flag in order to be able to enter Temple of Sol Ro Tower zone.<br />
<br />
-Kill Rallos Zek for flag for being able to fight Sol Ro, and gaining flags for PoAir, PoWater, PoEarth<br />
-Kill all 5 minibosses in Sol Ro<br />
-Kill Sol Ro for PoFire<br />
<br />
This is as far as my guild is so far so I don't know what more is required.<br />
There's also an option flag you can get off the dragon in PoI for access to the factory, but you don't need it to progress.<br />
You only need one person to open the door to let you into the factory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Also, completing all 6 trials will flag you for being able to fight The Tribunal, though it's pretty much a concensus that that's a big waste of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Your checklist flags (the ones you got without getting the previous ones first) will not show up until you get all the previous ones.<br />
<br />
For example, MM won't show up until you get all the trials, RZTW won't show up until you get VZ and TZ, and VZ/TZ won't show up until you get RZTW either for that matter I believe.<br />
<br />
Take a look Gemdiver's guide at The Mystical Order that someone gave up above if you're confused. Its all purdy with pictures and everything! He's also pretty consistent in naming the NPC's that you need to talk to for the preflags too.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about things not showing up. I got all my flags out of order and worried too when the seer didn't tell me them, but when I got the last one it all came into place.</div></div><hr />
