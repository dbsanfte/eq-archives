<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After I finally figured out what a JBB is (Jaundiced Bone Bracer for those of you, who like me, didn’t know, but didn’t want to ask either) and made the commitment to level my shaman (after shelving my rogue at 40) I decided I must have one of these wonderful weapons.  I read in the forum here that they usually sell for around 16k.  Now that’s a lot by my standards, I’ve had a hard time hanging on to 1k, but things began to look up when I started selling some leather padding and acrylia in the bazaar.  About that time I started checking the bazaar to see how much they were selling for on my server.  They don’t come up often, and in the last month I’ve only seen two.  The first one was priced at 32k. EEEEEK!  I saw it drop the next day to 28k and then disappear, so it must have sold.  Oh no! 28k!  Now that’s a whole different ballgame. <br />
<br />
Well I pulled myself up by my bootstraps and figured it would take a little longer (twice as long as a matter of fact) but I could do it. Patience, perseverance and a whole lot of leather padding.  Watch out spidies here I come!  In the meantime I kept checking the bazaar and day after day no JBB’s for sale anywhere.  Then last night, what do my astonished eyes behold?  Jaundiced Bone Bracer 60k pp!   OMFG!<br />
<br />
Oh the humanity!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hardiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends heavily on your server.  On Druzzil Ro these go for about 22k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just be patient.<br />
<br />
I went all the way to about 55 without one, and finally landed one for 18k.<br />
<br />
At 55 though it was rather redundant, but nice for just nuking when you are FoM, and have no nukes memmed in a group, or that last bit of damage to help dog dog, without blowng alot of mana.  (Gotta hate those critters that won't run when VERY low, and casting a DoT or nuke will cost 4x as much as the damage its inflicting).<br />
<br />
To be honest, I believe that if you pay more than 20k for this you really pay too much.  I made it a long time without one.  WOudl it have helped in my high 40s?  You bet.  Did I make it through my 40s without one rather quickly?  You bet.<br />
<br />
Oh.  FYI.  I didn't buy mine through the Bazaar, I put a message on the local EZBoard for the server in the WTB section to get one.  Several people contacted me (though the first couple were asking OUTRAGEOUS prices), but it settled down by the 4th seller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm JBB.. just have a look at the cost for our level 60 spells :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">tell vendors in bazaar, and try to discuss the price. Sometimes, you can have a reduction. It's easy to paid the real price on one item, if the trader is not afk :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or wait till you can do Seb. One dropped for us in the Crypt, but I'd had one since 51, so at 59, #2 went to the guild bank :)<br />
<br />
Being a shaman is a very expensive task... Torpor goes for 70k, Malo for 60k, and then there's Pox, Avatar, Khura's Focusing.... you can easily blow 200k on spells alone. <br />
<br />
Sucks, but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've seen them as low as 12k on Druzzil.   I think these days, anything with shaman on it, people believe tens of thousands of plat should be slapped on it. <br />
<br />
I didn't get mine until I was 60.  In all honestly, if you are in a heavy raiding guild and don't have that much time to xp, it's not going to affect you much, by not having a JBB.   263 DD every 8 seconds isn't going to do much, if at all, to even a mid-range boss mob or henchmen.  However, if you solo alot, then it can help, as long as it doesn't get resisted, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Focus on your epic. It does more damage, only takes one long cast instead of 10+. and has much better stats. if you happen to pick up a JBB along the way, cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lorace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The JBB is well worth a lot of cash.  I spent 18k on mine, and probably would have paid twice that and still felt ok about it, if I had to.  <br />
<br />
I spend a lot of time trading, and have found that on most rare and in demand items, like JBB's, people very often will put them in bazaar for outrageous prices for a while, just in case some rich uber-twink comes along looking to buy one quickly at whatever price.  If you work your server's message boards, and regularly check or advertise 'WTB' on your server's main auction chat channel, you will find one for a reasonable price eventually.  It may take some time, but you will find it.  You might even get lucky and find another shaman who has one they are willing to sell cheaply as long as it's to another shaman.<br />
<br />
Don't give up - this is one item that is very worth the trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Syklopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is it the bazaar that really screwed up the price on this thing?  For like the last year on Cazic, it was around only 9-15k at the most.  My friend got lucky and bought one off a friend of his for only 7k.  That guy that had the price up to 60k is smokin crack.  For what I know, the drop rate hasn't changed.  I've even been seeing JB BP's go for less than 30k.  No way in heck the price should be that close for BP to Bracer.</div></div><hr />

Focus on your epic. It does more damage, only takes one long cast instead of 10+. and has much better stats. if you happen to pick up a JBB along the way, cool. <br />
<br />
unless I'm totally mistaken the epic dot is something on the order of 15 DPS, the JBB about 29.  So I'd grab the JBB first.  It is a fun toy, especially in places like Chardok.  Epic is great for soloing where you don't mind the slow damage, and becasue it checks against  MR, allowing you to kill elemental resistant mobs like genoids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While i agree that the epic is overall, far better then the JBB, it doesnt neccesarily &quot;do more damage&quot;.<br />
<br />
In the same time frame, JBB can be cast 8-10 times, and thus do around a 1000 more damage then the epic.  Of course per shot its less damage, but DPS-wise, JBB is better.<br />
<br />
Epic is easy to get though, if you cant get a JBB, get the epic!  Well...get the epic anyway, and make that more of a priority!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I paid 21k a while back, and since then, Ive seen them do nothing but skyrocket.  Why this is happening, I have no idea.  The last one I saw was stuck up in the baz for 30k, and I've seen quite a few around that price.<br />
<br />
Like the previous poster stated, I don't think the drop rate has been altered.<br />
<br />
Just be patient, one will come along for 15-18ish, and you can scoop it up : )  It's a great item, but not class defining, and you won't suffer if it isnt there for ya to click : )<br />

I bought mine on D-Ro for 8k...  Based on the usefullness of the item, drop rate, and similar equipment for other classes I think it should cost no more than 15k.  If you look hard enough you can probably pick one up for that much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got my JBB after I hit 60.  It cost me 25k and is pretty much worth it.  It significantly lessens downtime when soloing.  Also it holds its value during raids especially if you are in a guild with several shaman who are sharing duties.   Before Luclin came out, they were commonly found in the 12-15k range.  Now pretty much not lower than 25k on Xev.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail,<br />
<br />
Paid 18kpp for mine, a long time ago.  Well worth it to me.<br />
I spent two weeks of non-stop searching for it (after several months of casual searching when I didn't have enough cash on hand to be a serious buyer), where the ONLY goal I had every time I logged in was making extra money WHILE searching for a seller.  That was pre-bazaar, back in the ECmart days. :p<br />
<br />
My advice to you:<br />
Post on your server specific message boards.  Post in the buy/sell forum here if you haven't already.  (WTB JBB on server XYZ for thread title, include a price within your thread, and your willingness to negotiate.)<br />
<br />
Network with any friends you might have in a top tier guild.  More and more people are retiring their characters.  Some shaman (Oracles especially, whose need of a JBB is much less than yours) are kinder to those who would *really* benefit and sell at a smaller profit margin (maybe sell for what they paid for it) than if they were selling to some rich Uber person's twink shaman.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you have a shaman mentor or two that has been helping you.  Ask him for help pursuing your purchase.  Many of the Oracles on my server are familiar with each other.  Some are even friends. :p  One has been EXCEEDINGLY generous with helping me filling out my spell book despite my perenially low bank account. ;)  (THANK YOU Glori!!!)<br />
<br />
In the meantime, raise money however you can.  Rathe Mountains, Gornit, whatever.  Padding is definitely a painless (well, okay, boring to the point of being painful) way to make money, but I'd find something you can farm to get cash and exp at the same time to get money.  Hopper pelts in Dawnshroud can be made into padding OR sold for profit by themselves.<br />
<br />
Good luck &amp; don't give up!<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Although the epic may be easy to get, compared to other classes, it is not easier to get than saving up 10-15k, unless you are in a guild that is somewhat high end.  Otherwise, every level 51 shaman you see would be wielding it. <br />
<br />
From personal experience, I know that getting people into Fear is a real pain, and if someone has killed the golems before you get there, you are just outta luck.<br />
<br />
Just keep saving and scanning the bazaar.  You'll run across one in your price range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">they run about 19-20k on quell, found a friend of a friend selling one and got it for 13k. Just stick with it, took me 2 weeks of looking or so before i got what i ended up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got mine for 12k and several hours of PLing alts (ugh, boring but it was him that suggested it).

Mob is at 200 health and starts running, sadly it'll take longer to kill it swinging a weapon (even with haste item &amp; haste spell up) than the 8 second cast of JBB :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Epic can be more dps than jbb depending how you use it.  If you are only fighting one mob at a time then jbb is more dps.  If you are fighting 4 or 5 at a time all with epic dot applied, then epic is more dps.  I have jbb and wouldn't sell it for 50k.  The only problem with using it is you cannot do anything else like rebuffing, pulling or moving.  With epic, you cast it then do whatever you gotta do while it does its business.<br />

Sorry to hijack this thread momentarily, but I had to respond.<br />
<br />
You realize what you are doing to all the shaman on your server, right?<br />
<br />
Other, NON-shaman selling their JBB and other shaman gear will see YOUR prices, and price their own wares accordingly.  Some shaman themselves may alter their pricing to somewhere between your price and the standard price, hoping to undercut you but make more profit than standard pricing schemes. This whole process repeats itself and can artificially inflate the Shaman gear economy for awhile without actually changing the supply of items at all.  Demand is still high, so pricing high means others will too, and some poor 45+ something shaman is going to take it in the shorts to get his/her JBB. :( <br />
<br />
The Uber-twink shaman knows what the going rate for a JBB is, and will likely not pay but a few extra kpp tops for the convenience of &quot;buying it NOW&quot;.  Or want to trade uber gear with an uber friend for one.  Pricing items at double cost isn't doing anyone any favors, and I doubt you'll sell anything at that cost, unless you are selling Malo/Torpor. :p  (Maybe not even Torpor now that Kragg's Mending can be had for 5pp &amp; change.)<br />
<br />
I highly doubt you'll sell items at 2x (or more) standard pricing.<br />
On many servers, there are people who develop reputations for gouging prices on items like this, and it isn't one I'd ever want to have.  Pricing fairly (or even low) may increase your &quot;faction&quot; with other players such that some time down the road you aren't going into hock paying some outrageous price for something YOU want.   I know I keep a list of people I won't do business with because of shady/mercenary trading practices.<br />
<br />
The Golden Rule comes into play here in my opinion.  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.<br />
<br />
That's why I price my extra spells at the lowest (or close to them) advertised in the  bazaar with my Trader Mule.  Extra spells that I have that a friend (or heck, even an acquaintance) could use, I generally GIVE away freely, or at minimum cost.  This has served me well so far.  YMMV.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Aye. Because then people will buy all cheap JBB's, mark them up to 60k, and then the market will be flooded with JBB's at that insane price.<br />
<br />
Be careful screwing with the economy. It comes back and bites you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yes, I've concidered that concern, but then again, I mean I really jack up my prices.  ODS, 3 of them on sale for 18-20k.   Mine on sale for 35k.   Everything I have, I put at the high end range, and then multiplied by two.  I do that during the day when the european players are high on my server and I've gotten a couple sales (JB Boots for 1k I think) and then immediately bought a replacement the next day for like 300pp.  As I stated, my afk message says to inspect me and my character description flat out states everything is double normal cost because it's what I'm wearing for normal gear.<br />
