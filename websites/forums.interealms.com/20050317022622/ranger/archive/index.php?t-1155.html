you can get a netherbian chitin for your bard. it's a AC20 BP with some stats.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velras Thornblade</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest Luclin zones myself. I personally am beginning to believe Kunark zones are seriously overrated for experience especially. The experience on Luclin seems to be much much better.<br />
<br />
At level 22, I'd suggest Pauldron (spelling?) Caverns or Neth Lair. I have a younger SK friend that solos in the Caverns and claims they are killer exp, and I've noticed that loot in Neth Lair is exceptional the times I've passed through.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrchiss</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to chime in with some old world suggestions.<br />
<br />
South Karana is good.  You can do the aviak village or the spires outside of the splitpaw entrance. Or even fear kite elephants.<br />
<br />
Lake Rathe is fun.  There are a whole bunch of spawns near the entrance from South Karana.  Just pull with harmony.<br />
<br />
You can even go into splitpaw with a group and stay near the entrance.<br />
<br />
High Hold Keep is excellent experience if you and your partner can get in a group in the basement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celedor</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paludal Caverns is BEST XP in game at any level, period. Levels 16 to 26 went by in no time at all for my rogue... I also returned 3yellow into lvl 27 and soloed to 28 this morning, cause I couldn't get a group in Marus Seru. Sure, most of the mobs are green or light blue at 27, but the occasional dark blue still give one full blue bub of xp at 27 for a rogue... EXCELLENT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thyramon</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate to sound like a broken record, but hands down gotta go with Paludal Caverns.  Me and a bard partner went from 16 to 25 in a few *HOURS* of playing time.  I've never seen xp like that before, and doubt very seriously that I'll ever see it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spidaaa</div><div class="date">05-04-2002, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">High Hold is a very under used place, at 22 you and your bard partner could get a healer and camp the stairs, at 25 i soloed to LR, train the guards and then kill em as they pop, real easy and guards are close, good luck )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belgaren</div><div class="date">05-04-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I'd suggest Mistmoore.  As dead as the place commonly is on my server, it's great for solo/duo without the constant risk of other people's trains.  Grouping here can be fun too but it's strictly BYOG.  It has some sort of xp modifier (being a dungeon), but you can use SOW &amp; Camo &amp; such.  The entryway is great as early as 22 or so, and as you get tougher eventually you can move on to the graveyard.  Harmony is all you need to keep the spawns there split (great place to learn how to use it right), and the few trains that do go by will rarely path through there.  Oh, and the mobs are fairly rich... esp in the GY (plat loot commonly and lots of FS/Ringmail).</div></div><hr />

You can go to SolA and solo near the entrance and a little bit in.  It's usually empty depending on your server and time you go there.  Plus the SolB and Lavastorm zones are close if you need to run,  Massive exp with dungeon modifier plus good fine steel loot.<br />
