<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading about HS, Seb, Hole, HHK, and Katta but cant make up my mind on were we should go. I dont have JBB, Fungi or Epic.<br />
<br />
HS - None of us ever been there, sounds like a place you die alot in the begining before you learn your way in there.<br />
<br />
Hole - Entrance and to the drop, is it good exp for a 58 lvl? Could I do that place with a 47 monk (alt account and two comp?)<br />
<br />
Seb - Were could we go here?<br />
<br />
HHK - Might go here and do solo until I hit 56 so I can cast Bane and Cel<br />
<br />
Katta - could that be a good place for us?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions, fastest exp possible, going on a hardcore exp drive for 4 days in a row, 15-18 hours gaming per day only exping and want to get the most out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, have you looked into LDC's in SolB, they are pretty decent exp and you will not ever really get trained and if you do well that would be very very scary train...<br />
<br />
Problem in seb would be runners... Never really been to HS but i have heard it is great exp, Never Been to Katta, also heard people rave about that, but mostly abotu the solo exp. And at 55 i found that HHK, while still great exp, slowed down a bit, the bards light blued out and most of the nobles with the occasional solid and issabelle cellus' are blue/light...<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />
