<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem to recall a post that said that &quot;My friends cousins girlfriend heard from a GM that the low teir flags will be done away with&quot;, or something else with that much validity.<br />
<br />
And theres always people asking us bout what kind of spells we want, and or how they can be improved.<br />
<br />
I betcha that they go though find out stuff from the playerbase that way, and ignore what happens when the crap hits the fan after everyone is asked officially what they think.<br />
<br />
So sit back, relax, its a done deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh.  What I wish the Developer's would just say is how they prefer to receive player feedback.  There is /feedback, /bug, and possibly other in game commands.  There are email addresses you can write to.  There is the developer's corner on their webpage.  There are the forums on their webpage.  There are all of the class forums.  There are all of the EQ news site forums.<br />
<br />
At one point or another I have been told that the devs read feedback from all of the above places.  But I've never seen Absor or someone just flat out say:  &quot;If you have a suggestion about how to make EQ a better game, this is the best way to actually make it happen.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree...we NEED to be able to submit feedback (albeit in a calm, rational manner) and get some input.  The old VI boards kinda were that...but the ridiculous masses clamouring for answers spoiled it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone ever looked at DAOC's customer support system?  It's awesome.  They have what are called &quot;team leads.&quot;  There is one of each of the 39 classes, and 1 for tradeskillers.  These are all real live human beings who actually PLAY THE CLASS (holy ****!!!!!) that they are assigned to.  Every time there is a major patch, they write up a team lead report that address the major and minor concerns of their classes.  Most of the TL's are reasonable people, so they have reasonable requests and reasonable solutions.  Each class has its own forum, where people can post questions and suggestions directed at the TL.  And, get this, the TEAM LEAD ACTUALLY RESPONDS DIRECTLY TO THE POSTER. I mean, holy mother of god, is that cool or what?  When I first saw it, I couldn't believe it.  I had been trained by EQ to believe that all MMORPG's have awful, unresponsive customer service, and I couldn't believe my eyes when I actually saw a functioning, interactive, informative system.<br />
<br />
On top of that, they have something called the friday grab bag (www.camelotherald.com) where they post answers to the most commonly asked questions they've received that week.<br />
<br />
Mythic is just trying so goddamn hard to listen to their customers and make the game better - something EQ gave up on a long time ago.<br />
<br />
I just wish mythic's CS department would come to EQ, and we might have a damn good game on our hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, too bad Mythic can't make a game that can even stand up to the shadow of Blackburrow, let alone all of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No offense but DAOC's intense customer feedback could be the reason why the game sucks so badly. Going in 30 different directions at once to please everyone is just asking for trouble.<br />
<br />
There is an interesting line from Mall Rats in response to that old saying &quot;the customer is always right&quot;<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Of course, there are a hundred different opinions on how to fix any given problem in Everquest.  For a game as massive as EQ, I'd expect nothing less.  But that just means the Developers need some sort of filtering system.  Pay some high school kids to sift through all the suggestions, and throw out the ones that look like they were written by a ten year old, or something.  But that's not the point.  The point is SOE (or maybe misinformed people) have made claims to listen to seemingly a million (&lt;-- exageration, don't flame me) different sources, and I don't believe SOE can listen to that many sources.  What I want them to do is pick a source, be it Dev Corner, Class Boards, whatever, and say this is the best place to subit legitimate helpful suggestions for the game.  If they did that, and we shaman had a legitimate complaint about something (like wanting shrink to work TL style) we could all submit it.<br />
<br />
People have suggested this with /feedback for their pet issue in the past, but I've seen no evidence that this works.  I am pretty sure that (at least at one time) the Dev Corner was listened to, because awhile ago I submitted a long post there about quivers, and in the next patch quivers had bow haste.  But no Dev (to my knowledge) has ever been asked this question at a Fan Faire or anything, and so I've never heard an official Dev answer to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been answered concerning problems 2 out of 4 times that I've put up issues there.  I haven't put in suggestions lately, but perhaps now is a really really good time?<br />
<br />
Oh yea, got answered 3 times by Abashi back on the whineplay boards, and I believe once while there was a board that Absor was answering from.<br />
<br />
And due to a comment bout druids and wolf form, and what guards do to stray dogs.........I may have been the reason wolf form was nerfed, that went in patch after i said something.</div></div><hr />
