<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">And so it was, after the fall of Atlantis, and before the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was a time, forgotten by history.  It was a time of blood and fire. A time of great heroes and great deeds as well as great suffering. Perhaps the greatest of these heroes was a barbarian from the icy north...<br />
<br />
oops...wrong story...<br />
<br />
The crier shouted the news thoughout the common areas of Fironia Vie: another raid by these creatures, these juggernauts.  Scores of elfin pilgrims were dead or maimed.  There was severe damage to the outer walls of the outpost but for some unknown reason, the creatures turned and retreated, as suddenly as they had appeared, before the entire outpost lay in ruins.  The elfin warrior, Rizz, wore a grim expression as he strode from the bank to the provisioner. He spied Psyloche, the rogue.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Any word from your contacts in the underworld, as to who could be responsible for this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Psyloche grunted a slighty bovine grunt, and replied &quot; not a peep.  Someone might know something, but they're not saying.  I don't blame em... they're some awfully annoyed people in the Outpost Guard...&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Rizz could reply, the enchantress, Sinfutura rushed up to them,<br />
<br />
&quot; I know the source of the attack! Its some creatures in the depths of the ruins in old Sebilis!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah! Yer daft!  Yer addled by yer magicks! There's naught there but those damnable frogs there! Besides, my sources in the rogues guild would have known- &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sources in thee rogues guild will sell you this information soon enough.  I heard it from a dwarf, o'er in the pub. He claimed to have seen these creatures coming out of the hole.  And the direction they retreated IS in the same direction as the old ruins...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; OK then.  See who we can round up. And lets go investigate this.  Even if it IS a rumour, it bears investigation by the Keepers.&quot;<br />
<br />
At Rizz's words, Psyloche and Sinfutura quickly headed off in different directions, looking for some of their comrades in arms.  Rizz remained thoughtfully looking at some of the damage from the attack before setting off in the direction of the only pub in the outpost.<br />
<br />
                                              *******<br />
<br />
At the call of Rizz and the others, a force assembled at the nexus of power in the Emerald Jungle.  The holy clerics Cshae, Knarlz and Xaryssa.  The Knight Lianna, the ranger Seadin and the master of tranquility, Chmee.  The enchanters Burien and Aquamini.  Psyloche in her full gear of lockpicks, poisons and blades and Ghangus in one of his many disguises made ready for the quest.  The mage Falino and the wizards Adelrune and Jlove.  The power of the forests was represented by Aaeamdar, Moonshae and Zelfani.  The holy shamaness Vhela brought forth her spirit pouch and medicine bag, to cast blessings upon all.  The Bard, Aiela was there to record the deeds in the histories of her profession.  And the warriors, Larain, Noober and Sinsem, in well-oiled armor and gleaming blades.  Circling this hardy band was the barbarian known as Vhelaspet, ostensibly scouting out the area, but really he was trying to avoid the offensive odours issuing from the wood elf contingent.<br />
<br />
&quot;A supposedly advanced race, and they've yet to  learn to bathe in that overgrown treehouse they call a city...&quot;<br />
Wulfran muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush love.  They don't smell that bad.  And they're friends. Come. We're about to set off.&quot; Vhela had come out to collect her wayward and moody bodyguard and companion.<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts.  Come on slow poke or we'll be left behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Realizing his ward would brook no further argument, the barbarian warrior followed his shamanic companion, fondly gazing at her.  He knew his predjudices could be weakness at times, causing strife with potential allies, but he accepted that he was who he was.  He admired Vhela's attempts to temper his weakness to strength.  So like her, always turning adversity into advantage.<br />
<br />
As the two barbarians approached the group, Rizz relayed some final orders and the band set out for Trakanon's Teeth and the ruins of old Sebilis.  The journey lasted a little better than a day.  The party rested a night outside the ruins before they descended into the tunnel that help the lair of the frogloks.  <br />
<br />
Just before dawn, a wolflike howl broke the quiet.  The companions rousted themselves to see Wulfran and Rizz holding off a band of frogloks from the Dar and Bok tribes.  A crackle of energy broke the air and more frogloks from the Krup tribe joined the fray.  Sinsem, Noober, Lianna and Larain charged the newcomers. Chmee and Seadin ran to the aid of Wulfran and Rizz.  The magical energies were quickly coutered by a mass of mana coming from the assembled casters.  Bolts of fire and death rained forth upon the frogloks and most quickly succombed to the assault.  A scant few ran for cover, but few made it, as it seemed the very forrests turned on them at the bidding of the druids.<br />
<br />
The band of adveturers took this assault to mean that their presence wasn't entirely welcome, and decided the best course of action  was to press onward...<br />
<br />
They stealthily crept down the tunnel into the subterranean levels of the old city.  As they arrived at the bridges, a combined group of Zol, Dar and Boks attacked.  They were quickly beaten back, but the last Zol charged Sinsem and bore him backwards off the bridge, into the water below.  After he dispatched the froglok, he found a tunnel, just under the surface of the water, amd cried out his findings to his companions.<br />
<br />
Rizz wasted no time in ordering his troops to go down into the water.  They swam a short distance in the tunnel until they came out into a chamber guarded by Ilis tribe frogloks.  The size of the band took the frogloks by surpise and quickly, several guardposts fell to the rapid assault of the Keepers.<br />
<br />
Soon the frogloks stopped appearing, and in their stead was a horde of the giant mushroom-like Myconids.  They came  upon the Keepers in a mass and almost swept them away. <br />
<br />
Almost.  <br />
<br />
As the line faltered, Rizz gave a mighty cry and surged forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;STAND FAST!!! I'M NOT ABOUT TO DIE TODAY!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Burien cried out,<br />
<br />
&quot;I'VE NOT GIVEN IN TO THAT DORF I'LL NOT GIVE IN TO THESE DAMNED MUSHROOMS!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The line steeled and held.  The tide of myconids broke upon them as the ocean breaks on the rocky shore.  Mages, wizards and enchanters sent spell after spell into the mass.  The druids called upon their arcane powers to seek the aid of the very earth. The holy clerics and shamen cast healing spell in rapid sucession upon the wounded and spells to boost the power of their melee fighters.  And the weapons of the warriors Knight, monk and ranger flashed and struck for the enemy. Until there were no more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don't ask me to make a mushroom soup...&quot; Aiela joked, a tired grin splitting his face.  Dust had combined with sweat and blood to make make muddy streaks on her cheeks and nose.  Her jest  raised the spirits of the band, and the first few chuckles gave forth to a torrent of releived laughter.<br />
<br />
Their laughter was shortlived however.  Ghangus crept back from the depths.<br />
<br />
&quot;The creatures are in there! I saw them! 3 stand guard and I heard more deeper in.&quot;<br />
<br />
The adventurers quickly made ready for their next challenge.  Rizz gave orders silently, using hand signals.  Psyoche, Ghangus and Seadin used missile weapons to quickly take down 2 of the guards, but the third sounded an alarm.  More of the dreaded juggernauts came forth and were slain, but they took their toll on the Keepers of the Elements.  A score had fallen but Rizz saw more coming, and realized his force was spent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizards! Druids! We need to evacuate NOW!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The casters hearing that command, marshalled their magical powers for one last task: to safely get their companions and selves safely away from the battle. The others worked on fighting a rear-guard action, whilst this happened, and soon the magical energies swept the Keepers out of the battlefield known as Sebilis.<br />
<br />
Later, after all had rested, eaten and treated their wounds, Rizz called them together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends.  We fought well on this mission.  We may not have wiped out our enemy, but I know that we hurt them badly enough that they'll not trouble anyone else soon.  And mayhap before they are ready, we can go back and finish what we have started on this day...&quot;<br />
<br />
The cries of agreement quickly drowned out the rest of Rizz's speech and KOE drank and planned their next assault.<br />
<br />
          *******<br />
<br />
<br />
OK this has a LOT of artistic liberties taken with it, but its pretty much in line with our Seb raid on Wed Night.  If I missed anyone, I apologize.  I had a blast, and regret that that one bastage got away from us and trained in the others.  I am eager to head back there again however!!!</div></div><hr />
