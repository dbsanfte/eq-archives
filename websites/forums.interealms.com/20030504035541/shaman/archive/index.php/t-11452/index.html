<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, as a lv65 spell, the ultimate dot for shaman, shouldnt this be a LURE based spell?  Like -1000 to PR check.   Its a curse, it should  be a unresistable curse, it generates insane argo as it is.  Even without the DD component, its still resisted way too much on monsters, and even in PvP against NAKEDS of equal level with 0 resist buffs after MALOS.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, but throw us one bone verant, bad enough our 63-64 spell turn ins are around 50 % on getting a good spell, at least make the rune turn in be LURE.  <br />
<br />
You gave enchanters a mana dot, that steals mana over time, which should be in line with shaman being able to curse your mind as well as your health, at least make our 'Ultimate' dot lure based.<br />
<br />
You gave us feral avatar, which is junk (primal avatar)<br />
You gave us quiescience (great but needed 600 a tick NOT 300)<br />
You gave us focus of the 7th, lasts half as long for 100 more hp roughly<br />
You gave us malos, -10 more off, wow.<br />
And now blood of saryn, great you removed DD component, but please make it -1000 to poison check!!!  MAKE SHAMAN useful in PvP/group wars again please.<br />

<br />
The fact that tash is unresistable has absolutely nothing to do with the amount of aggro it causes. The reason for the high aggro from tash is 1) it's a debuff, and 2) it has poison counters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check my profile Litgruv, the mace I wield procs Theft of Thought, an enchanter spell that STEALS 400 mana from target.  Given, this is nerfed somewhat against lvl 60 NPCs and above, but against any other caster, PvP or otherwise, it steals the dam mana and is a lure.  <br />
Point is . . . be careful what you say.  Today's gospel can be tomorrow's debunked dogma.</div></div><hr />

it just hapends to stack with other classes lore spell's<br />
<br />
sure it would be nice to have a bit of a lore on some of our spells<br />
but as it stands now in a solo situation our spells land about the same may be a bit less after MALO then any other class the only differance is we pay for it in mana  and time were other classes dont.<br />
<br />
i would like to see the cost of our spells come down a bit more to put them in perspective with other classes espcialy our 2k heal witch im glad i have but IMO is a joke to cost the same mana but heal much less then druid's.<br />

but even in the end in a nice group with KEI horse PO9  bard beast lord crack and canni5 i dont go OOM verry often any way</div></div><hr />

hehe our epic is nowhere even close to being Lure based :)<br />

I get quite a bit of resists with it, including on green &amp; light blue mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Blood of saryn should be made lure!<br />
<br />
I am a Shaman, I should have some ability to attack with a feared offense that is unresistable, regardless if its PvP or PvE, end game people got 200+ to resists.  Wizards get manaburn, necros get lifeburn, SKs get harmtouch, wizards get lures, enchanters get rapture, every single class gets a kill aa and/or ability.  Malo/Malos/Malicious Decay does not cut it unless you go to kill someone with sub-par gear and I do not know many with sub-par 65 pr at lv60+.<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryn is NOT LURE/UNRESISTABLE, people that do not have it think this.  You take it into a pvp or pvm enviroment and you will find this out.  It still checks resist.  Cast it on a naked pc after malos and it STILL is resisted 2x.  <br />
<br />
I mean come on, if you think malos is all that you need to relook at what its casting time is, 5 seconds.  In 5 seconds another PC or Mob can lure you/shock you/stun you/bash you/etc...  Its too slow, and even IF it sticks, most of the time Blood of saryn is resisted at a low 65 PR  thats RIGHT!!!  Sixty-five, 6-5, 65 poison resist!!!<br />
<br />
Come on now, its level 65, its ultimate, its 00ber, right???<br />
<br />
I am asking why the shaman community just cries over str/dex line spells and replace them, WITH WHAT?  More useless spells, hell verant cannot even think up new ideas, just toss +10 here on a buff or +100 hp more ie:no creativity.<br />
<br />
Try a red server for a change and make the game exciting, unless you like to be bored on a blue where you have to <br />
<br />
a)schedule a spawn time LOL, <br />
2) play nice PC policy and kiss your other players ass instead of handing it to them over a spawn or rare mob<br />
3) like being made a slave to a 00ber guild who forces you to do things or get booted instead of things you like.  Please.<br />
<br />
Make this Lure.  Rabid bear is not offense, sorry.  Spirit call is not offense.  VP sticks maybe half the time, sometimes less even after MD.   I mean affliction focus was nerfed hard, whats left for them to nerf?  We cried for dd component to be removed from our 00ber dots, and they did, why not for at least one thats lure?  I mean our dots are supposed to be the strongest in the game, right??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually Braxton, if our spear DOT isn't lure, it's as close to lure as you can get without being lure. I am always amazed when it's actually resisted. I actually test mobs to see if their magic immune with it. <br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the topic at hand, I would rather see the aggro decreased on Blood rather than have it be lure. We can use malo(s)/malosini(a) if we get too many resists. As far as PvP maybe you guys can campaign for something to help you all out, I would hate to PvP as a Shaman now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I really don't understand the people who say the aggro on the poison dots is ok as is. I don't cast them unless 1) I am soloing, or 2) I am casting it on something I'm not afraid to tank for a bit.<br />
<br />
I don't cast them with a Warrior tanking unless I can tank it myself. Most Warriors don't have those totally insane aggro weapons some of you uber guilded people might be spoiled with. The Knights do a lot better, but even then, it's a risk. <br />
<br />
For those who just say &quot;well root the mob&quot; yeah, I do. Though root tends to break an awful lot when a mob is in a group via nukes if you haven't forgotten :p. So I really don't get where the aggro isn't a big deal for some of you. <br />
<br />
The whole &quot;dot aggro&quot; seems to be vary greatly on each Shamans &quot;priority of class balance issues&quot; though. But I don't understand how it isn't a problem. They don't seem all that special anymore if I must resort to using them as mainly a soloing tool. <br />
<br />
But they can leave all our damage spells totally alone for all I care anymore, long as they hand us a few things that are more &quot;unique&quot; to the class. Not to mention something on the verge of halfway fun. Doting was never fun, just made me feel l was doing something more then saving the Chanters mana on slows. <br />
<br />
I'm guessing they may never fix this issue due to the &quot;potential damage&quot; we would do, via poison dots and ice based nukes. Which is fine, but stop ignoring the class for other things if that is SoE's current thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The spear was near lure back before the resist overhaul.  Now it is a simple normal magic based spell.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Blood of saryn should be friggin -1203021 resist.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to kill people you should have played an offensive pvp class.  You played a priest which you probably noticed are the least offensive pvp classes.<br />
<br />
Blood of saryn really should be -20 or -50 resist but asking for it to be lure (-300 I believe) or the goofy idiot idea of -1000 is simply dumb and hurts the cause of the shaman more than it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The nukes are far from impressive better than ours and clerics but still worthless.<br />
<br />
The dot, while -100 resist, is still a joke as far as damage goes.<br />
I'm sure the developers would be willing to cut Blood of saryn down to 1200 or so damage and give it -100 resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">We were quite powerful, before aa's and new DT abilities were introduced.  As a shaman we should be the most offensive of all the priest classes, right?  A primitve healer/warrior that leads his tribe.  Clerics now melee better then us with hammer line, which is good for them, because god its boring being a cleric.<br />
<br />
As far as a druid in PvP, its horrid to be one.  Around lv54-55 its great, past that, its horrid.<br />
<br />
I just feel if we are going to have some class defining abilities that no other class should have, just exactly what is it?  Lets see a minor list:<br />
<br />
Druids can buff hp as well as can clerics  (ok we buff stm but most MT have stm items already or it near max)<br />
<br />
Enchanters can slow, and get rune shields, as well as cheap tash line.  Can cripple as well.<br />
<br />
Druids heal better then us, peroid.<br />
<br />
Clerics melee better then us now.<br />
<br />
So we are left with cann/mana regeneration as our class defining ability, which is good. <br />
<br />
We can malo/malos.  At a slow cast time, no aa's to even speed this bugger up.  It would rock if malos was the same speed as malicious decay, then it would be useful.  <br />
<br />
But I rather see even a -300 modifier on it to poison checks as a HUGE benefit to this shaman.  <br />
<br />
At least they are trying to get a clue, I think.  Too bad they do not read these boards often from what I have seen.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, did you take a look at the new Druid DoT ?<br />
<br />
I'd take that over Blood of Saryrn any day of the week. And if i was playing on a PvP server i'd trade my whole poison line for that single DoT.<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3446&amp;source=Live <br />
And how do you like this nuke(1 of many they have) with a ratio better than Blood of Saryrn(with SCF+)and instant ?<br />
 http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2126&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
But hey, i can slow them in order to make my healing as efficient as theirs...erm wait...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">A Zek shaman fix my assumptions if they are incorrect.<br />
<br />
A dot that is going to take 20+ ticks to kill someone is a complete joke.  All dots are jokes.  Even if saryn had a -300 resist, shaman couldnt kill anyone unless they sat around waiting to die.<br />
<br />
Druid nukes are also a joke as far as PvP goes.  Honestly, any spell with a resist check of 0 is a joke in the long run.  A shaman/cleric/paladin/necromancer/druid could simply sit there and heal every few nukes until the druid is oom.<br />
<br />
The issues are not that PvP shaman are underpowered.  The issue is that dots suck ass (read the other thread about dots, it's headed in the right direction).  Unfortunately I've never done research on it and I'm not wasting my time on it but I believe our spells take longer to cast than every other class.  It's an old (outdated) way to keep a shaman in line because of their mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
Should we have an offensive weapon with a decent -resist, probably yes.  Is it a major issue for non-PvP servers, no.  PvP only problem means it really will never be looked at.  The people running the game right now simply have no clue about anything anymore.  Absor or whoever the hell is the current Propaganda Monkey needs to get involved with those who actually play the game and my apologies, this does not include people still playing in old expansions even though those also need tweaking (and yes, this includes limited PvP fixes that would not affect gameplay that much, like a -50 or 100 to shaman endgame dots). The resist would barely be a blip on blue servers but would at least keep people from laughing at the offensive ability of a shaman.<br />
<br />
In closing, I'd love to see a -50 resist check.  I'd also love to see dots not suck when compared with what they were pre-kunark compared to the nukes of each class.  Neither will happen though as the 10000 monkeys will never get the right solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>mediman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Druids rock in  pvp.  They are fastest class other than bards or someone on a horse.   They have can debuff fr so their nukes can land.  They have more than one fast acting dot line ( fire and wing death).  They have good AA's for pvp.   Wrath of the wild gives a single hit ds, at max thats like 600 i believe.   They get instant evac for when **** hits the fan and they gotta get out.   They have good DS otherwise.  Oh yeah they can track people.  Point is druids get kills.   As a shaman i am very good in pvp with any other person along with me, but it is next to impossible to get a kill shot on someone unless they have absolutely no skills or crap gear.   I only kill people who dont know how to run away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Beomahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">IMO Saryn shouldn't be lure, but the 65 necro poison dot is very similar to saryn (little more damage) but has a -50 resist check.  We've supposed to been better at dots then necros as far as I can remember, but their 65 inches us out.  I'd be happy if saryn stayed as it was but also gained a -50 resist check.  Might be pushing it too, but breath of ultor could use this too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Poison DoTs have ALWAYS been high agro. If you don't want agro, stop poisoning the damn mob :rolleyes: Disease DoTs work great for boss mobs, use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Poison DoTs have always had high aggro... yep.  And IMO they've always been broken due to overly high aggro.  My guess is that this is mainly due to Tash adding poison counters.  If the poison counter aggro were reduced to a reasonable level for SHM poison DoTs then it would make Tash a no brainer spell to just cast at will on INC.  As is, an ENC has to be semi-awake and know when to cast Tash to avoid pulling aggro.<br />
<br />
IMO, Blood of Saryn should be a slightly higher powered version of Blood of Thule, however the opposite is true.  Necro Blood costs 35 less mana, does 15/tick more DPS, casts ever so slightly faster (5.0 vs 5.7), and has a -50 resist adjust.  Looking at progression of PR DoTs, Necros always lagged slightly behind SHM in potency but had a wider variety of DoTs that gave them the edge.  They've maintained the wider variety and their spot as top dog of the DoT classes which is fine and as it should be, meanwhile Shaman were left behind in the one DoT area we excelled in previously.<br />
<br />
Leave the nasty aggro on Blood, that's fine... but make it more damaging to balance it out.  -50 adjust and up Damage per tick to 375/tick to put shaman clearly back on top of the PR DoT scene.  It would still be situational due to aggro, but when you got that aggro it would at least be reassuring to know that it was because you just cast the meanest DoT in game on the mob. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Its not the meanest dot in the game, necros get a similar one to ours at lv61, and its only 200 damage less from lucy.<br />
<br />
It needs a resist adjustment -50 or -100 at least, and less argo on the poison counters, cast it 3x on a mob, doing max damage each time IF you get no resists and you still get 'you have been summoned'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Finally got the dot and I have been playing around with it.<br />
<br />
Gets resisted more then I thought it would. Cast malo and it lands but why do i have to cast malo + dot on xp mobs?<br />
<br />
Generates lots of aggro. I dont know why a wizzie can crit for 6000 and I dot (and did not slow another shaman did) and I take aggro.  Glad I can take a pounding.<br />
<br />
People were right about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Fayclopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">It was mentioned earlier...but I think this is just part of the &quot;class balance&quot;. Shaman spells in general cost more mana, have longer cast times, and get resisted more often than all other classes. Oh yeah and our buffs last less time also. No other buff takes as long as group focus to cast. Also most other classes didn't get their buff durations nerfed with PoP like shamans did. Druid 61+ seasons buff lasts the same amount of time as the lvl 58 one...but shaman PR/DR buff has half or less the duration. New focus is 20min shorter....but virtue is the same as aego, PoT9 is the same I think as PoTG. Chanters got the nerf on c3, but I think there is different reasoning behind that. They don't want chanters making so much money off of it. <br />
<br />
This is to make up for the massive mana regen we have through cannibalize+torpor and can5. They want us to spend more mana on buffs, more mana on getting resisted. Same thing with the exp penalty on iksar and trolls...we regen faster so we take a exp hit. I remember one of the Sony people saying that balance is not a zero-sum game but they certainly don't show that. I have a 61 druid also...the druid can do so much more with his mana, it's just that he goes oom and my shaman doesn't. His heals heal more hp for the same mana, nukes do more damage, spells stick more often.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The bounce rate is still quite varied with BoS, sometimes it lands, sometimes it does not.  I will feedback this issue everyday.  At least a neg 100 check applied to it would be strong.</div></div><hr />
