<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Also , anyone know where to get &quot;geerlok alchemy set&quot;  ? has a alchemy mod on it , i think its LoY<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
i notice alot of geerlok tinkering devices , i think its player made but no confirmation yet and no recipe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lit, Alchemy scales 5 points per level beyond 60 (185 at 61, etc).<br />
<br />
Bits for the geerlok alchemy thingy are sold in Gunthak.  Dunno if any are dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there is 1 droppable component... it's some root ... drops in the caves in gunthak.  a tinkering friend of a friend was down there for an hour and got 2 roots, so i bought him bolts and stuff in order to make 2 of them plus a stack of perls (he s a mage) and he did the combine for me.<br />
<br />
difficulty:  <br />
easy if you have a tinkering friend<br />
                <br />
expensive, but not too time cosuming if you dont have one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">damn , after all the work , 175-180 was rough , i was so happy i was done lol. ahh well 180 isnt bad for now , with that mod tool im sure ill have  high succes rate illusion potions and group shrinks.<br />
