<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Guys,<br />
<br />
this is my first post in this forum, although i've been lurking around quite a bit :)<br />
<br />
So im going to introduce myself first, i play Jorlaf, a lvl 51 Barbarian Shaman on Solusek Ro server.<br />
<br />
Today i made an attempt at Yeldema, had quite some trouble but was successful! Only to find that i had forgotten to turn /log on.<br />
<br />
I tried it again a few hours later, and in a much smoother fight (resist wise) i was able to kill  Yeldema again.<br />
<br />
In the first fight i had to kite quite a bit before i could land root / malosi.<br />
<br />
I realize that my success was based on the buffs i had on me, but nevertheless i think 51 is probably lowest lvl one could solo Yeld, *might* be able to do it at 49, but resists would be much worse and you would lack Turgur's.<br />
<br />
My Buffs were: Tranquility, PotC, Focus of Soul, Symbol of Marzin, Shield of Words, Replenishment, Horse, Agi of Wrulan, Endurance of the Boar, Acumen, SoW.<br />
<br />
Pet Buffs: Celerity, Focus of Soul, Replenishment.<br />
<br />
My Equip: www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=534044<br />
<br />
I originally planned to use pet to soak up some dmg from time to time, but it never came to take any dmg besides rampage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">she didnt drop her talisman?<br />
Grats by the way, very impressive without Krags.  Thats some nice gear for level 51 as well.  Did you delevel to 51?  Seeing as how you have class AA abilities in your magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">She didn't drop her Talisman in both kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh i used my *dream magelo* and edited it to show Jorlaf's current gear and lvl, forgot to delete the AA's.<br />
<br />
I got zero AA points so far, ding'ed 51 today :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going to try this soon without external buffs.  Also get canni2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, IMO that is very impressive indeed.  Congrats!  :D <br />
<br />
Just a quick question, how are you wearing items with lvl restrictions higher than 51?  Your shoulder item says 56, and circled toe bones 53.  Been thinking of getting one of the toe bone rings myself, but was not sure whether it was one of those items you can wear before the req. lvl with reduced stats, or like stuff from CT which cant be equipped at all.<br />
<br />
Tempted to try this myself now, tho Im sure it will be suicidal hehe.  Think I will try with just KEI and PotC first of all, to test the water.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I see no melee from you in there, did your pet stay alive throughout the fight?<br />
<br />
Does she summon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The items i have with lvl restrictions are flagged with *recommended* lvl of 53 and 56, you can equip those items at lower lvl, but the stats scale according to your lvl. (so at lvl 51 the items have like 80 to 90% of their stats).<br />
<br />
For the Yeldema fight i used a friend's Obulus Death Shroud.<br />
<br />
Items you cannot equip due to lvl restrictions have *required* lvl of X.<br />
<br />
I did not melee because that would negate the horse benefits. Also my pet stayed alive during the entire fight, basically not damaged. I debuffed Yeldema with Incapacitate and she hardly rampaged.<br />
<br />
Yeldema is like lvl 53 and summons.<br />
<br />
The trick is not to send pet in and kite Yeldema until malosi and slow is on. Don't canni or melee (unless you lack a horse), just use clickers, rely on your passive mana regen only use mana for heals and debuffs.<br />
<br />
Use the steep walls to cast spells on her (mobs run down walls very slow, so you have time to cast). On flat terrain she has sow speed.<br />
<br />
Good Luck with her, at 51 it's not easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Holy crap<br />
<br />
Isn't she 53?  You did it at 51?<br />
<br />
Damn, I'd love to try this.  I don't have a fancy spear though, does that make that much of a difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think epic helps alot. I only used no mana dmg to kill her (except pet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Where did you pull her to?<br />
<br />
Everytime I tried it in the past, I got adds out the butt.  I was pulling her about 200 feet to the ledge by the water, is there a better place to put her?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am just amazed that you could cast superior healing for 20 minutes straight without canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From Yeldema's nest go straight for the cliff (western direction? not sure), down is a little flat spot, that's where i fought her.<br />
<br />
Its not a 100% safe spot, roamers can come from south along the cliff, but it doesnt happen often.<br />
<br />
I used fungi (15 hp regen) and replenishment (25 hp regen) for hit point recovery, tranquility (16 mana regen) and potc (6 mana regen) as well as horse for mana recovery.<br />
<br />
If Yeldema's health bar is moving down faster than your mana bar, you're going to win.<br />
<br />
Root her when she runs (her fleeing rute is up the wall into possible roamers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Didnt see slow interupted resisted or land on. The first or was it second cast can you explain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If the mob is higher than you (z-axis), your spell messages arent displayed, yet still land if you dont get a resist or interrupt message.<br />
<br />
The place i fought her is a small ledge at the bottom of a very steep wall. When the first slow was resisted i jumped down the wall and casted the second one, which landed when she was still too high to get the message displayed.</div></div><hr />

[Sun Jan 05 23:23:22 2003] Celerity <br />
[Sun Jan 05 23:23:22 2003] Replenishment <br />
[Sun Jan 05 23:23:22 2003] Focus of Soul <br />
<br />
at 51 only celerity is a spell we can use. replenishment is 61 and focus of soul is 61 as well or 62, did you get outside buffs? or is the log wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">He listed the outside buffs he had.  C5, POTG, REPLEN, etc.  He had quite a few.  Still, even with those buffs, its still an accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't use celerity at 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">On a minor note, I doubt turgurs at 51 is a lot better than torgors at 50.<br />
<br />
What would make this harder for a level 50 would be the lack of superior heal if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />
