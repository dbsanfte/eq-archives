After today's patch it has no graphic at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They need to up the HP and Mana on it still, and give it a Parry or DW mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vann</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats a upgrade but imo a very mighty gay weapon compared to the upgrade warriors got with the 15% riposte mod and enraging blow. and the rogue dagger. *** does verant have against rangers? I think this weapon should be on par with those. give us some innate attack on it or something. mighty gay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razumihin</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, last two days it's been upgraded. Somehow I doubt when I log on tomorrow it will be on par with the other weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They want to give us weapons to go with our striped pajamas.  That why they can look at us and say, &quot;they ain't ranjahs, they CLOWNS!  Blahar!&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard they changed the graphic on rubicite chain boots to floppy red shoes.:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kinkia</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me, this really only says one thing. The equipment gap between tier one(no competition for drops live in Ssra) and tier two(high competition for all raids, NToV, never got a chance at warders, people who can take AoW but it's always close) guilds has gotten way too huge. <br />
<br />
It boggles my mind that people whine about how terrible a 16/20 25ac FTIV +stats weapon is when most Warders, even those who take some big targets, still run at the good old 14/24 due to lack of options and more competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xequecal</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">15% Riposte mod? I seem to recall a post by Furor bitching about how this weapon's new 3% Riposte mod would only increase his ripostes from 5.09% to 5.10%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree kinkia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vann</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Kinkia, I don't honestly think you know what you are saying. Sure its a good weapon. Not the best but good. But when you compare it to the other class specific weapons we are getting screwed. Now unless you like having Verant say hey we think rogues and warriors are far more special than rangers then go ahead and keep making dumb comments like that. I put as much time into my guild getting to this level and killing cursed etc. And I'll be damned if VI thinks we should take a backseat to another class in terms of loot. I really think the design team at VI needs to learn how to do their job a bit more effectively cause currently they stink more than my laundry basket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kinkia</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I know what you're saying. Just like so many other drops: What Rangers get is not as good as what other classes get. Certainly not matching the Rogues 16dmg +mod backstab piercers..<br />
<br />
What I am saying is that if you took a second to campair this to other Ranger weapons, and the severe lack of thm just one step below your uberness, perhaps you'd realize just how good this is. <br />
<br />
I think that if Verant should do anything, it should make these tradeable. It's clear tier 1 has an over abundance of incredible weapons, and I doubt you would use this over say our new 12/16.</div></div><hr />
