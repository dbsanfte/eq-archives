<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking at a few recent discussion I would like to add my 2 cents to the discussion about a can VI spell.<br />
<br />
Like many I do not feel the need for carpal tunnel syndrome and so I would like a Can that is less clicks, but still gives a decent amount of mana back.<br />
So I think we need some form of mana over time (MoT) spell<br />
<br />
My idea would be something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
Slot	Description<br />
1: 	Decrease Hitpoints by 600 per tick<br />
2: 	Increase Mana by 200 per tick<br />
<br />
 <br />
Mana:	0	<br />
Skill:	Alteration<br />
Casting Time:	3.0	<br />
Recast Time:	30<br />
Fizzle Time:	2.5	<br />
Range:	0<br />
Location:	Any	<br />
Time of Day:	Any<br />
Fizzle Adj	0	<br />
Deletable:	No<br />
Interruptable:	Yes	T<br />
arget Type:	Self<br />
Spell Type:	Beneficial	<br />
 <br />
Classes:	SHM/65<br />
Duration:	4 ticks<br />
<br />
<br />
This spell would also have to block can, can II, can III and can IV casting else it would be way to powerfull.<br />
The recast time is 1 tick higher then the duration so it would not possible to keep it up at all times but maybe this should be longer then 1 tick.<br />
<br />
The general idea is to give us a short duration “buff” that converts hp to mana at a less then optimal ratio but that in return frees you from the chain clicking.<br />
Maybe the hp and/or mana ratios need some tweaking, maybe the duration should be longer or shorter and maybe the recast time need some work but it is the idea that I like.<br />
<br />
I hope some input will follow and I really hope this is something SoE would consider as for me it would be a nice addition to our spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What can I say, I'd ****ing love this spell. It's just that I am way too pessimistic at this point to express any kind of optimism or enthusiasm towards your suggestion.<br />
<br />
They won't do **** for us. They won't get my money though either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you talking along the lines of a clarity type of spell for shamans? A self only buff of some kind would be great. I sure wouldn't turn it down. Maybe for balance have it so it won't stack with C3 C4 or C5. It would be very useful in situations where an enchanter is not around to buff ya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea was actually an automated Can IV spell that trades efficienty for mana ratio.<br />
That is why I believe the can Line (excluding the AA can V) should not stack with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Styg is talking of a Canni over Time spell. Howevere, I don't think it's possible to code it so, that Canni I-IV won't &quot;stack&quot; with it, since it doesn't leave an icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, this is the necro lich line, and no, I don't think there's any chance we'll get it.  I think they did a GOOD thing with canni5, and I wish they'd just continue down that road - hell, just make canni5 recycle faster with an AA and I'd probably buy this idiotic expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I posted this exact same idea (though without the specifics) on a different thread regarding our spell updates.  Everyone seemed to have the same response that they do here...<br />
Would be a PITA to code, so SOE would probably be way too lazy to make it not stack with other forms of canni.<br />
Plus, it would actually be a helpful spell.  This alone means we'll never see it, unless it's up for 2 days on lucy just for SOE to tweak down to useless crap, and then delete, so to pour a little more salt on the already existing wound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2 min canni V would be absolutely great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This spell would be great - though I'm not sure SOE envisions us getting back 200 mana a tick in addition to Cann5. However, the idea is fundamentally sound. Let's face it, the pacing of EQ has changed tremendously with PoP and LDoN. Passive mana regen is now FAR FAR better than active regen. Plus, I'm sick of mashing my Cann4 hotkey 1000 times a night.<br />
<br />
There are several ways to address this:<br />
<br />
1) Mana over time, as described. I don't know that I'd stay with the suggested efficiency ratio or mana generation rate, but something along these lines would make a big difference.<br />
<br />
2) A high damage Canni with a long recast time (30 sec or so). This could also leave a recourse icon to prevent Cann1-4 from stacking with it.<br />
<br />
3) An AA version of either of the above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any of these options would go a long way towards reducing tedium. I don't know why everyone thinks SOE can't implement this... it's more like they won't. Modrods don't leave an icon, yet they have a reuse time attached to them - does the recast time go away if you get a brand new modrod? I haven't tested this, but I think the reuse timer is persistent with your character, not with the rod itself. Same thing with the Donal's BP... leaves an icon, won't allow another Donal's CH to land until it wears off. This suggests to me that it is at least possible to create a circumstance where spells that lack an icon can prevented from stacking. Maybe this is an item-dependent phenomenon, but at least it holds out some hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shammy version of necro lich type spells. It's entirely possible to do, and blocking the other canni spells shouldn't be that difficult. Just like how a necro can't stack their lich's. Would almost be a cut and paste, and some number fiddling.<br />
<br />
Always agreed this is a great idea. And always figured it would be overlooked, or ignored outright.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oddly enuff im a fan of constanlty canni'ing.  It helped me quit smoking hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still don't understand why they can't make an aa that lowers the recast time on Canni 5<br />
<br />
Makes sense and would be easy to impliment.<br />
<br />
Reduce reuse timer by 10% for every rank<br />
<br />
3 Ranks<br />
<br />
3 aa per rank<br />
<br />
<br />
My biggest pet peeve is that BL's get a passive mana and hp regen ability that can be cast on others, add to that list druids and enchanters - while ours is self only.<br />
<br />
But thats another topic and I don't want to get started hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shantan Maverick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is a cool idea.  Although I don't think they'll ever give us what is essentially a lich spell, it could be done like this:<br />
<br />
They could call the spell Injured Bear.  Conversion would be about the same ratio as other canni spells but more hp/mana than CanniIV, probably something like 225hp/125mana.  Now, instead of being just a crappy upgrade to CanniIV, they could put Illusion bear on it and have it make you do a failed fd (like the spiders proc on you in PoNightmare, with the &quot;You have fallen to the ground&quot; message).  Mobs see through failed fd's so you couldn't use it to get out of trouble.  The fd component makes it so you can't move or cast, and you don't get sitting hp or mana regen rates while fd, also the illusion blocks you from being able to do it on a horse.  <br />
<br />
This would be a good substitute for a horse in LDoN adventures or any other indoor zone.  The fd component makes it so that you can't cast any form of canni (or any other spell for that matter) while you're using this spell.  I haven't really thought about the duration or recast time, but with all these detriments I can't think of a reason off hand for why it shouldn't last indefinitely and have a quick cast/recast time.</div></div><hr />
