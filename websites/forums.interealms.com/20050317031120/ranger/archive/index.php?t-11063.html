EQAtlas (http://www.eqatlas.com) updated it's map of CT after the revamp.  Most of the important spawns are noted, such as Toxiferious, Blob, Mosquitos, etc.<br />
<br />
As for forces.  A solid 55+ group can do the entrance or maze (chanter 58+ is a must, or a VERY good puller).  If most of your force is 60ish, it makes things pretty routine compared to any other dungeon-crawl type place (think SolB where things hit for 400).<br />
<br />
The lizards here have quite a few HP; it's a &quot;Luclin&quot; zone, high AC, high HP, annoying AEs.  Bane of Thule, or something, is an AE DoT/Slow; it can be cured with a single Counteract Disease or Poison, I think, or maybe two casts.<br />
<br />
Blood is pretty common.  You can do the entry courtyard and get quite a few blood vials.  It's very common in 4C (the pyarmid to the north of the maze, with the Thul Tae Ew that can drop the fleshgrinder).</div></div><hr />
