<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe I am being petty or something - but I would like to know why every new class that has been added has had the &quot;shamanic&quot; races as their racial choices, and likewise why every new race that has been added has Shaman as a playable class?<br />
<br />
Beastlord / Berzerker have practically the same race choices as shaman<br />
<br />
Iksar / Vah Shir / Froglok are all races that can be shaman<br />
<br />
How about making a new class for the damn elves to play? How about making a new race that likes to be druids and rangers or something?<br />
<br />
Why do I care?<br />
<br />
I would just assume let some other race and class have to endure all of the new and garish looking twinks running around and generally giving the longtime players a bad name.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I am still pissed that there are Shamans in Grobb (where I started), but they are not trolls now. They are my hated and despised enemy from level 1 - Frogloks.<br />
<br />
Why not let the Brownies take over Kelethim next? Please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman originally had the most limited race choices (Barbarian, Ogre, Troll) so adding a few more is fine.  Beastlord/Berzerker having the same race choices as shaman just fits in with the lore of those races better than others.  Having a High Elf Berzerker, or Erudite/Wood Elf/Halfing/Gnome just doesn't make sense, nor would Beastlord.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that they added Shadowknights and Paladins to Gnomes, and Rangers and Paladins to Halflings.<br />
<br />
And I'd love to see Brownies added as a race.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lets do some math shall we?<br />
Warriors: Pretty much every race =/<br />
<br />
Druid/Ranger: lets think, wood elves, half elves, humans, halflings, anything im missing? Thats 4 races, but nobody likes druids neway, and rangers are hybrids, so who cares. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Necromancer/Shadowknight: Iksar, erudite, human, dark elf, and gnome(I don't get it either) Thats 5, pretty good.<br />
<br />
Cleric/Pally: Highelf, Erudite, Human, Half-elf, Halfling, Froglok, Dwarf, Darkelf, Gnome. 9, but who cares, everyone likes clerics.<br />
<br />
Monk: Do I really have to go over this?<br />
<br />
Rogues: Barbs, Dwarves, Halflings, Half/Wood Elves, Human, Kitties, Smurfs, and Gnomes. 9, but its a melee class =/<br />
<br />
Bards: Elves, Kitties, and Humans. Don't know much about bards, seems like an even mix of races<br />
<br />
INT Casters: Yea, all the same... Plenty of em running around.<br />
<br />
NOW<br />
<br />
Beasties/Shaman: Froglok, Iksar, Barbs, Kitties, Ogres, Trolls. 6, thats better than 2 other classes, well, 4 if you wanna get technical.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about the Berserkers yet, SOE changes so much crap around while making an expansion, I'm just going to wait for it to come out. The point is, maybe SOE is trying to give shaman more options? Maybe they think other classes have enough races to choose from? I dont know, i dont work there.</div></div><hr />

ROFL, I want gnolls! But yea, you also bring up the point that they added those classes to other race to bring in some variety. And the lore of each race is a valid point too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I particularly don't understand why Frogloks are shaman.  <br />
<br />
They worship Mith Marr, they are paladins, clerics, wizards and.... shaman?  It makes no sense whatsoever.  <br />
<br />
Ok, there are a lot of shaman frog npc, but there are also a lot of frog enchanters.  <br />
<br />
I am with you Ximix, enough with new races being shaman already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rokktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gnomes can be Shadowknights.  That is all that needs to be said.  That is the worst thing Sony has ever done.  I hate gnome SKs.  I really do.  It's just wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, I agree with that one.  If they ever add a new race, I'd like it to be gnolls too.<br />
<br />
Classes?  Warrior, shaman, wizard, rogue, berzerker, SK, bard.<br />
<br />
Those may sound weird, but warrior and rogue makes sense, gnolls being a tribal race would make sensible shamans, and if I remember right there are some gnoll wizards out there (in Splitpaw I believe, though I might be wrong), and the race needs one interesting &quot;huh?&quot; class, kinda like froglok wizards.  Gnolls are a very angry race, so Berzerker would fit (hehehe), and since they're evil, SK makes sense.<br />
<br />
Bard?  Why bard, you ask?  Simple.  Some totemic (tribal) societies use songs and lore to record their history, and that's what bards would do in these societies, keep the tribal history (that was SOE's rationale for Vah Shir bards).  And think about it.  All the bard races are either good or neutral.  It's about time they had an EVIL bard race.<br />
<br />
If it's not gnolls, then I'd like to see a completely new and unknown race introduced, something NOT already part of the game.  Something really, really interesting, like a race of insectoids (kinda like the Thri-Kreen from the AD&amp;D game), or maybe a race of winged reptillians or something.<br />
<br />
But I'd still rather have gnolls.  If they make gnolls playable, I'd roll one up in a heartbeat.  That whay I could have my kitty shaman and my gnoll SK.  :D</div></div><hr />

You can't lump these 2 together, SK's can also be Ogre/Troll.</div></div><hr />

This one irks the most.  If the frogs get clerics and paladins they should not get Shaman.  Shaman are the cleric class for the uncivilized races! It should be either one or the other, but not both cleric and shaman IMOH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i would hazard an answer to the orginal question.  SoW.<br />
<br />
sure at the upper lvls, Sony dumbed down SoW a bunch with run3, (and soon to be 'improved' run AA) and horses; but newbies apparently need SoW.  <br />
<br />
and the fastest way to give it to them is with Shaman.  (even if we never get an upgrade of it past billy)  therefore all the new starting races since orginal have shaman.<br />
<br />
but that is just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thought the whole premise was that a race gets Shamans OR Clerics OR Druids - only one Preiset class per race (except for Humans and Half-Humans).

<br />
it would be like Shadow Knights and Necro's are..<br />
<br />
except what they siphon through spell, they could do as an ability kind of like the monk FD compared to necro/sk FD.<br />
<br />
they can do other stuff like maybe jump higher than others...<br />
vampires are capable of having their own little set of unique skills to separate themselves from the rest.<br />
<br />
imo.</div></div><hr />

Because they are a tribal people, but also the chosen of Mithaniel Marr.</div></div><hr />

Lets face it there is no Lore anymore for SoE its all about appealing to the masses.<br />
I mean *** is the Froglok race ?<br />
Basically its just a gimmick race and sorry but i have no time for anyone who chooses to play a Froglok.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Because they are a tribal people, but also the chosen of Mithaniel Marr.<br />
<br />
Frogloks were created from half of Mithaniel Marr's lifeforce, and barbarians were created from the other half. Froglok's fought and fought to try to free Mithaniel Marr from Cazic Thule's minions, but couldnt do it until the barbarian horde showed up to help. Barbarians were the first 'men' (humans are our country cousins), yet we stayed 'primitive' and cant be clerics or worship Mithaniel Marr (unless you play on the diety server) and humans can do both.<br />
<br />
So the frogs worship Mithaniel Marr (truth and valor), so it only makes sense they can be paladins. But they are 'primitive' so they gave them shamans. The only reason I see that they got cleric also is because they didnt think it was right to have a hybrid class and not the parent class also.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion has always been why not just let any race be any class? You can still have racial hostilities, because that really doesnt have to do with good and evil - that's just a matter of perspective. Dwarves think ogres and trolls are evil because those races like to eat them. I doubt ogres and trolls think dwarves are good, except in respect to how they taste.<br />
<br />
You will still wind up with many of the same common combinations, because certain races are just more suited to particular classes. Yes, some people might make troll wizards - but they (the trolls, not the person) would be pretty stupid wizards. It's still going to be more advantageous to be a high elf, erudite, dark elf, etc. because they are smarter. It would however, bring a little bit more diversity to the population.</div></div><hr />

My troll grew up in a town with SK's and visited da Ogre town with SK'sm but never, ever saw any Necro's in either town.   That is from the outset of Norrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
side topic - races with bards.  Lots of RL cultures had bards, or at least singers, but the Barbarians of the Norse Lands were the ones with Skalds, singer/poet/magic makers who could change the fate of kings with the power of their words.  Why don't Barbs get to be Skalds, or at least Bards?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone here overlook the fact that Halflings also get Druid and Cleric?<br />
<br />
The simple truth is, there's not enough classes available to generate enough uniqueness to fit each race.  In a lot of ways, the game has been watered down to be a shadow of its former self.<br />
<br />
That's my take on it.<br />
<br />
As for Wulfbane's<br />
Basically its just a gimmick race and sorry but i have no time for anyone who chooses to play a Froglok.<br />
<br />
If you don't like a race, you don't have to play it, but this type of attitude could cause you to ignore people who JUST MIGHT make your gaming day a little better.<br />
<br />
If it were not for the rush of hundreds of people at once becoming frogs per server, and the ease of travel beyond their home, I don't think this would be the case about the frogs.<br />
<br />
When Kunark came out, the other continents saw very few iksar.  Which made it more realistic that they were only recently discovered.<br />
<br />
The Vah Shir were initially cut off from the world except with the help of wizards and druids (or managing to get through Paludal to the Nexus on their own), and at the outset, almost no one had a map for the zone.<br />
<br />
The Frogloks were the first new race after POP.  So in a matter of minutes after the first froglok was created, they were swarming all over POK to get to the best hunting grounds.<br />
<br />
I couldn't use POK for 2 days after LoY came out because of all the frogs porting all across the world.<br />
<br />
Same will likely be true with any new race that comes out now.  (Frankly, I think it would have been better had POK been more restricted in access, either the books not being near every city but only in a few remote places, or if there were a level requirement to access POK (say level 20 for example).)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes, Kash. I think Knowledge should be level restricted like all the other planes to level 46 and above, and I've /feedback'ed it a couple times.<br />
<br />
Good point, Baz. Forgot about the fatties. It was just a theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oh man, I'd love any of the monster races to be made into playable characters, gnolls are for sure my first choice. Think of it, gnolls, orcs, ratmen, lizardmen? (not iksar) all would be a blast to make.<br />
Do any of you remember a couple years ago when they were testing the option to play as a monter? You just selected the option and it dropped you in a random monster under level 20 somewhere in the world. Man, I had so much fun with that. They should have kept it and expanded on it. Allow the player to choose the zone he wants to be a monster in, and your highest level character dictates the highest level of monster you can be with restrictions of up to like 50. So if you have a 65th character, you could be up to a level 50 monster.<br />
Just think about it, you and some friends are bored one day and decide you want to play monsters. You all decide to choose say, Solb. So you and 4 friends hit &quot;Play monster&quot; at the same time and find yourselves on random monsters in the zone, it takes you say 5 mins to get together, and then you could wreak havoc, almost like a mini GM-event. If you died, you just popped into another monster in the zone. Man, how much fun would that be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Telal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I just restarted everquest after a 2 year vacation...<br />
<br />
I don't understand the hostility on frogloks, honestly.<br />
<br />
My first shaman was an iksar when sullen zek opened up, because I wanted to be evil, but not be a troll/ogre, only left me with the option of iksar.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm back and playing on a normal server, i wanted to be a shaman again... However, keeping the spirit behind roleplay, i couldn't be an iksar, if my wife was going to be playing a &quot;goodie&quot;, so that left me with barbarian, vah shir, and froglok.<br />
<br />
I will never play a barbarian (by my choice) because I don't like to be tall, and I hate having to cast a spell to see in the dark.<br />
<br />
that left me with vah shir and froglok...<br />
<br />
Vah Shir are tall (as tall as barbarians) and I personally don't like the looks of them...<br />
<br />
That left me with froglok as my only valid &quot;good&quot; shaman choice.<br />
<br />
I don't mind being a frog, I think it is kinda comical and adds something new to the game.<br />
<br />
But do discredit a potentionally very good player based soley on his/her choice to be a froglok is assinine at best.</div></div><hr />
