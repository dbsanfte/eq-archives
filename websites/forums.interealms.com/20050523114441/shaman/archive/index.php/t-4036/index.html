<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No it's not Verant. They are nothing but incompetent lying sacks of monkey dung.<br />
<br />
From Mobhunter:<br />
<br />
- Some mobs in Ssra Temple may be going to a random spawn timer soon.<br />
- Let's not address the issue of overcrowding on the high end part of the game. Instead put in more retarded random spawns.<br />
<br />
- Targeting and spell casting problems with the new UI are known and are being worked on.<br />
- Only 8 months late, fear not bugs will be corrected in about ... ugh ... another 3 years.<br />
<br />
- Group shrink for shamans is being discussed, possibly with a confirmation box added. According to a post at the Shaman's Crucible board, <br />
- Grats to all people who wanted to see this uber spell. This sure will address the complaints and problems of the shaman class. Nice bone. INC MGB SHRINK!<br />
<br />
alchemy will undergo a revamp at some point.<br />
- Translation: 31st September.<br />
<br />
- Verant is pleased with the way the Bazaar is working now, and no major changes are likely to be made for several months. <br />
- Why are many people still crashing then?<br />
<br />
- Problems with sound cards are not a priority right now. The entire sound engine will be redone at some point, which should fix most issues.<br />
- Translation: 31st November.<br />
<br />
- Additional teleport spells in Luclin are unlikely.<br />
- Buy PoP, Plane of Potsmoking ... erm Tranquility will have teleports to ALL zones anyways. Oh yah, too bad for wizards/druids.<br />
<br />
- Ancient spells were designed as a reward to players who are in guilds that can experience the very highest-end content, <br />
- Good explanation why they drop in a one year old content and not in VT.<br />
<br />
and they should not be thought of as an entitlement. Think of them more like rare nodrop gear, I guess.<br />
- Translation: Caster balancing that is not coming anytime soon.<br />
<br />
- The fact that the effects of blind spells and knockbacks still hit you even when you resist the spell is a known bug, but because the code that handles it is tied to so many other things it is very hard to fix. They're working on it.<br />
- Translation: Our expert monkey coding team is currently playing an Atari 2600 game called Pong. When they're done, they might actually look at the problem that has been in the game since uh ... very long time.<br />
<br />
- Stats on Vex Thal drops are being reviewed.<br />
- This sure affects the vast majority of the playerbase of (2% max?).<br />
<br />
- Zone crashes when entering Great Divide, Shadowhaven, and Dawnshroud still affect many people, though it's better than it used to be. It's an old bug that the team works on when it can, but it isn't a huge priority.<br />
- Read Atari game comment.<br />
<br />
- Ragefire will not be changed. Just let it go.<br />
- There isn't much to stay about this. Verant is obviously mentally retarded, stupid, dumb, masochist and whatnot. Excellent proof how a company cares about his clients/customers. If this were a PvP game, then people might understand this reluctance to change it. Right now, I am speechless by the utter mental retardation of Verant designers. Is Brad back on the team?<br />
<br />
- Plane of Mischief is being completely revamped--really. It should go live (on Legends, presumably) in the not-too-distant future. They might even move the entrance.<br />
- They will move the entrance from Trio/Duo corridor to ugh ... Aaryonar pit. Too bad it's too little too late.<br />
<br />
- The Flowing Thought cap is indeed 15, not including the Mental Clarity AA ability.<br />
- VT necklace + Aten Ha Ra tunic = cap. Yay! More caster gear to look forward! NOT! My guild is nowhere near the top but we still have many casters already at FT12-13. While melee get AoB and Vengeance that stacks ... we get crippled FT. Nice.<br />
<br />
- One of the things we've downloaded in recent patches was the new spell particle engine. <br />
- 20 bucks on 2 emergency patches and one followup patch.<br />
<br />
Expect some surprises in the coming weeks. It is Verant's intent that we will actually want to have particle effects on.<br />
- Translation: Patches after patches after patches because we can't code.<br />
<br />
- The stat cap on items will not be increased past 127. In other words, +125 items in Vex Thal and PoP are as high as we're going to see.<br />
- Haha, gonna be interesting to see the 10+ page thread on FoH boards about this.<br />
<br />
- Pet pathing is tough to change, and isn't likely to improve a lot at this point. Changes like pet aggro reduction will hopefully make up for that.<br />
- More bones! Erm, &quot;caster balancing&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Verant is not going to release another product before it's done.<br />
- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHA! <br />
<br />
<br />
Things that were not mentioned:<br />
- Focus items, forget them. They are on the backburner. Meaning, one of these days, 31st of November probably. So now, swap out your uber shoulder from Ssra and put up an old Sebilis loot! Oh and swap out the uber necklace from somewhere and strap on the Velk's loot! Yay! More proof of a company that is blatantly lying to its customers. More proof of a company that has no clue about his own product.<br />
<br />
- Caster balancings? What caster balancings? Oh yes, the few bones thrown. On the backburner, as in coming never.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the next coming months with more added bones and no real issues addressed.</div></div><hr />

It's bizarre. People make a request to have a few things looked at. Verant may or may not pick anywhere from one to all of them. If they just picked one, you'd be bitching about it right now anyway. &quot;WTG to the losers who wanted an alchemy revamp! Thanks for the bone!&quot;<br />

At least Shaman got an alchemy bone, the cleric board is looking at this information and knowing we are never getting ANYTHING.  RF? To bad suckers we hate cleric epics.  AAskills? To bad lozers just hit your MGB key and shut up.  CasterBalance? To frelling bad, cast CH and sit down like the good trained monkey you are with the 10 other trained monkeys needed for UberMob_371.<br />
<br />
At least bones were tossed into your corner.  Clerics got flipped the bird.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cali is biased!<br />
<br />
They do need to address RF though, and no, we won't let it go. Every Druid and Shaman in EQ practically is running around with an epic meanwhile Clerics have to sit in a FFA zone and wait to be KSed. Seems a little unfair. (Apologies to those Shaman and Druids who don't have their epic but you know what I mean.)<br />
<br />
And they REALLY REALLY REALLY need to fix the targeting bug, I switch targets all the time randomly now and it's really annoying not to mention dangerous.</div></div><hr />

I keep hitting &quot;Find&quot; looking for that 500 pp copy of Malo or Torpor that people keep saying they find in the bazaar.  I haven't seen either of them for sale at all (although Malosini is available for the bargain price of 4k- heh.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mass Group Buff and Group shrink - muahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It just proves the old addage, &quot;People are stupid&quot;.<br />
<br />
The response to the spell drop situation is proof that there are no developers playing high lvl shamans.  If they did they would do something about it.  It's the typical VI response to any complaint, &quot;It's working as intended&quot;.  Then after overwhelming evidense that they are full of **** they come back with an exciting anouncement and do what the player base had been asking for for over  a year.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  The only reason we ask for such sucky new spells is because we have asked for better spells and been screwed for so long that we have collectively lowered our expectations to the point that we set our sites low enough that we wont be dissapointed when we get crap spells with the new expansion.<br />
<br />
Also, have you ever noticed that no developer ever seems to post here on our board.  I mean this is the difinative shaman board but they never post here.  They post at the Safe House or Graffe but never here. Makes you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry, if Clerics want their epic as easy as we get ours, then they need to lose the effect and take something that only helps themselves and isn't game changing.<br />
Say a self only 10 second cast Celestrial Essence ;/<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, I think the group shrink bone is crap as well.  It's like they looked over the list and picked the thing with the least (read none) game impact.  Now they can say they're listening to us. (Blah)<br />
<br />
Alchemy revamp will be nice however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">While true or not (yes he has some good points) jesus man sounds like its time to change games. The day EQ gets me that worked up is the day I seriously consider retiring. I have played it for going on 2 years now and I have my times when its time for a change so I grab whatever is new on the shelfs and play something else for a while (currently still working my way through FFX) and then come back to EQ when the itch returns. Don't let it get to you so easily. thousands of people have played the game to level 60 many times over withtout most of the stuff we would all like to see happen, be happy when we get even little things. Hell the pet changes alone had me jumping for joy not to mention the removing of the DoT and heal restrictions. I know we are all sick of hearing this but its still true. After all is said and done, its a game, if your not having fun, why suffer? Look on the bright side there are a massive number of MMORPGs coming out from Galaxies to Shadow Bane to even EQ2 eventually so I am sure there is something out there that will bring you pure MMORPG gaming goodness. No this is not a flame this is simply an opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frankly, an out-of-group, and even better, a full-group shrink spell would be awesome.  Low expectations?  No, just very practical.  It'd cut several minutes off my raid buffing time.  Maybe then I won't have to start renewing buffs before I'm done buffing other folks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yup, there is a targeting bug.<br />
<br />
It seems to only happen when you are holding the right mouse button (looking around) and your mouse passes over another target.  <br />
<br />
Its annoying because you normally only notice it when you go to cast on your intended target and get the new one instead.</div></div><hr />

Because they have a lame internet connection or computer, or an outdated video driver.  Or beause they use a custom UI but dont upgrade the default files when they are patched.<br />

- Ancient spells were designed as a reward to players who are in guilds that can experience the very highest-end content, <br />
- Good explanation why they drop in a one year old content and not in VT. <br />
<br />
I agree with you here, it also took them months to fix the script, and now its 3 hours to do just the ring, not to mention the other lords and ladys.  No one really cared about vulak anymore anyway, but now he is the only source of ancient spells.  Lame planning on their part.<br />
<br />
and they should not be thought of as an entitlement. Think of them more like rare nodrop gear, I guess. <br />

I dont think of them as an entitlement, I think of them as rare no drop loot that sucks.  Some ancient spells are really good, and some just blow. <br />

- Stats on Vex Thal drops are being reviewed. <br />

<br />
Yeah, the 2% of the player base where most of those people no only have been playing (and paying) for 2+ years, but have multiple accounts as well.  Its also the 2% that everyone else works to become a member of, so its important to upgrade drops in VT for those people, and for everyone.<br />

<br />
Agree, and it should be a huge priority imo.  Its just shoddy to have well know bugs in a game thats been out years and not have them fixed yet.  Maybe one day they will fix the 10k wall bug in upper guk thats been around since the the first person stepped into guk.<br />

I agree with Vi here, people need to stop being gimps and just get over it.  If you want your cleric epic, go camp ragefire.  If you cant camp it, someone in a far off land might cry for you.<br />

Yeah its late, but im glad they are upgrading it.  It was actually cool when vellious camp out, then it got nefred into a pos.  They made a mistake, but at least they are fixing it.  Better late than never.  So far youve complained about 5 things they havent fixed, and then when they do fix something you still complain.<br />

- Haha, gonna be interesting to see the 10+ page thread on FoH boards about this. <br />
<br />
Hmmm yeah well, I bet they will change their mind here.  I mean, you have to keep increasing the power slide to keep players interested.<br />

- Let's see. Overcrowded server before this change had: 1 cursed spawn every week. Overcrowded server after this patch: 1 cursed spawn ever week. Oh how nice way to actually solve the problem. Instead of UK guilds getting cursed now, it's gonna be west coast. Same problem, different channel. This game badly needs more endgame content.<br />
<br />
<br />
You dont have to use the new ui<br />
- As a programmer analyst I know that many resources are going to be poured into this problem, thus depriving many more critical issues to be addressed. Point was not, to use new UI or not, point was buggy code, non existant QA nor any source control.<br />
<br />
<br />
We get something we want and you have a problem with that? bog. <br />
- Verant wants to hear comments just like these. Here is a bone, now keep it quiet about more important issues. <br />
<br />
<br />
Because they have a lame internet connection or computer, or an outdated video driver.  Or beause they use a custom UI but dont upgrade the default files when they are patched.<br />
- Only thing installed on my machine is: Win2k SP3, NWN, EQ, GForce4 4200 (latest drivers of course), 3COM NIC card, broadband connection, Dual Athlon 1800+, but yeah I got a POS machine with a 300bps connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Haha, why dont they just get rid of blind all together.  Its annoying, and not in any way a fun aspect of the game.<br />
- DT is fun? Mana drain AE is fun? 500/tick near lure dot is fun? It's called lack of imagination for challenging endgame content.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the 2% of the player base where most of those people no only have been playing (and paying) for 2+ years, but have multiple accounts as well.  Its also the 2% that everyone else works to become a member of, so its important to upgrade drops in VT for those people, and for everyone.<br />
- You forgot one thing, that measy 2% of the EQ population that is in VT, this same population uses the MOST server resources, uses the MOST programmer resources, these are the people who find game stopping bugs (hey let's crash Sssra, oooh, HP dun have Bloodbath, crash again, ooooh HP dun have Bloodbath, crash again...oh wait it has Bloodbath now, RAID ON!). One word: ShowEQ. VI shouldn't carter these players at all. They should work on giving more service and content to the other 98% of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
I agree with Vi here, people need to stop being gimps and just get over it.  If you want your cleric epic, go camp ragefire.  If you cant camp it, someone in a far off land might cry for you.<br />
- Yes, get over it. It's just a game. Cry more. Any more witty coments? Must be fun to camp mindlessly a 72 hour spawn and constantly worry about aholes KSing. Or how about the 70+ member lists? You will get your item from RF in ... ugh ... 2052 June.<br />
<br />
If your casters arnt caped then shut up.<br />
- Oh new witty comment. I would have prefered stop whining or crying but oh well. Point was, once a caster is at FT15, there is no loot really to look forward too. Melee always have Vengeance/AoB, better weapons etc. As history proved it, there will be always better weapons out, more AoB like items and so on. Casters however are stuck capped with FT 15 AND no new focus items for at least another year. Must be hard to grasp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yah, you want DoT stacking? Forget it. Verant monkey coding team can't do anything. Not that I am suprised.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Krelic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Let's see. Overcrowded server before this change had: 1 cursed spawn every week. Overcrowded server after this patch: 1 cursed spawn ever week. Oh how nice way to actually solve the problem. Instead of UK guilds getting cursed now, it's gonna be west coast. Same problem, different channel. This game badly needs more endgame content. <br />
<br />
<br />
You are asuming that with random spawns they will still keep the respawn rate.<br />
<br />
Random spawns coupled with a shorter respawn rate (2-3days max) would be ideal. <br />
<br />
What is really needed is both random spawns, with shorter respawn times for certain encounters.  <br />
<br />
2 Days after patch there should still be things to kill for most servers with 3+ top tier guilds.<br />

<br />
It's one of the few, &quot;bones&quot; that I'm more than happy to gnaw on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Cry all you want, but group shrink would make most shamans a lot happier. Sure it doesn't add any power, but it saves a ton of frustration. It's not like shamans need a ton of new things to be a good class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The only thing I really disagree with you about is the shrink issue, Zorlac. Did you read the thread with the stuff madcoww was asking about for fan faire&gt;? There were so many different people that mentioned the shrink issue there that I think it qualifies as a pretty important deal to the majority of those playing shaman at high level. Maybe it isn't a big deal to YOU, but when you have that many people that want to see it, it is important enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never stops to amaze me how they have zero QA and real testing. Patches for patches for patches. Also gotta agree that their priorities aren't that good as per using a *lot* of resources to create new UI which is totally different and modifiable instead of fixing many issues. They propably could have fixed 75% of the highlevel player overcrowding issue with the resourcse put on UI. Perhaps highlvl crowding is only so and so few portion of customers problem, when new flashy UI gives eye candy to all existing and possible new customores. I'd like to have content over eye candy, but they'd like to have cash :D<br />
<br />
Perhaps VI is correct about RF, perhaps not. But they are wrong to speak to customers so ignorantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Euro guild on our Server has been cockblocking us from taking on Emp and Cursed.. Hopefully random will fix this. then we will just be cockblocking them,, they really do need more faster spawns..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">does noone else notice the fact that zarloc is mentioning ssra saying the highend game is overcrowded, and in the same bloody post saying theres only 2% of us in vt?<br />
<br />
erm excuuse me, but you think this will last forever?<br />
ntov was strictly top end on my server till luclin came out, now everyone and his gramma been there, how would you like it if ntov wasnt upgraded or changed at all since release?<br />
we betatest your future zones.</div></div><hr />

I haven't been to NToV....   Back to my question.<br />
<br />
How in the world do they do caster balancing?  Well for shaman in this case.<br />
<br />
OK, we get all the spells available to shaman, add ??? Equipment and see what happens?  No consider the drop rate of the spells... is that taken in to account.  Opps we just added an Ancient so we will have to include that into the balance, but considering that Greater Remove Curse you can't even buy...... ?  How can they even concive of a &quot;Balance&quot; because if you have the best gear you would be right at the balance point or you would be over powered if you moved the balance point down.... then what happens if your NOT in an uber guild and are expected to have X and Y but you don't ... you get left off the raid/group because of that?<br />
<br />
I guess I would just like to know how they plan on balanceing it and where their benchmark is.... is it having a shaman that only has the spells that you can buy, and is in ??? gear?  or is it with all the spells?  Are they using an HP shaman, AC shaman, or Wis shaman?<br />
<br />
You would think that Luclin would have some of the spells Kunark since it is from the same empire, just a few were lost in Kunark over time.  Some overlap should have existed.<br />
<br />
I am going to hate to say this because we all know how quests work.  Put a super rare drop on something that spawns every 72 hours, which is absolutely dumb.  But make our spells research or quests.  Shaman learn by gaining knowlege of whatever... so put the spells in as quests.<br />

Stuck in level 55... think I am going to go play a ranger now... or quit haven't really decided yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hmm if you hate EQ and VI so much then quit playing.<br />
<br />
Personally Im excited about group shrink.<br />
<br />
Oh.. and FYI the new interface isnt in release.. its in a public beta and its use is completely OPTIONAL. Dont like the bugs in it.. or the crash bugs in the bazaar then DONT USE IT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">rmm yea, i'm quite sure the patch msg said OPTIONAL, and BETA :)<br />
<br />
from patch msg. <br />
<br />
We decided to offer it for optional use as a sort of Beta II for folks on the Live servers that haven't had the chance to try it out on the Test server.  /cough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I am going to take a week off... need to back away from the game.... kind of fustrated that I can't get any iron oxide, can't get any groups because guild is hunting in HS, I can't get any of the trade in spells (still missing 2), can't can't can't ... and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">/hug<br />
<br />
Have you tried the elementals in Najena or Steamfont for iron oxide?  I would check the Bazaar for cheap sales of the turn in spells, good luck!!!</div></div><hr />
