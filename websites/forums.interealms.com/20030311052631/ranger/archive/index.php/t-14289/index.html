<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dartaniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm looking for some suggestions here.  i'm blending regular exp and aa exp in my groups now.  my questions lie with what skills should i get after getting innate camo.  i'm not quite sure where i want to go, i think that maxxing out CF would help with my archery DPS, but then again i'm not sure how much of a difference this would make.  as fas as PoP aa skills, nothing really stands out at me right now, GotF when i get higher levels maybe.  in my groups i do mostly archery for dmg, not much tanking unless it's a dire situation.  i'm open to what ya'll think and what you know has worked for you.</div></div><hr />

If you raid aoe-ers a lot, go HP. Durability, STA (or planar power if your STA over-maxes with Brute.)</div></div><hr />

Gotta ask your self what are you aiming for and what are your guilds goals.<br />
<br />
If you're going to be raiding a lot, definitly get ND3.  Those extra HPs will help out.<br />
<br />
From the looks of your equipment so far, I would plan on mixing more defense than offense and start your CA3.  It has really helped a ton with any melee who's had to tank.  CS3 is nice, but CA3 helps more.<br />
<br />
Really wanting that Huge Archery Damage?  Invest in Gamepad from Gravis :D !  You have a decent bow and I hope you have a Mith Champ Arrow or Blessed Champ Arrow for EQ now.  Max out CF3 for the best chances to do above Bow's Damage Cap with a crit hit.  The fellow Rangers of my Guild noticed I was Criting much more than them and it's mainly because I was Max CF and they were either 1st or 2nd lvl.<br />
<br />
If you are going the Pure Archer, get your Dexterity at least 200+.  It does make a difference.<br />
<br />
Again it really remains to what you want and where your guild is heading.  Last thing, if you are raiding and doing more SoL, SoV zones, Ambidexterity will help since the mobs stink when they touch a wall.  PoP mobs, Archery has worked well on the Boss MOBs including a cornered Mith Marr!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
