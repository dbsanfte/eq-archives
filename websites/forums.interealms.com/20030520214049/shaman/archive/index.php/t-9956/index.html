<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well with the pick up of my new laptop I'm going to pickup  a second account and PL up a partner. So given the option are there any preferences out there for boxers? I'm 58 atm but I'd like to take this up to 65 if I can just because school is starting up and my time will be limited and thus don't want to waste time LFG when I'm on, just log on and start xping and AA's.<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most people suggest a plate tank these days, since POP pretty much demands a real tank.  Most suggest SK, as FD and snare are great, and SK's get aggro very easily, which will leave you free to canni and dot, etc.  <br />
<br />
Pallys are nice and can stun, and give some small buffs; starting at 59, they can also start making very notable contributions to healing.<br />
<br />
Both SK's and pallys don't damage too quickly, really, but there are plenty of great weapons coming out(windblade) that let any class that can use them do very nice damage.  Plus, pallys and SK's of course have their spells to help get aggro.<br />
<br />
People always used to say monk, but monks do not have the ability to get the high hitpoints necessary for survival in POP as a true &quot;tank,&quot; although a monk who winds up with tons of great no-drop armor can eventually have nice hitpoints.  Still, it will come very slow and hard to a monk, and still not really make him an ideal tank.  Retired my 60 monk for just this reason.  He and my 60 shaman shared many fond memories. :(<br />
<br />
Now I have a 51 warrior.  You can buy extremely good crafted armor for some warrior race/diety combos(I chose rallos zek ogre, so it works for me) -- fierce heraldic being the one with highest hitpoints that sells frequently.  Most pieces have 30 HP and up per piece, and a good number have 60 and up.  They also have lots of dex, and agi and STA.  <br />
<br />
I chose warrior because he is easy to equip to high functionality and high hitpoints without any droppable loot, unlike the monk; because having a SK/pally would mean I would have to try to canni and do all my shaman duties while also trying to spam spells with my melee, whereas with a warrior I could just taunt here and there and concentrate micromanagement on the shaman side of things; and because warriors have the &quot;defensive&quot; skill that lets them take far less damage than other tanks do, which will be very handy indeed if my slows and/or debuffs ever wind up taking too long to land.   A side benefit is that warriors are essential to raids, so having one around could be handy in that way, too.<br />
<br />
Got him to 51 in 1 day and 5 hours.  He's nice to have around, and will only get better.<br />
<br />
Is it the ideal choice?  I have to agree that SK is probably better, and I've always found the whole conception of the SK to be very cool -- and FD is definitely godly.  However, more work is involved; and I find that when I am doing two characters, I like it being relaxed and lazy, without a lot of switching between screens, not frenetic.  And, having the 1000 or so extra hitpoints a warrior gives over a hybrid tank is a very valuable thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry, offtopic here. But uh, Blarg? You wouldn't by chance be aka ReflanX who posted a ton on the Monk board a while ago would you? Just a hunch...........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">got him to 51 in 1 day ?<br />
<br />
YOu mean 29 hours?  Sounds like some cheeting goin on Thasts just silly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, this is ReflanX who used to post on the monk board all the time.  Reflan is my druid's name...first char I ever made, so that's my EZboard name, never changed it.  Except from Reflan to ReflanX when the board got messed up heh.  Guess what BlargX's first name was?<br />
<br />
As to getting to 51 in a day, I mean in 1 day played plus 5 hours, so 29 hours total.  Realize that I had TWO buffing classes with which to buff him; group focus and group sta/agi/bih li/group PE from primal cudgel really add up.  So does having to do only 51% damage with the twink to actually get the exp.<br />
<br />
Having the druid helps, to say the least. ;)  Druid damage shield leveling is fantastic; was often fighting five mobs at a time.  Sometimes did virtually no damage whatsoever with the warrior at all -- as long as you land ONE point of damage, you get the credit for stuff that dies to a damage shield.  Was able to buff my new warrior with both 54 druid buffs and 60 shaman buffs -- he had max sta/str and great hitpoints from level 6.  Also had all my 60 monk's gear that wasn't monk-specific, like fungi, hardened grey flesh sleeves, cowl of mortality, etc.  Wish I could have given him my tranq staff!  Had to sell that at a 8k loss; monk stuff is very hard to sell these days.  Sold virtually everything my monk had at a loss, except for the stuff that will not sell at all, like royal baton of stature, because it's monk stuff.  Eventually sold off enough monk stuff and camped up enough stuff in Umbral to get him a lot of Fierce Heraldic armor and a windblade.  <br />
<br />
Was kinda hilarious today...some guy came up to my group asking if we had an opening.  He was an ogre warrior all in red with a windblade -- funny thing is, so was I!  We looked identical, and I called him my &quot;big brother&quot; since I was shrunken at the time.<br />
<br />
Monks used to be the flavor of the month, but I managed to be a pretty decent one.  Now bright red ogre warriors are the flavor of the month -- hopefully I won't be a sucky one of those.</div></div><hr />
