<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that SoE have been playing the one star thing with posts but they also simply just delete posts as well.  There was a post going about the lack of support for the Nvidia 6800 video cards.  These cards have been out for some time now.  The post was in the technical section of the boards.  They simply deleted 5 posts or so, one being mine.  How can they expect any kind of trust from their customers when they pull this kind of crap?  Dishonesty and misdirection seem to rule their decision making.  <br />

It is a silly answer and they were called on it.  Maybe I am over reacting but this ticks me off.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it can cure Cancer, but hopefully our collective frustration level will drop.</div></div><hr />

They dont want your trust, and they dont care about honesty.  They are run by the Dollar.  Their business for the last 3 years has shown that they can pretty much get away with anything and people will still continue to shovel money in thier laps.<br />
<br />
I know; Ive done it(thrown money at them, that is) for almost 5 years myself.  I decided about a week ago that I was going to stop being really pissed at SOE; Im gonna play the game.  Ive played a lot more of my wizard lately, as he isnt too broken and I can still get the feeling of contributing a lot to a group and having fun.  <br />
<br />
Sorry about your posts.  Its thier website though.</div></div><hr />

I have had too many troubles with gonner's in the past.  I may seem supersticious or just plain dumb, but I just feel better that way.   :p</div></div><hr />

Battle.net's playerbase is mainly a bunch of total incompetent Diablo 2 / Warcraft 3 &quot;i pwn j00 kk thx gg no re&quot; middle schoolers who are into fast action and instant rewards.  I doubt WoW will cater to those who enjoyed the first year or two of EQ.<br />
<br />
And yes, I realize that WoW will not be played over Battle.net, which is a free service.  WoW will cost money, but my point here is that it will draw the same audience as War3 did.  I have a lot of Warcraft3 buddies (been playin War3 since it's launch, beta'd the expansion) who are 'i PWN JOO' 's who cuss out everyone they beat... and they tell me they simply cannot WAIT until WoW comes out (it will be their first MMORPG, as well, mind you).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And none of those are playing EQ?<br />
<br />
I never understood why anyone thinks that WoW will be like Diablo 2.<br />
<br />
Oh and on topic I certainly agree that that type of cencorship  is a bad idea. But I guess they can do what they want on their boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">they delete and censor anyone who bitches about problems because.. guess what! they dont want people to know there are problems!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">they delete and censor anyone who bitches about problems because.. guess what! they dont want people to know there are problems!They put this new petition thing into the game to &quot;improve CS&quot;. Well, it probably could have. Except that now, instead of contacting you in-game to discuss your problem, they frequently respond to your petition in the middle of the night, and then, once they have answered it, they close your petition so that the only way you can proceed is to delete your now-closed petition and file a new one.<br />
<br />
And if they do not delete your posts on their boards, they ignore what the post was about, even if they do post on the thread itself, which I had happen recently.<br />
<br />
SOE has never understood what CS was for. And after 4 years of their lack of CS, I have had it. It would be nearly impossible for any other game to ever be worse at CS than SOE is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The petition system is now basically an in game e-mail system, so I doubt they talk to many people in game at all now. I had an isssue around the time they introduced the system, and had a back and forth exchange between various CS reps that way. They didnt close the ticket, it is only closed by the petitioner. You can only have one up though, so if you wanted to file a new one about something you'd have to close the old one first.<br />
<br />
IMO it is a much better system than the old one where you would type some stuff using /petition and then sit waiting, not knowing if they were going to do anything or go home for the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ready the post you linked, to me it looked like the TSR was basically saying that there are issues that involve Microsoft and the card manufacturers, so resolution of the problem may not be entirely in their hands. Usually companies won't give you details about stuff like that because its confidential. All they will say is that it is being looked at, and nothing more.</div></div><hr />
