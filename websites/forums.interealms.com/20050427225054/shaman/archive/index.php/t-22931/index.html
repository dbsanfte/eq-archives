<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey, i was wandering when i play my shaman, from lvl 1, where should i go to solo?<br />
to about 10: Warrens<br />
then i can solo kurns around 15, right?<br />
pretty much stuck at that lol, thanks for the help. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">oops sorry guess i pressed post quick reply twice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trollfarceur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try Paludal Caverns, I've been there from level 13 to 24, exp is insane :)<br />
If you haven't a too bad gear you might be able to succeed at lvl 13, if not I'd advise you to come here at lvl 15. And if you're bored with soloing, there are quite often open spots in groups at the bandit camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, someone told me another place to go to, but cant think of it, any alts to PC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unrest, thats it. How bout unrest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is my view that a dedicated shaman will spend significant amounts of time soloing to whatever extent is required to maximize mele skill, especially defense.  Almost any zone of appropriate level mobs will do so long as you take your time to build a solid foundation.<br />
<br />
Personally, I find FoB and Kurns to be most convenient as both have a large number of mobs that will not run when low on health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unrest is one of those zones that the old foggies grew up in.  (I know..Im one of them)  One thing to note about Unrest is that there is always a train waiting to happen.  Everything is social, so be prepared for an add or two.  If you arent the only one in the zone be prepared and watch for trains.  <br />
<br />
But yes, the exp in Unrest is nice as well.  Paladual Caverns is where 90% of the players at that level go, so your best chances of finding a group probably revolve around PC.  But As Radag said, at lower levels is a good idea to solo some and get your melee stats up.  Ive met shaman that had 100 defense at level 65 and counldnt take a hit at all.  You should max out your defense around level 45ish I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>doctheguitarman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey, for LV 1-5 solo around Halas in Everfrost. At LV 6-12, go to Black Burrow which connects to Everfrost. From 12-15, go to Befallen. It's connected with West Commonlands. Be careful in there because you can't SoW in there. From LV 15-25 go tot he Paludal Caverns. Can't say any more because my toughest toon is Lv 23......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gethrigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">what about HHK? I bet that zone is empty now since most peeps head to PC... hehe<br />
<br />
Just a thought... I 2 box PL my 15 shammy there with my 59 ranger.  Buff the crap outta my toon and DS him... gtg.<br />
<br />
Been having some problems tho with casting gobbies down there since they dont really melee and their spells can be devastating to the lil guy at 15.<br />
