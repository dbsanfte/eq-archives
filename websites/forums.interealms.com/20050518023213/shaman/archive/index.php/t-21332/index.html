<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the highest melee dmg done by a shaman? Personally mine is 210dmg with the 2hb from PoF, most of the time dmg is below 150dmg, with occasional aa crit blasts of 640, pretty lame really compared with other class weps available out there, I'm hoping for some changes with the new expansion to include some better weps for us shaman.<br />
<br />
By the way what do you think of the look of our V.02 epic? I love the look and hope it has some melee capability with it too ~<br />

<br />
Well first off the graphic, while interesting reminds me of the flap over the Necro (QUACK) Epic. Sorry to our Vah'Shir brethren.<br />
<br />
Second it's a 2H weapon. That's nice, always like options, but umm, a 50 /35 ratio - while Godly is wasted on Shaman as we are no longer the Battle Priest we once were.<br />
<br />
Third, the stats are very, very good. HOWEVER, <br />
<br />
Time's Antithesis Stats: 1H Piercing AC:15 DMG:28 Delay:23 STA:+20 AGI:+15 CHA:+20<br />
WIS:+20 HP:+175 MANA:+170 FR:+18 CR:+18 PR:+18 Effect: Turgur's Insects Class ...  <br />
<br />
I wonder how much our Elemental Brethren are going to sacrifice equipping this thing.<br />
<br />
Fourth, Sony said they were &quot;customizeable.&quot; Great - that's why there's a type 4 slot? Ok. Because adding a melee proc onto the weapon of a class that doesn't routinely melee does........?<br />
<br />
Finally, note that it is NOT Shaman specific. Great - so now in the rush to obtain this thing we have to compete with not only Druids but Clerics as well?<br />
<br />
But hey, what do I know, I have, equip and use Epic 1.0. So color me 'noob.'</div></div><hr />

That Dathor hammer was my pride and joy when I was in Dulak, just after I purchased Rabid Bear. Never did get a double 310, but with the bracer from Tipt I guess the maximum would be a double 620 if you were exceptionally lucky.<br />
<br />
I eventually sold the hammer, but I miss it at times I must admit....<br />
<br />
These days, I have a Boneshod Greatstaff (max 138), a Hammer of Spiritcalling (163) and Aleje's Ceremonial Cudgel (168). FWIW, the &quot;magic number&quot; seems to be the high 900s ATK, above that you'll not see an increase in the maximum damage from a weapon. I guess that's what being on the &quot;pure caster&quot; damage table does for you  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahh I saw &quot;Epic V.02&quot; and then the item. Was thinking it was the Epic, much the way 1.0 has a specific name.<br />

Its about the same ratio as the Staff,  but it still does more for 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1) You hit faster, thus the 450 LURE dd spell procs a heck of alot more.<br />
<br />
2) Any other Proc augments and items effects are also effected by the speed.<br />
<br />
I have tested this out many times with my fellow shaman with them useing the &quot;Staff of Eternal flame&quot; and &quot;Hammer of Hours&quot; (wich hardly ever procs)<br />
- Everyones attack were in between 1300-1350<br />
<br />
<br />
Needless to say, a Cleric can still seem to do more dps with that summoned weapon.  :(  :mad:  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Highest hit so far 51!!! Woot me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">proc rate is prorated with swing speed<br />
<br />
if you swing more you have a smaller chance to proc per swing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why are there still people that thinks delay has any effect on proc rate?<br />
<br />
warbear, delay does not matter at all for proc rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, why is it then that I proc about twice that of the &quot;Staff of Eternal Flame&quot; with my club ??????????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Some procs have modifiers on them to adjust how frequently the proc per minute.  But it IS set to proc a certain amount per minute on average.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Haste yourself and wear a haste item, see how many swings on average between procs.   Remove haste item and slow yourself, see how many hits on average between procs.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I know that one of my enchie friends frequently slows himself in order to guarantee a proc every swing with his mana tap weaponry on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I will have to try that one.  But it will be hard to slow myself, even with takeing off all my items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even so, Sharky is the bomb. My regular swings are in the 130s, and I jacked AA into FoM for crit procs. I think the sharky definitely has a + proc modifier, it does seem to go off a lot. Toss in the 150 dd proc aug from EF, which has its own indepentant proc rate (also tested to death) and the crits on that, and you actually can pump out some melee damage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">To determine how often a weapon procs, comparitively, you can look it up on Lucy. Simply find the weapon, go to &quot;raw&quot; tab (top right) and look for the field &quot;procratemod&quot;.<br />
<br />
Note also, proc rate is independant of how often you swing, it's a fixed number of procs per minute. You do need to swing to proc, of course.<br />
<br />
Staff of Eternal Flames (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=24789), Hammer of Hours (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=21886) and Sharkspine Club (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=21885) all have mods of 0, so they should all proc about the same number of times per minute. I'm not sure how 1h and 2hers vary, though.<br />
<br />
The cleric summoned hammer, Hammer of Damnation (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=29365) has a mod of 530 - that procs a LOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gegen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Haste does not affect the proc rate... sorta... actually you'll proc less per swings that if you're slowed.  Hence why when you rampershake you slow the warrior with turgur's so you get an 80% proc rate (+the new weapon affinity mod which I don't know how much it is nor how it will factor in)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">well, after spending half the day fooling around with it, this is what I have found for myself ; <br />
<br />
Hasted = 7.9 procs a min (average) 11 hits per proc<br />
<br />
Non-Hasted = 6.8 procs a min (average) 8 hits per proc<br />
<br />
Slowed = 4.6 procs a min (average) 3 hits per proc<br />
<br />
<br />
Procs = Lotus spines / Permafrost / Pestilence shock<br />
<br />
 - Seems as if the Lotus Spines proc was averaging the same per min. , no matter how fast or slow I hit.  But the Permafrost and Pestilence shock hardly proced at all when I was slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">a SK buddy of mine is convinced that proc buffs ARE affected by weapon delay and haste. stuff like Shroud of Chaos or Pious Might will fire more with a low delay weapon and high haste. I've yet to prove the validity of this though, I'm going to have to do a couple 50ish minute parses (the duration of my Pestillence Shock with 75% extension) with 1) exquisite velium hammer (20 delay) and 2) Gatorsmash Maul (70 delay) and see how many procs per minute that cranks out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">In all Honesty, the Sharkspine Club still does the most dps out of all available weapons to us <br />
You sure a Hammer of Hours doesn't outperform considering it's proc damage is 300 higher?  I don't have either yet so I can't do any parses.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the number of procs per minute you get, I can't can't help but see how it's tied in to how fast your delay is.  The ONLY time I ever proc is when I swing.  I've never procced a weapon except when I've swung the weapon.  If I swing slower, there's fewer chances per minute that I will proc.  If I swing faster, there's more chances per minute that I will proc.  I can't even begin to think how convoluted the code would be to regulate the number of procs per minute to be a set average value regardless of whether you are hasted or not.<br />
<br />
I'll have to do some parses.  I've got a symbol of the planesmasters, and a Fasesmasher (42 delay 2h blunt weapon), and I'll grab a Shovel (27 delay) and see how many procs per minute I get with each.  I'm positive the number of procs per minute will be nearly 2x as much with the shovel since it's nearly 2x as fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You sure a Hammer of Hours doesn't outperform considering it's proc damage is 300 higher?  I don't have either yet so I can't do any parses.<br />
<br />
The proc rate on the Hammer of Hours is pathetic.  I have no idea why they made it like this, but then again, I dont know why they made clerics melee better then us.</div></div><hr />
