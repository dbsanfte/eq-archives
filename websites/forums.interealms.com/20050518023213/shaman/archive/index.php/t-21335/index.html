<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamolite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just was wondering if anyone had recieved the message yet that they have been chosen to beta EQ2. Was trying to find out if they had started picking yet or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looking at the Beta site today. It looks like the link is still open for sign-ups?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never got past their retarded sign up process. First of all they wont let me use firefox. Almost didnt bother on that fact alone. Then when i finaly fire up IE it keeps telling me my active X isnt set right. Well it is.<br />
<br />
So i didnt bother after that.</div></div><hr />

hrm, litgruv i did mine in firefox<br />
<br />
You can sign up for beta with any browser you choose however, using IE to submit forms and recieve information from Sony is required.  Im sure their code monkies have designed some spiffy feedback forms and whatnot that require IE to run.  Agreeing to use IE is part of the sign up process; you state that you will use IE somewhere around the fourth paragraph of the beta agreement.<br />
<br />
PITA, but oh well.  I had to dig around my HD to find IE again.  Even had to update to the latest version.<br />
<br />
Oh, and no info from SOE yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Probably wont see any invites till near the end of the month since beta doesn't actually start till sometime in June.</div></div><hr />

The same thing happened to me. Make sure you have the most updated version of IE downloaded. That fixed my problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't think that any invites as such will be sent out before the second half of may, earliest.</div></div><hr />
