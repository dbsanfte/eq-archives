<br />
Original ? Or later version? And how can I tell?  And if it is original it will work from inventory? Or do I equip, click, unequip?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure it's the nerfed version as I've heard of the pre nerfed versions selling for MUCH higher.<br />
<br />
Thinking back now I wish I had bought it.<br />
<br />
Don't see many for sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think there are 'nerfed' and 'prenerfed' versions.  I could be wrong, but they didn't actually change anything on the staff (ie adjust anything in the item database)...they changed the game mechanics for stacking.<br />
<br />
I remember quite a few shamans here at the crucible were upset - mainly because they already had the staffs, and this change affected them directly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there were TWO changes affecting fungi staff.<br />
<br />
first one, if i recall correctly, made it so you had to equip it to use (originally could be clicked from inventory just like sow booties). not a big deal for shaman as we CAN equip it but probably some rogues or something were upset. this one only affected new staves, so you may be able to find one of the old variety around.<br />
<br />
second one was a fix to the stacking problems so you can no longer trick it into stacking with regular regrowth. this affects the actual effect, not the item, so it can't be evaded by getting an old staff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Let me clarify this one a bit.  There are two nerfs.<br />
<br />
1.  Originally, the fungi staff used to be usable from inventory.  This meant any race/class could use it.  Shortly, Verant realized that this wasn't a good idea (necros) and nerfed it to be usable only when equipped.  There are very few &quot;pre-nerf&quot; fungi staves out there- and they're worth a TON (hundreds of thousands of pp, I'd think.)<br />
<br />
2.  The stacking of the effect of the fungi staff was nerfed to no longer be stackable with regen spells.  Arguably this was just fixing a bug, as the spell regen was never supposed to stack with the staff effect- but in any case this affected all fungi staves, since it was the effect that changed.<br />
<br />
So there are two types of fungi staves out there today- those that work from inventory and those that don't.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Original ? Or later version? And how can I tell?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's the later version.  If it was the original one usable from inventory, it would have at least an extra 0 at the end of the price.  Probably even double that amount too to get a fairly good price check.</div></div><hr />
