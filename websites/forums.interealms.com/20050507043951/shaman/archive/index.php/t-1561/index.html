<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was wondering if anybody knows the PC on JB legs, im on Solusek Ro by the way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">like 15k.  thats about standard price for most venril sath legs.  im on solro too, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On Lanys was told 25k to start.  Thought that was way too high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Squeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">on vallon they run 20k<br />
<br />
i traded a iskar bp and venom axe for mine just before patch that changed some weapons to have lvl requirement on em  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">20-30kpp is what I've seen on E. Marr.<br />
<br />
Would love to have them, but the Kromriff I'm wearing now were free, and I have better things to spend my money on right now. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i personally wouldnt pay more than 10k max for jb legs. the stats are very lacking and the effect is useless. only good thing about it is the ac. <br />
<br />
all in all, jb legs are crap and fairly common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">last two times ive seen them for sale on 7th were for 25k and 20k. i never heard whether either pair were sold for that or not.but thats what they were askin for when i answered the /auction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Squeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">duffe, there not useless. my lvl 46 shaman uses them so often i got all my jb armor all hot key'd together.<br />
<br />
especially if your in a group with 4 tanks. makes buffing a heck of alot easier. <br />
<br />
&quot;to hell with em...you get JB buffs!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">JB buffs are neat for a few levels, but eventually are basically useless.  Level 39 buffs on level 55+ tanks will not win you any popularity prizes.  They would be nice if it was realistic to acquire them at 45, but by the time you can contribute to a VS slaying, you can probably get better.  Great ac though.<br />
<br />
Paying for MQ'd thurg legs would probably better if you are in the market. Abolish disease is great for unslowing your tanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I only used them for &quot;pet&quot; buffing or PL lower characters.... On the other hand JB armor looks better than most of the better armor (sigh...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A good pair of legs is indeed hard to find!  Certainly expensive.  :0<br />
<br />
I love my Thurg legs.  Obviously SS ones are better, but those differences are statistically pretty marginal.<br />
<br />
What's great is that the effect on Thurg legs is very useful now.  It was a clever resolution by VI actually, and killed a couple of birds with one stone - our leg effect on major armor is useful and we don't have to kill buffs to dispell slow.  <br />
<br />
NPC mobs dont cast abolish disease on each other when they get slowed, so we get a leg up!  So to speak....<br />
<br />
JB legs seem to go about 20 to 30k on my server, but I can't say I've seen them for sale much.  Seemed overpriced to me too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">JB legs these days only have 1 selling point...<br />
<br />
One of the best 'transferable' legs for Shaman (excluding Iksars).<br />
Fantastic twink item, but if your in a guild that does Kael or ToV HoT... these quickly get replaced.<br />
<br />
Way back when, I bought JB legs for 25k, (which is funny, I paid almost 30k for my JBB). I soon after traded them for a Fungi Tunic.<br />
<br />
If your selling, I am guessing these days, you can catch 15k without trying, and 20k from the unsuspecting buyer or the 'power twinker'.<br />
<br />
The clickable 'stamina' buff is a non-factor... they look good, decent AC and wisdom... other than that, get yourself some quest legs, and wear some Jarcrap legs from Karnors in the meantime.<br />

<br />
Define quickly... mutter.<br />
<br />
I have probably killed 10,000 or more giants in the Arena in Kael and never seen a chain BP or chain legs drop.   Months and months of 3 or 4 or 5 times a week, from last June to December....and still we go up every once in a while to help friends faction.<br />
<br />
A few dozen trips to HoT... I have yet to witness a pair of chain pants dropping.<br />
<br />
In a damn year+ of killing for armor in Velious, NOT one single drop of chain pants.  /sob.<br />
<br />
Um, yeah sorry about that...<br />
<br />
They are decent pants if you don't have velious quest.  I see VS legs for sale all the time on Terris, I would guess they go for under 20k now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/comfort Henora<br />
<br />
I know how you feel. I've been holding out for SS chain legs for so long... and the miserable things just won't seem to drop for me. I've lost track of the time I've spent killing stuff in HoT, to no avail. I have NEVER seen them drop.<br />
<br />
Chain drop rates in HoT are just pathetic. :(<br />
<br />
Here's hoping we both see SS chain legs someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Velious chain legs/bp do seem to be damn near impossible to get. I have seen lots of other stuff...especially plate and leather. I have seen plate AND leather bp drop on the same mob in HoT before. But I have never once seen a chain bp drop (in kael or Thurg) and only ever seen one pair of legs (HoT). <br />
<br />
Shaman really get screwed when it comes to leg wear. Shojen legs anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well um i am wearing the legs from hate and want JB legs bad since i dont think im gonna see Kael or even Thurg or SS drop in a LONG time, i have my Kael BP though, even though now im kinda on SS faction, just got to dubious yesterday, and i really want a JBB, JB legs, and a REIF but i really only have 16k and about 10k max of stuff i can sell my equip is for main slots<br />
<br />
Kael tunic<br />
Rune Etched Legs<br />
Braclet of Swirling smoke, Nathsar Bracer<br />
JB Boots<br />
JB arms<br />
Kael Gloves<br />
Kael helmet<br />
Cone of the Mystics/Slimy Harpoon/Nolble's Walking staff (that 8 19 that drops of nobles in kael)<br />
<br />
And yes i AM a ac shaman and my wisdom suffers from it<br />
<br />
any suggestions on what i could do with about 24-6k i would gladly listen to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ToV HoT is funny, not 2 raids ago, we had 15 chain drops 3 of which were Chain legs, then 2 raids straight, we had 11 plate drops and no Chain drops at all.<br />
<br />
Desperately random I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
Naturally, I missed the raid with 15 chain drops, such as life...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well i picked up a JBB today and sold the Nathsar for 300pp i spent 15k and a Barbed Ringmail on the JBB but i think its owrth it /sigh so i got about 2k left... now what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Coldain skin gloves?  AC is a bit low (for a long time I wore CC gloves) but the wis and hitpoints are yummy.  One of the nice bracelets from WW?  <br />
<br />
That's so weird, Henora, about the chain legs.  That was the one piece that all chain wearers had in my guild.  We were swimmin' in pants!<br />
<br />
And of course, my fashion story happy ending.  My guild had posted a definite date we were to switch factions from SS to...well, just not SS anymore (we're currently faction outlaws, killing whatever).  <br />
<br />
So, the night before the switch date, we get THREE chain bps, enough to ensure that every chain wearing full guild member had a chain bp before we switched, including me!  Thank god, a year of looking like a fashion freakshow was enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I witnessed a JBB go for 5k and about 9k more in ok stuff, but sadly this was prior to my knowledge of it being available. I could have offered more. I guess from now on I can't go out to eat lunch :(. Saw someone selling a pair of JB legs on Luclin for 20k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd say the JB legs are pretty comparable with at least the thurg quest leggings:<br />
<br />
JB:  AC 24, +8 wis, +75 mana, +8 dex, +8 str<br />
Thurg:  AC 22, +10 wis, +80 mana, +30 hp, +5 sta, +3 agi (and better buff)<br />
<br />
The thurg legs are a little better, but when you're ready to upgrade the JB legs you can sell them to recoup some of your investment.  :)</div></div><hr />
