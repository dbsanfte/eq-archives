<br />
I'm not going to repeat the things that Alan's already stated so well. 99.9% of the people who play EverQuest do so in a fair manner, and agree that there is no room for cheating as part of EverQuest. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this message is addressed to the other 0.01%. <br />
<br />
If you've &quot;accidentally&quot; ended up with items equipped that your race or class cannot normally equip, and/or have any items that haven't been earned in the lines of acceptable gameplay under the EULA, we strongly recommend that you log in your character before tonight's patch and unequip any mismatched items and delete any duplicates. <br />
<br />
As of tomorrow's patch, please do not be surprised when items gained in an illicit manner and/or wrongly equipped are creatively, forcibly un-equipped. <br />
<br />
We already have logs of who's done what, and we'd like to extend an opportunity to those who may have tried something out &quot;just for fun&quot; to take their actions back. <br />
<br />
As a team, we've been congratulated quite a bit lately for many of the positive changes that we've been making to the game, and we're glad to continue to improve upon what we still believe is the most enjoyable online game out there. <br />
<br />
However, please do not mistake our intent. The rule does stand: If you cheat to get around the system, you must be willing to accept the consequences. <br />
<br />
Cheat in EverQuest; Bad Things Happen. <br />
<br />
Once again, to the vast majority of people who play EverQuest in the true spirit of the game, we're sorry that we've had to take up your time with this. <br />
<br />
We thank everyone who has submitted /bug reports and feedback here in the Dev Corner on this issue. No punitive action has been or will be taken against those who discover and report bugs, and stop taking advantage of them. <br />
<br />
Thank you. <br />
<br />
Scott Hartsman <br />

EQphreak: I'm not Scott. I'm Adam, sometimes known as Rokvald, who posts on this board as Bahimiron. I was just quoting Scott.<br />
<br />
I seem to've been a bit too vague, so I'm gonna go back and put quote stuff around Scott's post, so people stop thinking I'm him. :P</div></div><hr />

I guess I should post about the overseer over at the druid's grove ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Reminds me of the other messages we have received from Smedley regarding the *fake* cheating tool which came out prior to ShowEQ.  Something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
'We know the people that are using it and it is very easy to detect it.  We're about to ban all of them now.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yes, and the cherished one:<br />
'Hurry and sign up for the Legends Service!  We're almost out of room!'<br />
<br />
<br />
I REALLY doubt that they had any way whatsover of detecting that someone had PREVIOUSLY equipped an item to an illegal slot.  If they were logging it, hat would mean they knew it could happen.  It would also mean that knew it was happening all this time.<br />
<br />
As far as duping goes, I can believe they might be able to detect it based upon unique identifiers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They can never detect NOR ban any packet sniffer (ShowEQ and clones) ... if people who are using them aren't stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">or of course they /cough  might /cough keep logs of most everything that happens in general. like how you think they know if you really lost that item or are just bs'ing? or how they track where items go? but of course, putting all these logs through a search checking for illegal items in illegals slots would be waay too hard :p</div></div><hr />

Almost got myself killed in cabillis tho, lol no idea that would change faction.<br />

I was annoyed at first when I saw that post, until they decided it was time for an emergency patch to fix it. Good job original poster.</div></div><hr />

I bet it wouldnt have been fixed this quickly if that person had not spread the word. WTG!<br />

Hehehe, there is something &quot;interesting&quot; in that message from VI too that I didnt catch when I read it:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, i lost a bag to the corpse looting bug, and i told a guide that i lost my GM smithing hammer, geerlock hammer, and geerlock sewing device.<br />
<br />
in 15 min, he tells me, found it, and i get those 3, and<br />
the fishbone earring, 2 velium jasper earrings back, and he says, ill give you back the batwings and fishscales only if you ask.<br />
<br />
I was flabbergasted<br />
<br />
It was my utility bag, and i was freaked to lose the GM smithing hammer, i didnt give a rats butt about the others, so didnt mention it.   But they know what i had in a bag on wednesday night, and it was the next tuesday.<br />
<br />
I would think if they cared (and in this case, they do) its not hard to do a database search, and do a little comparing of equipments race / class stats against the race/class of the player.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ummmmmmm, they keep logs of all the items that you've obtained and destroyed?  HOW?  Can you imagine doing the data reduction on THAT file?  VI has determined that 6,243,621 cp's were destroyed in the last week  :)<br />
<br />
Now I can see how they'd do a wipe of specific items that you can't equip, but how would they data reduce log files to see who got X item and then research what class/race that person is?  EXCUSE ME, don't they know that some of us are programmers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Without getting into a programmer vs programmer pissing match - <br />
It'd be pretty trivial to parse log files and whip up a couple of SQL queries to compare item/slot/race/class for each character.  Probably only take a day of programming and a couple days to run.</div></div><hr />

On the banking transactional system I've been working on for the last 3 years, we keep logs of anything. It's not hard, neither takes up lot of space. Compression is your best friend. Within 20 minutes of digging I can tell exactly what user X was doing exactly at certain time, what functions of the system was used, what buttons pressed, content of every transactions and so on. Our logs date back to first day of system going online. It's very easy to do, even for VI. Remember, EQ is nothing more than a gigantic database.</div></div><hr />
