This is a huge nerf, my affliction efficiency and haste items are some of my most important gear because of their effect.  <br />
<br />
My efficiency item saves me 25% mana on Malo, Slow, Root, Cripple, etc etc.   Haste on Malo and Turgurs is something we have been using for months and months now.<br />
<br />
It is just ridiculous to change it from DOTs, to all debuffs/dots to only dots, BACK to all debuffs/dots and then BACK AGAIN to only dots.  It has been ALL DEBUFFS and DOTS for at least 7 months now.  <br />
<br />
I have based loot awards on this focus effect and I have made gear decisions on my own stuff around it too.<br />

#1. I've been selling ceramic skulls of decay and making them for friends. This item is now useless. My #1 target was shamans and necros, and the odd enchanter. No, they're not using these for dots... allthough that is nice... it's for charming slowing rooting crippling.<br />

 Isazo did apparently..and although I fully agree that these focus would be awesome for slow/root/malo...didn't anyone see the writing on the wall, and in the back of your minds didn't you suspect that these would once again end up &quot;as intended&quot;?<br />
<br />
I think this is a case of people getting comfortable with what was a bug to start with...no use in exploding about it, especially if deep down you knew it was gonna happen...because I know I did. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">In reply to the Devil's Advocate - sure, you can argue that Aff. should only have been DoT all along, but it's not fair to leave it affecting debuffs for so long and then take it away, and if I think the debuff+dot interpretation of affliction is more sensible anyhow.<br />
<br />
It seems right and proper that affliction = debuff as well as dot (with duration) - slow has disease counters, even =)<br />
<br />
If extended affliction doesn't apply to debuffs, then there is no focus item that benefits them.  Every other spell (except CH) gets some focus boost (I'm not talking about the generic spell haste/pres).<br />
<br />
If affliction focus really shouldn't apply to debuffs as well as dots, then there should be a new focus - debuff haste, extended debuff - or Quickbuff should apply to debuffs or a sister Quickdebuff should be added.<br />
<br />
Debuffs are now considerably less useful when the brown stuff hits the fan.  This affects shamans the most, but others as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rumor: Lead GM says the change is not intentional and should be considered a bug<br />
<br />
Fact: focus of solusek still works for debuffs as well as dots<br />
<br />
Fact: charmers are throwing an even bigger fit because ceramic skull of decay (easy to get aff 4 focus) was allowing them to recharm summoning mobs safely<br />
<br />
However the charm nerf plays out, enchanters and shamans at least will have a strong common cause in keeping debuffs (slow/tash/cripple) - actually, most casters have some useful non-DoT affliction - so SoE will either listen or frustrate a lot of their players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct.  This is a bug fix.  I'm incredibly sorry that we didn't get this into the patch message.  As you noticed, we had fixed this bug once, and somehow we got it back and fixed it again this patch.<br />
<br />
Obviously we’re not proud of the fact that this bug returned, and we’re embarrassed that the fix didn’t get into the patch message.  For both of those things I’m very sorry.<br />
<br />
And I understand you this could upset you.  But it should have been pretty clear that this was a bug.  And, as such, we really don’t plan to reverse it.  There will be a post on the Dev Corner about this shortly, but basically these foci were added specifically to boost DoTs.  They are commensurately better than other foci because they were designed to beef up DoTs, which were felt to be lacking relative to other damage spells.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you understand the reasoning behind this.  And again, I’m sorry that we missed it for the patch message.<br />

 I agree with you that it was pretty unfair to leave this the was it was for so long and let everyone get comfortable with the bug.<br />

&quot;and if I think the debuff+dot interpretation of affliction is more sensible anyhow. &quot;<br />

Its just for anyone who pays close intention to the details...you'll notice this line &quot;Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only)&quot; has been in all the Affliction line since their inception. There really is nothing to interpret there.<br />

Edit: On second though Im -sure- there will be some here that will interpret &quot;Detrimental&quot; as including slowing, lowering resists, ect..<br />

A lot of people are now wearing nodrop gear that should have been awarded to necros, or are sitting on tradable items that have just plumetted in value.  Was it really so bad to have a decent focus effect for debuffs?

And as for speed of solsek, that falls under the &quot;detrimental&quot; clause that made affliction haste a no-no. So don't count on that still working once they figure that one out. <br />
<br />
So basically, you are sol unless you are a big guild, or on giant faction AND farm ntov/dain regularly.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Update to the Patch Message for 2-4-03 <br />
With the patch on February 4th we fixed a bug with Affliction foci, but we failed to mention it in the patch message. We corrected a bug that was allowing these foci to work for too many spell types, including things like snares and slow. Affliction foci now only work on damage over time spells. <br />
<br />
We apologize for not mentioning this fix in the patch message. <br />
<br />
The very high savings in cast time and mana, as well as the extended duration, were planned to only work on damage over time spells. These spells needed more help than all other detrimental spells. The affliction foci for haste and mana are dramatically better (more than twice as effective) than other items of the type. The extension focus is better than any other as well, though not to such a degree. These items are only so much better than others because they were intended only to improve the effect of damage over time spells to bolster their value. <br />
<br />
We fixed a similar bug in June of 2002. Some time between then and now the bug resurfaced. The bug was fixed while another was being addressed, and because it wasn't the targeted bug fix it didn't make it into the patch message. We certainly wouldn't have left this information out on purpose. <br />
<br />
We understand that this change has an effect on some players. But these foci have always been intended to work exclusively on DoT spells, and we do not plan to undo the bug fix. We'll look at other detrimental spells and see if there are some lines that should benefit from similar focus items, but that will be done on a case-by-case basis and not by reverting this recent bug fix. <br />
<br />
Alan&quot;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
From this, I would expect to see a scaled down version as a new category of focus effects for debuffs.  If they randomly put the effects on existing items, like they did when the original focus effects were introduced, it would be like winning the lottery to have such an item in inventory.  Maybe this is not the time to clean out your bankspace.</div></div><hr />

However, the way it was working for the last 9 months or whatever was the de facto game balance, and they just screwed it.

<br />
Speed of Solusek is only on uber items (140+hp/mana) that very few will see - but it's 18% haste for all detrimental spells (including nukes).  That beats out the 15% spell haste IV but not by much.  It's a shame that uber guilded enchanters will still be able to toss out 4 second charms farming tier 3+ for runes/molds while lesser charmers will end up taking all the spawns in the easier, wide open storms/valor to deal with the increased cast time.<br />

Not that charm didn't need a nerfing, but this is the wrong way to do it.</div></div><hr />

As far as I know, it was claimed to be a bug in one patch message, and then restored to working with all debuffs a few days later. At that point, SoE let it slide for almost a year without comment. Given some of the developers about-faces in the past, claiming it was 'pretty clear' is disingenous spin doctoring as best. I haven't seen anything in the subject from SoE in months, but if it's out there I'll concede the point. <br />

If shaman Dots were actually useful these days for anything but soloing (at high levels) you mght have a point. As it is, you just nerfed an entire class of items, that a lot of people have invested a lot of time (or plat) to acquire, into uselessness. <br />
<br />
With a few lines of code, you've just wasted a lot of time for a lot of people, the fact that most are gonna be pretty upset about it shouldn't come as a surprise. Especially when for any debuff in the shaman lineup the affect isn't exactly an overpowering affect. Wasting people's time shouldn't be done lightly, it has a bad tendancy to piss of your customers.</div></div><hr />

Was it that overpowered??  I can't jhave any fun or enjoy items like other classes?  I think it only fair that wizards can't use nuke foci or necros affliction foci.  Those are their main jobs.  You took ours away, might as well trash them all to be fair no??  <br />

Its a bug &quot;fix&quot; that they do not plan to reverse (according to www.everquestlive.com).<br />
<br />
Just dump you Ceramic Skull of Decay like a hot brick (like I just did a few hrs ago) and get a Dain Cloak (which I also just did).<br />
<br />
It won't speed up cast time on any PoP spells but will shave some time off Malo/Slow/etc.<br />
<br />
It sucks to go from 33% debuff haste down to normal spell haste but sh1t happens. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
It also means I now need to get a Mana Pres item again.<br />
(I had Affliction Haste 4 in secondary and Affliction Efficiency 4 in range).<br />
<br />
On a POSITIVE note. I can now aim for a shield with uber stats (High Priest's or Arch-Liches etc) rather than trying to score a Grummus shield (with a focus effect that now is only good for soloing, but worse stats/AC).<br />

<br />
You invalidate NINE MONTHS of loot decisions, countless raids, tradeskill mastery, whole GUILD efforts with a needless nerf- a nerf that severely hampers an entire CLASS, and you have the F*UCKING BALLS to say &quot;And I understand you this could upset you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Were we really supposed to think SOE was retarded enough to put items in the game exclusively to increase the SPEED WE CAN CAST DoTs (Jesus, I can't even type that without thinking &quot;Are you high !?!?!&quot;)... and that the actual benefits derived from these items- benefits critical to the power progression of the class, items whole guilds strive to attain precisely for these benefits-  were a happy accident, to be corrected whenever you had a whim?<br />
<br />
Is there even one person left over there who can even spell &quot;game mechanics&quot;?  Let me make this REAL simple:<br />
<br />
You have just increased the time it takes to cast all critical debuffs by 33% (or 18% if you're lucky enough to be uber and have a spell haste item.)  If you can't understand the implications of this, you should all just go home.<br />
<br />
You have just increased the mana it takes to cast all critical debuffs by 25% (or 15% of you have a mana preservation item).<br />
<br />
You have just decreased the duration of all critical debuffs by 20%.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I can't imagine a more targetted or nasty shaman nerf.   Oh, but you &quot;understand how we could be upset&quot;, so I guess that makes it all better, right?<br />
<br />
This isn't a stacking exploit, or a pathing bug, or a mob I can hit without it hitting me.  This isn't clearly a BUG at all.  I see two possibilities here- that this is a targeted nerf, on the order of 20% of the functionality of our class (equivalent to all melee damage being reduced 20%, or all cleric heals reduced by 20%)... or that you guys are such f*cking morons that it never occured to you that invalidating nine months of work and raping the bejesus out of an entire class might just IRK them.<br />
<br />
I vote for the latter, myself.  <br />
<br />
I am not going to invest the time to start over.  I'm cancelling my LoY order now, and if this isn't rectified I think my three and a half year run is over.  I doubt I'm alone.<br />

So, looking at this from another angle, does this mean that those of us who do not have the resources to obtain these focus items (although it sounds as though there may be a rush of cheaper ones on the market in the next 24 hours) have to put up with dots &quot;lacking relative to other damage spells&quot;?

And once and for all would like you to get it through that shaman are a DEBUFFING class. Making dots last longer is silly when all xp mobs die before the normal duration expires anyways. Make a focus that increases the damage PER TICK of dots, make another focus that decreases the ridiculously high aggro of dots, and maybe we would use them.<br />
<br />
Repeat: Shaman are a debuffing class. Noone invites us for our mediocre buffs. Noone invites us for our dots that last twice as long as it takes to kill the mob. You obviously dont want us to be a main healer with the watered down heals you keep giving us compared to the other priests. You gave us the weakest nukes of any caster.

Now all of that hard earned money is wasted, I didn't even know that this was a &quot;bug&quot; that they worked with other spells until I logged on today and was very confused.<br />

The items are now pretty much useless for my shaman, unless I'm soloing, which is pretty rare these days.  It's not worth a slot in my equipment lineup anymore.<br />

This is a very disturbing change, mainly because they let it go for 9 months without &quot;fixing&quot; it... then fixing it without mentioning it in the patch message.

in one swift move your team has managed to turn even the most level headed Shaman into a blithering basket case.  You nerf slows with mitigation and dispite its devistating effect to Shamans effectiveness in some zones, you still had quite a few (almost 50%) of the Shaman out there supporting mitigation.  But I'll be damned if you havent completely lost those people now.<br />
<br />
Think about it.  Faster casting DoT......shaving 2 sec of a DoT which lasts 1min 42 sec.   Extending a DoT's Duration by one tic....on a fight which lasts less then the duration of the DoT......saving ~100 mana on a spell that you MIGHT have time to cast.  Remember........we cast our DoT's, IF we cast them, AFTER debuffs.  So DoT's only taking 42 sec wont even make their full duration.  Can you  sit there and honestly think that is a benifit at any level?  Honestly?<br />
<br />
I dont DoT during a fight because I can cast it 2 sec faster.  I DoT if I have time for it to makes its full duration.  Extending the Duration doesnt change this.  Otherwise, its an incredible waste of mana for the limited damage it does.  The only effective use for affliction focus was in debuffs.  THE ONLY EFFECTIVE USE!</div></div><hr />

It was &quot;broken&quot; for so long that everyone who played the game thought it was working properly, and thus invested a lot of time and effort into aquiring items with these effects.

EverQuest has a lot of issues and the fact they take time to make such sweeping, dramatic changes that for the most part, created no balance issues (if they did, they would have been fixed a long time ago), instead of fixing real issues (like Charm...then again, Charm creates such balance issues and has remained untouch for months).<br />

See the difference. Line 6 hps allowed (lucy should probably change this to hps required or only. Speed of solusek is coded to work for any detrimental spell including nukes which where never effected by affliction haste. Thats why it's only 18% haste instead of 33% even tho it's a harder focus effect to come by normally.</div></div><hr />

Ok so what focus items are left for shamans?  <br />
<br />
Well afliction focus is out becuase our Dots are so easily resistable, take too long to work, and deal way too much agro.<br />
<br />
Increased damage maybe? Wait a minute I suck ass at nuking.  <br />
<br />
Healing focuses?  More useful for pallies and rangers then us now.<br />
<br />
Summoning focus?  K i summon one pet per play session whoopie.<br />
<br />
Extended buff duration? The only somewhat useful one and it doesnt even effect torpor.<br />
<br />
I won't even go into the other minor worthless focuses.<br />
<br />
We no longer have ANY focus items to strive for.  I don't care if afliction focus was intended for DoT's only.  We f*$%ing need it on debuffs.  They WERE the only worthwhile focus items for MONTHS.  This is really f&amp;cked up.  <br />

<br />
It's very situation and specific to the issue.  Some bugs need to be fixed no matter what.  However, their reasoning to fix this &quot;bug&quot; is not sufficent.  If it created such a balance issue, why was it not fixed sooner and why did they allow it to go on for over 9 months without mentioning it?  More so, look to the next response...<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;  Guess then it is ok to use Epic Shortcuts, Stacking Exploits and Pathing Exploits as well because they are - you know - in game for more than nine months. <br />
<br />
The difference is, guilds and players don't spend hours on end and platium (15k+ pp) on &quot;Epic Shortcuts, Stacking Exploits, and Pathing Exploits&quot;.  These items were assigned to people because of their value - guilds have been making decisions on such items for over 9 months and people have been spending their earned platinum on such items.  It's the impacts of this bug fix that makes it an atrocity, not the fact that is a fix.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;  We knew for over half a year that this is not intended. We discussed on these very boards that it is not intended. Verant already fixed it but the fix got lost again. <br />
<br />
No, we were kept in the dark for 9 months.  While the original intention may have been clear, the present status was not.  Intentions change and when you let something go for over 9 months without a word, what are people to believe?  For all we know, they left out the notes in the patch that was stating they were going to allow the other benefits to the Affliction Foci - after all, we all know how forget they are about putting stuff in the patch notes.<br />

How long were we supposed to NOT use/expect to use affliction focus effects because they would &quot;probably be nerfed one day.&quot;  Affliction works with debuffs/affliction doesn't work with debuffs/Affliction works with debuffs...looks like they had originally FIXED a bug that was keeping affliction effects from working with debuffs.<br />
<br />
I was one of the &quot;oh no, don't expect affliction items to work with debuffs&quot; people, until MONTH AFTER MONTH went by and no word from the dev folks and new affliction items were created that also worked with debuffs.<br />
<br />
I agree with some of the earlier posters in this thread, it's a trust issue.  You can't trust SOE to fix problems like the str/dex spectral returns but a bug that provides a benefit to the player can't be allowed to continue.   Let NINE MONTHS go by, create player made pottery items that with affliction effects, let people scrouge money to buy affliction focus items, let people work on faction for quests, let people spend valuable raid points on them, THEN NERF THEM.<br />
<br />
If they had immediately righted this error back in June, it would have been an &quot;eh, oh well&quot; issue.  The fact they let people bid on the items, make the items, faction for the items, spend cash on the items only to &quot;fix&quot; the problem 9 months later is reprehensible.  <br />
<br />
Debuffs are a shaman's main priority and as of now, we have no focus items for our bread and butter spells.  Wizards have their improved damage focus items, clerics have their improved healing focus items, magicians have their summoning focus items, where are OUR focus items?<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'm also appalled at the hypocrisy of throwing shaman the sop of &quot;oooh, alchemy grandmaster item&quot; at the same time they &quot;forgot&quot; to mention the nerf to affliction focus items.  Way to dangle the shiny toy in front of us and hope we wouldn't notice the nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree with you if there EVER was a patch stating Affliction Foci work with detrimental spells not including HP loss now, sadly there never was. Wishful thinking and ignoring the obvious for 9 months.<br />
<br />
So, leaving hope and wishes aside, there was official word on how it should work (only dots), which leads to the conlusion that sooner or later it will work only with dots.<br />
<br />
Some people gave up on Affliction Foci last June, some people gambled their hard earned money for Sony to be too lazy to fix that bug and lost. Some people were persuaded by their fellow Shaman to get an Focus Item because it likely will never be changed back. Those people Im sorry for, but they werent tricked by SOE, but by their own trust in the Status quo.<br />
<br />
Verant didnt deceive anyone, in this case they played it straight and fair. They told how it is supposed to work (something they do rarely enough), we just didnt want to believe it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now we have:<br />
<br />
1) gimped heals (when we started out being equal to druids for the longest time)<br />
<br />
2) slow mitigation (probably the biggest hurt, it's not enough that mobs just outright resist us, now they have to add a new way to gimp us)<br />
<br />
3) excessive aggro drawn from our spells - dots / slows / cripple ... int casters can lay the smack down for 7k crits and not draw half the aggro we do.<br />
<br />
I can't wait to see how far down they nerf enchanters for their charming abilities, I would have loved to play an enchanter alt to charm kill someday. It will just get nerfed however, so why bother.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Stuff Verant has told us:<br />
<br />
Melees would never be able to bind themselves in cities<br />
ALT TAB would never work with EQ<br />
Ragefire in Skyfire was working as intended and would not be changed (Absor said this in front of a room full of players, myself included, during the Seattle Fan Faire)<br />
<br />
So, after 9 months of &quot;straight and fair&quot; silence, why it so surprising for some of us to have believed in a strange (but NOT unprecedented) Verant reversal?  The very use of the words &quot;straight&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; in regards to this situation is maddening, straight and fair would have been a monthly note in the patch message, &quot;hey, we're fixing those affliction focus effects, they should only work with dots.&quot; <br />
<br />
The 9 month silence was neither straight nor fair.<br />
<br />
I feel the shaman class is in a downward spiral.  First the heal debacle where because of our slow we are gimped healers compared to druids.  We take that abuse, because, hey, slow is pretty spiffy.  Then, while we're still reeling, they slap us with slow mitigation.  Then, increased aggro for our LOUSY &quot;ch&quot; style heal.  All the aggro of a cleric/druid heal for a pittance of the healing power and just as much mana.   Now, they decide after nine months of what, laziness? sloppiness? to nerf our affliction focus effect...where will it end?<br />
<br />
During these nerfs, shaman have received few enhancements, they are just taking and taking from us as our class becomes more frustrating and less fun to play.<br />

Bollocks. When VI introduced focus the whole thing was borked. They changed this and that and rarely put in a message or explained what they intended to do or what they intended to affect.<br />
<br />
And if they always intended to fix this &quot;bug&quot;, leaving it for nine months is just criminal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I wish they would have written a patch message that Affliction Foci work on Debuffs. The fact they never did clued me in that it aint to be so. And knowing Verant, I knew &quot;It was always so, let it be&quot; doesnt work with them.<br />
<br />
Ask Monks. &quot;We were always able to tank&quot; didnt work either...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Mixing other issues with that is not really fair. Im against most of those changes. I find the Affliction changes useless as well, robbing us of the only Focus line we could really use (apart from Mana Preservation which is a no brainer anyway). What Im against is the &quot;It was so for months, it has no right to change&quot; attitude. Because bugs dont become features when they avoid detection long enough! And that should be REGARDLESS of the usefullness of bugs. It should always be true, no matter how much it helps or hinders.</div></div><hr />

Can your team refund all the pp to shamans that have bought Affliction effect item?<br />
<br />
Not long ago, affliction lvl 4 items were not working for lvl 61+ spells, then there was a patch with the message that affliction lvl 4 items should be working properly.  This patch must be in Nov or Dec 2002.  After that patch, affliction lvl 4 items worked for Malos, Malosinia and Cloud of Grummus.<br />
<br />
Do you think your patch message have misled the shaman community?  Do you think it might seems like your original intention of affliction focus items affecting only dmg spells may have been altered somehow.<br />

<br />
What really does suck however is not only the fact that VI allowed this bug to stay in for so long, but that they implimented affliction 4 items, modified VT focus effects several times and generally revamped many different focus effects, yet didn't fix this simple error.  Even I was starting to get to the point where I was thinking VI was intending to keep it as was, hence the creeping interest in the likes of the grummus shield.  I really do feel sorry for those shaman that spent there hard earned dkp, time and pp gearing up with focus effects for the good of the guild, only to effectively get lumbered with a set of sub par and comparitively worthless equipment.<br />

Not long ago, affliction lvl 4 items were not working for lvl 61+ spells, then there was a patch with the message that affliction lvl 4 items should be working properly.  <br />
<br />
From Nov 19th Patch Message: <br />
Quote: <br />
<br />
&quot;Affliction Efficiency should now work on Damage over Time spells of level 61 and greater.&quot;<br />
<br />
After that patch, affliction lvl 4 items worked for Malos, Malosinia and Cloud of Grummus. <br />
<br />
Do you think your patch message have misled the shaman community? Do you think it might seems like your original intention of affliction focus items affecting only dmg spells may have been altered somehow. <br />
<br />
You have misled everyone with your intention. <br />
<br />
After that, I spent 70k pp to buy a sharp claw ahlspiess with affliction efficiency 4 and 30k pp for a ceramic skull of decay. <br />
<br />
Can your team refund me my hard-earned pp? Do you know how long it takes for players to even save 100k pp? You can have those items back!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">Hmmm.<br />
<br />
I took a while to think about this before I posted, mostly because I have no real desire to simply say &quot;I agree, and by the way you suck&quot;.   <br />
<br />
The focus items were not working exactly as envisioned by the development team.  <br />
<br />
Fair enough.  <br />
<br />
They were allowed to remain in that state for a period of 9 months, however, causing guilds and individuals to believe that the development team reviewed the matter and decided to leave it alone.  There was never a statement indicating anything to the contrary, and Sony/Verant have a long history of immediately taking steps to eliminate even the most innocous situations like these.  The fact that there was an unintended side-effect to these items is not necessarily a bad thing -- in actuality, its logical that &quot;affliction&quot; items would affect (call me crazy) AFFLICTIONS.  It isn't like they were making beneficial spells faster or more efficient.  I personally invested months of time and effort in the aquisition of these items, and I can tell you with absolute candor that it was NOT because they would let me cast Bane Of Nife one second faster.  <br />
<br />
This change devalues (in my eyes, and in the eyes of others) my contribution to the game.  It will now take longer to slow/malo a target than it did previously, in situations where it is more important than ever to fulfil your role as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
I guess the bottom line is that I feel that Sony/Verant is working against me.  Is it really so unbalancing to have these items functionas they have for the psat 9 months?  Is it really worth upsetting so many customers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">Everytime Sony makes a major change to existing items there is danage done.  Everquest is supposed to be a persistent world, I need to have confidence that an item a might be thinking of acquiring - using carefully hoarded pp, or by expending major amounts of time - is not going to be rendered worthless by some arbitrary process.<br />
<br />
The amount of damage depends on the rarity and cost (pp or time) of the item.  In this case the damage is massive: just looking at the volume of the reaction to it makes this undeniable.<br />
<br />
Could Sony please explain why allowing this bug to remain was considered worse than the damage done by the nerf?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">What exactly was misleading in that patch message then?<br />
<br />
The fact they put in focus IV items with a &quot;BUGGED&quot; effect (their words), said they were fixed and never once indicated that they would be reversing it. <br />
<br />
The fact they did not indicate that a bug existed in their game that they would fix when they could be bothered. <br />
<br />
The fact they allowed this situation to continue to go on for months without doing a damn thing about it.<br />
<br />
Come on, Enkebesh, stop being pedantic about the words. You know VI mislead by ommission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">My take is that VI/SOE is incompetent beyond measure and were really too stupid to realize that they fixed a bug in one version and reentered the bug into the live code in the next version. Making the buggy code the default one for over nine months because they at some day fixed the bug and never bothered to check again!<br />
<br />
Up until they fixed it again now they had the opinion that the bug is fixed already. And most likely they were ashamed that this bug was kept for so long and wanted to fix it without much noise. Because, when they didnt realize this bug for nine months, why should anybody else. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Thats how they work, they dont know their own code, as proved again and again during the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Ulfwall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Disregarding that I don't like that slow/malo/cripple no longer qualifying for affliction focus effects. However, Affliction Haste, as a focus effect becomes virtually meaningless without these. What good is 1, or even 2 seconds shorter casting time on a spell that takes 40+ seconds to do its full effect, i.e. DoTs? The only thing I can see is being slightly less likely to get interrupted. But honestly, how often do we find our selves withing melee range trying to get a DoT off? Sure, tanking for dogdog was a viable option before PoP, but hardly anylonger. Being able to shave off 2 seconds from the cast time of malo+slow is huge in the light of mobs dishing out damage in the order of 1000+ dps. Please give us affliction foci back for slow/malo/cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Where the hell is VI's priority list? It takes them 9 goddamn months to fix a bug but instead of putting this bug at a much higher priority no, they fix doors, they fix how some goddamn level 1 mob that gives bone chip quest hails you. They fix some other mob's toe nails. They fix some other mob's hair color.<br />
<br />
For the last nine months, people have been using Affliction Focus items, guilds still wipe to (insert uber mob here), people still don't get insane XP from it, basically it's NOT BROKEN. Why change it and piss off your customers? Oh wait, VI logic. Customer IS the ENEMY.<br />
<br />
Perfect proof that VI has absolutely no source control neither a priority list. This bug should have been fixed DAY ONE. Not 9 months later. Of course when you got crack smoking project managers that are high on acid 24h/day they tend to see door turning bugs at the same priority as a serious game function issue. Oh the horror, the door doesn't turn properly! SHUT DOWN SERVERS NOW!<br />
<br />
This bugfix is also very hypocritical of VI. Since day one, there is a bug in game where by even a 1% slow cancels out ALL haste. That's right, your level 9 lame slow will NULLIFY the effects of the best enchanter/bard haste. But why this isn't fixed? Oh yes, VI is using a BUG to nerf charm. Charm will include 1% slow component to prevent any badass haste to work on charmed mobs. An age old BUG. Way to go VI! Hypocrisy at it's finest. VI only fixes bugs that they can't use to nerf someting else. Awesome coding indeed! How pathetic to use bugs to nerf something.<br />
<br />
Oh and Absor, give me one reason why I should use Affliction focus items now. Oh and learn the words: priority and integrity and teach them to the 31337 VI monkey coding crew and crack smoking designers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FIX THE DAMN SPELLS if they are so crap. Then you can leave Affliction focus items affecting ALL afflictions, but tone down the % effect to something reasonable like 15%... <br />
<br />
I wouldn't put it past SoE to have already intended this. They throw out a massive nerf, more than they want, and then when we all complain, they can say &quot;Actually, we DO listen to you, and are putting it back in, but at a reasonable level.&quot; It's manipulation, pure and simple.<br />
<br />
But I would like to add my voice to those who think that putting in Affliction IV items that work on Malo/slows etc and say it's working as intended, and then NERF the hell out of it, is way way way beyond the bounds of acceptability.<br />
<br />
To Absor I put forward a challenge. To come here and say with a straight face what possible use Affliction Haste is as a focus effect post-nerf.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Sparx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">I'm not a shaman, I'm an enchanter.  But I fully agree that this is a needless, unwarranted nerf to both classes.<br />
<br />
For shaman it obviously means that they will be spending more time and mana casting mal* and slows.  So they have less mana to dot with (even if you chose to use dots that run FAR too long) and they will land later in the fight (and so have less run time).  <br />
<br />
This is referred to as &quot;a fix&quot; in VI parlance.  Anyone else would call it stupid.<br />
<br />
As far as my class goes, it hurts on out two primary roles.<br />
<br />
It reduces mes back to the normal 54 secs (which is more like 45 secs taking into account an allowance for resists) rather than 1 min with focus items.  If they think it's fun timing 45 sec meses on 3-4 mobs then they obviously do not play enchanters.<br />
<br />
The other obvious one for encs is the impact on slows.  Our slows are short duration at 3 mins.  Anything that makes them run longer is much loved, as is speed and efficiency.<br />
<br />
Our dots are a joke and ironicly are the only thing not impacted.  /Cheer Verant.<br />
<br />
It seems what they are saying is something like this:<br />
<br />
You support class punks have gotten focus items that allow you to do some FUN things in the game, like nuking and dotting.  We can't allow uppity support people to make any contribution outside their narrowly defined roles, so we're going to withdraw any focus that is specificly of advantage to you.  Please return to poliching the floor with you butt, or constantly canning to keep up mana.<br />
<br />
All this to &quot;fix&quot; a &quot;bug&quot; that was so imbalancing that they failed to notice THIER error for 9 months.  I'm struggling to give this credit.<br />
<br />
Its very simple Absor.  Undo the nerf.  Don't IMPROVE the focus items.  Don't fix your broken, feeble spells.  Just undo this thoughtless nerf.<br />
<br />
And add some targeting hotspots to fire elem models in Sol Ro and PoFire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Sparx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">A simple suggestion to get Absor's attention.<br />
<br />
Advise VI through whichever channel you prefer, that until they undo the nerf AND agree that it won't be necessary in the future, you will be refraining from purchasing SoY.<br />
<br />
VI doesn't care much about its customers.  VI doesn't care much about complaints.  VI doesn't care much about what we think.<br />
<br />
VI does care, very much, about making loads of cash.<br />

Before you claim we all knew it was coming, let me tell you that when the effect was removed and then re-instated, I naturally assumed the dev team wanted it that way.  Some monkeys had to code it, right?  The fact that an effect vanished and then reappeared with a subsequent patch implys the bug was it NOT working.   <br />
<br />
As someone else said, they just F***ed nine months worth of loot awards, DKP, and significant purchases.  For what?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">The more I think about this, the worse the SoE logic seems.<br />
<br />
1. They want to increase the &quot;underpowered&quot; DoTs...<br />
2. They introduce Affliction Focus at high levels.<br />
3. They let this affect other detrimental spells for 9 months.<br />
4. They swing the nerf bat on the other spells, but leave DoTs...<br />
<br />
There were SO MANY better ways to do this.<br />
<br />
Look at their original aim. To improve DoTs... Well, first of all, they all have durations and mana costs, so why not just tweak those a bit..?<br />
<br />
And why were they improving DoTs? Who were they trying to help? It must have been the low to mid range, since very high level shamans don't rely on DoTs too much, it's much more focussing on group DPS and slows, right?<br />
<br />
DoTs are mainly used for low and mid range soloing, yes? So improving DoTs would help these types. I am the archtype of the mid-40s soloing shaman. A boost to DoTs would help me greatly - and the affliction focus items were great, I had a haste/duration/efficiency trio of items with **** stats but GREAT effects. I was happy.<br />
<br />
So now the nerf. The nerf has affected ALL shamans. My ability to solo has been lowered by a tangible amount. If i get adds, my slows cost more, dont last as long, and are harder to channel. Ditto roots and debuffs.<br />
<br />
So, they set out to improve DoTs (presumably) to help soloing shamans (since groups almost never need those long slow dots).<br />
<br />
In the end, they have screwed over every single shaman, and done it in a way and taken so long to do it that it has caused the maximum amount of resentment. <br />
<br />
Bravo!<br />
<br />
/golfclap<br />
<br />
<br />
Tallanas<br />
<br />
P.S. Saying there was no message to say that it SHOULD affect other detrimental spells, in order to say this nerf was predictable, is ridiculous. They nerfed Yaulp for Paladins months ago, NEVER mentioned it in a patch message, wouldn't even ACKNOWLEDGE IT, and then they have just repaired it now out of the blue. They don't ALWAYS tell the whole truth in patch messages, you know...</div></div><hr />

To just trash something that effects the main ability of a class, with no prior warning is just wrong.

<br />
I think though the main problem here is the way SoE prioritizes their development. They just seem to randomly jump from one aspect to another with no logical or linked plan.<br />
If you're going to fix problem A one patch surely it would be more productive to then gradually work out from that to B then C then D ad infinitum. At the moment they seem to go A-G-M-L-Z-B.<br />
I was always taught that the most efficient way to use resources was by starting from a central point and branching outwards. Tackling each problem as it arose linking from the previous one. Not to jump about like some mad muppet on a free shopping spree. Barrelling up and down each aisle with no real idea what you wanted to buy.<br />
<br />
If SoE where a &quot;lucky shopper&quot; using their past record, they'd leave the shop with a pair of socks and a 10kg bag of charcoal.<br />
Then come back 3 weeks later at 4am, tapping on the door. Asking the security guard to let them back in because they just remembered they wanted some Cornflakes and a pot noddle.</div></div><hr />

Picture this, a room full of people discussing the Yaulp series and after 8 hours of hard thought come up with lowering the mana from 10 to 1 to make the spell more &quot;valuable&quot;.  Then while doing the patch coding the same guy that alternately makes str/dex buffs stack with focus also &quot;fixes&quot; affliction focus items for the 2/4 patch.<br />
<br />
Ok seriously though, in a roleplaying game that involves &quot;mystery&quot; on the game mechanics what can you rely on?  You rely on what you see.  What we saw were affliction focus items affecting more than DoTs which slanted our gear and playstyle in a certain direction.  Now we are almost a year down the road, the WRONG road.  Who has the energy/will to backup and try the path on the right?<br />
<br />
Honestly for me I don't like EQ anymore.  I play now because of my friends.  I used to do tradeskills, quests *gasp*, explore, just in general get immersed in the game.  For as long as I can remember now I just log on, find my friends and slap hotkeys.  The state of the game is crap.  It's too much of a yo-yo with knee jerk reactions/changes resulting in huge balance swings, an extremely knowledgable playerbase vs. people who use TRS-80s to code a game they don't even play,  rushed/unfinished expansions, AND I'VE BEEN LEVEL 60 FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND DON'T HAVE MALO/TORPOR (and I kill malo/torpor mobs at least 3 times a week).<br />
<br />
Why can't SOE/VI gather up people from within the player base and use them at the virtual conference table to discuss things that will make the game more &quot;valuable&quot; or at least ask these people questions about what affects certain changes to the game will have.  I think at this point it has been proven that SOE/VI cannot figure out how to fix the game on their own, why not call in the experts (Alan, that would be the players).<br />

Affliction foci were too powerful to be used on non-damaging spells(charm/mez/etc), it was not intended for foci designed to Extend 45 second DoT's, With Very high mana cost reduction(designed to make it more efficent), and decreased cast time, to be usable on 'powerful' debuffs... only Damaging spells<br />

This just SCREAMS that the dev group is not on top of things, has NO sense of communication management, and no real code oversight ... no wonder it takes 9 Plus months to deal with something that should have been corrected on the next patch.    <br />

I encourage you to do the same if you're unhappy with the customer service provided (the lack timely communication and well thought out changes).<br />

That's how I sent my feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets think about this from a logical standpoint.  If SOE nerfs our affliction focus items, and then un-nerfs them for 9 months, we're supposed to assume that it's a bug??  When they brought it back into the game, logically most people assumed that it was working as intended.  Am I supposed to run and check the SOE Dev boards anytime I want to get a new item, go to a new zone, fight a new mob...</div></div><hr />

Thank you Absor for the easiest points I ever gained. when I saw this:<br />
<br />
&quot; ** Tradeskills ** <br />
<br />
- Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman): Shadeweaver Portal. <br />
- Renamed one of two items called Figwort. The Figwort sold in Shar Vahl has been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion. <br />
- Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk. The Drachling Silk that was once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid Silk. <br />
- Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes. These great beasts are now much more likely to have their eye intact when killed. <br />
- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Soul of Incorporeal&quot; to use a &quot;feather&quot;. <br />
- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Troll's Essence&quot;. <br />
- Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were inconsistent with their single dose versions. <br />
- General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he was having a problem crossing in the past. <br />
- Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of planar oak, Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable. <br />
- Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable. <br />
- Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents. <br />
- Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability. &quot;<br />

I commented in IRC that shamans were about to be raped anally without lube and that was the chew toy to keep them form screaming to loudly. Got betted half 2 guildmates(shamans also) Raid points that SoE wouldn't do something like that and 3/4 if it was screwing over slow AGAIN. <br />
<br />
Why am I laughing about getting slap in the face this badly? Because I am so jaded at this point I expect to be beaten with the nerf bat every patch.<br />

You know if you keep this **** up, your going to have another druids grove on your hands, how much **** do you think you can slap one class with before it degrades into the whiney I HATE THEM club?<br />

Why don't you guys just go ahead and delete the shaman class altogather? Just turn all shamans in to wood elf druids half their level? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u163"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p163">The real irony here is the whole point of certain Affliction Items.<br />
<br />
Extended Affliction I coveted more for Dots than Debuffs.   on  a big boss fight, we're already refreshing debuffs before thier normal duration.<br />
<br />
Its the other 2 i find more ironic.<br />
Affliction Haste: What's the difference in a DOT landing 2 seconds sooner?  NONE.  Totally without point.  Out of all the affliction items, people got this one almost excusively for debuffs.<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficiency: so I save a little mana on malo/slow compared to Mana Pres Item.  How in anyway does that make any real difference.<br />
<br />
What is the ultimate pisser, is that Gear Selection just got screwed.  Many focus items are used JUST for the effect.   Gem Studded Ring, Ceramic Gavel of Justice.  The stats are hopeless on the item.  Yet we chose gear for the EFFECT ALONE, and now that effect is removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure necro's, Beastlords, Shadow Knights, and druids are all disapointed<br />
<br />
Well, not really.  Having played three out of four of those classes into the 50's (and necro into the mid-40's)  I  have to say I thought of these as Shaman items.  Sure, using less mana on DoTs is nice, (Affliction haste is utterly useless) but almost all of the high end affliction focus items are either caster only or take up a slot no melee class would be crazy enough to use them in, which leaves out my BST and SK.  My Druid and Necro solo just fine already, thanks, and when I look for focus items they're oriented toward group use.  (And we all know how useful DoTs are in groups, right?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
Anybody could have known that these focus effects were never intended to work on debuffs.  The June 6 patch message made it clear.<br />
<br />
It would seem the effect began working on debuffs again in August, and on these very boards it was viewed as a likely-to-be-changed bug at the time.<br />
<br />
Aug-Sep-Oct-Nov-Dec-Jan.  The effect was bugged for 6 months or so.  It sucks because it has such sweeping consequences to enchanter and shaman gear selection.  But it really still is a bug fix.</div></div><hr />

This proves they need to keep a better eye on their developments and patchs.  Working how it was suppose to, then not, then fixed, then not, and let go for months on end, is very amateurish.  <br />
<br />
They also need to include EVERYTHING in their patch details and developers read player forums more closely.  At least promptly, keep everyone up-to-date throughout a patch day, if things were missed on the original patch list.  Seems players find out the bugs and unintentional nerfs quicker, which is pretty sad.</div></div><hr />

GD right.  They DIDN'T necessarily intend to do THAT (or at the very least, obviously didn't think it through very well), and they're STILL not doing anything about it.

When you ask, the answer is almost always &quot;working as intended&quot;. So to say now after 6+ months that a change of this magnitude is just re-fixing a previous bug is a crock! I guess we were all just supposed to magically know with our Kreskin-like mind reading powers that they didn't intend to change Affliction focus items back to working with all debuff, root, dot's and mez's for the past 6 months?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Anwariad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">I enjoyed my Affliction Focus items because I finally felt that there was equipment that made a difference to shaman besides hp/AC/mana.  I could get an item that improved my character like a melee get improved with a haste, weapon proc, high dmg/delay weapon, etc.<br />
<br />
My wizards has improved damage and mana preservation.  Improved damage rocks for him.  Extended spell range is great.  Every FT items makes a big difference to him.<br />
<br />
The affliction focus items were my shamans little shiny precious trinkets.  I have no equipment know that I really cherish.  Dang I loved that Bracelet of the Sky.<br />
<br />
<br />
Way back I remember reading the patch message that Affliction Efficiency was only supposed to affect DOTs.  I stopped my drive to get affliction focus items then.  But over the months I saw that they were still affecting debuffs so I pursued getting them all.   I passed on Spell Haste items because most of the spells I needed to haste were debuffs and Affliction Haste was better.  I filled slots where Spell Haste would go with other costly(DKP) no drop items.<br />
<br />
I was lulled into thinking that what existed in the game was as intended and that the developers changed their mind on and realized there focus effects just for DOTs and not debuffs was silly.  I was foolish to think this with SOE involved but what can you do? If DOTs suck and need upgrading and it appears SOE admits they do why not just increase total damage, shorten duration, decrease mana, decrease resists.   <br />
<br />
Getting feedback from SOE as a shaman seems impossible.  We are not kept up to date on what is going on.  This is a game to me and I do not have the time or desire to spend the time reading development boards, going to fanfares, etc.  I can not read SOE minds and after playing this game for close to 4 years what they state is how it should be and won't change one month is not what it may be a couple months from now.  They are inconsistent and unreliable.  It is not unreasonable for players not to take as gospel what was said nine months ago.  Every class and player has experience this.<br />
<br />
As mentioned before affliction focus on DOTs is mostly useless outside of soloing.  If Malo and Turgur take longer to cast then there will be even less time for DOTs to do even just regular duration let alone extended.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whether it was a bug or not and whether it was a bug fix or nerf I do not care.  This was not unbalancing and made my game experience more enjoyable.  All the little things are wearing on me.  This is likely the last straw.  Last straw doesn't have to be big.  We all know all the other straws.<br />
<br />
My friend made me play a shaman but I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I love my character.  You can only get slapped or ignored so much.<br />
<br />
I will wait another day to reflect and make sure im rational but poor customer service should not be rewarded with my hard earned cash.  Too many times I have taken the path of wait and see over the last 4 years.  I am much more of a mind now of fixing things so I like them and I might play your game again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here I go tho :)<br />
<br />
This sucks, but it's not totally unexpected. They did say it would change. So long bracelet of the sky, hello Dain cloak. This will definitely increase the value of general spell haste and MP items, and the competition for those drops. It's very lousy that many are now stuck with no-drop items of nominal value. <br />
<br />
In my mind tho, shaman are just caught up in the nerf bat swung against chanters and charm. With an AH4 items and buffs, CoD dropped from a 5.0 second to 2.8 second cast time. That's a huge deal and a huge difference. Likely, since so many are concerned with enchanters' ability to for example monopolize BoT minibosses solo, this was aimed at them. The problem is that we were hit as well.<br />
<br />
Thus, I think it's a poorly thought-out move impacting more than was intended.<br />
<br />
Plus, not to be all roleplay geeky, but ain't it called Turgur's Insects, like a plague? Sounds like an affliction to me.<br />
<br />
If VI had a clue, they'd restore the affliction line to debuffs that, well, afflict, and leave charm out of it if that was the unspoken goal.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't the goal, and VI truly has a problem with Affliction XXX affecting debuffs, I am totally at a bleeping loss -- although I grant them they did warn us, sorta :/</div></div><hr />

Where the hell is VI's priority list? It takes them 9 goddamn months to fix a bug but instead of putting this bug at a much higher priority no, they fix doors, they fix how some goddamn level 1 mob that gives bone chip quest hails you. They fix some other mob's toe nails. They fix some other mob's hair color.<br />
<br />
For the last nine months, people have been using Affliction Focus items, guilds still wipe to (insert uber mob here), people still don't get insane XP from it, basically it's NOT BROKEN. Why change it and piss off your customers? Oh wait, VI logic. Customer IS the ENEMY.<br />
<br />
Perfect proof that VI has absolutely no source control neither a priority list. This bug should have been fixed DAY ONE. Not 9 months later. Of course when you got crack smoking project managers that are high on acid 24h/day they tend to see door turning bugs at the same priority as a serious game function issue. Oh the horror, the door doesn't turn properly! SHUT DOWN SERVERS NOW!<br />
<br />
This bugfix is also very hypocritical of VI. Since day one, there is a bug in game where by even a 1% slow cancels out ALL haste. That's right, your level 9 lame slow will NULLIFY the effects of the best enchanter/bard haste. But why this isn't fixed? Oh yes, VI is using a BUG to nerf charm. Charm will include 1% slow component to prevent any badass haste to work on charmed mobs. An age old BUG. Way to go VI! Hypocrisy at it's finest. VI only fixes bugs that they can't use to nerf someting else. Awesome coding indeed! How pathetic to use bugs to nerf something.<br />
<br />
Oh and Absor, give me one reason why I should use Affliction focus items now. Oh and learn the words: priority and integrity and teach them to the 31337 VI monkey coding crew and crack smoking designers. <br />

Was it that overpowered??  I can't jhave any fun or enjoy items like other classes?  I think it only fair that wizards can't use nuke foci or necros affliction foci.  Those are their main jobs.  You took ours away, might as well trash them all to be fair no??  <br />

<br />
Got to hate posts like this.  I got nerfed lets nerf everyone else.  You really need to work on you playing skills if you think this makes chanters or shammys unplayable.  Don't get me wrong I totally disagree with the nerf.  I don't care if this lets charmers run rampant in some zones more power to them, but to hear them calling for a nerf of another classes equipment is as stupid as the nerf that just happened.  And I imagine you are the same people that were applauding nerfs to other classes or their equipment when it happened to them.  So just think of it this way if you don't support another class when they go through this don't expect much support in return.  I know I'll probably get flamed but I don't care.  <br />
<br />
If you haven't figured out SoE's strategy yet it seems obvious to me.  If a class/equipment is working so well that it makes things easy it will be nerfed more than likely.  They are trying to slow things down so people stay interested in their game longer so they can make money for a longer without making any new releases which costs them money.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u194"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p194">Crap like this makes me glad I never put the effort into Affliction items. Was gonna go after the coldain bracer as soon as I got back (really, the poison-etched wrist is so dumb that I just might anyway...), but now... Bleah. an extra tick on my DoTs?<br />
<br />
Uh, whee?<br />
<br />
No, no, it's not a break to the Shaman class... Oh yes, it hurts, but we're still as effective as we were without focus. *Cough* ...Go on, swallow it!<br />
<br />
Hell yes it pisses me off, though. It's just shameful that the only way they make DoTs &quot;useful&quot; is by requiring people to go out and get items that don't really help. &quot;Oh, it's our fault these spells stink like old salmon, but here's some focus items that you can quest for months to get and spend 40k to buy, since we don't actually want to make the effort of making the spells better&quot;<br />
<br />
Absor, you realize that these are now the only classes of spells with no I - IV focus effects? You realize that some encounters relied on these effects for Chanters and Shaman to get by on more than the skin of their teeth? You realize that while Wizards are popping off 7k 2-second nukes, we're doing an extra 40 damage over 6 more seconds with the same level of focus?<br />
<br />
Come on, man, do you pay attention to this game? Or are you just emplyed because you run the Sony meth lab? I seriously hope it's the first, fella.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u195"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p195">C'mon SOE, let's not be petty. If you want to penalize a class, why don't you change the way charm works, or the way it's listed in lucy so that the debuff haste/efficiency doesn't work on it? I mean, this seems to be a little late in the game after 9 months, an expansion, and new focus effects that are listed as working correctly from the Dev Team. <br />
<br />
So . . . the question now is what to do to correct this issue. We shaman are obviously not a happy crowd, and this is a major blow to becoming a high end shaman. And, I don't know about anyone else, but in my guild, shaman are fairly rare. The bigger guilds attract them, I know, and there are still a couple of free agents walking around, but when I log into EQ, I put up my lfg tag and get a group within 10 minutes &gt;somewhere&lt; in PoP. <br />
<br />
I want to see this changed. I'm not happy with the way that shaman are heading from SOE's perspective at all. Crappy alchemy that is supposed to be our baby. Crappy DoTs that are next to worthless at the higher levels. Crappy heals that are just above ranger healing in their effectiveness. Crappy buffs that are essentially worthless after level 50, even though everyone wants the buffs cast on them.  So what does that leave us?  Not much. Shaman deserve the same treatment as the other classes when it comes to AA and focus items. If you can't or won't reset the system the way it was and give us back what we have paid for, crafted for, or bought in raids, then you (SOE, I'm talking to you) need to compensate us in some way. Change our AA so that we can get some ENHANCED use out of our debuffing class description, like all the other classes get some really nice AA/ focus that pertain directly to their classes.<br />
<br />
I don't think that shaman are asking that much in this regard, we only wanted to be treated as the other classes are treated and given the same perks. You've managed to castrate our effectiveness in a group like nothing before. Yes, we can still do our job decently well. But, so could a wizard without MB, etc, etc. We only want the perks that we've worked so hard to obtain by getting to 60 or 65 and raiding and doing all that hard work. <br />
<br />
Fix it, or compensate us. And do it soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. What about complete/incomplete heals or movement spells like gate/evac?<br />
<br />
- Did affliction work for snare btw? I assume so.<br />
- What foci affected mez/blur/harmony/lull? Affliction I assume since it applied to charm.<br />
- What about heals over time? I assume healing foci didn't affect them.<br />
- What foci affected lifetaps?<br />
<br />
Really, what they need is to break things down farther from the category that was affliction, since they seem to fall into varying groups.<br />
<br />
Mind affecting: charm/mez/lull<br />
Movement: root/snare<br />
Debuff: malo/cripple/slow/scent/decay<br />
DoT: um, what it says :)<br />
<br />
Four seems like too much tho. <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd vote for a focus effect line for charm/mez/harmony/lull/mem blur and a focus effect for all dots/debuffs - which may or may not include snare/root.<br />
<br />
Absor, make it so!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u197"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p197">Ok,<br />
Im sure Im going to lose every friend Ive ever made on this board after this post...but Enkebesh, is the only one of you whos using any logic in this argument.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand when a person is angered they get tunnel vision and its hard for them to see the bigger picture, but for everyone who is sooo quick to blame Sony about this...consider....<br />
<br />
One of the first lessons I learned in life is...ignorance is no excuse...period. If you do not know every detail about a thing...you have no business doing anything with it.<br />
<br />
I see everyone crying out rage, falling into two groups....<br />
<br />
1. Those that knew, some where deep down that this would be changed again someday. I mean c'mon...Sony SPELLED IT OUT FOR YOU in a patch message...sure 9 months ago, but it was there in BLACK AND WHITE. This is the group that knew the details of the effect and knew there was always going to be a chance it would change. I would say a -majority- of the player bases is WELL aware of game mechanics...down to number crunching...the effect info has been there for you to read since DAY1.<br />
<br />
2. Then we have the rest who aren't really involved with the mechanics...they wait for the hard-core players to explain things to them...they go solely on what they've been told, which most often proves to be myth. I find its generally not a good idea to trust in mass ideals...research them your self.<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion neither of these groups can blame Sony. Sony didn't allow you to believe these items were working as intended(as proven by the patch message that keeps popping up in this thread)...YOU let yourself believe this item was working as intended. Now, I understand this is a hard concept to understand for some...but back to my original point...ignorance of -the facts- is no excuse.<br />
<br />
I try to be as respectful as possible, especially on this board that Ive loved for info for three years. The info is few and far between now, one of the only valid arguments Ive read recently is removing the useless stat buffs from our 63-64 line-up. The rest is all bitching about this or that...it all boils down to some un thought !@#$! &quot;Im angry because I cant &quot;win&quot; at EQ.<br />
<br />
Im ready to take my medicine...let the Evel flames roll, but for anyone who looks at things with an adult perspective...you must see a point in taking responsibility for yourselves on this one. Sony has made -allot- of goofs in the past. Nobodies perfect, but Id say they give you a -damn- good product and piece of entertainment for a measly 12$ a month.../shrug. I sight more than warrants this kind of...&quot;The end is near...were all DOOMED&quot; type 5 page post. I really think that -this one- falls in the laps of the players to take responsibility on...think about it after you calm down.</div></div><hr />

Now, I understand this is a hard concept to understand for some...but back to my original point...ignorance of -the facts- is no excuse.<br />
Since when do the players have more responsibility than the developers for making sure their game is working correctly?  You're saying that we're all supposed to keep track of everything said in every patch message and other official statement?  I've been playing this game for nearly four years, and let me tell you, I couldn't even begin to tell you the vast majority of what was said in patch messages.  Some of it didn't apply to me at the time, so I learned later from interacting with the game and the other people.  Are you honestly trying to say that we are negligent because we paid attention to how the game worked?<br />
<br />
I don't intend to bash the developers.  I enjoy EQ, I enjoy my friends, and have never before been remotely tempted to quit.  I think they've got an ENORMOUS task keeping track of this huge game so I don't hold slipups against them.  What I DO hold find very upsetting is when I, the paying customer, am blamed for their mistakes.  <br />
<br />
It is not the responsibility of the players to make sure the game is working as intended.  If they had a list of outstanding bugs somewhere that we could consult then I could begin to see your point.  But they don't, and expecting us to track them all when half of the bugs are never announced and half of the bug fixes are never announced is patently absurd.<br />
<br />
Let me provide a few examples.  I challenge you to find me a patch message (heck, even any other clear official message) indicating that keyrings are working again.  You won't find one.  We were told about a year ago that keyrings were broken and we haven't heard anything since.  Are they still broken?  How much longer are we going to have to wait to find out?  Have you been using your keyring?  Would you be upset if you logged on and everything on there was gone?<br />
<br />
Even longer ago we were told that they didn't like the current proliferation of multiquesting and were looking at ways to remove it.  This was in the early Velious era, I believe.  Does that mean anyone who MQs anything, say jboots or part of their epic, is to blame if this is suddenly nerfed without warning and they lose all the money and effort they put into that item?  They made an official statement that MQ was not working as intended.  So sorry, Mr. Ranger, but the treant ate your shattered emerald.  That's what you get for not reading the entire four year history of the game before you started playing!<br />
<br />
Give me a break.  I understand that someone or a group of someones messed up here, it happens.  But how long are the customers who were not breaking any rules and were trusting the game content going to have to pay for it?<br />
<br />
Trusting the game content...I guess that was our mistake.  That, and trusting customer service to have any interest in serving the customer :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">Dandi, <br />
bro, reading every patch message since the beginning of EQ is -not- my point. My point is it IS your responsibility to understand what an effect is good for and what it dose...have you taken -any- time to read up and understand what the most basic element such as wisdom do to impact your character?<br />
<br />
How did you ever think that these items were actually to include slows, malo , ect..? You -have- to fall into on of those 2 groups...either you -knew- what the effect was and were part of the discussion, that I read very clearly right on this board, whether they were going to change this or not.....or you are one that let someone else tell you what these effects did...they were wrong...blame them.<br />
<br />
The player base got comfortable with a bug...I repeat the player base got comfortable with a bug....just because the duckling passed through the alligators mouth 100, 1000 or even 1000000 times doesn't mean the gators never going to snap down in it....it is a gator after all. If the duckling got comfortable and forgot the where it was...guess what...ducks fault.<br />
<br />
Once again though I realize this will be hard for some to grasp...especially if they are as angry as some of these posts Ive read.<br />
<br />
Edit:spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Slithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">&gt;&gt;1. Those that knew, some where deep down that this would be changed again someday. I mean c'mon...Sony SPELLED IT OUT FOR YOU in a patch message...sure 9 months ago, but it was there in BLACK AND WHITE. This is the group that knew the details of the effect and knew there was always going to be a chance it would change. I would say a -majority- of the player bases is WELL aware of game mechanics...down to number crunching...the effect info has been there for you to read since DAY1.<br />
<br />
Back then, quite a few people were upset by that and protested against it, pointing out how this left debuffs without something to boost them.  And so the nerf gets undone and it's back like it was.  No note in the patch message, but that's not unusual.<br />
<br />
People wonder if it's intentional.  They post about it.  No replies.  Time passes.  They post about it.  No replies.  More time passes.  They post about it.  No replies.  What the Affliction focus items do is posted left and right.  And even more time passes.  Verant looks at charms.  And now, suddenly, affliction items get noticed.<br />
<br />
It's not like they could possible miss this if they play the game at all.  Focus items are out there.  Lots of them.  They glow nicely.  They help a lot of classes.  So there's no way SoE could not know how these items are working, short of not playing caster classes, including hybrids.  I highly doubt they are all running around as warriors, monks, and rogues.<br />
<br />
The &quot;fix&quot; is stupid.<br />
<br />
1.  It's a knee jerk reaction to charm.  We know it even if they won't admit it.<br />
<br />
2.  DoTs?  People have already listed the stupidity of most of the focus effects for dots.  And they suggest adding some non-dot ones for debuffs.  It's like the reanimation focus items...a waste, summoning is all that is needed.  Spreading it out is stupid and a waste.<br />
<br />
3.  Time invested.  It's so obvious, so uncommented on by SoE, and been in so long that it is working as intended.  People spent serious time and bank to get these effects.  And now, due to reason 2...they are junk.  Now they want us all to go chase down a new lame effect?  Massive demand, little supply to start out with?  Screw that.<br />
<br />
4.  The nature of debuffs.  We have to refresh them early, so extension means nothing.  They won't boost the effects, making them more powerful...75% slow is all it's going to be.  Other spell types get double boosts.  They cut the cost and boost the effect.  This doesn't work for debuffs.  All we have is the cut cost.  What is wrong with us saving 25% of the mana cost compared to a nuker cutting 10% off the cost while increasing the boom 10%?<br />
<br />
People are upset and they have a right to be.  They got screwed for no reason.</div></div><hr />

My only question to you is...is it better to rely on the last know -fact- or rely on the assumptions of the masses? See thats my whole point in taking responsibility for ones self. Arguing this point is going to be a lost cause on this subject thought it seems.<br />
<br />
If you take a step back my friend...and read what you've just now written about Sonys motives, its almost -purely- assumptions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u204"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p204">Evel,<br />

I'm sorry but it is ridiculous to expect the players to keep track of the announced changes that are intended, the unannounced changes that are intended, the announced bugs, the unannounced bugs for thousands of mobs, NPC's, spells, effects and abilities when SOE provides no official information on them, no list of current bugs and in fact fills the parsable files with fake spells and effects and does not allow it's in game CS to provide accurate information when asked.<br />
<br />
I'm supposed to rely on the information on unofficial spoiler sites that have been historically inaccurate or filled with misinformation? Or is it that I'm supposed to keep track of Absor's ever waffling position by reading through the dev and testing boards everytime I want to play and take his word for it? If I did that I'd still be thinking they could never remove hell levels, that horses would never be in game, that dot's never ever caused a mobs corpse to poof, that manaburn was working as intended, etc...<br />
<br />
Wait, it was in one patch message you say, bah! A whole lot of things have been in the patch message that never went in game, went in the game and were taken back out or were changed again with no announcement, etc....<br />
<br />
So I would disagree that it is the players fault for not being properly informed.<br />

And not because of this &quot;bug fix,&quot; either. In fact, I can logically see it *is* a bug fix. I can understand the desire to fix any and all bugs that exist in a given piece of software.<br />
<br />
No, I'm retiring my Voodoo Dood because, with each new expansion and patch it becomes more and more clear that VI has absolutely NO regard for the people who choose to play Shamans. I can't remember a single instance, certainly no recent instance, where VI had enough regard for my playing enjoyment to even *tell* me they were reducing my character's power and desirability for groups/raids/guilds. They have been reducing our effectiveness, and adding little or nothing to the play-value of our class, and we usually only find out after one (or a great many) of us discover it in game. Then VI tells us they just forgot to mention a class-re-defining change. Of course they forgot. Why should they remember a change to a class they don't give one good GD about?<br />
<br />
So, since there doesn't seem to be any way to beat 'em, I'm gonna join 'em. Who cares about Shamans anyway? Guess I'll play my Monk some more.

Let's get this out of the way.  This is not a discussion about whether this was fair or who was to blame or about morality or anything so high and mighty.  This is their game- this is their world.  They can do whatever the hell they want, any time they want.  Got it?<br />
<br />
This is about the fact that a change was put in place which invalidates months of work by a sizable chunk of the player base.  It decreases the power of a entire class (actually a few classes) in a very real way.  And the class is pissed.  And they have a right to be.<br />

You are correct that I am responsible for understanding what something does before I claim that it is malfunctioning or cry foul when it doesn't work like I expected.  You are NOT correct that I do not have the right to rely on the way things function in the game as an indication of how things *should* function.<br />
<br />
You yourself are telling me that I should not rely on other players as a source of information.  I find that extremely unreasonable given that we're playing an interactive game where we're supposed to be interdependent on other people, but we'll assume for the sake of example you are right.  Other players are the source of the information on the vast majority of spoiler sites, so by your own reasoning that renders those spoiler sites not trustworthy.  What is left?  Sources that do not originate with other players.  The only such sources I can think of are Lucy and the developers.<br />
<br />
Ahh, Lucy.  I love Lucy, I think it's a wonderful tool.  But the last time I heard any hint of an official stance from the Powers That Be is that they discourage the use of spoilers.  This should be familiar to anyone from the pre-Kunark days who read their patch messages and the other official sources.  We were told that we were intended to get our information from playing the game.  Spoilers detracted from the immersiveness (Vision, anyone?) of the game, thereby diminishing our experience.  They couldn't stop us from creating and using spoilers, but it was clearly frowned upon.<br />
<br />
I never saw any patch message indicating otherwise.  In fact, I distinctly recall hearing something or other about how unhappy they were with Lucy's release, because it gave us access to information we were never intended to have.  Information we were supposed to acquire over the course of playing the game.  Not testing the game, playing it.  (Barring the Test server, of course.)<br />
<br />
What does that leave?  Fan faires and posts to unofficial communities don't count, because they were not deliberately set before the entire player base as something we need to know.  Developer's Corner?  Yes, it should be reliable.  No, it should not be required reading.  That leaves patch messages.<br />
<br />
All I can say about patch messages is they are not reliable.  They are useful for relaying precise bits of information relevant to the short term.  But both small and large things change.  As we are so often told, Everquest is a dynamic game and we should expect things to change.  You know darn well how often we're told something is working that isn't, and vice versa.  We were told that affliction focus items had been changed and should no longer work with dots.  When they started working with dots again, were we told that was due to the bug recurring?  No.  Did people ask and go unanswered?  Yes.  Have they ever made a change that benefited us without telling us so?  Yes.  Is it smart of us to wait a bit and see if they fix it again before investing too heavily in it?  Of course.  Is it reasonable to expect us to wait eight months?  No.  People forget things after a few weeks.  New players come in.  People start using the items that weren't before.  Completely new items with the very same bug/feature are introduced as part of an expansion for which we pay additional money.  An eight month old patch message does not adequate communication make.<br />
<br />
Some people say we're overreacting.  The point is not that shamans are now a useless class.  The point is not that everyone working at Sony is a Bad Person because they did this mean thing to us.  The point is that we are paying customers who are suffering a significant loss of value in our investment of time and money in this game because there was inadequate quality control in the game and inadequate communication between the game developers and the customers.  The point is that we are suffering severe consequences for something that should not be our responsibility.<br />

But the matter still remains, unreliable or not, the last patch message regarding this indicated this was -not- intentional. Call it what you will, but for all intents and purposes this is &quot;fact&quot;. Sony never reversed this claim in 9 months, although these items kept functioning with slows, malo. This -still- puts the responsibility of the player base -assuming- Sony decided to change them over to work with slow...with the player base. There are hundreds...Id guess more like thousands of players who crunch this game down into scientific data.... Meaning there -are- players in the know...this is where most player driven info is spawned from...is most of it 100% correct without being able to be proven with spell dat or official words from Sony....guess its up to you to decide...just, as Ive said before, be prepared to be disappointed when you believe the masses and then find out the -truth-.</div></div><hr />

B) If you won't correct your MISTAKE of creating Slow Mit. then give shamans a INNATE CLASS ABILITY(that means DO NOT give us this as a AA it should be a free) +% to aviod some of the worst effects of Slow Mit. say +25% to all slows.<br />
<br />
C) Add Crit Slows as a class or AA ability.<br />
<br />
2.<br />
A) Give us a upgraded magic based slow, say 85-90%. Give Us a 65-70% LURE based slow. redo the PoP shaman spells, they are a damn insult, even if you did upgrade slow in this manner.<br />
<br />
B) If you won't do 1A or 1B then give us a bane type slow that is atlest 100% verus mobs that have slow mit. and let the mob mit. it down to acceptable levels.<br />
<br />
3.<br />
A) Stop lieing and form replying to us, this just makes it worst. Honestly Absor you getting almost as bad as the bastard that came before you. Would you like to see everyone using sigs along the line of How do you know something is a lie infested peice of bull****? AbsorEQ wrote it.<br />
<br />
B) Have the Dev team stop smoking crack for a few hours and go to boards, READ them and POST on them, hell maybe even ask for input form the class base(and really read it.)???? I know thats a scary and new idea.<br />
<br />
C) Have the Dev team go to class channels in game or create their own and LISTEN to the player base. Remember to let everyone know when your going to do this. yeah you might be abused the first few times(you have earned it), but I promise you if you show you are listening that will stop. AND DO NOT LIE,  DO NOT PROMISE THINGS YOU CAN NOT OR WILL NOT DO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I have said my peice, even thought I am damn sure it won't do a bit of good, I will have a heartattack if LiesorEQ even bothers to form reply to it.<br />

[B]The Hyena Shaman: &quot;Absor, you realize that these are now the only classes of spells with no I - IV focus effects?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not really. What about complete/incomplete heals or movement spells like gate/evac?<br />
<br />
Got me there. Port-type spells got no focus, and our % heals were purposefully omitted from healing focus<br />
<br />
- Did affliction work for snare btw? I assume so.<br />
 Yup, it did. <br />
- What foci affected mez/blur/harmony/lull? Affliction I assume since it applied to charm.<br />
Again, yup.<br />
- What about heals over time? I assume healing foci didn't affect them.<br />
Hmm, I forget. I know the &quot;Enhancement&quot; foci worked on torpor, presumably on the other HoT spells as well. Also pretty sure the Healing foci effected each &quot;wave&quot; of healing, sort of like how damage foci affect rain spells.<br />
- What foci affected lifetaps?<br />
Okay, please no necros / SK jump on me for this... But I'm pretty sure both Improved healing and improved damage worked with these. If I'm wrong, feel free to hit me with a frozen mullet.<br />
<br />
Really, what they need is to break things down farther from the category that was affliction, since they seem to fall into varying groups.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Four seems like too much tho. <br />
<br />
How about three, then? The original DoT one (And make it GOOD, people, yeesh... Even necro DoTs are kinda lame in hte upper end of things), one for charms (Heh, riiiiight) and one for &quot;incapacitating&quot; effects like slows, weakens, mez, snare...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't care if they announced the upcoming change every hour on the hour since the the game shipped.  <br />
<br />
Do you understand?  I'm pissed about the CHANGE, not the notification of the change.   If Verant had decided to fix the charm problem by removing charm from the game entirely, you'd be making the same f*cking arguments (&quot;They said it was overpowered- you should have known!&quot;) <br />
<br />
The lack of better communication is irksome because it indicates a lack of respect for our class and a lack of understanding of the scope of the change- but it's not the core issue.  People didn't get pissed off when the patch message first said it only worked on DoTs because PATCH MESSAGES LIE.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that SOE can do anything they want to EQ at any time.  I, as a customer, have a right to express my frustration through the channels available to me.   I choose to do this as a precursor to quitting, because I enjoy the game and don't want to have to quit as the ultimate protest.<br />
<br />
Expressing frustration about a change in game mechanics is not ignorance.  <br />
Expressing frustration about a lack of clear communication is not ignorance.  <br />
Expressing frustration that the game I play for enjoyment is being made less fun is not ignorance.  <br />
<br />
Prattling on that we as a class should just accept all of these things just because it was in a patch message long ago is fanbois.</div></div><hr />

You cannot read?<br />
<br />
On 19 Nov patch, it said Affliction focus 4 items were working as intended.<br />
<br />
Before 19 Nov, Malo, Turgur and such spells were not affected by affliction focus lvl 4 items.  After the patch, they were affected.<br />
<br />
Is this a misrepresentation?<br />
<br />
Even in real life, if a company allows something to go on like as if it should be for 9 months, the company would be held liablle for it.<br />
<br />
If it is a bug, it should have been made known to us constantly and not sending to us mixed signals.<br />
<br />
The mechanics of the game are supposed to be discovered by players in the game itself.  This is what Verant always tells us.<br />
<br />
Many players spent their hard-earned pp and time questing for items and now they are screwed.<br />

Wait a sec.  You're saying that all players should read Lucy (a website NOT AFFLIATED with SOE) for EVERY spell/focus effect/item in the game instead of believing a patch message where SOE stated that Affliction IV items were working properly while affecting debuffs?<br />
<br />
Just a note, doesn't SOE frown on players using Lucy?   I thought they didn't like us to sniff after spells that way.  Haven't they said countless times, &quot;don't trust Lucy?&quot;  Now you're saying, trust Lucy, don't trust the company sponsored patch messages.<br />
<br />
I know this is going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but I would estimate only a tiny fraction of all EQ players utilize the web to the extent that some of us who post here do.  They just log in and PLAY.  <br />
<br />
The due diligence rests on SOE to keep us informed, not on player run websites, not on ShowEQ, not on messageboards.  What I see is nine months ago, they fixed focus effects not to work with debuffs with a small note saying they weren't intended to work with debuffs.  There was a small outcry.  All of a sudden, affliction focus items were working with debuffs again, dead silence from SOE.  <br />
<br />
9 months passed, more affliction items were put in the game that worked with debuffs.  A patch message stated that affliction IV items were working properly (while affecting debuffs).  <br />
<br />
In a way, I'm not mad so much that my nice trinkets took a header into suckville, I'm mad because SOE is sloppy and lazy and makes a habit out of alienating players.    They didn't fix this &quot;bug&quot; just out of the goodness of their heart, with the pure and noble intention of removing bugs from the game.  They fixed this bug to nerf enchanters and we got caught in it.  If enchanters weren't charm soloing for oodles of AA a day, would this change have been implemented, I DOUBT IT.<br />
<br />
If this had been fixed promptly 8 months ago, it would have been a tiny ripple.  By being sloppy and lazy, SOE created a tsunami.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the best argument Ive seen so far Wisey, and I agree with you...who knows what kind of mistake was made here...but from the raw effect description from the beginning....the true effect is pretty clear in my opinion.<br />
<br />
And just as a different perspective on that quote...they didn't specifically say &quot;working with slow-malo&quot; they said working as intended...which would imply that slow -is- intended...but if you think about it more deeply...they were &quot;bugged&quot; when they got 4 working like 1-3. So simply saying that 4 is now working like 1-3 would have been a better way to say it imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tukk,<br />
<br />
You hit it on hte head there. 100% - Honestly, I could care less about the focus item stuff (I don't have any ;)  ) But the simple fact that SoE has been giving us crap, and not even the courtesey of &quot;Uh, hi, Shaman? We don't like you, eat a bag of nerf, k thx&quot; like they did with Monks, like they were going to do with Paladins... Remeber THAT? How about the manaburn and rod-nerfing, Mages and Wizards got a heads-up there<br />
<br />
First it's the stupid sub-druid heals... We were led to believe there would be equal healing. But okay, we get Slow, right?<br />
<br />
Then it's slow mitigation. SoE refuses knowledge of it, despite parsing proof. Finally they admit it and spend 4 months working on four lines of text to let us know about it.<br />
<br />
oops, five lines of text, turns out things were being hasted by slow. How fun! If they hadn't put that line of text in, we'd still be hasting Druzzil Ro. Thankfully they noticed that was poking out from under the fig leaf and fixed it.<br />
<br />
And let's not forget that we still have some of the rarest spells out there (Screw Torpor, look at simple things like Primal Essence and Levitation), and the ones we can get easily... Well I dunno guys, Gindan, Daiku, and Wrulan make up for ALL of this, right? Guys? Heloooo?<br />
<br />
And now an indirect nerf that yanks almost a year's worth of focus items from not one, but two classes, in order to deal with people complaining about how poerful charm soloing is (Remember back when we were EQ gods for killing Yeldema? Same with modern enchanters. Huzzah for the Chanters)<br />
<br />
Frankly the Shaman class is looking like a blind man's dart board. They're screwing with us, and i don't even think they really know they are. it's amazing. Weee, look at the alchemy trophy.<br />
<br />
Dandi,<br />
<br />
Another good point. Retroactive punishment is retarded. Some of us have put hundreds of raid points down for these items, spent months questing them, or spent a ton of plat either skilling up to make them, or buy them from someone else who did. Will there be any compensation? Many Shaman and enchanters are now packing items that have crap stats with a crap focus effect, and are thus only worth a bare fraction of what they previously were.<br />
<br />
However, on the wild chance that this WILL be changed back... This is the time to buy people. Skulls, gem-crusted rings, you name it, stock up on your Affliction focus while they're cheap. You never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Arnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">What really concerns me is the time that SoE has wasted. If they waste my time I'll be upset. But if they cause me to waste my friends' time, then that is completely unacceptable!  By letting this &quot;bug&quot; persist for so long, SoE implied that afflicion focus items were designed to affect slow/malo/etc and it was perfectly reasonable for players to plan and act accordingly.<br />
<br />
True, Evel, SoE did not come out and state they had changed their minds and were now going to let affliction focus items work on debuffs, but they condoned their functionality for 8 months and how could we have known they would change their minds again?<br />

As has been communicated to me in a couple of threads - Lucy takes the data from EQ files and displays it as best they can interpret.  Basically - there are numerical flags that get translated into phrases.  For example, 10 might = Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 10%.  But as has been discussed on this board - that really ought to say &quot;Decrease Spell Mana Cost by UP TO 10%&quot;, because it is variable - not a fixed 10% every cast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed)&quot; isn't really descriptive enough for us to read that it means &quot;only works on DoTs&quot;.  It could very easily be read &quot;includes DoTs&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Im stating here for you now that...its a much better idea to try to get a positive change than simply go up in arms over something that was bound to happen. Hows that for a better response?Focus on the bigger picture here bro<br />
<br />
..if you cant &quot;You are either an a**hole, or a moron. &quot;<br />
<br />
Gloriana,<br />
Wisey brought up the point of Aff 4 &quot;working as intended&quot; and its a good point...but if you look at it alittle more closely when they got 4 working -like- its sibling 1-3.....1-3 was still *bugged*...either not saying anything or stating that 4 was working in-line with 1-3 would have been much clearer imo. Using &quot;spoiler&quot; sights is beyond my point here....and as a side note Ive never heard of Sony frowning on players using Lucy..Id venture a guess that Lucy would not be up, running and open to the public if they did. Take it for what you will...EVEN lUCY IS REALLY BEYOND MY POINT HERE<br />
<br />
Look, my point here...and Im going to state it one last time...is that simply 'not knowing the facts' is no excuse when the facts -are- out there....if you rely on what the masses tell you...expect to get burned from time to time....assumptions are a very sketchy business.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This concerns my point. Im not directing this at you, but to all shaman that refuse to face up to fact the player base is at fault for -assuming- they were giving these effects to slow-malo...basically...you took a gamble...either by making this assumption yourself or buying into what the masses told you. My point is blame them or blame yourself....No, Im not an EQ rep lol, but I am one who realizes at some point...you have to take responsibility for your own mistakes...Sony gave you a patch (and if were going to include the misleading message on Nov 19 that scales the 9 months back to 2.3/4 months in the months of equip decision argument) message and the info is out there.....<br />
<br />
It cannot be argued that this came as a -shock- to a large portion of the shaman community...allot were involved in the discussion of its true intended effect and allot new this dark cloud has been looming over Affliction X slowing-maloing since the start.</div></div><hr />

If the way that the vast majority of the players understand the game is so faulty, as you say it is since you insist we can't trust them, then obviously the current system of telling us what we need to know is not working.<br />
<br />
And don't even try to say that it's that we're all too dumb or ignorant.  When 90+% of the customers aren't getting the message, the customers are not the ones at fault.<br />

Oh, and btw, about ignorance, you said: <br />
...ignorance is defined by one ignoring the facts....<br />
That is incorrect.  Ignorance is defined as not knowing or understanding the facts.  All it means when you know, understand, and still ignore the facts is your arguments are going to be so full of holes that you're going to wind up running in circles to avoid falling in.

The &quot;facts&quot;:<br />

It worked on ALL detrminental spells.<br />
VI changed it and the patch message stated they had changed it to only function on DoTs.<br />
VI changed it BACK to affecting all detrimental spells.<br />

Though you are correct in saying damaging it also means harmful or negatively effecting. So by your own logic it can be applied to slows and debuffs.<br />

It's quite clear that you won't be moved in your opinion as others won't in theirs. This is good as a frank and honest discussion should lead to progression. <br />

haha If it makes you feel any better...standing almost totally alone on this is tough, I can imagine the Crucible lynching coming for Evel...mods, punish me for having a different opinion if you'd like....but I still stand by the conviction <br />
<br />
Even though I didn't fully agree with your statements I respected them, now all I want to know is. Do you want some help getting back on that cross?<br />
Dialogue for no other reason than to boost ones ego is not dialogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u241"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p241">Moyes,<br />
didn't see your post so I have to reply to it to...Im never getting out of here heh...anyway....The effect of slowing a mob will help cause detriment to  it....let me pull up the Webster definition for you....<br />
<br />
<br />
Merriam Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary, 10th Edition  <br />
<br />
Main Entry: 1det·ri·men·tal <br />
Pronunciation: &quot;de-tr&amp;-'men-t&amp;l<br />
Function: adjective<br />
Date: 1590<br />
: obviously harmful : DAMAGING -the detrimental effects of pollution-<br />
<br />
It means almost literally damage over time.<br />
<br />
And Im far from omnipotent...one really doesn't need to assume anything if your serious about understanding the facts of a matter. I honestly knew posting this I would never cut through this wall of bitterness...no chance no way...but I do have a point...and its not 'knee jerk' its not emotional....maybe try rto see it? Im sure some have at least tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">Evel,<br />
<br />
it's a cross you've chosen to bear, martyr-boy, don't sniffle and weep over your own choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u243"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p243">If you've read into -any- of my post on this can you really make this statement?<br />
&quot;Dialogue for no other reason than to boost ones ego is not dialogue.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think thats what Im getting at? Hardly....granted my lone stance has motivated to post more than I maybe should have...I stand by my original point 100%<br />
<br />
Edit for The Hyena Shaman:<br />
<br />
I got a kick out of the &quot;cross&quot; comment from Moyes because its absurd, but when others jump on the band wagon and use the same &quot;dis&quot; it becomes lacking my friend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u244"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p244">Allow me to quote Merriam also,as I'm sure you must have seen this also then.<br />
<br />
Merriam Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary, 10th Edition  <br />
<br />
Main Entry: 2detrimental<br />
Function: noun<br />
Date: 1831<br />
: an undesirable or harmful person or thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
If  a slow that reduces a &quot;mobs&quot; damage by 75% max isn't an undesireable or harmful thing,then I stand corrected. I know full well that when I get slowed I regard it as harmful and undisireable.Then again I'm using an assumption based upon my own experiences, so my bad again?<br />
<br />
So while in your example it means almsot literally damage over time. In mine it means almost literally slows and debuffs.<br />
<br />
Edit.<br />
Just noticed your remark about my absurd &quot;cross&quot; comment.<br />
It was you who stated that standing alone is tough. Why was there any need to highlight your stance, it's obvious from your posts. Highlighting it in an almost martyristic way was tacky at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u245"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p245">Judest Priest...to harm is to damage...the -effect- of slowing will help -cause- detriment to a target. Im not an attention seeker...I have to give it a rest for the night..btw your example is a noun(person place or thing...were looking for adj here :) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Evel The martyr-boy of Sony <br />
out<br />
<br />
Edit for Moyes: Highlighting that point was to say I am genuinely nervous about mods being emotionally involved with this issue and punishing me...Not to say they would, but who know....regardless Ill still stand by what I think is a valid argument..ment to get the people who aren't 'in the know' actually to think for themselves and not just take the Sony is killing us posture like -everyone- else....Once again an -assumption- ............put me &quot;on a cross&quot; Human nature is funny like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u247"><b>Uusal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p247">I went to BoT today and watched a group of 2 chanters and 1 cleric kill 10 giants in the time it took for my 9 people to recover from a wipe (7min). I got so furiuos about my favorite gear, stuff I spent hours and days and months to get nerfed to uselessness. Yet this 3 group could still totally exploit a truly broken spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">OK<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Evel = Absor.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Good night Crucible....theres always hope for a new tomarrow.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">Last post for the night as it's far to early.<br />
See this is where the argument has arisen from.<br />
<br />
Noun or adjective are both correct uses depending how you interpret it.<br />
This is what I was refering to, the way they SoE have a lot of things flagged is ambiguous at best. And by definiton open to assumption and interpretation.<br />
If anything is to be learned from this its...............<br />
Don't make any assumptions no matter how rational they seem.<br />
The most foolish course of action is normally the easiest and most widley used.<br />
<br />
About you're feelings  as regards the moderators here.<br />
I'm sorry you feel that way about the moderators here. And I think you malign and do a great disservice to them by thinking that.But that is by the by and an opinion you are free to have.<br />
<br />
I applaud the fatc that you've managed to put your ideas across calmly and rationally albeit with the odd faux pas.This is good for the whole community at large.<br />
<br />
Take note though that..............<br />
&quot;I may disagrre whole heartedly with what you say, but I'll defend your right to say it till my dying breath&quot;<br />
Paraphrased from someone, I can neither nor care to remember at this moment in time.<br />
Also at tyhe end of the day we're arguing over nothing more than bits of data and spangly colours, while the world could end tomorrow.You're right on one thing human nature is funny like that.<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">its a shame that chanters are so woefully overpowered taht they think nerfing something that obviously had no effect on them. i dont use any focuses so i wont miss this, but its still crappy.</div></div><hr />
