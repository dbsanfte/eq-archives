<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>judelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey,<br />
<br />
All of you ubers and sorta ubers, how about passin down some helpful hints. I'm a 17 (almost 18) Barb shammy currently camped on the gnoll side of Highpass. Probs are I can solo 1 sometimes two gnolls but they have a tendency to pull their buds in and its a dash for the zone line. My spells at this point are sorta feeble and I rely on my 1hb or piercing to carry the day. I know at 19 I get a better healing spell and a decent DoT but I'm trying to solo til then and its slow cause I have to heal and med after every melee.<br />
My armour is ry'gorr and i have a jade chokidai prod and a jewel encrusted scepter. I also have one of those glowing shield that have mana and wis.(sorry forgot the name) Anyway i know that most shammies would kill for a setup like mine but that armour only protects so far and in straight up melee you take some serious dents. Anyway, Any directions would be appreciated.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been a while, but don't you have the Drowzy spell at 17 (may have Walking Sleep as well).  I find that slowing the mobs is absolutley essential when I am soloing/meleeing.  Cast Drowzy to pull them, cast a DoT (sicken or tainted breath?) and have your cold based nuke ready as well.  Seems like you have great equipment, just try using your full line-up of spells.   <br />
<br />
From my experience, as a Shaman, after level 5 or so you will never really be able to rely solely on melee skills, use those spells!!!!!!<br />

Personally, I found the gnoll side of HHP boring.  Spawns too spread out.  I loved the Orc groups on the Kithicor Woods side of the zone, GREAT exp. spot for levels 16-19 or so.  I'd go group over there...../shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe you should group for a while, as there are some stretches in the early days when soloing can be really painful. I remember that right before level 19 was pretty tough, since the heal spell was so weak, and between levels 29 and 34 were also tough (for soloing). Your gear does sound great for your level. Slowing the mobs may be useful to you, but keep the nukes/dots memmed as well. Maybe pull with the slow spells, add a dot, melee a bit and if you're taking too much heat, root the mob, back up a bit for either a heal or nuke the mob and then get back to meleeing. Root probably won't last long, but if you're having some success at getting it to stick, try root/dotting tough mobs. Medding for part of the fight will reduce the med times after the fight, which is a good thing. :) If this is still too slow, your best bet is to find a good group and power out a few levels and get your new spells. In general though, soloing before you get the pet is going to be slow. Regen and canni will help some at level 24, but even then, there will be quite a bit of downtime. The pet, at level 34, will really help alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great equipment...I had great fortune soloing on Kerra Island from 15-19.  I only fought the 3 wharf rats.  (the one inside is tougher)  Great experience, no one in the zone.  I was getting a level in about 2 days playing 2 hrs a night.  Good luck!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I swear, Paludal Caverns are the best exp form 18-25 ever. Just port up to Nexus and run into Shadowhaven. From Shadowhaven you can run into Paludal (after binding or hitting up the soulbinder). Paludal is home to a pair of camps of theives, and yes they DO backstab. At your lvl it DOES hurt. :rolleyes: <br />

Soloing crocs in oasis i think was still good exp at 18, but its a bit repetitive i spose. Hmm... i was a broodling of the LOIO gang, where i went EC&gt;Nro&gt;Oasis&gt;LOIO&gt;FM&gt;OT&gt;DL... then i broke the cycle and soloed 51+52 in Cobalt Scar :D. Try to go some places the majority dont, its alot more fun to discover for yourself =)</div></div><hr />
