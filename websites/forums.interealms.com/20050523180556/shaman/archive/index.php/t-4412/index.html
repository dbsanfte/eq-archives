<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, been reading this board for two years and have never posted an &quot;equipment advice&quot; thread, so give me a bit of a break.<br />

I intend to swap the +6WIS ring for AC/HP ring ASAP, it's just laziness that I haven't done it already.  My range slot item could use some work, suggestions welcome.  Other than that I'm reasonably happy with each item, but but my overall AC is just over 900 self-buffed and I would like to take it to 1000+, so that means some of my slots have to change pretty significantly.  <br />
<br />
My WIS has rocketed in the past 2 months from the 160 or so it was stuck at seemingly forever to 200 with bearform, so I have some room to sacrifice WIS for AC/HP.<br />
<br />
I don't have a lot of cash and would like to save what I have for spells in the coming levels, so I'd prefer campable items, but I'll take suggestions for relatively inexpensive bazaar camps as well.<br />
<br />
My guild's raid limit for ToV is 55+, so I've just barely gotten into that range.  I can hope for some ToV armor drops, but frankly we have a lot of people that raid more than me and I can't count on armor from there (although I may get lucky).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your comments.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">some form of the legs from dragons in WW.<br />
Chitonous(sp?) Belt from FG.<br />
Bene Talisman from Scout quest for range or the one from chieften in ME.<br />
POTC quest earring if you know lots of people in guild that have the tradeskills can be cheap.<br />
What Seredith said. <br />
For the rest I would wait on TOV armor.</div></div><hr />

Here is what I would suggest.  <br />
<br />
1.) PoTC earing (network with your guild crafters, farm stuff crafters need)   My earing cost me like 3k total.<br />
<br />
2.) Swapp your Barbed Rubi Bracer (sell it) for a Coldain Military Wristguard (yes you loose a little ac, but you get extended affliction  3 and trust me that is huge)  (I'll gladly help you with that quest, got my faction mule parked in the right spot).<br />
<br />
3.) Buy or camp a IGS (Imbued Granite Spaulders) You will LOVE the resists and the Ac.<br />
<br />
4.) Get a better range item.  Heck, if you have wis to spare you can't go wrong with an Idol of the Thorned (camp yourself and have your alts get xp, or buy for like 3k).<br />
<br />
5.)  Shadel Bandit Ring is your friend.<br />
<br />
6.) Crystal Chitin Guantlets are sweet.<br />
<br />
7.) Try to get the Deathmask of the Elysians, chrystal spider eye is ok too.<br />
<br />
That should boost your ac quite nicely.  To really break 1k ac you will need some Thurg/ SS / Kael / PoG armor.<br />

Yeah, I figured that, but that will come sometime and I want to do what I can so when it does come I'm there.<br />

Hehe was that ever in doubt?  I've been over 50 for six months!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't see Magelo (javascript suxxors) so I don't know what you've currently got in range.<br />
<br />
But how about a Goranga Idol - either hunt in ME for one yourself or just hang around the zoneline and buff/heal people and wait for an unwanted one to drop.<br />
<br />
I know if I was hunting in ME and an idol dropped, I'd rather give it to a 50+ shaman who actually had business in the zone than the level 20 monk who's been badly feigning next to my group and asking for an idol for the last 2 hours.<br />
<br />
oops, rant off :)</div></div><hr />
