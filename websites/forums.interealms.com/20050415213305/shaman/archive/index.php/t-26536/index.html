<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all, I already know that this is likely to do no good.  If you want to point out the futility of even trying, though, I am not interested in listening.  I have just as much right to waste my time on this as you do on stuff.  So:  take your &quot;this is a big waste of time&quot; comments elsewhere, tnx.  If you are not interested in participating I bear you no grudge; but go away.<br />
<br />
Assumptions.<br />
<br />
1.  SoL/SoP is the one and only spell line we get for DoN.  Therefore it should be a sexy spell line for soloing shamans, and for shamans who do casual groups, and for shamans who do serious heavy duty exp grind groups, and for shamans who are moderate raiders, and for shamans who are hard core raiders.  Some have very high power gear and some have bazaar gear.  No solution is a good solution if it works well for one segment of the community but is poor for another segment of the community.<br />
<br />
2.  Shaman power should scale with level, equipment, aa, and skill.  Other things being equal, a shaman with better gear should be able to exert more power than someone with lesser gear; a shaman with 500 aa should be able to do things a shaman with 50 aa cannot; a shaman who knows exactly when to cast a spell should be able to get more done than a shaman who isn't sure what to do in certain situations, and so on.<br />
<br />
Goal.  We want to reenvision SoL/SoP into a spell <br />
<br />
....which has good utility for all styles and levels of shaman  <br />
....which will scale<br />
....which will meet Rytan's feeling about how much buffing power shamans should have.  <br />
<br />
It WILL NOT WORK to come up with a solution that YOU would be happy with, based on your playstyle.  The goal is to come up with a solution that makes this a good spell line for all shamans.  <br />
<br />
In this thread I hope to facilitate discussion among thoughtful shamans who want to explore how to make this spell usable across the range of levels, gears, and playstyles.<br />
<br />
It began as a spell that fulfilled all the requirements:  it was useful for everyone, it was most powerful for those with deep mana pools and extension aa, and SOE was proud they had invented it.  It received the nerf of death with the 30 second recast delay, making it very hard for anyone to use it well, and giving it exactly the same power for everyone (you can have it on three people, that's it, I don't care how uber you are).  It now has received the triple nerf:  pet proc rate reduced, damage reduced, group only.  And we are all mostly reeling from the mood swings of the last few days.<br />
<br />
I am open to lots of suggestions.  I ask that people seriously listen to each other, and give real consideration to other people's ideas.  I encourage us not to rush to judgment:  &quot;Your idea is stupid!!&quot;  Instead, I urge us to see what it is about each idea that moved a person to propose it.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you are going to vote at the end, or pick a strategy, or what.  We'll figure that out in the next couple of days I guess.<br />
<br />
Tools.  These are items that can be varied, in order to change the power and usability of the spell in various ways.<br />
<br />
Allowable targets for spell.  <br />
Mana cost.<br />
Duration of the spell.<br />
Damage caused by the proc.<br />
Frequency of the proc.<br />
Recast delay.<br />
Aggro caused.<br />
Other ...<br />
<br />
Process.  I'm going to post this and go to bed, it's been too long a day for me already.  I invite you to respond <br />
....because you are interested in helping this project<br />
....because you have a suggestion<br />
....because you want to respond to somebody else's suggestion<br />
....because you want to ask a question<br />
<br />
Good luck to us all.  See you in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">im very interested in this.  and if panther has infact been nerfed into oblivion...which it is to me if all the nerfs go as planned.  i think the only bon that can be thown out is modifying other spells or gear.  like TA clickable from inventory, reduced recast on malos, quickened mgb/ a second mgb ability...since we have alot of buffs to cast now, and and 1 mgb doest cut it, and possibly a bigger aa canni/crit canni, or something along those lines...when im trying to make mana fast, 3 minmute canni5 and long recast pained memory just gets it back a little slow...especially since the super high maintenece costs of spells like champion and panther.  <br />
Panther is probably dead...fine, i got to solo some mobs that was previously not do able by shaman (but still easy solos by alot of others..but were balanced) and was actively sought after in group situations becuase the extra dps was noticable when groups had a weak cleric,, tank, dps class.<br />
has anything been offered in the class reenvisioning along shaman lines besides panther for lower lvls (which wont help them now) and the &quot;dunno wha to do with your heals causew you can slow&quot; bit.  it seems that classes who didnt really need much are getting very nice upgrades (beastlords are a great example, and most directly affect our futures)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Make it group only and leave the rest as is.<br />
<br />
Why? Because this keeps group functionality the same and soloing the same. The only difference comes in raids.<br />
<br />
For raiding, it was evident that there was no way that Rytan was gonna let us chain Panther for 900 DPS (topping out during a raid). I think 300 DPS is exceptionally low for an optimized group, so I think that I'm willing to compromise with Rytan and top out at 500 DPS. I'm also able to control my mana better and do my other shaman duties while pumping out this 500 DPS number and I don't have to bust ass to do it. However, I will have to bug my raid leaders to make specialized groups depending on where they want Panther to be used. ie. MT group, DPS group.<br />
<br />
The &quot;wow&quot; factor of this spell came in the 550 spam during a boss kill. Evidently SoE will not allow this to stay, so at least let us have some 550 spam in our own group.<br />
<br />
This suggestion also allows us to scale. Because there are still people complaining about not being able to maintain it on 3 targets, immediately that gives you room to move up to 5. Also, once you have 5 targets, the more gear/aa you have, the more time/mana you have that you can spend elsewhere, such as healing/slowing/DoTing. A increased spell haste item opens up several seconds which'll give you time to throw in a DoT or something. More mana allows you to nuke, or add an extra heal.<br />
<br />
No, you can't mana burn anymore, but I can no longer think of a good solution that'll satisfy Rytan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's something I'd like to point out first of all:<br />
<br />
2. Shaman power should scale with level, equipment, aa, and skill.<br />
<br />
It began as a spell that fulfilled all the requirements: it was useful for everyone, it was most powerful for those with deep mana pools and extension aa, and SOE was proud they had invented it.<br />
<br />
My friend Blazz might call me a pessimist, but this lack of scaling and the limited stacking, which as we all know prevents Panther from exceeding a certain amount of DPS based on the number of &quot;recipients, were two of the major issues I brought up *before* this line went live and which I'd mainly like to see adressed.<br />
<br />
Panther scaling with equipment:<br />
<br />
Panther has always been a relative &quot;static&quot; DPS tool. If you want to believe that 12 seconds of extension(with the best beneficial extension focus) actually meant that the spell &quot;scaled&quot; with gear, feel free to do so, but it's hardly the case in my opinion. And while you may actually have had a really miniscule DPS increase on a raid on average(maybe one more person per cycle for ONE Shaman), this was absolutely and undisputable never the case in a group or soloing scenario, since you didn't have enough targets.<br />
<br />
On top of that Panther would always add the same DPS, from when you got the spell till you actually got an upgrade to it. My DoTs and even my nukes are becoming better DPS wise and even in regards to total damage(for DoTs) the further I progress.<br />
<br />
Panther scaling with AAs:<br />
<br />
While not every Shaman has SCRM, I'd say most do, as it's 3+ years old and was certainly not designed to boost Panther. No AA was introduced with Panther to modify its duration or base damage, proc rate whatsoever.<br />
But even if we pretended SCRM was that AA that helped Panther scaling in terms of power, it was still only actually noticable on raids, since it simply allowed you to mantain more people per cycle and upping the total DPS of ONE Shaman(and it didn't matter in case you had enough Shamans to reach saturation in less than 60 seconds), but for grouping and soloing it didn't boost DPS one bit.<br />
<br />
That said, like you rightfully suggested, Panther's power should scale with gear and AAs and there's really only one thing to do, in order to ensure that and that's to introduce AAs and foci that directly affect Panther's base damage the same way other DD spells are affected(DD foci could start affecting procs again, which should be quite easy to code and a Shaman AA named &quot;Panther's fury&quot; or whatever could up the base damage of the spell by x % per level). <br />
<br />
Increasing its proc rate might actually be detrimental with more and more proc buffs being introduced and 10 procs/minute seems quite reasonable, so I'd like to dismiss that option.<br />
<br />
This would be the first step. It would also mean that the Panther line would become an integral part of a Shaman's arsenal and basically be somewhat class defining(if this should not be SoEs intention, they sure won't design AAs or foci for it).<br />
<br />
The second step would be to make pets scale accordingly after this change. <br />
Pets would not be able to equip DD foci to increase Panther's damage on their part and only benefit from the Shaman's &quot;Panther's Fury&quot; AA, but it could be solved by making pets proc more often from the start(just to be on par with the average DD focus equipped PC).<br />
<br />
The third step would be to make Shaman pets have an additionally increased proc rate(innately higher dex for wolves) to allow Shamans to stack better when in a DPS role, mainly relying on their own pet to do the intended damage when a group doesn't offer enough targets for more than 1 Shaman.<br />
<br />
Example to explain the stacking issue: <br />
<br />
Shaman, Shaman, Cleric, Warrior, Wizard, Rogue group. One of the 2 Shamans could easily keep his own pet, Warrior and Rogue buffed with Panther, but the second Shaman would only be left with his own pet as a recipient.<br />
<br />
As a result Shaman A would currently(after the patch anyway) add 146 DPS(I think Panther was quoted to be 73 DPS by Rytan after the patch)via Panther through the 2 melees and another 60ish maybe through his own pet for a total of 206 DPS. Shaman B would only be able to add 60 DPS via Panther through his own pet.<br />
<br />
By upping the Shamans' pet proc rate to be 3 times as high as a PC's(or basically what it originally was), Shaman A would add 180 (60x3) + 146 for a total of ~326 DPS via Panther and Shaman B 180, putting both DPS figures for Panther at a reasonable level for the average group and allowing for a higher stackability of Panther.<br />
<br />
No changes would actually have to be made to the spell version currently on test itself(The spell would still be group only and have a base of 10 procs/minute with a base damage of 400.). Keeping the group only restriction would prevent any Shaman to do the unintended DPS Rytan fears and which he put the restriction in for.<br />
<br />
The game changes to be made would be:<br />
<br />
- Introduce a focus line to upgrade proc buffs(maybe just Panther) or make the current DD foci apply to proc damage as well.<br />
<br />
- Introduce an AA, &quot;Panther's Fury&quot;, with the next expansion preferably, that enhances the base damage of the spell line(could be 3 or 5 ranks).<br />
<br />
- Keep the wolf's proc rate what it originally was(but change all other pets)<br />
<br />
These changes would mainly increase the Shaman's DPS in groups, where the biggest issue lies imo. At the same time it will increase any raiding Shaman's DPS who usually finds himself grouped with 2 melees as he can make up part of the DPS he lost due to the in-group restriction, through his own pet, &quot;if he can keep it up&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's 7 am and this all makes sense to me atm, but it might not make sense to you.  :p<br />
<br />
Edit: changed procs to proc buffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">simple, add a small amount of agro/hate to the spell.<br />
<br />
regardless of mana pools or AA's the spell will generate the same amount of hate/agro.<br />
<br />
it will allow you to cast it on anyone, no matter what group they are in and allow you to cast it as many times as your mana pool will allow. just don't cast it too much or you get agro and go splat.<br />
<br />
it doesn't need to cost twice as much mana, last twice as long, only be casted on group members, generate as much hate as tugur's or a poison dot, have it's proc rate lowered, proc damage lowered, or any of that.<br />
<br />
just have it generate a small amount (a small amount) of agro, as all spells do this.<br />
<br />
how many spells that add as much DPS as panther are there that generate zero agro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Before I get into this too far, I have a question. Does anyone actually have any data on the CURRENT rate of pet-proccing other than Retrons Post (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=332231&amp;postcount=13)? If not, then I am going to assume that data to be accurate, since I dont think nerfing the SPELL affected the pet-proccing code, and I have yet to see anything different.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there are a couple incarnations of the spell that I think would be satisfactory. The problem here is they hit SO MANY aspects of the spell with the nerfs. I wouldnt mind the group-only thing IF the damage was jacked back up, and the duration was lengthened, and pets procced more then PCs. It could be workable from a raid standpoint that way, with some creativity in group construction and some good, skilled casting on pet-swarms. <br />
<br />
I think the BEST solution is to return the spell EXACTLY the way it was, except keep the pet-proc reduction rate nerf-fix-adjustment-whatever-thehell-youwanna-callit, I really do not see THAT version as being INCREDIBLY goddly, for reasons that many of you have already explained ad-naseum (Macnair and his Chanter analogy, Giac and his stackability examples, etc).<br />
<br />
IF, and I say this with some reservations, IF it MUST be kept group-only, then I want some DAMAGE and DURATION. The PITA factor MUST be minimized somewhat. The damage MUST be worthwhile for the effort. <br />
<br />
I dunno, I am tired. This thing really has me pissed. Its affecting me more than it should. I think the reason for that has nothing to do with this particulr spell itself, but more with the feeling of betrayal that is overwhelming me. I have been trying to honestly see things from SOEs perspective with regard to a lot of things, but I just cannot get past this one. My god, Rytan compared its effeciency to DISEASE DOTS!! I dont even mem disease DOTs when I SOLO for gods sake. If there is ONE STATEMENT I can point to that demonstrates how completely and utterly out of touch those people are, its that one.<br />
<br />
Thats it, for now. Good luck Mac. I am behind you 100%. I think you have a really good grasp on this whole situation, and will gladdly listen to any suggestions you make and support you any way possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">just have it generate a small amount (a small amount) of agro, as all spells do this.<br />
<br />

<br />
Spangaloid...<br />
<br />
The only Shaman that would get aggro are those in groups where the tank or whatever doesn't have any hate generation.<br />
<br />
I've tried to pull aggro off Gster with DoTs, chaining slow, cripple... you name it. I couldn't do it.<br />
<br />
If you think adding an aggro component to these spells is going to do anything to reduce casting on too many people for the higher end Shaman, you are sorely mistaken.<br />
<br />
Maybe an idea, but it would only serve to frustrate a large proportion of the Shaman community, while doing nothing to reduce the casts for a smaller proportion.<br />
<br />
The spells were intended to provide the Shaman a way to give an aggro free form of dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Before you proceede with this discussion, you should ask yourself a simple question:<br />
<br />
What % of a DPS class damage should a shaman be able to provide?<br />
<br />
After you come up with a satisfying answer to that question, parse, parse like mad, under very fast fights (ArchMagus, Chailak, Mshas, Keldovan for example) under very long fights (Master of Specialization) under medium fights (Tormentors, or fights with low numbers)<br />
<br />
You'd be incredibly surprised at how different the perception of how much damage classes do, and how much damage they actually do.<br />
<br />
Rogues, very high end ones with Tacvi/Anguish weaponry can break 800 DPS while chaining discs, with a full array of raid buffs, but in a long fight, their DPS is maybe around ~500.<br />
<br />
Basically, what % of monk/mage/ranger/rogue/wizard damage should shamans do?<br />
<br />
By the way, I don't think this is a waste of time at all, I just am surprised to see at how twisted a view of class balance a lot of you seem to have.  Spells are not balanced in a vacuum.  If monks do around 450 DPS, shamans have no right to contribute more than a monk.  I will be glad to provide a number of DPS parses on various mobs if people want help coming up with decent balanced numbers.</div></div><hr />

well, gster is arguably the best equipped warrior. not every guild has a gster.<br />
<br />
i'm presently in a guild that is rebuilding form the losses of WoW and EQ2...our tanks don't suck but their gear does. i have to tone down my playstyle considerably as a result. with panther i am able to dish out more DPS than i ever could before and never get agro.<br />
<br />
if i wanted the same DPS with DoTs i would be tanking.<br />
<br />
that's all i'm saying.</div></div><hr />

What enables them to do that DPS? Is that without any buffs or bard songs?<br />
<br />
I posted something similar this in a thread over on the EQ site.<br />
<br />
Theoretical numbers:<br />
<br />
7 PCs<br />
Duration of 100 seconds<br />
appx 16 procs per PC in 100 seconds<br />
400 damage per proc(not counting any crits that may occur)<br />
<br />
7*16*400=44,800 damage<br />
<br />
44,800/100s=448dps<br />
<br />
So you are saying that a Shaman casting Panther on 7 PCs should't approach the DPS of a single monk?<br />
<br />
Multiply that by 3. It would take 21 pc's with Panther (as planned by Rytan) to get approximately the same DPS as 3 monks that do the dps you stated.<br />
<br />
It also takes time to ramp up to that DPS. It doesn't occur immediately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I am saying that monks offer a lot less compared to shamans outside of DPS.  Even the most cynical player will agree that a shaman's non damage contribution to  a raid by far trumps that of a monk.<br />
<br />
Therefore, since a monk's main contribution is DPS, is there a justification for a shaman doing damage better than a damage class?<br />
<br />
To simplify this:  If shamans did more damage than dedicated DPS casters, what justification is there to ever take up a DPS caster since a shaman offers better unresistable damage on top of far higher utility?<br />
<br />
Utility classes should not encroach on damage classes turf, by the same token, damage classes should not encroach on utility classes turf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blazz, I may be wrong, but I think he was referring to the dmg/mana efficiency, which is not the same thing as dps. Disease dots are the most efficient way of doing damage for us, they aren't used because the rate of doing that damage is too slow in most scenarios. Panther was not only more efficient than our disease dots, it was also more damaging than our dps dots. Wunshi has an efficiency of 6.84 for example, while panther is about 8.46 assuming an average of 1 proc/tic. The dps on the other hand is 30 for Wunshi and about 92 for panther (again, assuming an average of 1 proc/tic). Sisslak has an efficiency of 4.73 with a dps of 96. The downside of sisslak though is that the recast timer prevents you from keeping it on more than one target at a time, so, even though it might seem slightly better from that perspective than panther, it isnt. The numbers for Yoppa are 4.73/75.<br />
<br />
If you stack panther the net efficiency stays the same but the dps delivered is additive. You can stack other dots of course, but you need multiple slots for that and you face differing resist issues.The big difference in efficiency means that even under optimal conditions panther is going to be well ahead of any other damage scenarios.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Make it group only and leave the rest as is.<br />
<br />
Why? Because this keeps group functionality the same and soloing the same. The only difference comes in raids.You may be right that this is where we will end up; but that &quot;only difference&quot; means that some players are getting no noticeable nerf at all, and others are being nerfed severely.  <br />
<br />
So:  I am noting your opinion, but I would say that I don't want to begin with this conclusion.  If we end up here, we end up here.  But let's not start here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Panther has always been a relative &quot;static&quot; DPS tool.

Many scaling effects are not:  single digit percentage increases are very common, and a 20% increase on something is generally quite coveted.  I'm certainly open to your suggestions about how it ought to scale better.<br />
<br />
Within a group setting or a raid setting, with the original spells, total mana, mana regen, and shaman skill all make a difference in how many people you can keep buffed, for how long.  In a raid setting, for example, if you can keep 12 people buffed for 3 minutes and I can only manage 10, you are 20% better than me.  In a group setting, you might be able to keep the spell running nearly constantly on three targets, but I can only manage two and sometimes a third, call it 2.5:  you're still 20% better than me.  That's the sort of thing I had in mind when I suggested the original spells had scaling effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are two ways in which panther differs from arch tipical buffs.  The first one is the return on the marginal, that Sir Yakk went on about, and the second is the fact that mobs are balanced assuming standard raid buffs, which panther does not include.<br />
<br />
I am going to break this down to an analogy you know well, so hopefully it makes sense.  Remember when Thott made his famous graphs about shaman healing?  Him showing that shamans healed better than a ridiculous amount of clerics if they chain canni'd and slowed the mobs and healed only with torpor?<br />
<br />
His argument was that a cleric was healing on unslowed mobs, while shamans were healing SLOWED mobs, which is very intellectually dishonest.  Most experience groups have a class that can slow proficiently (ench, bst, shm, bard) so it is wholly unfair to look at cleric healing assuming mobs are unslowed.  The mob DPS is balanced already assuming a mob is slowed.  Slow is to mob DPS as Haste is to PC dps.  A mob will always be slowed, and a player will always be hasted.<br />
<br />
Haste and slow are 'built in' game mechanics.  They are plentiful and on a raid enviroment they are 'always' saturated.  Panther is something 'extra'.  The closest spell to Panther is magician damage shields, and I am sure people will agree that attributing all damage shield damage to the tank tanking is ludicrous.<br />
<br />
The point at the end though, is that I do not think I can convince you if you are stuck this way.  Rytan however, is convinced that Panther damage should be attributed to the shaman, and he is the one making the decisions, not the 'community'.  While Rytan's views may not be perfect, he is right more often than not, and making decisions by consensus in a MMORPG is a terrible idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Blazz, I may be wrong, but I think he was referring to the dmg/mana efficiency, which is not the same thing as dps. Disease dots are the most efficient way of doing damage for us, they aren't used because the rate of doing that damage is too slow in most scenarios.<br />
Oh I understood why he used that as a comparison, it still doesnt detract from the fact that hes out of touch. Disease DOTs are basically unusable spells. By using this as a barometer, he gives me the impresion that we think those spells are GOOD. <br />
<br />
They are making similar missassumptions on the new nuking revision. They think we are going to look for mana efficiency in a spell before other factors. Any of you shamans out there EVER look at mana efficiency when picking what spell to use in what situaiton? (other than stuff like greenie farming, when there is no need to use AE Yoppa, since the other AEs are more suited to greenie-farming). <br />
<br />
SOE has lost touch with the player base again. I truly felt they would try to listen to us after OoW. I felt they were sincere when they said player input was inmportant. Hell, go read Brenlos quote about Panther. I am beginning to wonder if this WHOLE fiaso isnt a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. We have Brenlo talking about how excited he is that we like the spell line, and Rytan nerfing it within days of that announcement. <br />
<br />
Liking the stuff I am reading here so far though. I think our solution, at least for now, may be to DEMAND answers, not changes. I want to SEE the reasons. I want to SEE why they feel the way they do. I want to UNDERSTAND why Rytan refuses to even acknowledge why the chanter analogy model doesnt apply here. As some have said, its kinda hard for us to aid them in direction if we dont know where we are supposed to be going. Panther LOOKED like an intentional upgrade to the potential DPS we could supply a group or raid. Now, it LOOKS like I wont have a spell slot for it in 90% of the situations I play in, especially since my other, slightly less of a PITA, forms of DPS, my Curses, require spell gem dedication due to restrictive re-cast timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Stinkeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Before you proceede with this discussion, you should ask yourself a simple question:<br />
<br />
What % of a DPS class damage should a shaman be able to provide?<br />
<br />
After you come up with a satisfying answer to that question, parse, parse like mad, under very fast fights (ArchMagus, Chailak, Mshas, Keldovan for example) under very long fights (Master of Specialization) under medium fights (Tormentors, or fights with low numbers)<br />
<br />
You'd be incredibly surprised at how different the perception of how much damage classes do, and how much damage they actually do.<br />
<br />
Rogues, very high end ones with Tacvi/Anguish weaponry can break 800 DPS while chaining discs, with a full array of raid buffs, but in a long fight, their DPS is maybe around ~500.<br />
<br />
Basically, what % of monk/mage/ranger/rogue/wizard damage should shamans do?<br />
<br />
By the way, I don't think this is a waste of time at all, I just am surprised to see at how twisted a view of class balance a lot of you seem to have. Spells are not balanced in a vacuum. If monks do around 450 DPS, shamans have no right to contribute more than a monk. I will be glad to provide a number of DPS parses on various mobs if people want help coming up with decent balanced numbers.<br />
<br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
My question is what kind of DPS are we talking about? A monk can do 400 DPS sustained forever. How much sustained damange is panther? Monks are not a burst DPS class. All I've ever seen are 600 DPS numbers flying around. What happens after those 3 minutes when the shaman is oom? Is a 600 DPS burst followed by a much lower sustained all that much out of line?<br />
<br />
As far as the content being tuned to a spell or not. How much content is tuned to 600 DPS? Gee, if we only had that extra 600 DPS, we would have won the encounter. Encounters are tuned around haste because it provides fantastic sustained DPS. You guys are losing sight of the overall impact of the two. The impact of haste is huge. The impact of panther = 1 wizard (or maybe more when someone figures out what happens after the 600 DPS burst.)<br />
<br />
You can compare panther to either haste or direct damage. In the ideal world, all the stars line up, panther can do as much burst damage as direct damage but has a lot more issues (stacking, effficiency droppind due to downtime, etc.) If you compare panther to haste, both burst and sustained damage are piss poor in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Therefore, since a monk's main contribution is DPS, is there a justification for a shaman doing damage better than a damage class?<br />
<br />
&quot;A Shaman&quot;, just like you said, not Shamans in general, big difference.<br />
<br />
To simplify this:  If shamans did more damage than dedicated DPS casters, what justification is there to ever take up a DPS caster since a shaman offers better unresistable damage on top of far higher utility?<br />
<br />
If this was the case, you were right, but since adding monks to your raid will proportionally increase your DPS and adding Shamans with Panther will not, this is moot.<br />
<br />
Utility classes should not encroach on damage classes turf, by the same token, damage classes should not encroach on utility classes turf.<br />
<br />
Rytan is looking at a sustained DPS of 300 for Shamans via Panther. Making the Shaman pet keep their proc rate and leaving the spell the way it is currently on test, will result in Shamans doing about 320 sustained DPS on average in groups(2 melees, 1 Shaman pet).<br />
<br />
Seems quite reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There are two ways in which panther differs from arch tipical buffs.  The first one is the return on the marginal, that Sir Yakk went on aboutI think there are more than two ways.  Its duration is much shorter than many other buffs; and so the only time it makes sense to cast it is during a fight, which might accidentally lead us to think it is a direct damage spell.  Also the damage resulting from casting this buff on someone is much easier to quantify:  we can count the procs and simple math tells us exactly how much damage was caused, and it would be a  lot harder to do that for a strength buff or an ATK buff; and that might accidentally lead us to think it is a direct damage spell.  Probably some other ways as well.  So:  it's not the same as every other buff, I grant you that.  But it appears that we do agree that it's a buff.  I'm glad we're together on this.<br />
<br />
[Thott's] argument was that a cleric was healing on unslowed mobs, while shamans were healing SLOWED mobs, which is very intellectually dishonest.  Most experience groups have a class that can slow proficiently (ench, bst, shm, bard) so it is wholly unfair to look at cleric healing assuming mobs are unslowed.  This is a different question, probably one we don't want to discuss in this thread (the relationship of shaman slows and heals deserves much more attention than I want to give to it here).  The fact that you bring it up makes me nervous, though.  Are cleric heals balanced against the idea that the mob is always slowed?  I thought it was shaman heals that were balanced against that idea, and that was the reason that cleric heals are so much better than ours.<br />
<br />
Hah, don't answer that, it is too much of a distraction.<br />
<br />
mobs are balanced assuming standard raid buffs ... <br />
Haste [is part of] 'built in' game mechanics.  This idea deserves a lengthy response.  So here it comes.  My response has two parts.<br />
<br />
First, I think that your argument asserts that when a particular mob is designed as part of  a new zone, it is designed to be a challenge to the people who would want to fight in that zone; and tuning the encounter to be challenging assumes that the melees who are fighting will come to the fight having received a buff that allows them to do 70% more damage than their nominal amount.  <br />
<br />
That is, when the zone was created, it was created with the intention that it would be challenging for players of an appropriate capability, on the assumption that all the melees would have a buff on them that allowed them to put out 70% more damage than they could without that buff.<br />
<br />
I think we need to pause for a moment just to reflect on that reality.  When various encounters were designed, we are all in agreement  that these encounters were tuned with the understanding that there would be a buff in the game that would increase the damage output of every melee involved by 70%.  <br />
<br />
So buffs that can add this kind of damage are built into the basic structure of the game, and all kinds of encounters have been invented on the assumption that a raidful of melee will be buffed up so as to add 3000 dps or more to the raid's overall damage output.<br />
<br />
So, that's the first thing I think we need to see about this.  The game is designed to include buffs with that kind of damage augmentation potential.  So we can't just conclude that there is something wrong with a buff that adds this kind of damage, if that's built into the very fabric of game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Second, the idea of progression is also built into the fabric of the game.  As we progress and get new levels, new gear, new spells, and new abilities, then encounters that once were well beyond our capability become very challenging, and then pretty easy, and eventually trivial.  As we as players gain more power, these particular encounters don't get more difficult so they can keep up with us; instead, they just become trivial.  <br />
<br />
So if wizards get new nukes, if necros get new dots, if clerics get new heals, if melees get new weapons and new disciplines:  we don't lament that encounters were tuned to be challenging before such new powers existed, and with those new powers the previous encounters will be much easier than they used to be.<br />
<br />
Instead we simply expect that SOE will design new encounters, encounters that will be challenging for players who have more power than players in earlier expansions had.  And they'll sell us those new expansions, with those challenging new encounters.<br />
<br />
To take again my example of Derakor the Vindicator from the other thread.  This encounter includes the assumption that a raid full of players have all received a buff that allows the melees to produce 70% more damage than they otherwise could, so that kind of buff is not automatically bad; and all of us who are level 70 raiders have now progressed in power -- gear, levels, aa, spells -- so that Vindi would be trivial for our typical raid.  <br />
<br />
Don't like the Vindi example?  Call it RSS royals instead.  That encounter is presently too hard for some, quite challenging for others, and not too tough for still others -- and when we are all level 100 some day, it will be trivial too.  <br />
<br />
Blazz (I think it was you, Blazz) pointed out that Spirit of Panther had made that encounter easier for his guild -- still far from a trivial fight, but cutting several minutes off the kill time.  I'm sure that Panther had something to do with that; but I suppose that you also succeed more quickly because you know the encounter better, so skill has gone up; that's one increase in power.  And Panther was available, which is also an increase in power, and that also helped win the fight more quickly.  And perhaps some people have better gear now as well, and that's yet another increase in power.<br />
<br />
Here's the (three-part) conclusion to this long long post.  <br />
<br />
1. Spirit of Leopard and Spirit of Panther are buffs that provide a significant increase in the damage output of melees.  It looks like you and I agree on this Mearis, though we are not yet in agreement about what that should mean.<br />
<br />
2. The game is built around the existence of buffs that provide very large augmentations in melee dps power.  Haste is the biggest of these, and it has been around for a long time.  So powerful buffs are not evil.<br />
<br />
3.  Encounters that were challenging when designed become trivial when players increase in power -- and the players are supposed to increase in powr, and trivialize that content.<br />
<br />
Come back at me over this, Mearis.  I appreciate that you are a staunch advocate of the opposing point of view here.  I don't want us to be enemies, but I want us to probe this whole question thoroughly:  and having you doing your best for one viewpoint while I do my best for the other will help us gain insight.  I hope.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm going to have to take exception to the current trend.  I disagree completely that we need to assess what % of a dps class we should be able to provide.  This is a BUFF, ffs.  It's not a nuke.  You're doing exactly what Rytan the Asslord did, and it makes no more sense than when he did it.<br />
<br />
As a buff, it can be cast ONCE on a player/pet until it runs out.  Subsequent casts do not add dps, they only refresh duration.  Already, to be accurate, your question would have to be, &quot;Given X number of people, what % of a dps class should a shaman be able to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
That is a variable formula.  Rytan the Asslord is a moron.  He didn't have a good answer for that question, so he arbitrarily slapped 3 caps on it--pet procs, a max of 1 group of people, and lowered the proc to boot.<br />
<br />
As a buff, with a set number of people, shaman do not stack.  Take 8 people and 1 shaman.  Though mana intensive, 1 very well equipped shaman could keep Panther on most of them for 2-3 minutes.  Let's go with 8 people and (to make a point), 100 shaman.  The amount of dps from Panther isn't going to change a bit.<br />
<br />
Now 100 wizards, they can stack.<br />
<br />
You can't say, &quot;what percentage of a dps class should a shaman be able to do?&quot; with a buff unless you limit the number of buffs.  That is what the original nerf was all about--he tried to slap a 30 second recast delay on it, and reduce it to a maximum of 3 people upon which it could be cast.<br />
<br />
Good old Rytan the Asslord won't deign to discuss haste with us.  That is exactly the same thing--it can add obscene amounts of dps, and the amount it adds is directly proportionate to the number of people available.  Heck, it can add 3000 dps to a raid easily, for 45 minutes, but the potential shaman adding 1600 dps for 1.5 minutes and running himself out of mana is apparently terrifying for Rytan because our class is no longer marginalized.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the question we need to be asking here, is how do we get to someone at SoE who (a) has more authority than Rytan, (b) isn't biased, and (c) can look this issue over for us.<br />

Still waiting for his response to my terribly long post on the subject.<br />
<br />
It is obvious to quite a few of us at this point that Panther must be evaluated as a buff.  It's not obvious to everyone though.  If it is as obvious as I think it is, then I should be able to convince them that their intuition that this is a damage spell is mistaken.<br />
<br />
So it is an interesting question, whether I can convince Mearis of that.<br />
<br />
I've got three meetings tomorrow, so I probably won't be able to post much over the next 24 hours.  <br />
<br />
Please begin to consider this question:<br />
<br />
Given that Rytan is not going to give us back everything that he took, what version of this spell would give us the best utility and scalability across the variety of shamans that use it?<br />
<br />
This isn't &quot;What would YOU most like to see in this spell?&quot;  That question gets us answers that are tuned for particular play styles.  Instead, please do your best to come up with proposals for a powerful spell that works well for people across the range of shaman playstyles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">When do you guys sleep?<br />
<br />
I think Chutoi's haste analogy is the best comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">600 DPS is higher then even wizards in most situations depending on gear etc.  Given that shaman have never primarily been a DPS class, and have a number of other useful abilities to bring to the table 600 is just plain too high.  The spell needs to be reigned in........ <br />
<br />
As you can see here, Rytan seems to be ALWAYS baseing his numbers from mid end content.  I do not think he has the slightest clue nor cares what draw backs his nerfs will have at higher end content.<br />
<br />
According to him, shaman should have a soft limit of 300 dps, assuming that wizards can sustain 600 dps. So, another words he wants shaman to do half the damage of what a pure DPS class can sustain.<br />
<br />
Now, at high end, Wizards have stated, that they can sustain 800+ dps easy.   Problem is, Shaman will still be stuck at the 300 dps mark, while every other class has jumped 30% in dps.  And as far as our the rest of our damage spells go, DoTs are actually less effective in high end content, due to a much higher amount of resists, and mobs only tend to last about 5 ticks after its debuffed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Given that shaman have never primarily been a DPS class, and have a number of other useful abilities  to bring to the table 600 is just plain too high<br />
<br />
Now as far as this goes, he is again ONLY thinking about low/mid end encounters.  <br />
Well, no shaman have never primarily been a DPS class, but we USED to be healer, we USED to be great slowers, ETC.  Since most of our primary utilities were taken away from us, as soon as we hit high end mobs, the only thing we have left is DPS.  And now since even that is being taken away from us, what do we have left ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with what you are saying, the problem is that you did the first few steps, but then missed the obvious conclusion.<br />
<br />
Your argument is, 'there are buffs that augment the damage by a much bigger amount' therefore panther 'ain't no thang'.  My point is that haste buffs have become so intertwined in the game, that the they are now part of the default 'starting condition'.  Imagine the very opposite now, it is much easier if you played other MMORPGs.  Imagine EQ now with no such spell as haste, for any class in game, and imagine mob HP's tuned with that in mind.  This is not such a colossal leap.  Now, imagine that in an expansion 6 years into the game, a spell such as haste is introduced.  Why would haste be overpowered if it is introduced 6 years into the game, as opposed if it is something that is therefrom the start.<br />
<br />
The arguments about infinite stackability are real moot.  Panther does not stack infinitely, but it stacks well enough that in raid enviroment you are not likely to often run into stacking issues.  If you offered magicians the options of a spell that allowed them to do 900 DPS but only stacked well up to 4 players, people will immediately take it.<br />
<br />
Take a look at this spell:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6145&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
This spell has a '4' hit limitation, meaning it will always do 2k damage for 330 mana.  This spell has a ton of similarities with Panther.  It 'stacks' well up to a point, meaning about 2 or 3 magicians can use this if they space it out very well on a fast hitting mob.  Second, it is a 'buff' but looking at it as a buff is disingeneous.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this example will make you understand.  Take Avatar of War, back when he was a hard mob, it was common to put a bard grouped with the warrior, for his damage shield songs.  The bard's damage shield was likely to do about asmuch damage as a few rogues.  Does it make more sense to 'attribute' this damage to a warrior, or to the bard?  The reason why bard damage shield was not overpowered was because it had a super limited stackability.<br />
<br />
Second, the idea of progression is also built into the fabric of the game.  As we progress and get new levels, new gear, new spells, and new abilities, then encounters that once were well beyond our capability become very challenging, and then pretty easy, and eventually trivial.

<br />
Sony does not care about old content being trivialized... within reason.  There are however precedents of spells being nerfed because they made old content trivial.  Take Thunder of Karana, it made Sontolak absolutely trivial, and it got nerfed super soon.  In this case, Panther is not normal mudflation, but it merely the addition of a new source of damage that is better than all the analogous ones.<br />
<br />
Is panther innately imbalanced?  No, if thegame was built from the scratch with panther and no haste, panther would be balanced, and haste would be.<br />
<br />
I am not convinced I can sway those who are thinking they were done a great wrong, but the more important issue is that Rytan happens to see it the same way as well and you are not likely to change his mind nor engage him in a public debate, because he is not on an even footage.<br />

The last point shows how out of touch people are on damage.  Wizards 'cannot' sustain 800 DPS at all.  In a high uptime group they cannot even sustain 300 DPS.  They can do 800 DPS with incredibly high end gear for 2!!!! minutes with extremly lucky crits.  600+ DPS is an amazing parse for most classes over the very short term.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">only well geared shaman can keep up sustained panther on multiple targets also...whats your point?  only the best of the best can susatain supr high dps.  600+dps is the theoreticle max of the spell, not the actual.  to hit that your looking at burning all your mana in a short time...which is the same for every class burst dps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Thanks for responding, Mearis.

<br />
Your argument is, 'there are buffs that augment the damage by a much bigger amount' therefore panther 'ain't no thang'. My point is that haste buffs have become so intertwined in the game, that the they are now part of the default 'starting condition'. Yes, I'm clear on your point.  The 'default starting condition' is that every single melee will have a buff that augments his dps by 70%, for the entire raid.  For six years the game has proceeded built on the reality that this kind of buff will be on every melee, and nobody has any problem with this reality (though this reality might not have existed, and does not exist in other games).  <br />
<br />
And I think I hear you saying that the same thing is true about Panther:  if it had been around from the start, there would be no problem about it now:<br />
<br />
Is panther innately imbalanced?  No, if thegame was built from the scratch with panther and no haste, panther would be balancedNow:  does this mean that there is no problem about very strong buffs existing, as long as they have always been there, but buffs over a certain strength must not be allowed to begin to exist after a certain time period?<br />
<br />
If so, what is the limit of the power of a new buff that should be allowable?<br />
<br />
Also, is it good for the game that powerful things that have been here from the beginning are fine, but powerful new things should not be allowed to be added?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Given that Rytan is not going to give us back everything that he took, what version of this spell would give us the best utility and scalability across the variety of shamans that use it?<br />
I think if we analyze which nerfs affected which section more, we find an obvious answer. You pointed these out somwhat in your original posts, Mac:<br />
<br />
In its original form, it was good for everyone, better for people with larger mana pools (as it should be) and very usable by raiders (even helped with Shaman Stackability, because although you cant Double-Panther targets, more shaman mean more melee/pets have the buff more consistantly, and not just in &quot;Channel-burn then Panther the Raid&quot; scenarios).<br />
<br />
The 30-second recast hurt everyone, which is why I think we saw such a HUGE, unified outcry from the community. <br />
<br />
In its current form, the only affect it has on the more casual players who dont raid much is the lowered damage. However, for all group situations, with the lower mana cost, there is a &quot;point&quot; where its a wash, probably something like 2-4 targets in the group. Lets look at the math (granted, this is very basic, and doesnt take any focii into account)<br />
<br />
Old Version: 2 targets at 650 each for 550 dmage/proc = 1100 effective proccing power for 1300 mana.<br />
New Version: 3 targets at 475 each for 400/proc = 1200 effective proccing power for 1425 mana. <br />
<br />
Pretty reasonable comparison. The spells effectiveness now becomes more reliant on the number of targets in your groups. Of course, more targets = more PITA factor, and I imagine SOE has thought of that as well. I would rather have a beefy spell I can use on 2 targets than a mediocre one I use on 3, no matter how the numbers balance out. <br />
<br />
Anyway, it seems the TRUE nerf of this spell is in Raid situations, especially in the &quot;burst&quot; area. Creative group construction can keep the spell just about at its current level in &quot;average&quot; situations, with just the increased PITA factor of having to cast it on 1 extra target to get the same amount of &quot;proccing power&quot;. However, our ability to Channel-burn and Panther the Raid has been removed. This, IMHO, it MORE than enough nerfage to &quot;balance&quot; the spell, in fact, its OVERBALANCED in my mind.<br />
<br />
All that being said, it is my opinion that the following changes would make this spell go from &quot;A mediocre PITA tool usable in groups and CERTAIN raid situations&quot; to &quot;A GOOD spell in many more situations&quot;:<br />
<br />
Increase damage/proc to 475-500 (scale mana accordingly)<br />
Increase duration to 3-5 minutes (again, scale SOME mana into that factor). <br />
<br />
Without the ability to Panther everything in sight, the need for the PITA duration is kind of moot. Pet armys wont live past the first minute anyway. No raid leader is going to jump shamans around in the raid during an encounter where such a strategy would actually be useful, its just not realistic. <br />
<br />
If they want the spell to be more mediocre and average, then the PITA factors need to be minimized somewhat. Thats my opinion. Longer duration, or increased proc damage, or both, would help with that. I think the spell still has some potential in raids, with creative group making and the ability to have a shaman-mage combo to &quot;Panther the Swarms&quot;. As a 1 minute spell, 550 is a nice dmage number to offset that PITA portion. At 400, that 1 minute duration makes me go &quot;hmm, maybe I will cast a DOT and watch Sportcenter on ESPN instead of this crazy 1 minute crap&quot;.<br />
<br />
EDITED NOTE: The other affect that we have is Giac's main arguement, stackability. Once you run out of targets to Panther, adding more panthers and/or more shamans doesnt effectively add any DPS, unlike adding more wizards, rogues, monks, zerkers, etc.<br />
<br />
EDITED NOTE 2: Another option would be to leave the spell exactly as Rytan announced, EXCEPT remove the group only restriction. Nerfing the damage makes &quot;castable on anyone&quot; far less overpowering, even in &quot;Panther The Whole Raid&quot; scenarios. I dont think we will see that one, though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well, the dots that do similar damage on a one to one basis have to be cast just as frequently, so the PITA argument isnt valid. Plus you can can get multiple instances of the spell up without switching spell gems midfight, or allocating multiple spell gems, which is a necessity if you are layering dots. Given that, the low recast time and lack of agro generated, there are few situations where a shaman would every cast a dot again outside of soloing, even with the reduced forms of panther. About the only time you would use dots is in a group where you had few or no host melee, and thats relatively unusual.<br />
<br />
But there are legions who insist the spell will go to the back of their spell book, and that they will go back to dots. All I see are fools and/or decievers ;)</div></div><hr />

I put that option in after reading one of your posts on another thread Aruman. It makes sense, you said something like &quot;I will eat the reduced damage if they just remove the group-only restriction&quot;.<br />
<br />
The problem here is the Triple hit on an already PITA spell. 4 issues. Duration, Damage, potential targets, proc rate, both pet and PC. I just cannot accept that its ALL getting the whack. No way. So I guess we compromise. Put the dmage back up, give us SOME duration, and keep it group only. Or keep it lower damage, keep it mega-short, and make it castable on anyone. Etc, etc, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a 73 DPS(after saturation is reached that is) per person I'll add with Panther after the nerf, I am interested in who would only rely on these spells for their damage.<br />
In a group of 2 melees and a pet(assuming pets will have the same proc rate as melees), you are looking at 200 sustained DPS, *if* you are keeping this pita 100 second duration spell up on anyone even during down time. <br />
*If* you are going to handle this spell like a DoT, the figure will be closer to 150 DPS and probably less than 200 with 3 melees + pet. That's about the damage I do with Sisslak and Bane. Leopard is probably not even worth memming at all.<br />
<br />
Am I a fool or a deceiver?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The bonus is that Leopard/Panther carries over to the next mob (with timely pulls), unlike that half of a dot that you paid good mana for, but never inflicted on anyone. Then again, we have so much to choose from that there's plenty of room for different playstyles and philosophies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Exin Krup Gutkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The thing that strikes me is that Panther is constantly being described as a Buff when it can just as easily be considered a DoT.<br />
<br />
They have very similar means of damaging a target with a different method of stacking.<br />
<br />
DoTs are a one time cast then you wait till it runs out and recast if you want.  The stackability is that each person can only cast it once, but multiple Shaman can cast the same DoT on the same target.<br />
<br />
Panther is a one time cast then you wait till it runs out and recast if you want.  The stackability is that each person can target and cast on as many melee as are available.  So each Shaman can cast multiple times but you can't hit the same target more than once.<br />
<br />
Whether or not it is a &quot;buff&quot; doesn't make any difference in my mind.  It ends up being the difference between a Cleric's Mark line and a Druid's Damage Shield line...do you cast it on the mob or do you cast it on the players.  Either way the damage is being done.<br />
<br />
The difference is that I feel casting it on players opens up more opportunity at the expense of ease.  It is much easier to cast directly on a mob and be done with it versus casting on every melee available (as a single cast spell).  But being able to cast on every available melee allows for a larger pool of DPS (consequently too much it appears).<br />
<br />
From what I can tell the Devs simply want to make sure this spell is limited while still being cast on players:<br />
<br />
1. Recast times would definately cut out number of targets but is also the worst idea in most people's view if solely because you can't choose when to cast it...it removes the choice and burst damage aspect.<br />
<br />
2. Group only slims down the potential targets to 6 from unlimited (pending raid size).  Scaleability is lost to a great degree, however, before group-only-scaleablity Panther was based more on raid size versus a shaman's mana pool.  If scaleability should be based on gear/aa/level/etc the spell data should reflect that, not the amount of people that can zerg a target.  This was the largest differential between solo, group, and raid Shaman.<br />
<br />
3. Large mana cost.  The larger the mana cost the less people it could be cast on and be kept up on.  But here again the problem would be that there is still not much of an upper limit if a raid was large enough.  Given enough Shaman and enough raiders everyone could still receive the buff.<br />
<br />
I honestly see the Devs as believing the scope of the spell needed to be limited.  One group might be much smaller than any of us had hoped, but I can see where having the capacity of hitting an entire raid with Panther was just too much.<br />
<br />
I do think the group restriction is a viable one because it sets a limit on targets and can then easily be tuned to the Devs DPS desires.  A Shaman still has 6 targets even if all of them are not good candidates for getting hit with the spell.<br />
<br />
I understand this is most restrictive on raids, but I also believe that raids were where the Devs had the largest problems with this spell.  In a group it was already tapped out and the DPS was maxed already...same with solo.  Only on Raids was the DPS only limited by the number of Shaman and Raiders present.<br />
<br />
Now having said that Group-only is viable, the damage should be returned to its original state.  Target number is now limited taking away what I would perceive to be the largest potential DPS threat, so returning it to a larger damage per mana can help justify its use on one or two targets.  This lower mana/less damage seems again to be targeted at making sure that even if everyone in the group is hit that there isn't as large a DPS boost.<br />
<br />
To address the Buff versus Direct Damage debate, I think I touched a bit on it at the start of my post.  This equates to a buff just as easily as it does to a DoT.  It does pretty constant DPS, more measurable DPS, has a short duration, works independant of the targets gear, all like a DoT, but is cast on targets like a Buff and can potentially carry over to the next target.  While not instant gratification like a DD spell or a single strike like a Backstab I just see it as resembling a DoT or Damage disc more than a Buff.<br />
<br />
The only thing that could then be addressed is scaling to AA/Level/Gear and again that can be done though ramping up the damage based on level, lenghtening its duration and alloing focus to impact it more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that much time to think, I solved the problem. :)<br />
<br />
Then I realized why that solution would not work. :(<br />
<br />
Large mana cost.  The larger the mana cost the less people it could be cast on and be kept up on.  But here again the problem would be that there is still not much of an upper limit if a raid was large enough.  Given enough Shaman and enough raiders everyone could still receive the buff.Large mana cost was it.  Large mana cost means scalability:  people with deep mana pools and high mana regen can cast more often than those with lesser amounts.  Large mana cost will keep people from buffing too many people on a raid.<br />
<br />
I think that I have discerned that Rytan's goal is for you to be able to buff 6 targets.<br />
<br />
400/proc x 10 procs/min x 6 proccers = 24000 dpm = 400 dps<br />
<br />
The ramp up time is less, because it's fewer targets:  30 seconds instead of 60 seconds.  So the efficiency factor is .75 instead of .50.<br />
<br />
400 dps x .75 = 300 dps<br />
<br />
So the raid leader's option for reaching Rytan's magic 300 dps figure is to put a shaman in a group with 5 melees:  5 players + dogdog = 6 targets.<br />
<br />
So what I figured out is, increase the mana cost of Panther so that a shaman with a deep mana pool -- 8000 with raid buffs? 9000? -- can maintain this on 6 targets for 3 minutes or so, and then will run oom.  Then, said I (passing mile marker 108 as I had this moment of glory) you won't need to restrict it to in group casting.  You can do 6 targets for 3 minutes, and you get to pick which 6 targets in the whole raid.<br />
<br />
But of course that won't work, I realized a few moments later, because with Spiritual Channeling we have infinite mana for 4 minutes at a whack.  So I go oom after 3 minutes, pop SC, go another 4 minutes and change, by then I've regenned enough mana to go another minute or so on regular:  I've got almost 9 minutes of burn time on a spell that's supposed to run me oom in 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Ah well.<br />

Mac, I have the feeling that those numbers are exactly why they did what they did. And remember, in certain IDEAL situations, we can STILL get 15 targets to pop Panther on (Shaman pet army + mage-in-group's pet army, which wont work on a vast majority of mobs, since pet-armys dont last very long in the face of big AEs, AE ramp, auto-riposting mobs). Channeling is why I don't think we will ever see the spell as &quot;non-group-only&quot;. Never. Not without an abusive recast to limit the number of targets further in the Duration / (cast-time + re-cast time) = max targets equation. (maybe the answer to this problem isnt a long re-cast, but a longer cast time. a 6 second cast time would efectively cut the &quot;max targets in a Channel burn&quot; in half, since it would be wearing off on the 1st and 2nd as we were casting on the 7th or 8th, /shrug, who knows)<br />
<br />
I am still optimistic that we can get some damage added, eventually (with an appropriate mana increase), but with so much on SOEs plate right now, I doubt we will see much of anything before summer. <br />
<br />
Tired. Gonna go play some Everquest. Practice targeting my pet army, that same name thing drives me nuts (oh, if the person I was having the discussion about pet-target cycling is reading this, you were correct, I was mistaken, there doesnt seem to be a way to cycle pet targets, maybe thats another thing we can push for, to make our burst-DPS potential a little better in certain specific situations).<br />
<br />
Good luck Mac, and thanks for all the terrific insight and level-headed posting. However the more I think about it, the more I begin to realize that the people who say &quot;You cant get anything done in this game unless you bitch, and even if something is GOOD you better bitch anyway in order to keep it&quot;. Pretty disgusted about all this, especially if thats the way we have to behave to get things done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyhow, this spell as it is now really doesn't give us anything in the form of increased dps. Given a full group of BST or SK's with pets, then sure.. 11 targets for panther and there is a definate difference in using that than a nuke/dot combo.<br />

Given an avg. of 3 melee in a group, the dps of the new panther is barely above curse of sisslak now. The new changes are a joke, Rytan is a joke. Chutoi has the right attitude towards him.

This is probably even macroable. Stick a /pause 60 after each /tar, and cast Panther during the pause, then the macro will /tar the next one and pause. <br />
<br />
I havent had much luck sticking the actual casting of Panther into the macros themselves, though. Its ok for 2 targets, but worthless beyond that. This may be a way to hit 5 though, /tar pet 1, /pause 60, next line /tar pet 2, /pause 60, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">All this adding restraints made panther a pretty crappy spell in many players' opinion. So let's add some more and see if the spell gets better. Yes, more restrictions. If we can not get a spell that is free of restrictions because someone (read: Rytan) at SOE is scared of how it will scale up on raids we can at least minimize the hassle involved and maximize stackability and opportunity. If in doubt, go the whole way and see what happens or something like that (ogre theory of game balancing TM)<br />
<br />
 - multiply mana cost by 8<br />
 - multiply proc damage by 8<br />
 - increase recast time to 1 minute<br />
<br />
It still will not scale properly. The annoying constant recasting is still there. But no constant changing of targets, recasting is reduced by a factor of 8, no worries for Rytan about how many people we could cast it on and you only need a single target to make it works - which means shaman should have no stacking issues.</div></div><hr />
