<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mo ...<br />
<br />
Here is my setup:<br />
<br />
ASUS A7V266-E BIOS ver. 1004B<br />
MSI GeForce 4 MX 440 64 DDR<br />
Sound Blaster Live!<br />
Linksys NIC 10/100<br />
1024 DDR (2x512)<br />
400 watt PS<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
Cannot get this card working correctly within Win2K. I get random lockups with a green bar at top of screen. When trying to run a game ( EverCrack ) I lock at the character screen with the green line at top. Could not get this card working at all within 98SE or Win Me. At one point I was getting blue screens and many other errors. I am hoping to get this card working soon, or I will go crazy. Has anyone else had these problems with this board? Any help would be great. Could this be a combo of my mobo and video card? I went to ASUSs website to see if they had a newer BIOS, and they do, but it doesnt look like it would really fix my problem. I have heard that over 512 megs might do strange things to the computer but seeing I have the newest gear out there Im not sure that is really a factor. I could be wrong though. Should the video driver be downgraded? <br />
<br />
This was posted also on a tech page as well ... Im sure you can tell... lol<br />
<br />
On Ravi's machine, pretty much the same setup, we cant even get windows of any version installed. Maybe faulty mobo or HD. Nothing but blue screens or multiple errors.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's a video driver issue or could be that AGP4X isn't liking something.  Here's a few things to try.<br />
<br />
Use the driver version 22.80   www.guru3d.com for the download<br />
That is the recommended driver that VI says to use for Geforce cards.<br />
Before switching drivers download the detonator destroyer from there so make sure all old drivers are out.  Go to add/remove programs and remove any video drivers that are listed.  Then start det destroying and click the uninstall button.. reboot and reload the video drivers from wherever you saved and extracted the drivers to.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work then check out www.geforcefaq.com and go through some of the stability things it says with settings in your bios.<br />
<br />
As to general questions, over 512MB is only a problem on Win98.  With constant errors it sounds like you have some kind of OS corruption, bad memory, or something HW related.  With Ravi's if it is erroring during an install it is probably bad or the wrong type of memory.  Take out all but 1 chip (assuming 256 or 512 chips) and try again, then swap around and see if it makes a difference.<br />
<br />
Oh and if this is a new system that you bought as components then take back that Geforce4 MX 440 card, it's power is less than the Geforce 3 TI200 cards and about the same price.  Those are the bottom of the barrel cards and you'll be better off with the newer model coming out soon or with a GF3Ti200 card of your choice.<br />
Let me know  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's a review of the Gforce 4 at Tom's Hardware Guide.<br />
<br />
http://www6.tomshardware.com/graphic/02q1/020206/index.html<br />
<br />
He notes that the MX Series is not true DX8 compatable, in the following quote from the 'conclusions' of the review.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SNIP~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
When you look at the three different GeForce4 MX offerings, it is easy to see that the low-end version, the GeForce4 MX420, will be a product for OEMs only. Its 166 MHz SDRAM memory will slow down the performance of the GeForce4 MX chip so much that it will hardly perform any better than previous GeForce2 MX400 cards that you can get for a mere 50 bucks. <br />
<br />
The performance of the GeForce4 MX440 and 460 cards, however, proved to be very impressive. Especially the GeForce4 MX460, which is able to score results as high as those of the GeForce3 Ti200, or even the Ti500 cards. Both are able to beat ATi's Radeon 7500 in most cases. <br />
<br />
Still, none of the GeForce4 MX cards has full DirectX 8.x support, because of its lack of vertex and pixel shaders. This weighs heavily when you remember the lowest priced offering out of the GeForce4 Ti bunch of cards. It's only $20 more than GeForce4 MX460. <br />
<br />
I therefore suggest the GeForce4 MX440 for value buyers, but they should try to get the price down to less than $149. Better yet, a value buyer should watch out for GeForce3 cards. Any GeForce3 card that costs less than $190 is a bargain right now. GeForce3 comes with full DirectX 8.x functionality, vertex/pixel shaders and lots of 3D power! If you can chose between a GeForce3 card and a GeForce4 MX card for similar prices, I would clearly go for the GeForce3! <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SNIP~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Given that the vertex and pixel shaders are one of the defining features of  the Gforce4, I believe I'd take the 'I need to exchange this product, it's not compatable with my PC' approach and upgrade to either a Full GF4 or a GF3.<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE TO READERS:  Some newer motherboards (Intel 850 and 845 chipsets in particular) are NOT compatable with AGP2X Video cards, (AGP2X runs at 3.3v as opposed to 1.5v AGP4X).   If your video card tries to run in AGP2X Mode, it will burn and damage the mainboard.   I've been doing a lot of Socket-478 Pentium 4's lately (Gigabyte Mainboards ROCK) and they ALL have this warning.  They all insist on an AGP4X Video card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know, I read that too =( I wish I would have known that to begin with. But all the sites I went too there was no info on GF4MX series. There are also threads going around that say the GF4MX boards DO support DX8x ... so who the hell knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This page will not display ... is that the actual site? where else can I get that det destroyer? Ravi downloaded 22.88 already and it still locks, but I will try a few things again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anytime I try to reboot it just sits there at a gray screen ... resetting the machine is ok, meaning it does not tell me I shut down incorrectly.<br />
<br />
Any hints on that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's the latest driver for the chipset on your mainboard - might help.<br />
<br />
Click -&gt; http://www.viaarena.com then click 'Drivers' on the left, and choose 4in1 4.37(a) from the list.<br />

<br />
<br />
The gray screen is a known Win2k issue, usually caused by the windows logoff sound file being corrupt.  It doesn't hurt anything, but is annoying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go to sounds on your control panel and turn system sounds to &quot;None&quot;.  Then reboot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I will try those things on my machine later today.<br />
<br />
Ravi's machine ... She had a bad stick of ram ... Win 2K is not up and running on her machine =) Now just to get all the drivers in order.<br />
<br />
Thanks again all =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've seen those green tracks before, not pretty. Likely means you've got a hardware failure, and sometimes can be difficult to pinpoint. If none of the drivers have helped, the video card would be my first step, but could also be the cpu or motherboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does your motherboard have built in video? If so remove the graphics card, try it with built and see if everything works ok. If so then may be isolated to the card. If not then obviously something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The mobo comes with built in sound and I think LAN. Both have been disabled. I have tried different video drivers in which so far they all act the same. I have tried a couple other tweaks in the BIOS and that didnt work either. I have set the AGP to 1x, 2x, 4x, and auto, and they all act the same. I am very close to returning the ASUS board for the ABIT which actually got better reviews.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was this a working system before the GF4 card, or were all these components purchased at once?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hasn't been mentioned but here are some other basic things to check.<br />
<br />
IRQ on Video, Sound, NIC   <br />
Make sure they are all different and there is no device sharing on any of those IRQ's.  Sometime USB will using the same as the Video so watch out for that if you have any USB devices.<br />
<br />
Few other spots for drivers.  www.the-ctrl-alt-del.com, www.m3dzone.com, www.guru3d.com<br />
<br />
I'd recommend the 22.80 drivers then 27.31 if the first ones don't help.<br />
<br />
Question:  When it locks can you ctrl-alt-del and end task on EQ or do you have to reboot?  If it locks and you have to reboot then it is more likely a conflict on IRQ or something.  If you can end task then it sounds more like a driver issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, basically I took out the card and put it back in, made sure everything was snug .... then reinstalled EQ and DirectX and am now back up and running. A few problems here and there but those I can deal with. I was in EQ for a little to make sure then started on Ravi's machine. Got hers up and running now as well. Thanks for the tips all. <br />
<br />
The gray reboot screen is still there but like I said, thats no biggie right now =)<br />
