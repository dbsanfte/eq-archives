<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone tried to solo down in the arena in Plane of Tactics?  I noticed most of the mobs con blue to me at 62 with a couple yellows but the exp was awsome in a full group.<br />
<br />
I think the mobs were doubleing for like 480 a hit.  Dont remember the exact number. <br />
<br />
Anyway just want to know if anyone has tried this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They have a lot of hit points and do pretty decent damage even when slowed.  I duoed it with a cleric friend trying to get him his lvl.  and basicly to keep myself up i was having to chain torpor.  i had pet and a few dots running.  but i was quick to get low on mana from dots.<br />
<br />
Do nto know how effective root dotting would be... but without torpor its the only option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo the arena.<br />
But it can get very frustrating.<br />
<br />
you have about a 50/50 chance of getting an add and another 50/50 chance of getting trained cause an enchanters charm broke =)<br />
<br />
joking aside its very possible but it does get frustrating with the adds. Dont know if i have ever killed more than 3-4 mobs without having to zone or gate. But you can fight next to the zone out in arena so its pretty safe.<br />
<br />
And yes you can kill named, they arent really much harder.<br />
Just stay away from casting mobs and 80% of mobs dont see invis so you can usually scout around for named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not flagged for tactics but a mob that doubles for 480 is soloable.  It isn't easy, but it is doable.  I solo the taskmasters in ssra basement that hit for 410, and it isn't too hard.  When they get a lucky string of max hits you may need to tnargs yourself, but chain torpor should be able to keep you alive.<br />
<br />
If they dont summon and are rootable, then root rot them.  Should be pretty easy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Runes can drop from 2 of the named rarely, molds even more rarely, and there are a couple of other little toys that drop there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Firstly, your question should be can the Arena be soloed for EXP?  Shammy's can solo dragons, but you don't see WW clogged with us doing this.  It's something that you CAN do, but it's dangerous, long and not certain...  The Arena is the same way.  You CAN solo the mobs in there, but grouping will give you a much better EXP rate and higher chance to live through the experience.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PIT in POT is Soloable. As others are saying. Adds are a problem. You go down there alone with no one else there, it's going to be rough getting lucky enough to have the mobs path at the right times for you to get singles until it's &quot;cleared&quot;  As far as root rotting. Don't really see how without BOU/BOS.  Someone will claim &quot;Oh but I did it.&quot;  I'm sure you did on one, maybe. If you did it, it wasn't for long, With wanderers/a resisted root/root breaking every time you land a dot.  You just aren't going to last long down there.  With BOU/BOS and it not breaking root, they are easily soloable.  The adds make it difficult.  Nameds aren't popping like they were before, so I'd question the reasoning behind being down there at all at this point.  It is a really nice 3-6 man exp camp though.  You do get good exp soloing, but as said by others and myself, you just aren't going to stay in the zone long enough for it to matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Don't really see how without BOU/BOS&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes i agree these spells pretty much make this possible<br />
It would be hard to solo there with BoN,SoN,or Pox. the DD would make it significantly more dificult.<br />
<br />
I also recomend Virtual Para. you can use it too &quot;position&quot; mob once rooted with PE to minimize the adds.<br />
<br />
BTW:<br />
At 65 its good exp but nothing out of this world little over 6% if i recall correct.</div></div><hr />
