<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been hunting Yeties for the last couple levels ( left cave in DL) and I will most likely ding to 39 tonight.  Now my question is, how has Nurga changed?  I have heard the Spider only section has changed, but can someone shed some light on how it has changed?  I was hoping to find myself a new hunting ground at 39, and Nurga used to be on top of my list.  So any suggestions, in case Nurga is no longer vaiable would be appreciated.  I am a semi AC shamy, 847 ac, 1209 hp (at 38), with decent gear.<br />
<br />
All help is welcome,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I spent a good bit of this weekend in there playing a SK alt with a small group (druid, enchanter and my shadowknight - mid to high 30's except for the druid who was low 40's)...<br />
<br />
The most notable change is that there are no more spiders or Burynai - everything in the zone is a goblin now.  There are tons of necro, wizard, magician, cleric and shaman caster mobs plus shadowknights, rogues and warriors on the melee side.  The biggest pain was dealing with the casters, but it was very doable and decent exp with the group I mentioned.  Soloing this area is going to be a bit more challenging than it used to be, but since I didn't try it I can't say for sure.  I'd say try it - you'll probably do ok...<br />
<br />
I'd recommend setting up camp at the zone out to Droga (not the one way in near the old spider camp).  There are 6 spawns in the first room you come to &amp; there's a zone nearby for safety.  They're spread out enough so that you should be able to get singles pretty easily.  There are also 5 more spawns just one room away, but pulling those single might be difficult until you hit 43 or so since they're packed a little bit more tightly...  Just invis your way to this camp spot.  The mobs at this spot seemed to be melee mobs 60% of the time, so it ought to be a good spot to test the waters.<br />
<br />
Drop-wise, the zone has changed a bit - the clerics do not seem to be dropping chant rocks at all (cause for concern if you're working on your Iksar cudgel quests).  There are a couple of new things that are dropping too:  an ore and a goblin beverage, but I don't know yet what these are used for.  The biggest change (and one that I'm sure is an accident) is that Goblin Warders now spawn here fairly commonly.  You may recognize the mob as the uncommon / rare mob that spawned in Droga and dropped an occasional Shroud of Nature.  Warders seem to pop fairly often during our visit and dropped a shroud 1 in 3 times on average.  We let a couple dozen of these things rot...<br />
<br />
All in all this place is still a pretty nice and quiet hunting grounds, but I think I'll be less inclined to solo here with my alts now than I was previously.  Good luck checking it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are no more slaves in what used to be the slavepit areas either.  It's all goblins all the time.  The new drops are the grinning goblin brew.  The Mt. Death salts dropped previously, but they are dropping more commonly now.  You brew 1 salt with 1 goblin brew to make Goblin Temper.  Then take 2 bricks of Deathsteel ore with 1 temper to make a sheet of deathsteel metal.  Then the metal, the temper, and the appropriate molds make new forged deathsteel weaps.  The details are at eqtraders.  They are actually not too bad of items for lowbies and may get you a skill up or two on smithing, as the trivial seems to be about the same as the high end banded.  <br />
<br />
My complaint - with the removal of the iksar slaves, it's one less place to find an already extremely rare drop of iksar blood.  Why cant I just pop open my own vein and bleed?  alas....<br />

Freekin sucks, the patch that broke the zone went a day or two before I was to that part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've /bug and /feedback this &quot;change&quot;. I don't think it was intentional, honestly. They've messed up two quests with the removal of the slaves without explanation or creating an alternative spot for drops to come from.</div></div><hr />
