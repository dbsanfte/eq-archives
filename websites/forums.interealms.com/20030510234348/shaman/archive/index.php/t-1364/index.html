How long could I use belt for? Should i just keep my pennies for something else? I found a seller asking 300pp for it. Comments....</div></div><hr />

Int caster use it because they are restricted to cloth.<br />
Druid use it because they are restricted to leather.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not gonna be as hard as avalach on it but it isn't a great item IMO. The ac is pretty low for my taste but the hps mana are pretty nice. Either way on my server 300pp for it would a steal. At your lvl and compaired to your current belt I would definitely go for it for 300 pp. When you get higher lvl and are looking for something with a bit more ac like a spider fur belt, Girdle of reflection or even a flayed tourmoil skin belt you should easily be able to get your money back on that belt and probably even make a profit.</div></div><hr />

PS:  Hanging around in Shaman's Crucible, you shoulda realize Testament of Vanear is EVIL by now. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the insight.... I think I'll use the cash to have some 6/65 rings made instead. Been wanting those for a while also.<br />
<br />
BTW, I know about the Testament, primarily only equip it when in group as healer/buffing mode.<br />
