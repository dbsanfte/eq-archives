<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lots of changes on Lucy, seems that many detrimental spells, including most Shaman, have had similar adjustment, example:<br />
<br />
Torrent of Poison   <br />
  <br />
Date Change <br />
06-21 18:02 Changed Unknown180 from 0 to -25 <br />
06-21 18:02 Changed Unknown178 from 0 to 12 <br />
06-21 18:02 Changed Unknown179 from 100 to 135 <br />
 <br />
Anyone know what Unknowns 178, 179, and 180 mean?  Most new values for Unknown180 went from 0 to negative.  Any chance our rains will land better (I know, wishful thinking)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">178: extra fizzle factor<br />
179: resist bonus for target<br />
180: AE range &quot;bonus&quot;<br />
<br />
Just kidding. I have no clue what they mean. But I couldn't resist to post this. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Those might well be PvP changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those Unknowns were indeed added close to the last PvP changes, so it's a good guess they are PvP related tweaks. There was a day or 2 on Lucy, when literally 1000s of those values were changed at once.<br />
<br />
I think, they are still fiddling around and trying to figure out some acceptable PvP values.</div></div><hr />
