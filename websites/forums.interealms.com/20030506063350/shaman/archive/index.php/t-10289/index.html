<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akaran_D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hola. I've been working on this shammy for a bit, getting her to a level where I can start dualboxing with her when my group is short a slower, or I just need to solo. My origional alt was a cleric, but after getting him to 54 and then trying to duo anything in nightmare.. well. It didn't take long to become endeared to the power of this class.<br />
<br />
I have set her gear up as best as I can for what my bank account will allow. I *think* I have done a fair job of it. The only item on her that I do not own is the Fungi Tunic. I have heard alot of comments from shamans in my guilds on the fact that it isn't as useful at the higher levels (as a paladin, I'm still trying to grasp how any regen can be considered bad..) so eventually - in another 15, 16 some levels - I'll be switching out. (or whenever my friend asks for it back) I also need to upgrade her forrest loop to a Solstice Earring, somthing I will be doing once she is the level to use it. I have the mantle from the Exe Trial banked for when she hits 51, and a couple of other things I can't recall the names of off hand. I know she needs a JBB - once she hits the level I can start duoing her with my paladin for exp, I'm taking a few days over to the OOT to farm cyclopses for gems / cash. I am also trying to work on her epic to get the SoW boots - tried it over the weekend, and the npcs in the bottom of Erud's Crossing never seemed to spawn. Last thing of note, again once she hits 50ish, I am putting her hard at work on the Iksar Crudgle quest.. the one that fits in the range slot and right clicks Carnage. Irionically, I have the bones from VS - just not the faction, or any other part of the quest, completed. (go me.)<br />
<br />
Suggestions on her gear are greatly appericated. If there is anything else I can clarify or answer questions regarding, please let me know. For the moment, I am PLing her (not fun as a paladin) off of the Walruses and Uthork Man o Wars in Eastern Wastes. Whenever the walruses go green (if before 42, this is) I am going to head to CoM or DL to get the last bit of required experience to begin grouping her and the paladin for QuickExp(tm).<br />

JB boots and arms instead of those, I guess; possibly compensate for the loss of WIS by swapping in a +WIS ring if you are having mana pool size issues.  There are some nice shields with at least that much AC but also some other stats, like a Bone Braced Buckler.  Look into Imbued Granite Spaulders for the shoulders, or an Obulus Death Shroud for the mana conservation focus effect.   Barbed Rubicite anything is good, has AC and WIS.  And the Range item could be as simple as a Howling Harpoon to get some extra WIS or a Goranga Idol for extra AC, that one doesn't have much going for it.</div></div><hr />
