<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been helping some of my friends do quests a lot lately and they keep asking me if I want to do one, but the problem is I don't really know of any that would be beneficial for me to do.  I did the Totemic quests a while ago just for fun, but I didn't really need any of the armor so I just ended up giving it away to a friend that wanted to start a Shaman.  <br />
<br />
Basically what I'd like to know is are there any quests that I can do that would be a bennefit to me?  I have a permanent group with a Warrior, Rogue, Druid, Pally, and Cleric/Wizard depending on the situation.  I think my equipment is pretty much set up, but if you see something that I can quest as an upgrade I'm all ears.  If it's not an equipment upgrade, I'd like to do something for situational uses, or something with a right clicky, etc.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one other thing...  I like to duel with friends so I'd love to here of any other &quot;clickies&quot; I can either quest or farm.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have been hunting in GD and have good CoV faction you can do the Bracer of Hammerfall quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=969).  Might not replace your Bracer of Scavenging, but depends what you're after.<br />

<br />
Always fun to summon hammers for people or just to toss at the people you're duelling and throw them off a bit. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Another fun one is the Rough Silver Chain quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1224).  Good for resists, not bad other stats.  Mana Preservation is too sweet to get rid of for you right now, but good to have for later on maybe.<br />
