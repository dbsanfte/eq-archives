<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have them duel, when the warrior kills the frog let it die and expire. Then roll a real class and go hunting. :)<br />

Alternatively, nadox will be fun at that level. at 52 you can't really solo there without downtime but you should be fine with your warrior. Head in through the lava tunnel  between dulak and gunthark, invis up, swim to the bridge and then climb up the right side. When you are there, with your back to the river turn left and run along to the corner. That is a safe corner to pull to. Loot is ok, xp should be good and continuous and if you get into any trouble you can gate the shaman and it is a very quick run/swim to the zone line for the warrior.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />

There are many threads about the best toon to box and where.  I have a very similar setup with my shaman is 53 and I have a choice of 57 warrior, 50 monk or 51 rogue.  Now where can ya fight .. its a tough call because with a warrior you have no way of escape besides the zone =)  And Sup-Heal doesnt help to much when your tank has 4.5-5k HP .. haha so you have to find something you can kill in one shot and heal after the fight =)  I spent some time in ME which is ok but if I were you I would check out Dulak in LoY .. seems like the mobs are pretty soft.  You age would be perfect for seb .. but you will always pull 2 =)  HS is out unless you get some escape potions.  CoM has been updated .. the Hole?  Heck even Kael bank might work =)  <br />
<br />
Now if you dont want to box or box in a group PoI, PoJ, even PoN are doable with a full group -- need a real healer -- Shaman are amazing but their abilities are kinda lacking when it comes to heals .. <br />
<br />
50-65 boxed is very questionable to me and unless your farming LB's for gems or cash I would seek groups .. with the new code changes its a plus.  Or solo =)  Its not you combo its your ability to heal that holds you back from biggie mobs that hit for 300.  If you were boxing a tank class that can heal itself or midigate you might be better off &lt; personal opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sup heal is more than sufficient for pop tier 1. I've been main healer and slower for my group when I was 54 with only about 2200 mana in poi. Not alot of downtime either, sure I was canni'ing like mad but who cares. Could even handle the non slowable mobs with me as only healer. Also done poi with my druid as only healer with sup heal as max heal when he had about 2500 mana. No canni there so all I was able to do is heal but it still worked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
huh? c'mon now. I can solo all 5 elements at the entrance without a single break between any of them and still be 100/100 before the last one drops. Or maybe you were thinking he was 2 boxing a druid and a warrior?<br />
