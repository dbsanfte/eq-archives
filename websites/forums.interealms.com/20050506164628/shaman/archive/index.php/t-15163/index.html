<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, this question pops up every few weeks i think.<br />
<br />
The answers are 'Yes' and 'Because they have no clue'.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to flame the other posters, but everyone here stated, that you either cannot heal sufficient in ALL situations or you need a truckload of additional AAs and items to get on par to other healing classes (hint - starts with a 'd' ).<br />
<br />
Why is that again? Never mind, i know there is no answer to that ...Early in the morning and still need more coffee here  ;) , so bear with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We used to have a spell on test called Khura's Mending, which was like a 2950 heal with a 10 second cast time.  It got scraped before ever going live.  Why did they do this?  Because we do not need it.<br />
<br />
If we had direct heals just as good as a druids, then the druid class would no longer have a reason to exist.  Why?  Because shaman heals combined with 75% slow is about 10x better than druid heals alone.<br />
<br />
On top of that, I do not even WANT another 10 second heal.   I would have liked quiescence to heal 400 a tick instead of 300, and I would have liked to see a slightly bigger and faster blast heal as a spec spell, but a slow, clumsy 10 second heal just doesnt do it for me.  There are basically two types of healing that need to be done:  Erratic healing and controlled healing.  Erratic healing is when a mob is unslowed, or flurries, or does anything that is unpredictable and/or causes a lot more damage than is easily healed.  You generally use fast blast heals to heal damage like this, because that 10 second heal might not land in time.  The other kind, controlled healing, is what you do when a mob is slowed and his damage is very predictable and easy to handle.  A cleric would let a tank get down to 40% or so and CH him.  A shaman, though, can just use quiescence.  It is extremely cheap, especially when paired with our awesome mana regen.  A 3-secondish cast time quiescence with SCRM behind it makes it very easy to keep up on a tank constantly.  KM costs twice as much mana (actually 3-4 times as much since SCM, specialize, and mana pres do not work with it), and heals for less than an SCRM quiescence.  Thus, quiescence is infinitely better suited to the task of healing than KM is.<br />
<br />
In addition to the power of quiescence, tnarg's is also a really nice heal.  With blessing of reverence and my agnarr shield (25% beneficial haste), I have a 2.4 cast time on tnarg's.  I also have ornate arms (improved healing 4), which are now quite easy to obtain and available to everyone.  My arms add between 1% and 20% to each heal.  On top of that, you have healing adept AA's, which can add up to 19% (sadly, in 221 aa, I have not found time to do this line yet).  Add in all those modifiers, and you've got a 2.4 second casting heal that regularly hits for 1700, sometimes more.  On top of that, with maxed healing gift (which I DO have), you will crit quite often (3k+ crits!).<br />
<br />
So, who needed khura's mending anyways?  I sure don't :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It would be great if SOE could get the healing spells a little bit sorted. Of course clerics are the king of heals. They have the CH, good HoT and good spot heals too. Let the druids have the iCH they have now and some spot heals (casting time 3.5-4sec, decent hp / mana ratio). For shamans we would have some HoT, fast spot heals (2.5-3.5sec casting time, worse HP / mana ratio then druid spot heal) and NO iCH.<br />
<br />
Stoicsm and torpor are good as they are now (may be a mini-mini torpor at 34 so we can speak about a HoT spell line). I would like to see a quies healing 350-400HP per tick for 240-275mana (yes, worse HP / mana ratio then now but more healing power), change tnargg's mending to 1200HP, 400mana, 3.3sec casting time and give us new spot heal at 65 like Besual's mending 1800HP, 620mana, 3.0sec casting time. Let SOE do that and I will be absolutly happy with our healing power. Well, may be my point of view will change if I can enter PoTime (only in EPs now)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The problem with quintesence is that you cannot go past the 50 hps, kraggs does about 75 hps in spam mode, tnargs 300 (but your oom in a minute doing that).  You can stack  quiescence and 2 kraggs for around 120 hps at a decent mana/hp rate, so there is a  use for that spell (e.g. you are the rampage healer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">with maxed healing AA and IH4 Tnarg's is doing just fine</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er.. SCM and spec do too work with it. Dunno about mp, since I havnt actually used the lameass spell in months.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Jinheim,<br />
<br />
using Blessing of Reverence to reduce spell time is all fine, my problem is only, if i got BoR, i already have a cleric in group  :eek: so i wouldn't have to heal 90 percent of the time to begin with. Or you got a pocket cleric, who refreshes BoR every few minutes for your healing comfort  ... So that argument is kinda flawed.<br />
<br />
For the other arguments i am not sure, if i get your point. Is it 'When a shaman has 200 plus AA and several special items, he can heal as good as a naked druid with his 3 or 4 basic heal spells' (both 65) ?<br />
<br />
Ok, i agree with that  :D<br />
<br />
More seriously, i agree somehow that shaman healing should be less efficient than druids (given slow and mana regen). But in general both classes should be able to handle the same healing needs (albeit with different tool sets) with the SAME level of AA and gear, and i don't believe that this is the case today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">While I dont truly believe our healing ability is fine as it is, I am a little tired of people using our mana regen as a reason why we dont have such and such an ability.<br />
When you consider all the horses, FT items, kei, pot9, etc etc, who really has mana problems anymore in exp groups? I have been in many groups that lacked a kei source, with a druid healer, and the druid has never been in a oom situation unless things went wild (which is rather rare). The only difference really if that druid had kei would be that he would have been able to toss in nukes/dots as well. So really that druid was a fine 'cleric' even without kei. <br />
Anyways, Im just bitter today, pay no heed. But our mana regen imo is very quickly becoming equal to those of every other caster in the game. We are still superior in that regard, but the margin is becoming negligible. So please stop using that excuse to compensate for imbalances. <br />

       I'm sorry but drood have a 4,6k %ch type ,far more than 2,9k.Don't forget they're 3 slower class also.On normal mob we're ok ,but when they mitigate.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I still use my CH-clone when playing the main healer.  It's more efficient and can catch up the damage lost to a hard-hitting mob, when the tank has Q on but it's not nearly enough.</div></div><hr />
