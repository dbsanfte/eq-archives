Instructions: <br />
Extract to your  EverQuest\UIFiles   folder.<br />
 <br />
Then in game, type:   /loadskin custom 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
<br />
You are probably going to want to change the clickies in the hotbutton window.  So here's how.<br />
<br />
First of all, you need to know the EQType for the item or bag slot you want displayed in the clicky window.  All the EQTypes are displayed inside the file we are about to open, so you don't have to alt-tab back n forth.<br />
<br />
You need to open: EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml in your EverQuest\UIFiles\Custom folder  (I suggest using TextPad or NotePad)<br />
<br />
When the file is open, I suggest searching for &quot;CUSTOM SLOT 1&quot;, and it will take you to this section.  All the EQTypes are listed RIGHT above this line.<br />
<br />
This is what it looks like in the file:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;!-- CUSTOM SLOT 1  --&gt;<br />
<br />
	&lt;InvSlot item = &quot;HB_Inv_InvSlot1&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;HB_Inv_InvSlot1&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;!--&lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;--&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;75&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;1&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;23&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;23&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Background&gt;A_SquareBtnPressed&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
		&lt;EQType&gt;22&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
		&lt;!--&lt;TooltipReference/&gt;--&gt;<br />
	&lt;/InvSlot&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically all the slots are in order.  1 being at the top, and counting down from there, up to 8.  There are 12 total slots, 8 clickies then your Pri, Secondary, Ammo, and Range are horizontal across the bottom.  (Ammo and Range are much smaller and stacked above and below each other as you can see when using the UI)<br />
<br />
In Custom Slot #1, I use EQType 22 as you can see above.  EQType 22 is the top left bag in your inventory.  You can set the EQTypes for the things you want, in Custom Slots 1-8.  I suggest leaving 9-12 alone, unless you really want to change them.  I've found having access to the Pri, Sec, Ammo, and Range slots pretty handy as a Shaman, especially if you have a bag open close to the window so you dan click your epic for added dmg.<br />
<br />
So just go down the list, and replace the EQType's, then save and reload the UI.  The great part about this, is you can alt-tab out of EQ, make the changes, save the file, then type:  /loadskin custom 1 and you'll see the changes once it loads.<br />
<br />
If you have ANY questions/concerns/suggestions, PLEASE post them here or email me.  Posting here would be great as others can see your questions and may benefit from the responses.<br />

Extra's:<br />
1)  Open the Friends Window to get an EXP BAR with %.<br />
2)  The Target Window is a Timer Window for Slow, a 6:30 timer.  When you slow a mob, slide the lil triangle to the point on the bar where the colored line is, when the colored line loops around to that same spot again, it has been 6:30.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">cool stuff, been useing it past week or so, couple things.<br />
<br />
have to open up the actions box for invite/disband/follow.  <br />
no lfg box which can be handy for letting someone know they're now the leader now that someone else went ld.<br />
the target ring is bout enough to make someone puke if they had too much fun the night before.<br />
I get the message each time that I log on that somethings incompatible and when I go back to character select the character select UI is missing /boggle. but hey I can still change characters n stuff with arrow keys.<br />
<br />
and hey, cool little slow timer ya got in there.<br />
