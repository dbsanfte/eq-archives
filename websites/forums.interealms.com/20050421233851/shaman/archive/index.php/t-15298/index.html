<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonabla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, First time posting but I have a quick question.<br />
<br />
I've been playing my shaman more and more and I'm looking for some decent spots to duo with (2 box) either my 55 BL or 61 Rng.  Dosen't have to be great exp or loot mostly looking for something different then what I've been doing.  Here's where I've been.  Mostly Fungus Grove with the Ranger and Velks with the BL with some Dulaks thrown in when I can get there.  Any suggestions would be great.  <br />
<br />
Oh yea, the shaman is level 52 not the greatest equip and with most spells.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your suggestions</div></div><hr />

Veksar is pretty awesome too, I could slow any entrance mob at 52. <br />
I can't really give any more than that as I'm bored at 53, I don't have the foggiest idea where to go.</div></div><hr />
