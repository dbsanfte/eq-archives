<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">66 - Ding Normally with reg xp<br />
<br />
67 - Ding with some # of AA.  May need to make is some # of AA spend in OOW AA's so people cannot get 66 and 67 in minutes.<br />
<br />
68 - Ding with leadership xp.  Obviously prerq is level 67.  I can see people crying now about leadership aa sucking but SOE could put more abilities in.  I myself only have mana enhancement but I am the type that wants a level 70 player to be an all around player and not just a 2 day twink-a-thon.<br />
<br />
69 - Solo/Single group style long quest with each class getting a good storyline.  I miss good storyline quests.  I love the paladin epic quest storyline.  Maybe even make Epic 2.0 the prereq for 69. Ding 69 upon receiveing it.<br />
<br />
70 - Solo type trials.  Each class would have to proove how much they know about their class.  One part could be lore riddle from an NPC another a POJ trial type on a soloable scale.  If you are level 70 you are not just another get to 65 in 2 days bot.  You have got the AA, the epic.<br />
<br />
These are just spit ball ideas.  Overall there should be a difference between a 65 and a 70.  Level 70 should mean you have mastered your class and have an all around knowledge and use off skills available.  I do not mean make 500aa a prereq for 70 as most aa's do not define a class but if you see a level 70 it will not be some uber guilds 24 hr everyone knows your password twink leveled in 2 days.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have any ideas on how you should level from 65-70.  I personally would like to level in different ways besides the usual grind.<br />

The leadership xp thing is off I think.  So you think that in an xp group, only one person can get xp at a time?  Think finding a group is hard now, wait until everyone is fighting over who is the leader.<br />
<br />
Epic Required.  If you trust what SOE is saying, only the uber of the uberest is going to be able to get epic 2.0.  1.5 will be for time level players.  Ok, so you have just shut out about...60% of the playerbase from ever getting to level 69.  Guess you think that only raiding guilds should be able to level?<br />
<br />
Not flaming, but these aren't really very realistic.<br />
<br />
I think that normal leveling will be fine.  Think about it, to get xp at level 68 you are going to have to be killing some serious mobs to get xp.  That will keep the leveling down somewhat unless they put out lots of high level, low power mobs in OOW.  Could happen, but so far, the GoD mobs don't seem to be great AAxp from what I have seen, good luck getting xp at 68 off of them..  I think that the xp grind from 65 to 70 will be quite long even without any extra reqs.<br />
<br />
However, in the old mud I played, you had to do a certain number of quests to get to each level.  You had quest points assigned to each quest.  So you could either do lots of easy ones, or a few hard ones.  It really was just a pain, but did make you run all over the world to do stuff and help you see some stuff.  Dont' really think it is a great idea here unless they find a way to implement it well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still like the idea similer to class titles.<br />
<br />
Keep AA xp on. and at say 15 OOW AA spent you ding to level 66. Then 45 you get 67. 80 you get 68. 125 69 and 200 Level 70. And have good upgrades in charecter power for each. Not 30 point AA. <br />
<br />
People can get what about an AA an hour for serious xp only groups. So 200 + hours for level 70 Plus a large amount of incremental Charecter increases of power and choice. Rather than  Mainline xp till 70 then work on AA. <br />
<br />
Make static increases in Archtype and class abilitys teired  Like 2% in Heals 2% Crit increases. 2% Mana total. 2% hp totals. 2% DD damage focus. 2% Dot focus. 2% MR reduction for your spells cast. And fire and poisen and disease and cold. <br />
<br />
Under class abilities For shaman Take some of the suggestions of the many class boards. 10% Double attack chance (Capped at say 80%) 10% Damage bonus mainhand added (80% chance) 2% Dodge increasers. And To hit increasers. Mitigations. Avoidance. Strikethrough.  Raw attk numbers and % increases in regen numbers as well. So if you have 35 worn regen and spent say 40 AA it is 20% better for you. So in actuallith it is 49 points worn regen and the spells add to that. Same thing with manaregen. Give the ability to Have haste innate for you if you want it. Or even overhaste. All in percentages not hard coded numbers. So that later expansions can scale. Like the HP increase for Natural durability. Healing improvements for Hot's and Blast heals. More mana savings. Spell haste. All of this included in a huge gamut of AA choices geared or capped at around 20% improvements in effects with a few bennies for each class. <br />
<br />
Make the value of a charecter in the charecter not the item centric rat race. You replace items. And can lose effects due to swapping items but as you gain in power the items should not be the sole source of your ability.<br />
<br />
Make certain really decent AA unlockable by raid and Single group quests. (instanced of course so no cockblocking)<br />
<br />
Give us clearly defined goals short term and long term with gradual no need to be parsed effects. All tied into both questing and Raiding rewards and paths of gear and xp and loot. And take the god damned drudgery out of both raiding and the hunt for xp. Give us something to do when we are beating up the critters of the world. Faction let us build credit with races so even the lowly gnoll you punted halfway across the zone would help you somewhat. <br />
<br />
Make the choices challenging and fun again. Rather than a shopping list of what is best. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I will not buy OOW if they make the game as hard as SnowwSilverhammer suggested.<br />
<br />
I believe players need some NEW fun in EQ, not those old TIME sink again or EQ will lost more players faster.<br />
<br />
Nothing is wrong if everyone is lvl 70 IF they give us enough grind/raid/quest content to play.<br />
<br />
And of couse the MEANING AND REASON to get to level 70.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Level 70 should mean you have mastered your class and have an all around knowledge and use off skills available.<br />
<br />
That is what it used to mean to obtain the level cap. *feels nostalgic*<br />
<br />
Diwah, your ideas were pretty interesting. <br />
<br />
Dinging level 66 with regular experience ... sure, sounds good. <br />
<br />
Dinging level 67-70 ... I, too, miss good storyline quests. I'm working my way through to the Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl (I think that's the name, I'm awful tired at the moment), and am really enjoying the storyline that goes with it. Tradeskills are for the birds, lol. :p I don't know as though I like the idea of making the Epic 2.0 a pre-requisite for 69. SOE has implied that only &quot;la creme de la creme&quot; will even be able to attempt the 2.0, much less obtain it. Under your idea, that puts level 69, 70, and the 2.0 out of the reach of most of us. I say the Epic 2.0 ought to be a separate quest. <br />
<br />
I would like to see a fairly involved quest added. But it should be fun, it should be filled with solo-group-raid content, and I will go out on a limb and say the entire quest should be instanced. No cockblocking and preventing folks from advancing. I have to say I like the idea of solo trials of some kind. I could give you all sorts of ideas for various shaman trials, heh. <br />

EDIT: Edited ideas after reading in Glori's summit post that OOW levels will not be tied to AAs. Kind of made a couple of my ideas worthless, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they do anything besides straight leveling it would just be a giant pain in the ass timesink that most people would hate. One of the few things that casuals can get the same as ubers is level. Theres no reason to leave them out of that too. If they tie leveling to anything but normal xp it is just plain dumb.<br />
<br />
Omens has a few things that might make me come back and play casually with some of my old friends if done right, but making leveling from 66-70 require AA's, questing, or anything else would be lame beyond belief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vizxor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Been playing for over four years, miss the old days. Hope they make it 100 AA per new lvl, do a quest, get epic, whatever to get it. Make it something to achieve, not just grind out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I could just buy 5 levels in the bazaar....that's what I would do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There will be nothing special about leveling to 70, it will be just like the 65 levels before it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They should not tie lvls to aa, in the games current state that would be ridiculous. The problem alot of new Eqers are having is the GAP between them and the rest of us that have been playing for 5 years. <br />
<br />
Of course they should be behind and there should be advancment for the elders that have been around but Think about someone new to EQ. <br />
Having to grind to lvl 70 and than needing a whole bunch of aa's to be usefull. Now tie in that they need so many aa to advance to lvl 70. The new player w/o twink gear or raid equiped friends to help them level has no chance in hell of catching anyone. <br />
<br />
When you take away that feeling from the new player it becomes to overwhelming for them and they end up quitting. I think this has caused problems even going up as far as POP. Grinding exp should be less tedious. The problem is as the game developed it wasnt a big deal for most of us to grind out an extra 5lvls here and there to gain max lvl but they neglected how much exp is needed now to gain max lvl from scratch. <br />
<br />
Seriously should exp be really as slow as it is with 70 lvls and hundreds of aa's to obtain ? personally i dont think so and its not a casual / raider discussion its just plain boring. AA's are fun to grind because they give us an individual say ( almost ) in how our character is progressing i would like to see something more along the lines of individual progression like a whole bunch of aa's to choose from that makes us individuals and maybe its worth having 5 shaman on raid cause each one brings something unique to the table. /shrug im rambling i know but was just my thought about the whole exp grind.<br />
