<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I emailed sony over a bug that has happened to my character. Here is the email explaining the full story...spread the word.<br />
<br />
Subject: After deleveling, and releveling, bugged hit point regeneration. Please help, GM could not. <br />
To: eqtech@soe.sony.com <br />
       <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
My character is a level 59 Iksar Shaman on the Luclin server, Kialan.<br />
<br />
Stats regarding hp regen: AA Innate Regen 3, and level 59 Iksar regen which is (supposed to be) 12 standing, 18 sitting. This makes my HP regen 15 standing, 21 sitting.<br />
<br />
It was the above until the other day, I died in a raid in The Hole. I lost level 59 and was back to 58. I had Form of the Great Bear on when I was ressurected back to level 59. But...my Iksar regen was lost. I now regenerate 13 standing, 19 sitting. It is acting as if I have level 58 Iksar regeneration, when I am 59. I tried dying and getting ressurected again but that did not fix it. I had GM-Admin Teutraux (I believe that was his name) answer my petition, after making a copy of my character, and trying many things, the GM Admin could not help me. He told me to /bug report it, which I did extensively.<br />
<br />
I am hoping someone can help me get this fixed, as a shaman I depend on my hit point regeneration with cannibalize. And I have the 20% Iksar exp penalty, yet not getting the full benefit of being an Iksar. Please respond, this is a true bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Regen goes up at 55 (56?) and at 60 IIRC, I think you were somehow getting the 60 bonuses at 59 for some strange reason.  You should regenerate the same at 58 as you do at 59, and it will go up when you hit 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nope, regen upgrades 50, 51, 56, 59. It all went fine until this time. Check eqcastersrealm (yeah I know they're incorrect a lot, but their regen chart is correct).<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: even check magelo. Regen increases from 58 to 59. It says I should have 15 standing, 21 sitting. Minus 3 from both and you got level 59 iksar regen alone because I have regen 3...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://jumpspot.net/eq/monks_by_level.html<br />
<br />
Got that off monkly-business, no improvement listed there either.<br />
<br />
I know it's been a while since I was level 59, but i'm 99.999% sure I did not get a regen increase dinging 59.<br />
<br />
Castersrealm is BAD.  A large portion of their info is out of date, and even more is just plain wrong (and always was).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay posting my magelo...check out the hp regen.<br />
<br />

<br />
It was exactly this before the bug ..and that monk thing isn't right on the regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kongwu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Leveled both an iksar shaman and an iksar monk to 60, neither of them got the (unmodified) regen of 12 standing and 18 sitting before 60...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Magelo gets stuff wrong too. It still hasn't factored in the Iksar AC bonus. Maybe Magelo got their info from Casters Realm :p<br />
<br />
As far as I know, regen rate doesn't change at 59. It changes at 60.</div></div><hr />
