<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where would you take a 35 shammy and paladin duo? We are both moderately twinked, nothing extravagant but not too bad off.  I was thinking Crystal Caverns but I'm open to any and all suggestions.</div></div><hr />

I'd suggest LGuk, deadside.  You should be able to mow through those undead frogs without a problem.</div></div><hr />

this is an easy one... mar saru and the other zone with the mushrooms and tribals(35 to 39 do the tribals near griegs end zone). Also, the zone right off of shadow haven.  you, your dog and the paladin should be able to rip through some stuff there.  Haste the paladin and your dog.  Make sure the paladin is using a good weapon (a big 2hs would be nice). <br />
<br />
I was doing this with a monk and myself until 38.. we then left there to go to that zone off of shadowhaven with the beetle things and alien dudes.  I think it is echo caverns, but i forget the name. <br />
<br />
I just bought LoY so i am considering heading over there to kill some stuff with my monk buddy.. However, I am unsure where to go.  We will both be around level 40 when we get there, and we have fairly good gear after using trade skills to build up money.<br />
<br />
I need to start working on the Stoicism quest so that I will be a useful healer for our duo.  So far, we've been unstoppable.  We can take on 5 to 6 mobs that are blue at once.  Using instill and keeping stuff slowed is amazing.  I use a granite face grinder that i picked up for 300pp in the bazaar and a blight hammer for 500pp (got lucky i guess).<br />
<br />
Anyway, where can we fight in the new world?  Is it worth leaving luclin and the KEI hub in the nexus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Symbah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Like I said in another post. Hit the beach in Gulf of Gunthak.  With a pally in your grp you will just own the mobs there.  Loot kinda sucks, but damn the exp is flowing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kaesora. Did a SK + Shaman duo there from 35 to 41</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you want to go to LoY zones, go to gunthrak and invis, go down the corrodor to the back door of nadox (not the front entrance by dulak zone).<br />
<br />
there is a two spawn of guards that pops probably about every 15 minutes or so, and one of them in a PH for a SK guard that drops a necklace thing. once these are down, go pull singles from the path area. the diseased things have a chance of dropping a shroom looking thing, that has a one shot cast of clarity. it dropped twice for me in the 2 hours I was hunting there. money is not great, but don't just leave the drops from the mobs, one of the stackable things sold for almost 9pp to vendors with my cha at 110.<br />
<br />
there is usually no one around this area (except for higher levels going into nadox) and the errant train from people that know about this area right now.<br />
<br />
there is a spot that you can sit though that is far enough away that if someone trains they won't aggro on you, and usually only one or two of the critters come after anyway, and you can have them from there :)<br />
<br />
I zoned into nadox a few times right here, and there are some elemental things that are over there, that conned white to a 42.<br />
<br />
you can also try out dulak, or the zone in area to dulak (there is a little town like thing there). probably better drops than the area I was at....</div></div><hr />
