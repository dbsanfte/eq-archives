<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Celebrities and sports figures are normal Americans too.  Baseball is our National pasttime.  It isn't for the personal glory anymore—It is for the people of America...gaining back the Freedom...and Pride that we as a whole haven taken for granted for so long now.  I post this only for the last sentence.  It kinda hit me :)  This is to all of the brave people who are working day and night at the WTC and the Pentagon.<br />

This qoute is from Todd Zeile of the New York Mets.<br />

&quot;I think a lot of guys are inspired right now to do something that would be miraculous if we can somehow get ourselves back in the race,&quot; Zeile said. &quot;Maybe we can make this city proud of us, the way we're proud of them.&quot;</div></div><hr />
