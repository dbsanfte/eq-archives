<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zimbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm lvl 26 and want some equipment advise.  What should I be looking for, although I'm all out of money now.  :)  <br />
I have a slime coated harpoon to switch out for the gloomwater.  Should I?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Definently. Your WIS looks a little low.<br />
<br />
One extremely nice upgrade you could probably obtain with little trouble is the Blackened Ally Medallion. AC6, +5 INT/WIS, effect of Mana Preservation II. Great for your lower levels.<br />
<br />
Else, consider replacing some of those banded pieces with Totemic. Should not be to difficult to quest yourself at around 34.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you have some nice gear for your level in several slots.  I would suggest balancing your HPs (it appears that is your main focus) with a bit more Wis/Mana.  I personally shoot for about 150 Wis, but it's personal preference.<br />
<br />
A chipped bone bracelet is very nice as well - AC 4, 5 Wis and reduces the cost of your DoTs by 25% or so (cant remember name of focus).  Makes what mana you have last a bit longer.<br />
<br />
Don't listen to anyone that recommends Jaranth Armor from KC - you can't wear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zimbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great thanks you guys.  I'm on Innoruuk and have some high level friends who have helped me out some.  What I need to know is where can I get that Black Allay Necklace and the Chipped Bone Bracelet?  What monsters have those as loot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Black Alloy Medallion drops in Runnyeye. I got mine off of Lord Pickclaw. It may drop off of random goblins too. <br />
<br />
Chipped Bone Bracelet can be found on the Great Oowomp in Timorous Deep. Chief Goonda or An Ogre Shaman in Western Karana. Not sure where else it may drop.</div></div><hr />
