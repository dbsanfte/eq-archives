Seriously. The shaman in WoW are great. If your even a lil bit like me in how i like my MMORPG's you will be leaving EQ in 1-3 months and never coming back except to remember the old days.<br />
<br />
From this night foward im kicking my heals up and sitting back and watching the ship sink. SoE refused to plug the holes in the hull depsite all the hard work you all did and i did and now im just going to watch it go down with a ale in right hand and a wood elf in the other.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>xanier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well all Xanier here just checking shamm boards to see how things are going. As I suspected SoE has done nothing for the hardest working class in the game bar none.  <br />
<br />
As I have stated before have over 400 playing days logged and just got to a point where as a shaman I felt useless to the high end game. I only felt &quot;fun&quot; when I was soloing.<br />
<br />
I was in WoW stress test. I must agree EQ days are quickly going to come crashing down. The game play at just the newbie levels is far superior and more well thought out then the best days of eq.<br />
<br />
It is truly sad. EQ was the best. They should have stopped trying to steal WoW ideas i.e. Instanced zones, targeting circle and many more. Caught on to the fact that Blizzard listens to the player base and doesn't blow them off.<br />
<br />
WoW is my next step.  It seems I have left many good times and grinding times behind. Not all 400 days were fun but not all were as sad as the game has become.<br />
<br />
WoW I am on the way. I will be in the NEXT greatest MMORPG from start instead missing it like I did joining with Kunark in EQ. <br />

however , once you get to level 70 and find your role is only buffing and casting champ! i am betting you`ll get bored very quickly. and i will be there either to say i told you so, or to say good for you (if you enjoy it).<br />
in fact i think alot will get to 67 and be so disheartened at that point they might quit.<br />
<br />
It is just my opinion that the level 70 shaman is as boring as hell to play, but you have to do alot of work while being bored silly. its not a good mix. i am just trying to save you spending money ona product thats is woefully lacking in anything near kunark, vellious, luclin or pop quality. and as pointed out the best way to get soe to react is to not give them your cash. and yes you can still play without buying oow and it will still hurt soe.<br />

It might be a good thing what EQ players (yes we still are that) like so much in the other game so they finally get a clue.  We play this game over 4 years now, we still care about it.<br />

If oow offers more for a non raiding person then I'll probably buy it, reactivate and have a play about, heres hoping it turns out to be more enjoyable than GoD did.

To be honest I would have expected better out of some of you old timers.  People raise their concerns about the direction of the class and games and folks say stop whinning and do something about it.  Those concerned try to do something about it and folks tell them to **** and go away if they don't like it.<br />

<br />
Hmm, WoW is for people with no friends and that dont group eh.<br />
<br />
Thats funny, cause in the beta that i was just playing, i grouped often and it was EASIER to group in WoW then in EQ. Quests and progression are shared with group members so you dont even have things such as camps per say like in EQ, there is NO reason to not let a person share your camp, so there isnt 1 uber 65 soloing a area and stoping you from your quest. If someone is at your quest camp, you can invite them to share in the quest if they are able and you can group up and do it together.  <br />
<br />
Now let me think again how EQ grouping works again. Sit LFG in bazaar or PoK or tradeskilling for sometimes a hour or more waiting on a group to form and if your lucky everyone is flagged for the zone you want to go to. If the cleric has to leave the group is over, if the warrior or knight has to leave the group is over. Go do quests as a group to gain noticable EXP, well thats something EQ doesnt do at all, so there is no group adventure to share in, just group exping which is a mindless, half AFK afair. So if you mean there is no grouping in WoW in the way that there is no boring mindless grinding, you are correct. However there is interesting quests you can share as you progress through the game and not even realize your exping.<br />
<br />
<br />
But all that aside all i can say is that you sound like you havent played 1 day of WoW and with that in mind i would suggest you do play it when you can then re-examine your position.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except unless you've done the beta, then you have no idea what you are &quot;voting&quot; on.<br />
<br />
If the shaman class sux after playing a month in OoW i'll sign on, join in, take my pants off for, whatever protest you want.<br />
<br />
The reason why people get sick of the constant omg-the-shaman-class-is-dead-again is because we've heard it a million times before and because a lot of the people who spout it are parroting the doomsayers.<br />
<br />
I'll make my judgements based on what i experience in the game, not on what's posted on the crybabble crucible.</div></div><hr />

This one is Blizzards  BIG difference. <br />
<br />
As far as making a differernce we have been trying to make a difference as a community for five years. But since we can solo  mob X they asssume they don't need to listen to us.  As long as people play and put up with the disrespect and getting ignored like the shaman community the  &quot;dev's&quot; at SoE will not change a dang thing.  I have seen more action for changes then any other year with this exspansion but instead of positive changes to make us raid friendly they post some smart ass post about how they don't have a shaman in house and they are going to do away with the class. <br />
<br />
We have spoken up and no one has been listening. NOW  BLIZZARD DOES listen. so since we have stuck together for so long in this shaman community we came here to post and try to get others to think about a viable option.<br />

I'm not in the WoW beta, so I dont know if it has the tools to allow that to happen, but I do know that if it doesn't, it will never have the hold over people that EQ did. WoW is a new game, and as it ages will go through the same ageing process EQ did.<br />
<br />
As for Bara, he is clearly tired of the game and wants to move on. Nothing sony can do and no new content will change that. It will never be good enough. While many in that situation simply say their goodbyes and go, some try to rationalize their decision by taking as many others with them as they can, so it seems the right thing to do in their mind. If someone else is still enjoying the game, whether it be for what they are doing or for hanging out with friends, I dont understand why others feel the neccessity of trying to convince them through logic, malaise or poison that they should leave.<br />

It's an open forum, he can go as he pleases, but I will put this on my &quot;list of quotes that might come in handy one day&quot; list to use on your farewell post.  Hopefully it will register with SoE if more shaman leave.<br />
<br />
To shaman thinking about leaving, if you've waited this long to do so, it might make more sense to wait a couple weeks till OoW is sorted out and see if there's anything worthwhile staying for.  This is just friendly advice, please feel free to to ignore it.  This seems like a little pre-mature cancellation to me.  Please make sure you clean up after you leave ;).<br />

<br />
<br />
No your not getting it mate. Ill try again to explain it, maybe the flaw is in the presentation.<br />
<br />
When you think of EQ grouping you think of your friends getting groups, you think of being rejected cause your not the right class or cause you dont know the people in the group and its a guild group, you think of sitting LFG trying to get a GoD group together. EQ groups are made in advance and designed to last a few hours to &quot;grind out&quot; some levels.<br />
<br />
Groups dont form in WoW like that, wether there is a lot of people or a lil has no bearing on the game what so ever. I mean you CAN LFG and put one together with friends or guild or specific classes, but its not need as it is in EQ. In my experiences with WoW, you go off and start a quest, you head tot he quest area to gain what your looking for and its THEN that the groups are made. Not because they have to be made, but cause people are willing to have you help. There is NOTHING for them to loose. In EQ when your on a quest, you sit at a camp for hours waiting for a drop for your quest and if someone else comes its either too bad for them or too bad for you if you AFK a sec ause they will KS you. In WoW when your on a quest and you find a camp already has people there, it doesnt matter. When you join a group you have the option of sharing that quest with the other members of the group, so like if you need to kill 10 mobs lets say, as you kill them, they get the kill too, the quest is shared equaly and there is no reason keep someone out of the group and only a benifiet to allow them in cause the kills/drops will come faster with more people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does that help you understand how grouping works ? Its a totaly different mentality and its a good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">... but instead of positive changes to make us raid friendly they post some smart ass post about how they don't have a shaman in house and they are going to do away with the class. <br />
<br />
I was with you until this. SOE didn't make that post - EVER!! A player did, as a satorical comment. As a joke. That you believe it and then base that for your &quot;final straw&quot; example takes my sympathy to your whole point and turns it into laughter.<br />
<br />
The word boycotting gets played a lot here. Ooohhh, you radical geeks!! Stand up and show the evil corporate giant!! Not buying OoW to protest but keeping your shaman account open (even worse if you also play the toon elsewhere) is not boycotting. Cancelling all accounts and following up with pointed, reasoned emails and postings on all major boards explaining why is &quot;boycotting.&quot;<br />
<br />
All I see here is folks not buying a new expansion ... yet. Except Lit, who historically has quit playing EQ at least twice a day. Ok, not that often, but more often than I have ... which is generally the day of and day after one of my 3 account subscriptions expires. Then I tend to renew it because (1) I am either a junkie to the habit of playing EQ or (2) I am still getting enjoyment from the game. Likely more 1 than 2 though 2 more often than not feeds 1.<br />
<br />
If you are not honestly walking away from EQ because of your dissatisfaction with the game progression then, please, just stop climbing on the soapbox. For the rest, there is no Kumbaya-around-the-campfire issues here. Cancel billing. Post something simple here: &quot;Cancelled billing, tired of the nonsense, moving on, good luck and have fun everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Better yet, don't post. Your cancelled billing makes all the point SOE needs to understand. You are a customer. You are unhappy. You are taking your business away from them (presumed to be somewhere else.) Think about it. If all your posts, comments, points, parses, suggestions were not listened to while you were paying ... what makes you think the effort to publically rant after you stop playing is going to do any good.<br />
<br />
OoW will take care of itself. If it turns out to be another GoD fiasco (either at release or after the first month's patches neuter it) EQ player exudus may very well be the first ding of the death knoll for the game. Now, if, either at release or after the first month of patches, OoW becomes stable, interesting, available and worth the time playing there to the majority of players in the game ... where is the problem?<br />
<br />
Those who choose at this point to wait and see are not going to join your &quot;boycott.&quot; Those who are not going to buy the expansion are kinda-sorta doing it by their actions.<br />
<br />
Now ... in the big picture ... if EQ has stirred your revolutionary spirit, by all means protest. Boycott. Sit in. March. But find a better target. A game is not it. Burn your Nikes until children are no longer employed in their overseas factories. Go nekkid cuz 9 out of 10 items of clothing you wear was made in a sweat shop. Turn veggan because killing animals is just wrong. Stop eating veggies until they are all organically grown because the pesticides are bad for you. Tons of options out there for you to really sink your teeth of radicalism into ... don't limit to something as unimportant as EQ.<br />
<br />
Or, just head to the medicine cabinet, pick up the Ritilan and get back on schedule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">OoW looks like it will be fun.  I don't really want to buy it, because I am planning to switch to WoW when it comes out.  The thing is you basically have to buy it because of the level cap raise.  Thats the only thing that makes me mad about this expansion, if you don't buy it, you are left behind.  You dont have a choice not to buy it like with GoD, LoY, or LDoN, but are forced to because of the cap.  But other than that it looks like I will have alot of fun there with my mage and shaman when I finally get him up in levels.</div></div><hr />

Most people I know wont take someone who is not in the same guild or who they dont know in groups, because they don't trust the skills or level of development of people they dont know. Unless skills dont matter in WoW, I dont see how that is going to be different from EQ. If the game is to have staying power, there has to be progression based on difficulty, and if you have that then people are going to be choosy about who they hang out with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As for Bara, he is clearly tired of the game and wants to move on. Nothing sony can do and no new content will change that. It will never be good enough. While many in that situation simply say their goodbyes and go, some try to rationalize their decision by taking as many others with them as they can, so it seems the right thing to do in their mind. If someone else is still enjoying the game, whether it be for what they are doing or for hanging out with friends, I dont understand why others feel the neccessity of trying to convince them through logic, malaise or poison that they should leave.<br />
<br />
Bara, just go with grace, not with poison.<br />
<br />
there are a few points i feel i must defend, <br />
1. i never suggested that if you enjoy the game or like shaman as is that you MUST boycott it. it was a suggestion, obviously you dont seem to know the difference, a suggestion is just that, it does not mean you have to take it.<br />
<br />
2. i never said i was leaving either, i said i wasnt buying OOW, not that i was quiting EQ. It seem that you think that you cant play eq without buying OOW? why?  my guild will still do god and time.<br />
<br />
3. i am not trying to take poeple with me , but i am trying to get poeple to think rather that just blindly buy an expansion, even if not boycotting it, i would advise waiting for a couple weeks  at least while beta 2.0 goes ahead.<br />
<br />
all i was pointing out is that poeple have called for shaman to do somehthing like warriors did and alot thought that nobody would have noticed. i just pointed out that we now have 1 thing that will be missed now, and so can make a stand.</div></div><hr />

Yea, the player joke did get me I have to admit I thought that was real. However it doesn't change the fact that for 5 years now shamans have been calling for something. In 5 years ONE class has NEVER been changed. GUESS who  yep you guesed it SHAMANS.  I have quit eq and I am putting my money where my mouth is.  I have seen MANY great shamans leave or change classes because they just got fed up with SoE  CRAP.<br />
<br />
You nailed my point on the head Darjee-  SoE It isn't about entertainment or even the player base to them. They have absolutely no concern for those who play.<br />
<br />
Blizzard on the  other hand is the stark opposite of SoE.  So my point once again was to present a possible alternative for those who might be willing to accept it and to point out I am no fly by night  EQ on to the next MMORPG - 400 days eq logged and never quit for any other MMORPG  not sure what else I can say to make my point that it is not a fad it is the real deal with WoW.  I was coming here to a community of shamms who don't really get into bashing but rather into healthy discusion. Just like we are having now. Was just presenting an alternative.<br />

As for boycotting OoW, I already plan to buy it.  It looks like I will have fun in it and I look forward to grouping with a few of my friends in the new zones and tasks.  The graphics upgrade looks fairly nice too and will be a chance to test my new video card :D</div></div><hr />

You will be considered &quot;too low&quot; for KT by people with half your skills. Even in Time/GoD raids, they are going to want OoW buffs, and you are not going to be able to supply them.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Xan, no personal offense intended towards you. I apologize for coming off that way. My laughter was kinda general - your's is not the only post I have seen where that SOE joke was taken seriously.<br />
<br />
Over the last 5 years every class has been changed, with the exception being, for the most part, shaman. The irony here is that shaman have not been significantly upgraded or nerfed until mitigation and mudflation came into the game. So for 3.8 or 4 years (whatever the timeline is) shaman have not been &quot;changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every other class has seen significant changes over this time. Some for the better, some for the worst ... some that taken altogether have even balanced them ... somewhat.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong on what I meant by my post in this thread. I am no more happy with SOE and their shaman ignorance than anyone else. Working up through the levels confidently to only get to the end and find I am the heavy weigh contender who must fight the big fight with his hands tied behind his back is an unacceptable slam. I have my own bitterness about this.<br />
<br />
Then again, as it stands, OoW will introduce major slams to enchanters ... the skills SOE made enchanters embrace (charming) and major CC skills are nerfed to hell in this expansion. Watch their boards on how they are forgotten and left to wander GoD zones to feel useful coming to your chanter board soon.<br />
<br />
The list goes on - from board to board, classes are finding (or presuming) they have been minimized by OoW ... except, of course, clerics. But dealing with content will tell how that stacks up. I am hopeful that SOE is being democratic in their minimizing and have done so to all classes (not really, just tossing out some ironic humor.)<br />
<br />
A number of friends have already ended billing and decided to quit EQ simply because they are general players who foresee NEVER getting their 68-70 spells from raid mobs they will never get a chance to fight. Or at least not soon enough for them ... like this year and next. The first bitter pill of this perception has been the trial after trial after trial (expeditions) in GoD without ever seeing a spell drop for them. They don't anticipate the drop rate to increase much more in OoW than it is in GoD ... at least once the standard expansion re-tune is done and drops are nerfed once SOE meets its X-subscriber numbers cutoff.<br />
<br />
In their opinion, SOE has excluded them from enjoying progression on an equal footing (meaning, having access to gear/spells somewhere down the road) in the game at their desired pace. I can't blame them, and even somewhat-share this perception. I have 3 accounts still active but each has gone from my normal 6 month billing to month by month. SOE is not addressing the issues - for shaman or anyone else. My blind faith in good overcoming evil is the only thing keeping me subscribed. That faith has limititations ... OoW will be likely be my final straw. I have only purchased the expansion for 1 account ... so I can see for myself if SOE is turning the corner and actually making the game fun, interesting and entertaining again.<br />
<br />
If not, then I am done with EQ. It has been a fun ride for the most part. That I have to honestly say, most times, is due to the people playing - at least those close to me. With most of them gone, I wonder if I am just one of those folks who takes a bit of time to figure out the horse I am riding has been dead awhile.<br />
<br />
Anyways ... I love that this post pretty much totally contridicts my previous post in this thread. Meds must be wearing off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Hey Lit,<br />
<br />
One thing you are not taking into account. The age of EQ.<br />
<br />
I have been around since beta 4 Of EQ. And other than a small break at the beginning of this year played pretty much every day for the last 5 years (Or at least logged on)<br />
<br />
EQ when it started was group making heaven. It didnt matter the class. It almost didnt matter the level or the gear.<br />
<br />
All that mattered at the time was there is a person who might hlep keep me alive. As people huddled around some landmark that started to get called something repeatedly.<br />
<br />
I remember The house. I remember T2. I remember The hill. I remember all the little camp names we came up with. <br />
<br />
The camping came about because people were too scared to go new places. And because at the end of the day people will travel the path that is easiest for them.<br />
<br />
Wow will be no different. As time goes on and the like minded people meet up they will form Cliques. And from there they will progress in a like manner. And in fact with the evolution of Online gaming  and established guilds I can bet it will progress faster than EQ ever did. <br />
<br />
The genie is out the bottle and will never be recaptured again. We might have a game that will help us relive some of those fun times, but in the end it is never as good as the first time. <br />
<br />
WoW could be the best thing since sliced bread. (And from what I have seen it is damn good. But. It is not my first time. And while it might be a superiour game in every single aspect, It will never have the wonder of that trek I took the last night of EQ beta. When I took a human thief from Qeynos to the inside of Oggok. With no maps. And at the time no Movable invis. <br />
<br />
Omens is not going to change EQ. It will however add sometihng to the game. A Little headroom for the non raiding player that is me. Is it going to be great? No. It won't Then developers that work on EQ are a bunch of marginal players in a game that is going n 6 years old built on tech that is what 10 years old? They have neither the skills or the creativity to make the game great again. That is shown by all of thier past offerings. Good ideas. Poorly and shortsightedly implimented. <br />
<br />
But they will get my money for Omens for one simple reason. I want to die in these new lands. And get even the slightest bit of fun I can while walking the world in the skin of a shaman I have played for 5 years. I might hate SoE for what they have done to the game and for the lack of care. But I still love the Old Bear. And untill I am ready to leave I will play. But I will also continue to ask for improvements and consideration for the time sweat and tears I have put into this game. <br />
<br />
I might still give them money but with that money comes a responsibility to speak out on what I like and dislike. And even though they don't listen other newer gamers will and Maybe over time they can base thier own opinions upon some of the words I have laid down on this and other pages. <br />
<br />
Or the short version. <br />
<br />
Yeah SoE will get my 60 bucks. But they also have to listen to me bitch.<br />

Heheh  I didn't think you wre trying to bash me : )  is one thing I love about shamm boards we are all in this together and want whats best for the community.<br />
<br />
It kinda seems like SoE  is just tired of eq and is kind of nurfing and ignoring people away from the game on purpose.<br />
<br />
My best friend met a guy who was on the original design team for eq. The guy  told him they never expected the game ot be such a hit. He described it like this &quot; the game was meant to be a bridge over a creek. verant wanted to end it before it got out of hand and start a eq 2 that would better satisfy the very large community it had been attracting. Sony wanted to try to build a wooden bridge over the creek instead. he go's on to tell how every exspansion is just a building of a larger bridge whose foundation is still the creek and was never intended or designed to be what it is. <br />
<br />
Kind of made sense to me as to why there are so many bugs that still exsist today in the oringinal world.<br />
<br />
In a view out side of the circle, now it is coming to a close. But man they were some great years with some great times.<br />

If I want to keep playing EQ at the level I play on I have to buy this expansion. They've forced me to. I'll have to have my spells and levels to remain an asset on any raids I go on or groups I'm in. It's like being forced to buy the decrepit old cow because your beautiful, nubile and ravenous of legal age redheaded wife wants steak. Or something. <br />
<br />
If you really want to hit Sony where it counts just walk away. If OoW doesn't solve any problems within two months of release and if Sony continues blowing smoke to make it seem like they're doing anything I'm gone without looking back. I'm not going to WOW. I tried it, and it's too much like CoH to hold my attention for too long. It has a lot of strong points, but not enough for me to buy it and pay the costs thinking it's the next EQ killer. It's not. Nor is EQ2. Nor is any other game that's going to come out five years from now when we're still bitching about getting our spells fixed and Rytan and those who work with him continue to be incompetent.<br />

<br />
<br />
But thats the point mate, its a different game. The mentality is different cause of this and i guess im not able to relate to it in words how good it is, cause to be honest, i wasnt a believer till i played either. Beta testers told me how its different form EQ and it just didnt connect till i played to level 5 and did some quests for a while.<br />
<br />
As far as staying power and skill and grouping, your right, people will always be choosey about the groups, im just saying in EQ there is more to lose, like when you die you lose EXP in EQ, you only lose it i believe in WoW if you accept a healer rez in your home camp instead of running back to your body. Its not that skill doesnt come into it, but the need to be choosey cause you might miss a drop or a mob is less simply cause how the whole game works. Questing is leveling, you dont grind at all really, so the grouping action is completely different.<br />
<br />
As far as staying power, that will come down to depth of content and if you ask me WoW has that covered, the quest stories are very strong and remember, its not even out yet, so i see these stories getting deeper and deeper and dont forget that WoW had a lore system that predates EQ i think. The Lore goes all the way back to Warcraft 1, which im positive came before EQ, which isnt the point anyway, the point is, its got un tapped depths just waiting to be used.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But hey, maybe WoW isnt for you and maybe im just over exicted for my own reasons, but if you agree with me on nothing else Tug, then listen to this atleast. I think you owe it to yourself to try it with a open mind, with out the belief you will hate it when it hits shelves, i think you will if nothing else be suprised at what it can offer.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, i have taken that into account and while its age plays a role in the issue, i dont blame it fully, i blame the design of the game and how groups have to function in it and how the end game turned out. Im not trying to not knock EQ, i stand up for it all the time and remind people that with its flaws it was a inovative style of plaiyng at the time, but things have changed, the dream and ideas have grown and its now beyond the scope of EQ, atleast under its current ownership. I feel that WoW brings enough to the table to bring back that feeling you got when you leveled the first time in EQ, to a extent, but itll be more fun this time cause the grind is less the focus, its the journey through the game thats the focus.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow will be no different. As time goes on and the like minded people meet up they will form Cliques. And from there they will progress in a like manner. And in fact with the evolution of Online gaming  and established guilds I can bet it will progress faster than EQ ever did. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree, i think WoW will be different and while i agree that as time goes on, people will create cliques, i want to stress that the design of the game eases the need for them.  Blizzard is atleast opening the door for us to walk through, but its up to us to change how we act. Kinda like how i changed playing when LDoN came out and learned to group with random people again. Its like that x10.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Omens looks pretty good as far as i can see. No its not the ground breaking expansion we all hoped it would be, that solved so many balance issues and content progression issues, but for the people that still love EQ i think itll be alright and i certainly hope you personaly enjoy it and i would have bought it if my  billing wasnt ending soon or maybe if i just hadnt got into the WoW beta and solidified my resolve on leaving EQ.<br />
<br />
I know im ocming off as bashing EQ, but im trying not to, but i am defeinetly distancing myself with my posts, cause if i dont, i know ill get sucked back in, i know everyone here can relate to that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, like i told Tug, if you do nothing else, try WoW, i think you will be suprised how solid of a game they have made and beyond that, how solid of a game plan they have for its progression. Its built to last, its got plenty of stamina. That doesnt mean it will, but it had a real shot and i cant think of anyone better to play and talk with about WoW then the people like you from this forum.<br />

<br />
NDA was lifted on Star Wars Galaxies - and all the beta testers came out and basically said 'Do not buy this game, it is not ready.' And the response from non-beta testers was that of pure hostility against the beta testers, calling them liars and accusing them of wanting to reduce competition for the limited 2000 player slots on favored servers.<br />
<br />
Then, when they were able to play the game, the non-beta testers blamed the beta testers for not ensuring a well developed game.<br />
<br />
So, I will say this..<br />
<br />
I've played a little in the OoW Beta and I've seen the final spell lists - including the exact or near exact copies of spells (I'm assuming that they're just making GoD and LDoN spells easier to get). Give everyone their warning and ignore the 'liars and well that means more room for me in the game' posts, and laugh like crazy when they start whining in a month's time.<br />
<br />
Its the only way some people learn.<br />

I have been around since beta 4 Of EQ. And other than a small break at the beginning of this year played pretty much every day for the last 5 years (Or at least logged on)<br />
<br />
EQ when it started was group making heaven. It didnt matter the class. It almost didnt matter the level or the gear.<br />
<br />
All that mattered at the time was there is a person who might hlep keep me alive. As people huddled around some landmark that started to get called something repeatedly.<br />
<br />
I remember The house. I remember T2. I remember The hill. I remember all the little camp names we came up with. <br />
<br />
The camping came about because people were too scared to go new places. And because at the end of the day people will travel the path that is easiest for them.<br />
<br />
Wow will be no different. As time goes on and the like minded people meet up they will form Cliques. And from there they will progress in a like manner. And in fact with the evolution of Online gaming  and established guilds I can bet it will progress faster than EQ ever did. <br />
<br />
The genie is out the bottle and will never be recaptured again. We might have a game that will help us relive some of those fun times, but in the end it is never as good as the first time. <br />
<br />
WoW could be the best thing since sliced bread. (And from what I have seen it is damn good. But. It is not my first time. And while it might be a superiour game in every single aspect, It will never have the wonder of that trek I took the last night of EQ beta. When I took a human thief from Qeynos to the inside of Oggok. With no maps. And at the time no Movable invis. <br />
<br />
Omens is not going to change EQ. It will however add sometihng to the game. A Little headroom for the non raiding player that is me. Is it going to be great? No. It won't Then developers that work on EQ are a bunch of marginal players in a game that is going n 6 years old built on tech that is what 10 years old? They have neither the skills or the creativity to make the game great again. That is shown by all of thier past offerings. Good ideas. Poorly and shortsightedly implimented. <br />
<br />
But they will get my money for Omens for one simple reason. I want to die in these new lands. And get even the slightest bit of fun I can while walking the world in the skin of a shaman I have played for 5 years. I might hate SoE for what they have done to the game and for the lack of care. But I still love the Old Bear. And untill I am ready to leave I will play. But I will also continue to ask for improvements and consideration for the time sweat and tears I have put into this game. <br />
<br />
I might still give them money but with that money comes a responsibility to speak out on what I like and dislike. And even though they don't listen other newer gamers will and Maybe over time they can base thier own opinions upon some of the words I have laid down on this and other pages. <br />
<br />
Or the short version. <br />
<br />
Yeah SoE will get my 60 bucks. But they also have to listen to me bitch.<br />

This really sums it up for me, in fact, it sums up my view of all games like this. The games are solved. There isnt EVER going to be another game that will make my hair stand up and the back of my neck prickle like EQ did in those early days. I remember being truly SCARED to go in the House. Nothing can do that to me again. <br />
<br />
Now we have . . . this. I like it, don't get me wrong. But its not like it was, and nothing will EVER be like that again. <br />

EQ is solved.<br />

WoW will be solved a month before it ships. <br />

Play whats fun. When it stops being fun, stop playing. If it looks fun again, start playing again. If not, don't. If something else looks fun, play that. Isn't that what gaming is all about?</div></div><hr />

The players in WoW now are all beta players.  These are not just members of the public, but players with experience from playing other multiplayer online games.<br />
<br />
Sure, WoW would be how EQ is like when it first started... the comradship (because everyone is new and grouping means better survivalbility, etc) is there now.  Give it a couple of years, AFTER it has gone LIVE, you will see it change.  When 10 yr olds are playing WoW and begging you for coins, gear, help, and PL, and the ebay guys in your group start to show up, Yantis-type-business-models, etc... tell us how the experience really is.  <br />

Honestly i think this is the nail on the head.<br />
<br />
Some where along the lines we simply said &quot; we want to main heal&quot; when infact we were never really a main healer class or a high DPS class. We are getitng frustrated and upset cause SoE wont change us to what we feel we should be and SoE is sick of hearing it form us cause as far as they are concerned we are just that, a support class and in their eyes we are fine for that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems like a unsolvable issue to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Some where along the lines we simply said &quot; we want to main heal&quot; when infact we were never really a main healer class or a high DPS class.

This is inaccurate Litgruv, its more like &quot;somewhere along the line, SOE decided to make Druids much better healers, Necros much bettter DOTTers, and lower the effectivenes of slow and the usefulness of 7/8th of Shaman buffs with insane gear mudflation&quot;. <br />
<br />
I dont think people are upset because SOE won't change us, I think they are upsept because the GAME changed, and SOE changed OTHER classes to be more suitable, but DIDNT change us. Thats the nail, hammer, head IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Exactly. A class we were close to, the druid, was moved into the main healer type role and we didnt. We all kinda went .. ***. The question is, just cause a class got boosted, doest it really mean we should have our role defined too, in SoE's eyes im talking now. I think thats the whole issue im saying, its not that SoE is neglecting us, its that they have decided we will remain in the support class and not come up to par with the new druid boost.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to admit, with this last expansion the buffs have been tuned a lil better then the past. So again, its not that we are being ignored, its that they are ignoring what we want to be.<br />
<br />
I know its crayz, but maybe SoE does have a &quot;vision&quot; for the shaman. It might be a suck job vision, but one none the less. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I'm forced to agree with Blazz. We're fine as a support class, but our relative power has been left in the dust. The game has changed around us by a lot, and we've been nudged up in marginal increments while other classes have been tuned to the current level of content. I'm sure we all know and understand that we're a support class - we're just wanting to be brought up to being able to do it more efficiently. <br />
<br />
We want to be increased to the same class/environment balance as everyone else. The real problem is that everyone seems to be concerned about being balanced in relation to other classes and those classes abilities, rather than the real concern which is to be balanced against the game itself. The real problem seems to be that Sony is either clueless as to what they want us to be capable of or are afraid of upping our power, 'lest we go solo Vindicator or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A game merely has to be FUN to have staying power. While everyone's definition of FUN may be different, simply saying &quot;a game has to be difficult to be enjoyable&quot; is absolute hogwash.<br />
<br />
If you find the exp grind and ridiculous time commitment EQ requires to advance to be FUN (let's not even get into the &quot;second hand citizenry&quot;, the &quot;have's vs. have nots&quot; and the utter dependance on gear only obtainable via raiding to be effective or accepted), knock yourself out. I don't, nor do 400,000+ others (figure based on the number of people who submitted JUST TO BETA TEST), and that number will probably grow considerably by the time WoW releases.<br />

I am not that sure of myself, sure I wouldn't give SoE good credits either, but I know how I was thinking last year when I saw the first screens how cartoonish it was, and before I played it I was very sceptic about a lot of things actually.<br />

<br />
If there isn't a &quot;goal&quot; to be achieved, or once it has been achieved and there are no new goals, most people would play for a while and then move on to newer games. In order for a game like EQ to be successfull in the long run there has to be constant creation of new goals for people to achieve, or they will slowly loose their player base and eventually the game will die. EQ isnt successful because it has the best graphics or the best game mechanics, it is successfull because it has tons of content and that content is constantly being expanded. It is the classic &quot;microsoft versus apple&quot; scenario. That is why they cant spend a lot of time &quot;balancing&quot; as many think they should. If they did that, and spent a year doing so, they would balance the game to empty servers.</div></div><hr />

Nintendo knows this.  Hell, even Blizzard knows this.  How many people still play Diablo?  Certainly it's not for the challenge, it is a bigger grind than EQ.  I played through all three levels with one character and several levels with many others.  Talk about mindless, but hell, it was a lot of fun. :)<br />
<br />
But as you said yourself, fun is defined many ways.  Yes, the level and aa grind is not always fun, unless you decide that the fun is in playing, with the spells and equipment that you have in the zones available to you.  The goals of getting better spells and equipment and access to more zones is a motivation to keep playing.  But if you don't have those things, the game can still be fun and enjoyable.  However, if you are not having fun doing what you are doing right now, then playing hoping that it will get better with the next level, aa, zone, expansion, etc. is silly.  I play because I have in game friends that I have fun playing with.  No grinding, no powerleveling, just casual play.  Sometimes we challenge ourselves, sometimes we are not in the mood and just go farming, but typically we have a good time.<br />
<br />
It's a game.  Play if you enjoy it, don't play if you don' enjoy it, simple.  You are paying to play, so you have the power to chose.  If a better game comes along, I might just play it.  Unfortunately, I have not found one yet, and I enjoy what I'm doing now.  This hobby is still worth my $12.95 a month.  But the day it is not, I'll quit.  It will be my choice.<br />
<br />
And please, enough about WoW, the EQ killer.  It is beta, it has not been released, there isn't even a release date yet.  It's like comparing your girlfriend to the new girl who just moved in next door.  At least wait until she puts out before you dump your girlfriend for her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Groups dont form in WoW like that, wether there is a lot of people or a lil has no bearing on the game what so ever. I mean you CAN LFG and put one together with friends or guild or specific classes, but its not need as it is in EQ. In my experiences with WoW, you go off and start a quest, you head tot he quest area to gain what your looking for and its THEN that the groups are made. Not because they have to be made, but cause people are willing to have you help. There is NOTHING for them to loose. In EQ when your on a quest, you sit at a camp for hours waiting for a drop for your quest and if someone else comes its either too bad for them or too bad for you if you AFK a sec ause they will KS you. In WoW when your on a quest and you find a camp already has people there, it doesnt matter. When you join a group you have the option of sharing that quest with the other members of the group, so like if you need to kill 10 mobs lets say, as you kill them, they get the kill too, the quest is shared equaly and there is no reason keep someone out of the group and only a benifiet to allow them in cause the kills/drops will come faster with more people.<br />
<br />
So basically this means that using the max number of people is optimal in any situation? will a group of 8 do a quest about 8x faster than solo?</div></div><hr />

Personally, I can't disagree with you, I haven't seen WoW yet (I signed up for BETA, but those rat bastages .. ;)).  That said, please note that EQ was pioneering back in the origional release and Kunark days.  It broke lots of barriers and many of use were prepared to cut VI (at the time) loads of slack because they were pioneering.  Hell, took me 3 hours just to find the way out of SFG with my freaking ranger (got lost in the damned bear caves, shoulda gone back and AEed them all with my shaman ;)).  Anyway, Blizzard isn't pioneering.  They take existing features and make improvements and can start from scratch on new engines and code.  Not only that, but they need to prove themselves to cynical MMORPG fans who have gone through a litany of come lately products.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to have constant goals to achieve to remain interested.  I think both sides are on the right track, but fun to me should be re-worded to &quot;interest&quot;.  And like I said, goals = interest.  So they actually kinda go hand-in-hand.<br />
<br />
And if SOE keeps laying out goals for us in EQ, then people stay interested.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Lathyrnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Well, I've not played EQ since around Febuary, haven't played it seriously since well before that, but I kinda stumbled in here for some reason. /shrug  Here's my thoughts on WoW.  I was in the ST; played a Night Elf Hunter, got to level 12.  I could have gone much farther than that; I have the time, I'm in college now.  I didn't though.  Why?  Cause WoW is frigging boring as hell.  Quests?  Identical to EQ's old stuff.  Combat?  Much more boring than soloing a Shaman; yay for auto-attack / clicking special attacks. :rolleyes: For some reason the world / graphics are a bit boring as well; the character models are horrendous.  It's just missing something that EQ has / had.  I couldn't tell you what that thing is though. /shrug</div></div><hr />
