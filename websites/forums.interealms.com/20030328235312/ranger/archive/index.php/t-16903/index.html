<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just received an ahbs and now have my ideal weapon setup ahbs/renderer , using cof at the moment for haste.<br />
I have all archery AA, all HP AA, and offensive i only have crit1.<br />
Now i was going to finish innate camo and snare first for ulitlity items, but now i have new weapons thinking of just going straight max dps.<br />
Ferocity<br />
Ambidex<br />
Luclin crits<br />
PoP Crits<br />
Spell crits<br />
Doggie skill<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure ferocity should be first, but not sure next maybe max crits as effects melee and archery, would like to fit in innate camo and snare at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drunia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That list sounds fine. Just figure out if you are going for increased DPS general/melee/archery or better tanking ability. The HP and regen AAs are very nice to, for rather obvious reasons *cough* AEs *cough*. If you want to round out your with a some nice AAs check Celt's reccomendations at the top in the sticky, it doesn't get much better then that. I followed his outline faithfully and couldn't be happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pick up innate camo next :P  It's so darn good if you do a lot of travelling or pulling outdoors, or if you have to zone from someone elses s%$%storm train, or if you need to afk for 20 minutes, or if you need to invis to move on a raid, or if you need to pull with sneak, or if or if or if or if .....<br />
<br />
Entrap is super nice too if you have both pop nukes and pull a lot, I normally run earthen roots, Jolt/cinderjolt/flamelick/weeds (depending on role), harmony of nature/calefaction(pulling, harmony, other times, calef always), brushfire, chloroblast, frozen wind, eagle eye, buffx(usually soe).  Freeing up that calefaction slot helps tons for convenience and dps sake if you end up meleeing.  Also, never having to worry about de-memming ensnare is priceless :P<br />
<br />
Both are cheap really, the sooner you have the conveniences the happier you will be with your rounded toon :)<br />
<br />
Your outline looks great, but looking at your overall tree I'd say it's high time you got at LEAST innate camo out of the way next, I use that skill a lot more than I thought I would :)<br />
<br />
As for DPS increases, I'd look into doing combat fury3/fury of the ages 3 first on the simple theory that it affects both types of your dps, all the time..both bow and melee.  After that ferocity &gt;ambidexterity, but both shine so don't skip either.  Maybe toss the first level of Guardians of the forest in between ferocity and ambidex for a bit of short term gratification before saving for the second big 9 in ambidex :) (max ferocity is 9 as well hehe, do it before ambi!)  GOTF is really a nice output boost even at the first level, the most bang for your buck so to speak with the big 100 atk at the first 3.  You can finish it afterwards :)<br />
<br />
For the lifetappers, the supporting aa around the AHB/VRS combo really do shine quite a bit, but grab the aforementioned meat and potatoes before you start worrying about them.  The impact of spell fury3/healing adept/healing gift/aha/ahg is noticeable granted, but the dps gains/utility of the aforementioned aa's far outweigh the benefits of the lifetap-sword aa quintet tm hehe.  When you do finally get to that point, max spell fury first, then luclin gift, luclin adept, pop adept, and finish with pop gift :)  When it's all said and done, every tap heals for 119 guaranteed off AHB, and its possible to turn over 476 heals :)  A LARGE portion of the procs will heal for 238, as fury and gift proc independantly of one another, and heal the same amount.  Overall its powerful aa indeed :)</div></div><hr />
