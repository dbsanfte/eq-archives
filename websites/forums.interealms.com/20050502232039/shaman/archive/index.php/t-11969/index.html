<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok been talking to several people about this and everyone says something different -- cruicible channel peeps say one thing, guides say another and people in-game say yet another.<br />
<br />
What I am trying to do is:<br />
<br />
Getting Rodahn xferred to a new account (same server) set up just last night.  My questions are -- 1) Rod's account (my main one) has all expansions enabled, but new one does not have LoY, will that be a problem?  2) I'm not sure if new account is in 30 day trial period (since I used same account info as my main account that has existed for 3 years), and if it is, does my main account supercede that?<br />
<br />
Like I said, been getting mixed info and was wondering if anyone who has done it before out there could help shed some more light :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ive looked into this also at times. The faq section at everquest.com says destination account has to have same expansions enabled as the account being transfered from. Also believe just need to have same billing info on both accounts to be able to transfer also.<br />
<br />
<br />
found it ..this from the everquest sight <br />
<br />
For moving Characters from one account to a different account on the same server, Characters will be moved with items and coins. In order to process a transfer from one account to a different account, the destination account must have access to the same expansions as the source account.<br />
<br />
 When moving characters between accounts, billing information must be identical on both accounts and you must be the original owner of both accounts. You may use the credit card on file or submit a different credit card using the Billing Information fields. If the credit card holder is different from the holder of the card on file, please enter a short explanation in the bottom field. If you have only paid for your account with a Game Card, you must submit a credit card using the Billing Information fields.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are sorry, but we cannot process character moves while you are still in the free 30 day trial period.<br />
<br />
  Would assume that means both accounts but doesnt really say. Anyone know for sure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you registered the 2nd account, it automatically got a 30 day free period as all new accounts. You will need to wait until that is over before you can transfer your character.  I moved my shaman from my main account to a new one 8 or so months ago and had to wait for the trial period to end.<br />
As the above poster mentioned, you DO need to have the exact same expansions and billing info on both accounts (and said billing needs to be the original billing info on the account).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah ok, just activated LoY on new account a few mins ago, but new account still in 30 day trial /sigh :(<br />
<br />
Ah well, will plvl my monk mule on new account till then hehe, thanks for info all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you go ahead and start paying on the 2nd account (I.E. give them your creditcard #), they will move you immediately, takes a few days.</div></div><hr />
