<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mongol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have some cash saved up and my friend is telling me to get these Flowing Slime Boots that have FT3.  Being a relative novice to focus effects, how much of a difference will these make?  If I solo quite a bit, will I see a noticable improvement? I mean sitting down with KEI is giving me like 15 or 16 per tick, this is only gonna add 3...<br />
<br />
Just would like some opinions.  Oh, I'm 54.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally ... I sold the pair I won. <br />
<br />
I used some of the money (like, 20%) to increase my base hit points by almost 200 HP with a few gear upgrades and also got my unbuffed AC over 1000 not to mention my unbuffed HP is now over 2000.<br />
<br />
The rest of the money I am going to use for similar upgrades.  3 mana per tick is nice, but, I can now use Cann. 4 once more than I could before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep saving and buy torpor.  :p  30 mana per minute, or something with better ac/hp/sta/wis/mana in it's place and a 6:1 heal spell?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">who needs flowing thought when you can chew on your arm? leave the ft to clerics so they can heal you more!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree kiteless.  How can a pair of toe jam encrusted boots compare to raw flesh, especially when accompanied with lemons and strong drink?  yumm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Had sombody ask me why I would want Vindi boots the other day instead of ft3 boots.<br />
<br />
I basically replied why would I give up hp and ac for ft3 when I have Can and Torpor?<br />
<br />
Since your only 54 you might some use out of them, but they are only a short term investment for you.</div></div><hr />
