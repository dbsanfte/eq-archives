<br>
Here is the info on how to make the self teleport potion to Thurgadin! In total took me 1 hour to get skill up in pottery to 125 and 2 hours to get ingredients in CC for about 6 of them. There are 3 things you need to do: 1 get your skill up in pottery, 2 get the ingredients from CC and 3 get the container to combine them in from Frundle Frenkler in town.<br>
<br>
1) To start you need to get your skill in pottery up to 120 or 125. To do this is easy and will cost less then 100pp and takes a hour or so. Go to any skill site and find the easy way to do it.<br>
<br>
2) Now you need to collect your ingedients. Go to CC. everything you need is there. hunt the miners up top for the small pieces and small bricks of velium. then drop (make sure you have lev!) down to the bottom, run through the dorf town, and into the hall with the velium crawlers, spiderlings, and webmasters.  in about an hour, i had a stack of these and gated out. <br>
<br>
head back to thurgadin. go in the bank. the vendor on the very left sells crystal shards and HQ firing sheets. buy 2 crystal shards and 1 HQ firing sheet. <br>
<br>
go click on the pottery wheel in the bank. put the items in like this: <br>
<br>
crystalline silk <br>
crystalline silk <br>
crystalline silk <br>
glass shard <br>
glass shard <br>
small brick of velium <br>
<br>
do not stack the silks. also, even though all other pottery i've done always requires a water flask, do not use one. i tried and it didn't combine. so NO WATER FLASK! i'm around 100 in pottery and it was not trivial. <br>
<br>
you will get an unfired velious vial. <br>
<br>
right next to the pottery wheel is the kiln. combine the vial you just made with a high quality firing sheet. this will produce a velious vial. it was trivial at 100. <br>
<br>
<br>
3)Find Frundle Frenkler to get container. She is by the Pally guild in a building.<br>
<br>
Hail her and say:<br>
<br>
You say, "what velium vapors?" <br>
Frundle Frenkler says "Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret." <br>
<br>
You say, "what velium vial?" <br>
Frundle Frenkler says "I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet." <br>
<br>
<br>
she will give you a 4 slot purifier. it is a container, so you will need an open inventory slot. <br>
<br>
<br>
now, open that purifier box that you got and put in the vial, and 2 small pieces of velium. make sure they are not stacked. <br>
<br>
small piece of velium <br>
small piece of velium <br>
velious vial <br>
<br>
hit combine and you will have a vial of velium vapors. <br>
<br>
VIAL OF VELIUM VAPORS <br>
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP <br>
EXPENDABLE CHARGES:1 <br>
Effect: Thurgadin Gate <br>
All/all<br>
<br>
Gates you to the Bridge over the pit in Thurgadin<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Btw they are No Drop and Lore so you can only have one at a time .....but you can keep the materials in the bank and make another in about 5 min since you are in Thurgadin already. This is like having dual bind points for melee classes.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>But too bad I'm kos in Thurgadin.   Would be nice if they had a Kael gate potion.  Being able to gate to both Lesser Faydark and Velious would be awesome!</p>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Ticked_Off.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Not to rain on your parade, but...</b></p>

<p>First, let me say that it's <strong>wonderful</strong> that trade skills can actually produce something useful.  However, I am just a tad bit concerned.<br>
<br>
See, from my limitted understanding, SoW potions and Gate potions are about the only thing worth making in Alchemy (I just made level 26, so I haven't started yet, what's the point in getting my skill to only 10 -- I can train to that still...).  Though, I don't think there's been a Velious Gate potion made yet...<br>
<br>
With this trend, sooner or later, nobody will want anything alchemically made, since they can make it themselves.  *shrug*  Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I see it somewhat like putting Snare and Invis on Warrior armour...<br>
<br>
/em looks thoughtful.<br>
<br>
Though, mayhap they'll upgrade Alchemy too...?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Kridgerkanthar the cazic drop has been admitted by VI to be a bug. Cazic is supposed to drop the cazic gate potion, but the loot tables got mangled.<br>
<br>
For those that dont know this potion is a required component for the shawl quest in thurgaden.<br>
<br>
Oh and another thing, please dont tote it as "Rangers can Gate". <br>
1. It promotes class envy, <br>
2. It's incorrect as any class can use this<br>
3. If people start flaunting this all over the boards it will be nerfed next patch. Especially with point 1. <br>
<br>
Possible nerfs will be in either the price of the components, the skill level required, or they will just replace the item in the quest <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Hmm very nice - i'm glad i held onto that crystaline silk I collected.<br>
<br>
I am guessing the fired vial(not the final potion) is treated like a container and is not stackable?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

1.) No class envy here except maybe for shamans. it is made via a trade skill. <br>
<br>
2. all classes can use.<br>
<br>
3. they should not nerf it ..it requires good faction with the coldain and makes you learn a trade skill. If they nerf this then they might as well nerf fletching , we are the masters of bows, Why can anyone else fletch then.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>More info:<br>
<br>
- The velium vials (fired and unfired) are NOT lore, so you can do like me and keep a bag of them in the bank waiting to be combined with the velium pieces for the last step <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
- Everything except the initial components (silk, etc.) is NO DROP.<br>
<br>
- It was trivial for me at 125.<br>
<br>
- When you're working up your skill with bowls or whatever, don't bother to fire them in the kiln.  Just destroy the unfired bowls - it costs less than buying the firing sheets.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>It's very easy and cheep to get your skill up to 122.  I did this, and with a wisdom of 96, I failed 3 times (twice on the 1st step and once on the 2nd step).  I then spent about 200 plat getting my skill up to 148.  I was then successful on my 1st attempt at both steps.  I don't know if my experience is typical of not.  I just wanted to let you know.<br>

<p>Just a guess here, but I think it would be nerfed.<br>
<br>
It was intended as a quest item and someone tagged it as ALL ALL , so players can use it.<br>
<br>
I can't see VI intentionally putting this item in for players to use. It takes very very little effort to get one<br>
<br>
(Don't get me wrong, I want to believe it will stay, I said my prayers to Tunare to let it stay, but.... I am having a hard time believing it will)<br>
<br>
I read the post yesterday at 1pm  (Rytain ... Your Da Man .... )<br>
Logged on at 2pm with pottery at 0<br>
By 4pm pottery was 120 and I was able to make this.<br>
<br>
The items to make it are easy as hell to get<br>
13 silks and 5 small pieces - bought from a player for 20pp<br>
7 small bricks - Vendors in thurg (12pp each)<br>
Glass / sheet in the bank<br>
<br>
I didn't even have to hunt for the stuff...<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>They shouldn't nerf it.  It's nice that a trade skill is usable.  It's still anoying to collect all the components for it.  I had enough materials for 4 tries at 139 skill, ended up with 2 fired velium vials.  Of course, I got all my components from Velkor's, and I've heard they're more common drops in CC.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
