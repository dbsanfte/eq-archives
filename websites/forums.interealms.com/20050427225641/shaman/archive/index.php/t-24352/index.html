I don't know about you guys, but I am pumped up. Raiding was the best design element of Everquest. Period. Without a shadow of a doubt. Raiding brings together the powergamer aspect of all MMORPG's, and then pits it against brutal strategy, reflexes, intelligence and awareness.<br />
<br />
However I use the word &quot;design&quot; element intentionally. Everquest had the right concept when introducing raiding content, but the execution was terrible.<br />
<br />
Now, the WoW team realizes the difference between hard-linked (hard stop gap) raid content, soft-linked (natural stop gap) raid content, and non-linked raid content (read the article to understand). Furthermore the WoW engine and server comes prepared to handle instanced zones and dungeons, and the team understands fully well how it's important to have a good balance of instanced zones as well as zones that demand competition. I LOVE to see the team instantly understanding that lower level and hard-linked content needs to be instanced, while natural-linked is better for non-instanced.<br />
<br />
I can't wait.<br />
<br />
<br />
You will now be able to set a threshold for loot. Let's say I set it to blue items. Everything else is going to go round robin or free for all like normal, depending on how you have it set. When a blue item appears, everybody gets a roll or pass option. You have to click it right away, and if you roll and win, you get the item. There is also a master looter version, where the raid leader gets to assign blue items or higher. We think most groups will set a threshold of green or blue and use normal loot options for the rest of the loot. We think this will make looting more fair in raids, since the loot there will be so much better. <br />

Brilliant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was in a group the other night, and the paladin rolled on every dam item even though he already won some stuff. <br />
<br />
He managed to get a hunter only bow, wich was sad becasue myself and another guy were hunters , and he won several peices of leather armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll state those rules up front, and the first infraction gets them ousted. No if's, and's, or but's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">that's poor leadership, not bad loot rules =P</div></div><hr />

Exactly, greedy people will have to choose between rolling on everything or keeping friends...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slythor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe, he was the leader.<br />
<br />
after we all completed the quest, we broke up because most of us didnt want to group with him anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's easy to kick the leader. Remind everyone in the party he's a jackass, announce you are leaving to reform the group, and invite everyone but him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Drops are so stupidly common in WoW that anyone that hogs items that someone else in the party could use are just unreal.<br />
<br />
I'm not really fussed about raiding, I dont really want to see WoW turn into another EQ, I like the differences.<br />
<br />
PvP is where its at anyway :) (oh and as info I'm finding shaman to be brilliant for it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im excited about WoW PvP as well. It's gonna be something I Never really got into in EQ. I did some of that while the ST lasted and I had a blast. Although I didn't play on the PvP server, I did swim across the sea (since there was an exploit) to the alliance land and enjoyed some fun PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm glad to see they're working on raiding. In EQ after hitting 65. Raids, hunting with friends, and the guild were where I got most of my enjoyment in EQ. Cooperating with vast numbers of people to reach an objective is one of the things mmorpgs offer that regular games don't. A lot of people were worried about the endgame, this article adresses a lot of concerns. Having instances and a maximum raid limit of 40 from the get go should help keep things fun and challenging.</div></div><hr />
