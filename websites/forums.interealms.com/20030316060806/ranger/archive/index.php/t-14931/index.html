<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>manlaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to know at what lvl i can get thw swiftwind?....cause i saw some dude with it at lvl 49 :( well thx in advance! /wave<br />
<br />
btw...i have another question...the epic quest is imposible to do without a guild right? i cant do it myself....? =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Legenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I guess was wrong in my assessment that this question surfaces once every two weeks... It's more like twice a week it seems...<br />
<br />
I have personally started epic questing at level 46 and completed it at either 47 or 48 (don't remember exactly). This was a few months ago.<br />
<br />
If you have a large group of friends of appropriate level, it might be doable without a guild, but in general expect to need a guild support for at least the Air part, VSR and possibly Hole and Reavers. Most of that can also be done by 1 group of 60+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Guildmate COULD NOT do the quest until 49, T Darkforest wouldn't talk to him at 48, even though faction was good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I completed all but the PoA piece by 46, Telin didn't have any problems with me.  This was about a year ago though, so your mileage may vary.  But I do personally know Rangers that have gotten epics prior to 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I have no idea anymore lol.. I've read all these posts saying you could and couldn't do swifty before this or that level.<br />
<br />
All I can say is I started my epic at level 46.  I had swifty in my hand at level 49, that was in October when I finished it.  Even posted on the glade when it was done.  I'm not calling anyone a liar, just don't know what the difference was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They changed it a while back to make it so he won't even talk to you until you are 47(personal experience here) and I'm not sure...but I believe you can't do the final turn in for swifty until 51.  If you see people with swiftwind that are lower than 51, they either de-leveled or did it before they put the level restrictions in...or I am wrong.  Personally, I wouldn't take the chance of turning it in until I was 51.</div></div><hr />
