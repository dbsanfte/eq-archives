Since it is the designated newbie server, you still find genuine newbies on occassion and, assuming you know where to go, it is usually not too difficult to find groups.</div></div><hr />

As far as it goes, get to 65 on either the wiz or shaman first, or go red and do that sort of thing, otherwise, your just wasting your time that you could use leveling your main. Even your shaman is a waste if your not trying to level to 65 or complete some goal. If you dont like progression at all though, and like having access to the same zones, make a new toon.</div></div><hr />

Fennin Ro is the server of drama.  There is NOTHING but attitude here and finding nice, decent people is kind of hard, these days.  Everyone here is as competitive as they come.  I hate this server...</div></div><hr />

Your text signature says your wizard is in his early 50's, but the graphic portion of the sig says you are 65.  Which is it? :confused: <br />
<br />
Your level 13 shaman being rerolled on another server would only cost you a few days (even starting from scratch) of concerted effort to get back into shape.  Tunare was a great server when I was on it (I left to join friends on E. Marr).  You have EQtraders Denmother Niami among the population.  :D  Established, mature economy, &amp; plenty of good guilds to choose from.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a number of IRL friends on another server, I recommend you stay right where you are.  Play on Test server when Tunare is down. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Karana is an interesting server. I don't know as though I'd actually tell anybody to come to it ... there are a LOT of morons (ranging from the stupidity of the &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ur&quot; and &quot;r&quot; crowd to the real, genuine, IRL morons), and a rather large population of genuine noobs (most of whom are actually decent people just beginning the game) and a rather pathetic excuse for a zone rotation organization. On the good side, there's also an incredibly solid open raiding effort on POP mobs, a (relatively) stable economy, and a good handful of pretty nice guilds.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the whole open raiding factor would be something i would look at before joining a server.. i know seventh didnt have such a thing.. well, atleast no constant open raids.. maybe the behemoth or storms flags occasionally were open</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I actually like Maelin for my blue toons.  But that is only once every blue moon or so.  I like PvP so i stick to TZ.  Im not too hard core tho, so i stay away from SZ.  Those guys are insane bout pvp.  Really i think every server you are gonna find a lot of stuff you like/dont like.  If you are thinking of a change to pvp, i would suggest TZ but thats just a bias.  Its almost 99pct xteam now, but if you want to play by the team rules, the darks are the only team on the server that stick to it.  The lights consider any light race, no matter the team, as a light.  But the darks have a few guilds that stick to all dark members only.  They are losing members pretty quik tho, gonna be maybe a few more months before the whole server gives up on the team concept i think.  Lots of zek talk there but if you move to a zek you will pick up on the rules of pvp very quikly.  So long story short, any blue is the same, and im biased twards TZ as my favorite zek to play on.<br />

*EDIT* Few spelling things i found without spell check at 7am after not sleeping all night.  Might have missed others but fixed the ones i saw hehe, i read the &quot;cardinal rule of posting&quot; above :)</div></div><hr />

I don't think a rational thinking person would have a problem with any of those abreviations. Mispelled words don't bother me either, it just that punk slang that irriatates the hell out of me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It might sound odd to you, but I view the use of lame abbreviations as a lack of respect; phrases like &quot;can u buff me,&quot; &quot;where r u,&quot; or &quot;can ne1 sow me.&quot;  In-game lingo like lol and other EQ-isms don't really bother me, but if you want something, I feel you should be polite and actually type out your requests.  The number of keystrokes saved is minimal at best.<br />
<br />
As to the original question of this thread, the grass is rarely greener.  There is no utopian server.  The main differences tend to be bazaar prices (older servers have lower prices of old items, but higher prices on high-end items and spells due to too much pp in the economy....newer servers tend to have higher prices on tradeskill items since there are fewer master crafters) and population, with some more subtle factors being the dominant timezone, the number of alts, and level of twinking.<br />
<br />
If your main reason for wanting to leave is server stability, I would document outages (both on your own notes and /feedback when the server is back up), encourage others to do the same, and email SoE support (after every few times keep pushing it up to higher level supervisors).  At the very least, it the stability issue is really bad, you might get a free character transfer out of it.  If it's a very serious problem they've been ignoring, enough noise from the player base could bring in entirely new hardware for your server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">IRL im a real polite person, and i use lingo in the game.<br />
 <br />
and to the server thing no im not leaving completely just joining a new server with alt when im bored and server is down. That new server will be my bored-server-is-down server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Prexus used to have a problem with crashing all the time, even had a few roll backs. Characters that were once deleted came back fully dressed. Some people made a lot of money from that. Anyway, they finally replaced the hard drive, (I think Sont uses an Array HD), and we havn't had a problem since.<br />
<br />
It's a FCFS server but many people redefign that as FFA. The bazaar is packed full. The prices have been pretty high for a while now but reciently they have been dropping and you can find some good deals.  A fungi sells for 70k-90k, bio orb 14k-25k. We also have a guild that back flags anyone who wants to join.<br />
<br />
Prexus is probably as good a server as any but if I were you, I'd probably make a character on test.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">No offense, but your age dosnt supprise me. I am sure that a few people at an older age than 15 type like that, but for the most part, im sure the people that use u, r, ur etc, are all around your age. I know a lot of people your age that take the time to type out what they mean. The reason they do that is, it shows some respect to the people they are speaking with, and it shows that they are not totally lazy. I can see a bard in game using u, ur, r etc because they have to twist songs, but I would not expect them to use those on a message board. In game, if your really busy and need to reply to something quickly, its understandable that you might type like that. Outside of those situations, it makes you look like a total dumb ass, and a lazy bastard to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hmm I don't really see it as that major, I actually see the main cause of more people using u or r etc is because of mobiles, and having to write shorthand to fit in more stuff. So, I wouldn't see it as offensive or disrespectful really.</div></div><hr />

I know most are not, but I have seen more then my fair share of assling druids using u r ur. They also had no skill at the game and basically made asses of themselves where ever they went. I know not all are, but every time I see words spelled like that I think of them. I also think of all the level 20 people in PoK that HAVE to beg for buffs when I run through, causing me to put myself on roleplay, which I hate to do, because im proud of my level class and race, and dont like having to hide it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I doubt you want to play on Karana.  I played on that server for years, and I finally move logged to Morden Rasp with Night Eternal back when the server allowed transfers.  Karana has a bunch of nice people if you know where to look.  If you are looking for progression through EP and Time, well, there are a lot of guillds to choose from - just that EPs and Time will be crowded.   Also, there was ( I do not know if there still is ) a lot of drama on Karana.<br />
<br />
MR is nice if you are looking to start over.  It becomes a pain if you are a high lvl character - finding groups are a pain if you cannot find a guild group or group with friends.  But, they do have a strong newbie place - seems that a lot of people started fresh on the server.  Bazaar prices are high, so I would move with cash, lots of cash.  :P</div></div><hr />
