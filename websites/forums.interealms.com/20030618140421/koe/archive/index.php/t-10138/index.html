<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you are there and you happen across the Library, if its not too much trouble there is a wondefull spell called Refresh Summoning located upstairs (up the ladder) at the Magician NPC's that would make it much easier to keep mage pet's alive in heavy combat.<br />
<br />
I of course would cover your expenses etc.  Please let me know if you come across it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoP spells are all no drop..sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe he is referring to the Magician pet heal spell that is purchased from the Magician spell merchant in the PoK library.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes and are not all spells bought in PoK no drop? All mine are...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good question... I have no idea.  <br />
<br />
I just discovered where the spell was yesterday.  I didn't see anything about it being no-drop, but that could certianly complicate things :(<br />
<br />
That would be a bummer... but on the bright side... I get another Pet Heal spell at 52 or so, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got the expansion yesterday... Now I just need to figure out how to get to the mysterious Planar Library.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">FYI, I found my way up to PoK the other day and got the spells I need.  ALso discovered the JOY of being able to pop around the globe with the wonderfull stones up there.  w00t</div></div><hr />
