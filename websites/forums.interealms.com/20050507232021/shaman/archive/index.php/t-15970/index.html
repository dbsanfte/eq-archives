<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I'm curious as to what you guys have as your hotbox buttons, specifically for the 1st page, as i keep all the important ones there.... but as im getting more aa's and such, its getting hard to keep what i need for raids and such without switching to hotbox2 for other abilities.. (which i think is really annoying)  <br />
<br />
anyways heres my lineup:<br />
1. epic<br />
2. spirit call/pet attack<br />
3. horse<br />
4. quick heal (tnargs)<br />
5. slow msg<br />
6. malos msg<br />
7. canni 5<br />
8. assist<br />
9. sense heading<br />
10. sow boots<br />
<br />
oftentimes when i try and switching something out, i find myself pressing that button expecting the previous effects to happen, and it usually leads to a spam of irrelevant messages to what im actually trying to do, so thats been my lineup in hotbox1 for awhile... trying to fit RC into it, but i dont really want to switch anything out, cuz i use all of these a lot. so do you think it would be worth it to get RC into this lineup? cuz i REALLY despise switching hotbox windows, even though its relatively easy i find it troublesome, so i like everything on 1 window... anyways, thx for any advice or comments.. also, would like to know what you guys have for your hotkeys as well =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Pet Kill<br />

3. Pet Back Off<br />

6. range slot (swap wicked bone atlatl, ornate sceptre, or grimling crystal ball)<br />
7. Assist<br />
8. Spirit Call<br />
9. Rabid Bear (just so I can see when it refreshes)<br />
10. Radiant Cure<br />
<br />
I leave the horse, an inventory slot (sow boots), two ring slots (regal band of bathezid, coldain hero's ring, and stealthy ring of travel), a hotkeyed bag containing my toys, pet guard me, pet guard here, suspend minion, etc., etc., on other hotkey banks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All my main ones are on hotkey box 2 (no idea why)<br />

Canni<br />
Epic / winterstorm (whichever i'm using at the time)<br />
pet attack<br />

<br />
Never bothered with slow message, I hate fool melee who announce &quot;now assisting %t&quot; every mob.  I'm gonna slow it, and they know it, so no reason to keep saying it.<br />
<br />
Then I have some other useful things on hotbox 1 that I can quickly swap to.  sow boots, 9th ring (instaclicks), radiant cure, can5, spiritcall, other click effects.  On Page 6 (again, no idea why), I have pet controls.  I just get used to doing shift + 6, then 5 for pet back off, and shift + 1 then 5 for can5, then shift + 2 for back to normal.  Also keeps me from stupidly cannibalizing myself when I shouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As for the slow button, I group with the same people every night and they voted they'd rather see a slowed message than a resisted message, thus the message stays. :p</div></div><hr />

now all i need is a hotkey to clean up my ROOM (http://www.fohguild.org/forums/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=127657)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1. epic<br />

7. Q<br />
8. cani4<br />
9. open inventory slot for misc clicky<br />
10. spirt call<br />
<br />
I have one of my message pages setup with all my slow message ect and just click those as needed. <br />
<br />
As for calling slow from the cleric point of view PLEASE DO on every mob. When I start healing completely depends on if its slowed or not and I'd like to know when it is. I might miss the spell message, I won't miss a group message. If for some reason I'm grouping with just my cleric and the shaman in the group doesn't call slows it REALLY gets on my nerves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm running out of hotkeys on my first page. I am getting Cann5 and Virulent Paralysis next so I'll have to find a new place for those - I think I'll dedicate my second bank to AA hotkeys.<br />
<br />
I've always had a set pattern for all my characters, and after 4 years it's kinda hard to change the first 6 buttons:<br />
<br />
1 - sit/stand<br />
2 - sense heading<br />
3 - taunt (if applicable)/pet attack on shaman<br />
4 - slam/bash/kick/monk special attack<br />
5 - /assist or ranged weapon (if applicable)<br />
6 - spellbook<br />
<br />
I doubt I could replace 1 or 2 with anything else, because I constantly tap 2 without even thinking because of muscle memory, and always hit 2-1 when I want to sit down or stand up. I cant really change 4 either because in combat I always tap that hotkey repeatedly also.<br />
<br />
Hotkey 8 is usually /who all guild on most of my characters as well. On my shaman 9 is epic dot and 10 is sow boots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that I have all but 2 of the banks completely filled up now.  I won't list them since I use them all extensively though.<br />
<br />
<br />
  My advice to you is make a bank of JUST raidcall messages.   Put Slow, resisted slow, Malos, Malicious, Malosinia, resisted Malosinia, Grummus (and resisted), Cripple (and resisted) in the bank and eventually it is reflex to hit the proper call.<br />
<br />
<br />
   If you want to expand your basic set slightly without much fuss (and use the keyboard, not mouse), place calls on the same slot as the hotbank window.  (ie - place landed slow message on Bank 2, slot 2... then you hit SHIFT+2, 2..  viola, you announced the slow).<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Oh yeah, and unless you haven't maxed out Sense heading yet...  ditch that one and use the compass :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No excuse to not have sense heading maxed immediately.  Set some button you use constantly to also set off the sense heading button (I use left arrow, I seem to turn left more than right for some reason).. you'll max it easily.  After that, no reason to waste a key on it.<br />
<br />
I but a bunch of keys on the second bank, because some things I need so rarely (sow boots, for example) it's okay if I have to &quot;shift-2, 5&quot; to get to it.  Shift-# will switch you between button pages... so important but more rarely used stuff can get shuffled over.  That's where I have spirit call and RC usually, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use those for grouping and soloing.  Switch a few things out depending on the group or what I'm soloing but thats about it on the main page.  I also keep the action opened to the socials page right next to the hotbuttons which gives me another 12 buttons all open at once.  It's especially nice to make a /dismount key there because you can dismount in the middle of casting if its on the socials page.  No more accidenally clicking off a buff when trying to get off the horse quickly to interrupt!</div></div><hr />

I raid a fair bit, and we usually have 3 or 4 shamans minimum, so announcing stuff like malos and slow like that helps cut down on redundant mana usage.  I call malos before I cast because I know it'll stick, so it stakes my claim sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">well if you are comfortable muckin around in the UI files you can do what I did and add inventory slots to your hot button window.

I put Can5 w/ message and Torpor w/ message in a separate hotkey bank.  I've found that if I have to consciously swap hotkey banks, I'm much much less likely to hit Can5 when I don't quite have the HP to do it.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My hotkey line up is somewhat fluid, as I move things about as I need them. There are some constants though, things that I don't change because if I do, I keep doing them out of habit. Like Canni is always in slot 3, slow always slot 1. <br />
<br />
It's not ideal, but it sort of grew that way, back from when I first got canni etc, and didn't use it that much. For example, I have tried removing the sit hotkey and putting something more useful in slot 4, but I hit it by accident from time to time, even though I typically don't sit in a group or raid anyway!<br />
<br />
Typical grouping setup:<br />
<br />
1. Turgurs<br />
2. Pet back off<br />
3. Canni 4<br />
4. Sit/book (depends if indoors)<br />
5. Canni 5 (direct AA hotkey so I can see when it pops)<br />
6. Canni 5/quiescence macro<br />
7. Quiescence macro (announce and cast)<br />
8. Slow announce.<br />
9. /pet attack<br />
10. assist (by name)<br />
<br />
Typical raiding setup:<br />
1. Turgurs<br />
2. Radiant Cure (switch out to insta clicky if I need it).<br />
3. Canni 4<br />
4. sit<br />
5. Canni 5<br />
6. Malosinia announce<br />
7. Malos announce<br />
8. Slow announce<br />
9. Assist SA or puller (depends on raid) by name<br />
10. Assist MA by name</div></div><hr />

7 Mitigated slow message<br />
8 Malo message<br />
9 Slow message<br />
10 Tnarg<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid setup is for the most part the same. I have a resist slow message in slot 7, I swap out 8 and 9 with my raid malo/slow messages. On the second bank is root, Radiant cure, Buff inc to %t 's group , clicky booties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My setup is overly wasteful and highly confusing to anyone but myself.<br />
<br />
Sadly if dates back to the old interface when we had 6 banks of 6.<br />
<br />
1. Spear<br />
2. Slam<br />
3. Main heal (Quies)<br />
4. Main Dot. (Blood of Saryn)<br />
5. Slow<br />

7. Canna 4<br />
8. Canna 5 (with group warning)<br />
9. Was Root. Now is Ornate Pants root<br />
10. JBB<br />
<br />
That seems fairly straightforward. Right?<br />
<br />
Well bank Shift 2<br />
<br />
1. Pet kill<br />
2. Pet back off<br />
3. Pet assist Main tank and kill<br />

7. Rabid Friggen bear<br />
8. Canna 5 (Just button for timing. and no warning)<br />
9. Virulent Parlasys<br />
10. Spirit call<br />
<br />
Bank shift three is the same for all charecters I play. <br />

<br />
1. No clue<br />
2. Corpse<br />
3. Sense heading<br />
4. Loc<br />
5-10. No clue<br />
<br />
Bank shift 5 has like one damn button<br />

<br />
Bank shift 6 has repeat of spells in memorised order.<br />
1 Tnarqs<br />
2. Queis<br />
3. Nuke/Malos<br />
4. Poisen dot<br />
5 Slow<br />
6. Spells book<br />
7. Swap slot<br />
8. Canna 4<br />
<br />
And spell 6 gem used to be Root. But with the advent of root pants. and Ferine avatar. it has been made into My Avatar mem spot.<br />
<br />
Bank 7 is my Rp hotkeys. As well as Bank 8 9 and 10. If I ever get around to making them back.<br />
<br />
Prolly too much information. But oh well. I had 20 minutes to kill.<br />

9. epic<br />
10. /loc<br />

I'll be replacing /loc with canni5 as soon as I'm more comfortable that I won't kill myself with it too often.  Just got it and not yet ready to use it on autopilot.<br />
<br />
I tied all my spells to #1-8 on the number pad on the right side of the keyboard.  I also put sit/stand on the letter T and the spellbook on the letter R.  Target nearest npc is also on the letter B, very handy for multimob fights.<br />
<br />
I have other banks for things I use rarely, like /corpse or announcing Malosini/Grummus, etc.  I swap them in to replace unnecessary things on a situational basis.  And for things like fishing or my Trader Afk hotkey I just switch to the relevant bank of hotkeys as necessary.</div></div><hr />

3: Canni4 (definately necessary)<br />

The way my UI is set up, my primary and secondary weapons, as well as all my inventory slots, are all located at the bottom left of my screen in one long row, right below my hotkeys.  The inventory slots located near my primary/secondary slots contain:  Epic, affliction haste torch, and my twohander.  This allows me to swap them in and out with my normal primary weapon easily and without having to use any additional hotkey slots for them.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Lol, I'm glad I'm not the only one! I have sit on 4 too. I've tried to wean myself off it, as I don't really sit down that much at all, but if I put something else in that slot, I *will* hit it from habit.<br />
<br />
I might get there in the end - I eventually managed to get away from 2 being sense heading, after they put in the compass. :)</div></div><hr />

HEHE, I had it on 4 too. Change it, you can do it! I changed it for /pet report health and set the &quot;S&quot; key to sit/stand on keyboard config.<br />
<br />
During 1 or 2 weeks i had my pet reporting his health a lot :-) but you get used to it after some time hehehe.</div></div><hr />
