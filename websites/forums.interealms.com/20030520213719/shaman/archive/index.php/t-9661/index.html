<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New to the boards, and have a question i hope u can help me with.<br />
Im considered a bit insane by the other shammies in my guild, but i been leaning towards AC over just raw mana pool for a while as i feel we can regen mana pretty damn fast (have canni 5).<br />
Im just getting to the point where im switching from AC to HP, but whats really bugging me is that i dont know if theres an AC cap for Shamans, and if so what is it.<br />
Have an AC of 1087 HP 2358 Mana 3450 unbuffed.<br />
Anyway any feedback is appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there used to be talk of a soft cap for classes dependant on thier type .. melee / priest / int caster.  Warriors were the most aware and hyper sensative about this.  One thing I've noticed though through multiple counts on plate classes is that AC in PoP matters, flag out the 1300 ac cap they used to have is no longer the case someone with 1400 or 1500 or more ac compared to someone with 1300 ac will tank distinctively better, even if hps are constant.<br />
That being the case I'd assume the cap has been lifted from all classes, including shaman so the more AC you can aquire the better.<br />
You'll likely have to set your own limits on how much you'll sac ac for hp and vise versa.<br />
