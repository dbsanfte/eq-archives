<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Awewa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The cave was dark and damp, but more importantly it was quiet, well hidden, and unoccupied.  The three conspirators found the cave that spanned deep into the Rathe Mountains by accident, when looking for a place to set up camp for the night in a nasty downpour.<br />
<br />
The rain had moved in suddenly from the south, from the Plains of Karana, turning the marshy Feerrott into a soupy mess in mere minutes, making travel near impossible.  Black clouds peered down apocalyptically, forewarning of the danger to come, but none of them paid it any heed, struggling desperately to see in the torrential conditions.  The ground sucked hungrily at their feet, licking their calves and thighs whenever the chance arose.  Mud spattered up their robes turning them all the same dull brown.<br />
<br />
They had headed for higher ground, not only looking to escape a possible flood, but to reach firmer ground.  The foothills of the Rathes’ were hard granite, providing them relief from the tugging earth, and eventually the shelter of the cave they now stood in.<br />
<br />
Aliera had said a silent prayer to no god in particular, except the vile master of the rain himself, for the shelter.  Normally she enjoyed the rain, spending hours sitting, pondering many things or dancing happily under its gentle touch, but this rain was hard and unforgiving.  She did not welcome its touch, feeling it more like a spurned lover than a caring, consoling friend.<br />
<br />
But now, deep within the bowels of the earth, flushed with the light of several torches they had brought with them, she paced daintily around the large open room as Razma read the scroll aloud, instructing Jlove.  Having cleaned off in the underground spring that dribbled through an opening on the far side of the room, and spent the night sleeping by a warm fire, that had long since burnt out, her clean dry robe danced through the air as she turned several graceful pirouettes.<br />
<br />
She bounded with anticipation and excitement with each symbol Jlove drew on the granite shelf they stood upon with a shard of porous limestone.  The shelf was perfect for them, flat, and as smooth a lacquered pearl.  Runes and wards of protection now speckled the almost polished granite, as the two men completed the final preparations.<br />
<br />
“Sss… Zis isss alls.”  The necromancer hissed.<br />
<br />
“Then we are ready?” she asked exuberantly, her tiny feet slapping as her dance came to a sudden stop.<br />
<br />
“We are.”  Jlove nodded at her.  “But before we begin, you have much more to tell us.”  Her heart froze, dying for a single instant between thunderous beats.  The first due to her energetic dance, the second the unexpected probe.<br />
<br />
Countless thoughts flooded her mind dropping her jaw as they poured out her mouth silently, invisibly.  She did not know what to say, or where to begin.  She feared they would abandon her if they knew everything, but a part buried deep within her, more core than her friendship and loyalty, burned to release the secrets, and with much hesitation, she decided she would.  “I… I…” she stammered.<br />
<br />
Stamping her foot in self-defiance she settled herself.  “I have asked you here to call upon a powerful spirit.”  Her eyes opened wide to theirs.  The clouds lifted, and even in the dark they glittered in their usual fashion.  “I wish to ask its bidding to complete a task set upon me by The Master of the Phantasm.”<br />
<br />
The men’s eyes widened to match hers, but not in excitement, in shock and surprise.  “You still seek the Staff of the Serpent?”  Jlove inquired amid his wide-eyed awe.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” She replied, her excitement rising at the spoken name.  “This is my final test, and it too draws to its end.”<br />
<br />
“How does this spirit play into the test?”<br />
<br />
“The spirit is strength.  I need it to collect my prize, hidden deep in the Plane of Fear.”<br />
<br />
“Sss..FEAR?”  Razma’s hissing tongue interjected.  “Ss ‘ell me sss o’sss wha’ yous seeeksss.”<br />
<br />
“The Lord of Fear’s spirit slave; The Shissar Wraith.  The masters require its essence, and I require the power to obtain it.”<br />
“I can not do this.”  The wizard protested.  “I can not allow you to challenge Cazic Thule alone.  Perhaps if the Keepers will it we will confront him banded, but that is for all to decide.”<br />
<br />
“Jlove… No!” She pleaded, her brow furrowing with real anguish.  “I have not asked to go alone, all I ask of you is to help me call upon this spirit.  What harm can it do?”<br />
<br />
He sighed, peering at the ache upon her face, then turned to their Iksar companion.<br />
<br />
“I have come so far… so far.”  She murmured.  “Please.”<br />
<br />
“Wha’ ssspiri’?”  The Iksar asked shrewdly.  “I mus’ ‘ave …sss… a persssonal I’em…”<br />
<br />
A jingling sound came from her body, as if she wore bells upon her waist.  Into her hand tumbled a talisman.  Shaped as an arrowhead of brilliant gold, several rare and valuable stones studded its surface.  “This will suffice.”  She held her open palm to the necromancer.<br />
<br />
“Then you agree to the summons, friend?” Jlove asked him as he took the stunning piece from the lithe enchantress.<br />
<br />
“I …ssss… will do zee ssssumons onlysss.”<br />
<br />
With a frown and a sigh, the wizard turned back to the ritual laid out before them.  He studdied it very carefully looking for any imperfection, any flaw that could be dangerous, and found none.  He had been meticulous in his setup as he was in everything else.  “Razma, to the south, Aliera the west.  I will be on the north.”  He barked, throwing his head over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Facing away, neither of the men saw her face alight with furious joy.  The air around her crackled as she spilled into it.  Her moment had come, finally.<br />
<br />
The threesome took their places around the central circle of protection.  Razma to the south, holding the ritual’s parchment, Jlove to the north, his face lined with concern as he pulled himself inward to tap his full strength, Aliera to the west, her hand clasping the opposing hand of each gentlman.  Her face, too, showed lines.  Her cheeks creased as she grinned broadly.  Slowly the smile faded as she cleared her mind and focused herself to receive the brutal energy that would flow through her soon.  In truth, she trusted no other wizard to funnel his energy with enough control to not kill her, to avoid cooking her delicate body from the inside out, but she still knew it would be unpleasant.  She knew it as her fingers began to tingle and her feet went numb.<br />
<br />
The tingle did not last long, only a few moments until it grew.  The channel had been opened and raw energy trickled into her slowly like a melting glacier might feed a stream.  As the weather grew warmer that stream would grow to a river, and given a large enough source, flood its banks.  The tingle grew, and pain wracked her hands like she had never felt.<br />
<br />
Only the determination of her goal held her hands clutched in theirs, squeezing with all her strength.  She felt the air around her change; felt energy buzzing from her as well as from the runes etched in lime around her.  The air turned warm as the ritual began to churn like a gnomish clockwork.  Jlove fed it through Aliera’s concentrated channeling to the Warlock, who in turn fed energy into the runes in the ancient tongue of the dragon.  Each piece was as vital as the next, as any failure would disrupt the delicate transfer, but no such failure occurred.<br />
<br />
Jlove kept his release constant, strong enough to fund the spell, weak enough to be channeled through his friend.  Razma spoke pure and clear, not faltering on one syllable of the difficult language.  Each rune, drawn perfectly, collected the spoken energies and opened into the realm of the dead, calling to the owner of the jeweled pendant that sat in the center of the circle of protection.  And through it all, her threshold of pain long since violated, the tiny dark elf clutched to consciousness like an iron bear trap.  Waves of deliriousness struck her like giants clubs and she cried out.  Her mouth dropped open, spilling arcana of its own.  Her subconscious spat spells as fast as it could in self-defense, channeling off some of the mana that wreaked havoc on her nerves.  Her skin flushed as red as spilt blood, and hot as magma as she struggled under the wizards power.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her release was gone, the energy came in, but something prevented its passage.  Her last tactile sensation was that of the necromancer’s cold, scaled hand still in hers.  The ritual finished with a burst of energy, a backdraft that channeled directly into her, and clashed with what she was still taking on through Jlove.  The shock to her system ended her consciousness.  Her hands went slack and fell from theirs, breaking the link; the excess arcana still within her.  She never felt herself crash to the stone.<br />
<br />
Slowly Jlove and Razma came from the deep meditation to the thick heavy air of the cave again.  Their senses dulled, it was several minutes before they noticed anything amiss.  The first and most obvious change was the darkly silhouetted shade before them.  Somehow it sucked the light from the brightly glowing runes around them, creating an oddly shadowy incandescence as it looked around, eventually turning its attention to them and spoke.<br />
<br />
“Who calls upon Lord Wrathheart?”  The deep scraping voice, like steel on a millstone, sent shivers through them.<br />
<br />
It was then, at that moment, when they expected their female friend to answer, that they noticed her prone on the floor, half in, half out of the protective circle.  That answer came, but not from the unconscious elf, but from the shade, pulsing with vile energy.<br />
<br />
“My love?” it choked the question and paused.  “My slayer…” It grumbled venomously.  Jlove pictured a bead of drool escaping the corner of its cruel grin, like a goblin anxiously awaiting the taste of warm live flesh.<br />
<br />
The two stood dumbfounded as the shade cackled.  They had successfully summoned the soul of Aliera’s long departed torturer.  The man who had enslaved her and so many others as concubines and students.  The man she had slain, the first blood her innocent soul had shed.  The man she remembered as her cruel father, the painful truth blackened from her memory.<br />
<br />
It raised a hazy translucent hand and the prone dark elf floated to her feet, still unconscious.  Her lax muscles left her standing in a somewhat odd state, straddling the rune of protection.  Her toes tapped the stone and the creature giggled as he played with her like a puppet.  “Ages I have waited for this day.  But never did I expect you to be here, my lovely sapphire.”  Its hand glided to her, pulling gently across her jaw from ear to chin in one slow motion.  “Once more you are mine.”<br />
<br />
As its fingers pulled together on the tip of her chin, her left foot, still outside the rune shuffled forward across the stone.  He pulled her forward with those fingers on her chin like tempting a horse with a sugar cube.<br />
<br />
“NO!”  The wizard shouted, calling forth and instant blast of concussive force.  The blast passed through the creature harmlessly, but gave it pause.<br />
<br />
“You can not harm me here, in the plane of Torment.” It spat.  “But perhaps you will have your chance soon enough.”  It pulled her forward once more, and her foot dragged across the protective rune, smearing the soft limestone.  In an instant the ritual decayed, its energy folded upon itself, the runes failed.<br />
<br />
As the energy faded from each rune, so did its supernatural light.  As the light dissipated, having no true form or heat, the shade vanished in the natural darkness; but it was still here, they could feel its uncaged power.<br />
<br />
The Dark Elven enchantresses’ feet danced spectrally across the granite in her odd standing slump.  Then her head rolled up, turned toward them, and her eyes opened.  “What a surprise.” Her most wicked tone gleamed at them.  But it was not her, and they knew it; they could see it in her eyes, empty of hope and love; full of spite and uneasy desire.  “This one is primed with wicked energy.”  She grinned cruelly, maliciously.  A toothy, fear inspiring, heart ceasing smile.<br />
<br />
Without another word, through her flesh, it released a small portion of that energy.  A blast of mixed concussion and flame engulfed the cave, sending the two men hurtling across the room into the cave wall, scorching everything in range.  The stone around them rumbled angrily and the walls began to drip liquid stone.<br />
<br />
Once its fury subsided, she looked around, searching for something.  “Wake up, bitch!”  She spat, it talking to her. As it found what it was looking for.  In the cindered packs near they downed men the corner of a voluminous tome peaked out.  She strode to their sides, fished the warlock’s grimoire from the ashen mess, and fished for the wizard’s arcana.<br />
<br />
As she found the second book, she stumbled, nearly falling from her knees.  “What…?”  she stammered bewildered.<br />
<br />
“Ahh… You’re awake.”  It whispered in her mind and she answered herself.  “Yes… yes… delicious thoughts!  Mmmm… power… yes!  We go to Fear!”  She pulled the second book from the ash, stowing it much more easily than her tiny frame possibly could.  Striding gently, swaggering, she walked back to the ring where it had entered this world.  Leaning down it grasped the golden chain and pendant.<br />
<br />
“Oh my…” she said.  Its ‘thoughts’ mixed with hers as hers mixed with it.  As it remembered the dark purpose within the pendant, so did she know, and as she cringed, it laughed at her; laughed with her own voice.<br />
<br />
“You cringe at eternal life?”  It asked her, again with her own voice.<br />
<br />
“Eternal torture...” she corrected it.  Suddenly she wondered if an onlooker might think her insane, talking to herself so.  It laughed at her again.<br />
<br />
“You have not yet experienced torture or insanity, but you will.  So smart…” The cave air began to warm slightly around her.  “You always were.”  The shade could not hide its memory from her.  It remembered its own death, by her hand; her loss of innocence.  It grumbled within her, quaking her flesh with portentous anger.<br />
<br />
Her face jumped and contorted in waves of conflicting emotion as control shifted back and forth like the tides.  She felt helpless as its curses and vile memories flooded her, gripping her like a hawk clutching its prey.  His talons ripped deeply into her, tearing down the walls she had built around so much of her young life, forcing her to relive what she chose to forget.  It seemed even in death his torture and abuse of her was not finished.<br />
<br />
In defense she forcibly recalled pleasant memories.  Thoughts of her friends and loved ones; of good deeds done and received; of better times.  But the defense was feeble.  His poison soaked claws slashed her, dripping venom.  In her mind, instead of returning to her friends happily from some long past pilgrimage, she brought doom and destruction upon them.  Beasts of all sorts escaped their cages within her memories and invaded where they did not belong.  She watched her friends slaughtered, as she stood helpless.  She watched herself grin wickedly, hate flashing in her eyes as they screamed in terror until finally silenced by death.<br />
<br />
The images, to vile to stomach, sent her reeling.  Mentally and physically she stumbled as she took control through raw emotion; pumping endorphins and terror gave her power over herself, but the onslaught of imagery was too much.  Collapsing to one knee she gave up.  She slid back into a distant, untouchable place, closing off all stimuli like a trance.  His visions could not reach her here, but neither could her own senses, not consciously at least.  All that remained was his voice, talking to her; that she could not shut out no matter how hard she tried, or how far away she fell.  <br />
<br />
And talk to her he did; constantly, maddeningly.  The truth was, he had missed her, his favorite concubine.  His wish to be inside her again had been granted, but not the way he desired.  Fate always had a funny way about it.  He wished to be outside her, to be able to look and touch and feel her skin with his own body, but decided to make the best of this gift.  With his power, hers, and the battery that burned within her he could accomplish much, quickly.<br />
<br />
“What I have shown you is not fantasy, but a version of what is to come.”  He cooed her, rising back to his feet.  “It starts and ends with you.”  He opened his hand, where the gem studded talisman still gleamed and stared at it.  “Six gems, six souls.”  He hissed.<br />
<br />
Hidden in her mental fortress, safe from his assaults she still heard and understood his intent.  The souls of her and her friends would be sacrificed to grant him life.  She even knew the souls he chose, he had forced it upon her before her retreat.<br />
<br />
“Yes, my lovely sapphire…” he grinned listening to her.  She did not speak aloud now.  Instead her voice spilled from her mind like a waterfall.  She sought ways to separate herself from him, refusing to use the lips he commanded.  It did not matter, soon, after he regained some of his strength here in the plane of the living, he would control all of her.<br />
<br />
The pendant in one hand, he used the fingers of the other to twist at the gems bound to it; lain in the shape of an A, diamond atop, ruby and pearl along the left, emerald and jacinth the right, a large exceptionally bright sapphire in the center.<br />
<br />
The ruby gave way first, popping innocently into her hand.  Innocent it was not.  The jacinth came loose as well, joining its firey companion in his palm.  Delicately she picked up the ruby with her free hands thumb and forefinger.  He stared at it for a moment, somewhat star struck. <br />
<br />
Buried deep within herself she cried.  She cried for Jlove, the Strength, the Ruby, cried for Razma, the Darkness, the Jacinth; they would be first.  She cried for Zelfani, the Life, the Emerald, Cshae, the Purity, the Pearl, and Wulfran, the Unbreakable, the Diamond.  The only one for whom she did not weep was the Core, the Sapphire, herself.  She would be last, meant to endure the suffering of the others before she was ready to be taken herself.  Her pain was the key to awaken the Core, it needed to feed first.<br />
<br />
With a single word, he crushed the ruby between her tiny fingers like so much brittle coral in a mortar and pestle.  Her lips pursed as she blew the remaining dust into the air.  The jacinth followed the fate of its lost brother, pulverized and scattered to the wind.<br />
<br />
“Fear awaits us.  Your little staff will make a wonderful focus.”</div></div><hr />
