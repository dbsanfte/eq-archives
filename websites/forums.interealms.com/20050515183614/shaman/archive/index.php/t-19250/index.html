<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was really surprised (guess I shouldn't have been) to see the mixed results I got on my guild's messageboard when I posted a request for people to check out our message and post their support.<br />

I jyst CANT BELIEVE shamans are complaining about mana regen !!!!!<br />
I play with (guild shaman) all the time in duo situations and i try as hard as i can to make him run out of mana and he never does . I love all our shamans and they are all above excellent at their characters and playing ability, but, it is ludicrous to say that shaman are falling behind other classes. Shaman can solo and kill many mobs that most shamanless groups cant even handle. I agree you need heal upgrades to put you more in line with other priest classes and maybe a new DD spell, but this post from the shamans crucible sounds more to me like someone who is upset that other classes are becoming closer to shamans in power and they are not the havoc wreckers they used to be.<br />
<br />
Think about this.. Mana regen for bards.... non existent save for measley AA points. Bard melee damage, hell my rogue at 45 did more melle damage than tappyn at 65. We cant mgb anything besides saves and mana/regen. Would be nice to have a AE cure song or AE haste song.<br />
<br />

<br />
Perhaps they could take away Canni and give all the other things they are asking for. That could be a balance. Personally I don't think many non melee classes have much to complain about, least of all shammies and Bards.<br />

Hey Sam.... if I have never played a beastlord or shaman I probably would think you and the shaman community are nuts.<br />
<br />
One of my alts is a 65 BST with her 65% slow. I use her to provide (monk) with an instant group. I love my beastlord.. she can solo pretty much anywhere. (monk) and her make a good team. Only disadvantage is my beastlord can't really heal..... so I decided to make a shaman. My shaman is lvl 56 now and I'm kind of disappointed. I will still level my shaman to 65 before making a decision... but as it stands my beastlord is a better slower!!!! My Bst can slow on the first try.... her slow is only a 2 sec cast. My shamans slow seems to get resisted a lot... it's a 3 sec cast with a longer refresh time. If i have to cast debuff first it turns into a 7-8 sec process.... kind of sucks. I'm hoping when my shaman lvls this will change... but it seems unfair that BST gets a lvl 64 slow spell that is so dam fast while Shamans get a 3 sec lvl 51 slow spell that gets resisted. The whole shaman mana regeneration thing I don't agree with..... Shamans have canni.</div></div><hr />

I posted links to support our proposal and even in a tight group of friends I got one guy saying my whining was making his head hurt ... of course he finished off that statement with a smilie ... whatever.  I figure he was joking about the whining, but still doubted the necessity of the changes we asked for.  Clueless morons like turtle aren't helping our class, nor is the reputation we carried from Kunark and SoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The real problem is that people don't know the difference between active and passive mana regen. <br />
Do search on those terms and you'll notice that they are relatively new even to this board.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think that people forget that we don't want all or even a majority of what's in that document.  I've found that almost universally, people have said to me &quot;I don't agree with that proposal, but I do think shamans could probably use xxx&quot;, with xxx being one of the things from the proposal.  Of course, I do get the whole &quot;You can solo dragons!&quot; thing a lot, too...  Ever wish we could undo that? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Players in general, want to hold on to the fabled perceptions of old, about shamans.  I bet the vast majority haven't even bothered reading in detail, the history of our progression (or lack of) throughout the expansions.  They just don't want to believe it.<br />
<br />
There are 15 classes in EQ.  It amazes me that 14 of these have recieved attention in detail (sometimes more than once) over the years.<br />
SOE even restructered the entire discipline format recently, because of major concerns from a class.  Not for a single moment, since Kunark, can I believe that one single class (shamans) out of all the others, has been balanced all this time--not while other classes continue to raise hell about their concerns and recieve compensation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fact is... most eq players are selfish over-opinionated nerds. The people who frequent ANY message boards have a tendancy to be even MORE opinionated (its a result of being allowed one sided discussions). The long and short of it is... if its not their problem, they could give a flip. Look at warriors, and the flak they receved over asking for assistance. Hell, they still kind of suck even after the upgrades so many belittled them for asking.<br />
<br />
People perceive shamans to be at the top. I mean COME ON... we can use a JBB! We can solo western wastes dragons! We can solo for exp! What they often fail to realize is... its a waste of our time to do so. Group exp &gt; solo, ww dragons.... umm yeah I need some sweet reinforced dragon armor all right :P JBB... uh huh, thats some leet dps in todays fast kill groups.<br />
<br />
At least the majority of people who experience us at end game realize how badly we need a healing upgrade. We should be able to serve PASSABLY as a main healer in an exp provided we dont have to slow. With a beastlord/ench slowing in an exp group, I can keep solid tanks alive, but run oom very very quickly. A druid, to whom we are supposed to heal on a comparable fashion, can heal all day with a beastlord/ench slower. It goes to show how our heals have not changed to reflect the reality of slow mitigation. Although I guess I can go back to BoT. I hear elemental/time shamans are pretty leet there. Then again, so are chanters... as tanks.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A class has to really be screwed before you will see anything close to sympathy for a request for upgrades.  Unfortunately I think it is just human nature to see the world in a zero sum situation.  &quot;Don't tax you, don't tax me tax that man behind the tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were oblivious idiots who were arguing that Warriors were fine and did not need any help a few months ago.  The reaction is pretty much what I expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the main problem you encounter is that most poeple dont take into consideration that our regen is an active process and how that affects what we do, also how slow casting our spells are so that we are hit 2 fold.. also try and explain that most of the things we ask for are not for solo ability but for better use in a group.<br />
<br />
for solo we are fine, but slow.. should mention that yes we can solo stuff that other find hard but it take 1 hr or more! (for the more big things) we cant solo very fast. <br />
<br />
and lastly we are hit due to our uberness in kunark.. we where amazing, which is why it has taken 3 expansion to make us not. but that doesnt mean it hasnt happened.<br />
<br />
unfortunately, poeple seem to perfer nerf than actually getting a shaman that better for a group. . its seems untill people that play shaman well get pissed off and stop playing a shaman they just wont take our word for it:(<br />
<br />
just advised them that if god comes out as is, you wont get, and possible might retire .. i know i thinking about it:)<br />
<br />
oh wait that wont help, they wont even notice we have left.. bugger.</div></div><hr />

90 minutes, 1 failed mission and 6 rezzes later they did agree we have some issues.<br />

Not sure how the adventure could have gone so badly.   I am stuck as healer/slower in bunches of adventures.  To some extent I prefer it as it keeps me semi on my toes.  The only downfall would be that I can not dot or nukes as much.  Adventures with this set up usually go faster than normal as it allows more DPS classes in without the need for the do nothing support classes (assuming you have a semi intellegent puller)<br />
<br />
When I first read this I was assuming it was as a shaman with 2kish hitpoints having trouble, not someone with the ultimate weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd assume he was doing hard ldon mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lol he was probably doing a hard 65 LDoN. I have done slowing and healing on LDoN's but I think I was the highest or close to it at 59 and only doing normal LDoN's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I wouldn't want to be the primary slower and healer on a high diff all 65 LDoN at least not at this point in my shaman's development...but at the same time, I don't believe that I should be able to either because shaman offer a great deal more than simply healing.  Even so, I guarantee you that some of the more uber shaman that group with EP equipped folks with 100's of AAs or the like do it and it's trivial to them.  Me and my friends struggle to finish hard LDoNs even with perfect group configs because we have few AA and no gear of note (most have a few pieces of the 1492 LDoN armor at best) - but we can do it.<br />
<br />
For normal 65 LDoN I prefer to be the primary healer and slower - I find it very enjoyable.  My ideal group is me, mezzer, aggro tank (SK), and 3 DPS.  That kind of group destroys normal LDoNs (even moreso than other groups already destroy normals).  I've been main healer for many 65 groups before I was 65, before I had canniV, and/or with no CC other than (often my) rooting.  I don't think I've failed any LDoNs since the last time my server crashed.<br />
<br />
Normal difficulty LDoN is generally very easy for any group of 65's.  I wish there was some middle setting because the difference between normal and high difficulty at 65 is very significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;However, in terms of balance, fixing one or two of the issues would effectively negate four or five others&quot;<br />
<br />
That's the part that many simply gloss over and then when they read the rest they think we actually want ALL of that stuff, which would indeed be insanely greedy and overpowering.<br />
<br />
Those that think Shaman are still godly chars are about a year or more behind.  We're not broken to the extent of Warriors of recent past, but then again we're not claiming to be.  We're heading in that direction slowly but surely though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Even so, I guarantee you that some of the more uber shaman that group with EP equipped folks with 100's of AAs or the like do it and it's trivial to them.<br />
<br />
As one of said people I could probably do it and have healed for short periods when our cleric has gone ld or died but I don't think I would want to do if for the entire run and it definitely wouldn't be trivial. Even with 300+ aa's maxed ft, clicky mana buff, 15%mana pres items and a good mana pool it would still stress me pretty well to do that. Unfortunately at this point even with aa's and focues's our heals just aren't good enough to effectively keep up with the dps mobs quading for up to 1k can do no matter how uber you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm curious though, since I'm not at that level...  Could a similarly equipped druid or cleric do hard LDoN with no slower?  I certainly think we could use some improvements, but I'm just not entirely sure that the fact that we can't single-handedly carry a hard ldon group is that example.</div></div><hr />

      Rolf ,some post are so funy  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
A cleric can for sure but the fact is that a group with no slow at all is a rare thing.<br />
<br />
And Zhahz, I can do a normal LDoN mission as healer/slower and still have time to nuke. <br />
Matter of fact I could do a Hard one and win it when I take the correct type of classes with me, we are lucky on the mission type we get and no unforseen stuff happens (a fizzle at a bad moment, 1 slow resisted at a bad time, a room where an overpull can not be avoided, etc)<br />
So in reality I will fail said mission 9 out of 10 times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah, a fellow shaman made a post on our server forums, and I've been having a helluva time convincing people we deserve some TLC.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm sorry but going in on your Shaman as the only healer *and* slower on a lvl 65 HARD LDoN and FAILING is NOT a proper demonstration of any shortcomings of the Shaman class.  You likely should fail that adventure, I'm well geared, skilled, and aa'd and wouldn't want to do it, or expect to do well at it.<br />
<br />
On an easy/normal then fine no problem.  But there is a reason hard is called hard =P</div></div><hr />
