<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Although I'm quite  a way off being of a level that I can scribe them at, why in gods name are Torpor and Malo so damn hard to get hold of?<br />
<br />
I mean, they are (other than Slow) our class defining spells, so why do we have to go to such god dam great lengths to get them.<br />
<br />
I've got a feeling that I may just farm seb until I've got enough money to buy them at the Bazaar.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They're just rare.  They only drop from a select few mobs, and the BEST place to get them isn't touched 90% of the time.  Everyone always talks about Veeshan's Peak as being the place to go, but I sure can't convince a group or two to go in with me and farm for a few hours.......  that pretty much leaves sontalak, the kunark dragons, and the RARE RARE emperor chottal.  With kunark greening out and guilds moving on, it's only going to drop less and less often</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think we should petiton Verant to get them sold at Vendors:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't get me started.<br />
<br />
I spent 55k on Malo.<br />
<br />
I am waiting to buy Torpor.<br />
<br />
It is not for sale.<br />
<br />
Sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pray for the one thing that could change the rate at which these spells enter the game:  A Veeshan's Peak revamp.<br />
<br />
VP is the only viable source for torp/malo and some simple changes like making the zone-in a zone-out and loot upgrades are the only things that can bring more copies into the world.  With everyone focused on PoP, the rate at which these spells come into the game has just gone from a crawl to a dead stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild is trying to tell me and our other shaman that these two spells aren't worth the bother of getting.  They are about to have no shaman in the guild if they don't straighten out.  They sure get mad though if we don't go out and find our buffs to buy in the bazaar since they won't help us camp those either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The spells are rare, but attainable.  In fact, I would say NOW is the time to work on it.  With so many people focused on PoP, there are targets like Gorenaire, Talendor, Venril Sathir, and others available for you to fight.  Also, the SkyFire Mountains zone is empty 99% of the time (literally empty of players) so you can easily hunt Guardian Wurms.  They're very likely just standing there waiting for you to kill them.<br />
<br />
I spent some time hunting Guardian Wurms (with guildees) and managed to get Torpor.  My guild actually gave me Malo, then we saw it drop off Gorenaire a few days later (which is great, because there is another guild shaman waiting for it).  My guild has been tremendously helpful to me at every level of my character -- we certainly aren't the biggest, but we stick together and we look out for eachother (which seems like the way to be to me).<br />
<br />
Regarding the spells themselves...  Torpor makes you into an incredible mana machine.  Malo turns you into a debuffing powerhouse.  I went a very long time without Malo thinking that Malosini would get me by.  Malosini will not get you by.  Not even close.  Don't let anyone tell you different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree - if you're not able to hit dragons or VP, head to the Guardian Wurms. It might take you a week or more, but you'll have a nice haul of high level spells by the end of it. And GWs can be done with a single mid 50s group. Or duod by 2 level 60 people.</div></div><hr />

I think it is time to find another guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zakane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Malo is very worth having in a raiding guild. My spells came from Talendor(Torpor) and Sontalak (Malo). I have actually seen Sonta drop both Malo and Torpor on the same kill twice.<br />
<br />
Zakane<br />
Vah Shir Prophet of Torv<br />
House Archon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you have an Enchanter Tashing and a Mage casting Mala, then you can survive on a raid without Malo.<br />
<br />
Ideally get a Bard to occlude as well and then get someone to land Malosini after Mala is in.<br />
<br />
Make a debuff channel and get everyone to call each when they land so you know when to Slow.<br />
You may not need to full debuff everymob like this.<br />
Just depends on their MR.<br />
<br />
Tell your guild Torpor is great for keeping yourself and other casters alive during raids when Mobs are AEing you..... It also used to rock before the mod-rod nerf...<br />
<br />
Raids aside, I'd say Malo is pretty damn near essential for shaman in PoV/PoS groups.<br />
<br />
Most mobs hit insanely hard for regular exp mobs (i.e. Giants in PoS) and a failed slow = probably dead shaman.<br />
Tash draws too much aggro to cast on pull and not every group has an Enchanter or Mage (for Mala).<br />
I guess you could use Malosini - no idea on resist rates though.<br />
<br />
My Malo on Torvon was 35k but I've seen a bunch on Tribunal in the last month or so for 15k(!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nofreesowforu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With the addition of Luclin and PoP a few more spells were added and yes I was given access to a few that I couldnt find. But whats up with the Summons Gem stuff? Why? Where? and when will I need them?:confused:</div></div><hr />
