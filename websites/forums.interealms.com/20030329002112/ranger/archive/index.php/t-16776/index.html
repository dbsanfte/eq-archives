<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hawkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I was just curious, since the Elemental Armor got a huge upgrade (much needed and a pretty good job of it imo), I was curious as to if any of the Planestrider's Armor was changed? I saw that Stanos' Gauntlets got a change from Marvelous Visions to a lesser version (30% Haste but no stamina), any downgrades or upgrades for us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">bracer still has Vengeance 2...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Our legs stayed the same with the longer casting earthen roots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crydee Ossiriand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No changes to gauntlets or tunic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">unfortunatly no, no changes to them it seems, was really hoping to log on and see the legs changed to be like a lesser version of the elemental legs with an effect like Aura of Daring (20 atk 2 regen)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">unfortunatly no, no changes to them it seems, was really hoping to log on and see the legs changed to be like a lesser version of the elemental legs with an effect like Aura of Daring (20 atk 2 regen) or vengence 4, don't see why it isn't since the planestrider bracers have vengence 2 and thegloves vengence 3, would be a lot more fitting IMO than a right click root.</div></div><hr />
