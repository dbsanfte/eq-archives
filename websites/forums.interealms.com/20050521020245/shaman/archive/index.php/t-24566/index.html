<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am thoroughly enjoying the beta, and while they have made progress in large leaps....no way in hell it will be ready by that date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Crazy. Playing beta also and here is a rough list of what they need to implement, test, or fix:<br />
<br />
Revamped spell system/combat arts<br />
Revamped tradeskills<br />
Still don't have all the tradeskills (including ALCHEMY -- remember that one anyone??)<br />
Many broken recipes<br />
Lots and lots of broken quests<br />
Lots of coin exploits<br />
Factions??<br />
Traditions -- probably fluff<br />
Traits -- probably fluff<br />
Raid testing<br />
High end zone testing<br />
etc....<br />
<br />
Still, game looks nice  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If they REALLY wanted to do this right, put everything in game to the point where you consider the version Final, and then let the beta servers run Final for a month before releasing to the public. Too much stuff that is supposed to go in the beta soon for testing and there wont be enough time to fully test it.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine the chaos that will happen when Antonica crashes this often with a lot more servers/players to complain about it?<br />
<br />
I realize the designers must be pushed at these deadlines by SOE mgmt, but someone needs to stand up and say something.....right now release looks like a disaster as far as I can tell (unless a miracle happens). Sticking to this Nov release is the best possible thing that can happen for WOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Per Sony website, ships Nov 8.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Looks to me like a mad panic to get it released before WoW now that WoW has had an open beta.<br />
<br />
ROFL, think i'll wait and see - after the cluster that was GoD I don't think I'm going to pay for a complete new game that may be released buggy as hell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Greed makes them really stupid.<br />
<br />
Christmas is coming up and they want to beat WoW onto the shelves.  I'm amazed that they are willing to gutshot their own creation by rushing it out half finished.  Is there really some fat bastard with a stoagie going, 'ah just patch it later, no one'll care'?<br />
<br />
We're a wired community now.  Hollywood used to be able to recoup money on just about any sad gimmick film simply due to the inertia it took for Roger Ebert's pre-recording explanation of why it sucked to air -- but today, a bad film can tank in 24 hours as our buddies tap out IM's from gamepad cellphones in the theater.<br />
<br />
They are grossly underestimating verdict by blog, especially when their customer base is geeks who live on the web.<br />
<br />
*cough*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's just a durn good point, Barm.  But hey, Sony's used to players who are FAR more complacent than any company has a right to expect.  I think they're going to be disappointed to realize that they aren't going to have an entrenched playerbase with EQ2, and they'll have to change the way they do business or lose em all to more responsive companies and games.<br />
<br />
At least, that's what I hope for.  I've been accused of optimism once or twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So basically they will be asking money to play a beta imo.<br />
<br />
Although I find it strange when you read the beta boards a lot don't mind..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Early release before the product's ready is a  dangerous move on SOE's part.  Most folks will give a new MMORPG that first (usually free) month while they work their way into the new UI and game play.  If the game is bad, they may stay on longer if there's nothing else to play at that moment.  Putting an unfinished EQ2 on store shelves ~ 1 month before WoW goes retail is suicide - especially after all the fans WoW picked up during the stress test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">they released SWG half assed and it's a profitable game...   they've learned from that, that if there are fans, a turd will still sell.<br />
<br />
I'm waiting to buy until the frogloks have been released on at least one server.  most of the complaints should be out by then and I can decide for myself if it's worth it.  By then too, the first round of nerfs should be all wrapped up and most of the broken quests will be repaired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gukana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Um, don't judge EQ2 on SWG or EQLive.  <br />
<br />
Its already a hella lot more ready than SWG was when it was released.  And the devs aren't going against the player base on design issues like SWG was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm sorry but as a current beta tester, releasing when Sony wants to release is just a stupid idea.<br />
<br />
The game is not finished, there are serious flaws in it, but the worst part is the dev team is making progress, but Sony still wants to release. The only logical explanation I can think of for that release date is to attempt to steal market sales from World of Warcraft. The fan club of both EQ2 and WOW are pretty set in stone at this point. The &quot;Undecided Voters&quot; of MMORPG consumption are probably less than 1%, and releasing EQ2 before it is finished will send them away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Um, don't judge EQ2 on SWG or EQLive.  <br />
Why not?  SOE has earned its reputation with a long and dedicated program of early, unfinished releases.<br />
Its already a hella lot more ready than SWG was when it was released.  <br />
That doesn't make me feel any better.  SWG was 6-8 months early based on the broken quests, unworking weapons/armor, daily restarts, etc.  Does your comment mean EQ2 is only 4 months early?</div></div><hr />

I know SoE's rep.  I beta'd SWG, and *cough* played *cough* it for a couple of months.  I judge each Dev team by its individual merits.  Unfortunately SWG's dev team had a lead that had a &quot;vision&quot; as to what the game would be, fans and playability be damned.  EQLive has a dev team now that is doing a job.  Thats just it, a job.  So far, EQ2's dev team has done a good job with communication, feedback, and general attitude.  In SWG Beta, we got plenty of posts from Raph and Co. explaining why their implementation was better than our ideas.  The only time I saw a post that was in anyway similar was when they introduced instancing to the main zones of Antonica and Commonlands (note that the newbie adventure zones, as well as the newbie island were *already* instanced), and people were complaining about immersion.  In SWG, they outsourced the customer service, and in EQ2, we get posts from the soon to be GM's asking for lists of questions that you had when you first got the game.  There is a totally different feel on the boards from SWG to EQ2.  <br />
<br />
But even Gallenite (Team Lead) has a boss.  And the bosses *are* pushing EQ2 out a bit early.  The EQ2 devs have done a great job in getting it as ready as possible.  When I first joined the beta about a month ago, it was about 4 months from release, playability wise.  Now,  I'd say its about 2 months early.  I'm not sure how much they'll knock out in this next week, but unlike SWG, the game will be *better* than it was a month before release, not worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">EQ2 will succeed, bug-riddled release or not, and they know it.<br />
<br />
I cancelled my 2 EQ accounts and 3 DAoC accounts (well mine and my son's) yesterday to avoid being renewed. We will both be starting EQ2 together bright-eyed and eager to explore a new game.<br />
<br />
Rough release or not, I expect to enjoy starting fresh and early on a new game while at the same time forgetting the 3/5 year old frustrations of the older games.<br />
<br />
Some people are downright un-pleasable, some of the the same people bashing EQ2 are the ones paying monthly to bash EQ1. They dont quit, they keep paying and keep complaining knowing damn well they will never be happy.<br />
<br />
Good for blizzard in the way they handle their release. It will likely be more polished than EQ2.<br />
<br />
But when the releases have both come and gone, and both games are stable and expanding. Wow will still be second seat. <br />
<br />
--- My personal prediction ---<br />
<br />
I predict WoW with a comparable (possibly greater) amount of subscriptions in the first few months after release. They will both rise rapidly and WoW will peak then decline rather rapidly while EQ2 slowly continues to rise.<br />
<br />
The originators of the term &quot;Zerg&quot; will get just that. The game will be zerged at the beginning, then people will move on.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
I've played both public previews of GuildWars and I sure hope that game survives, I had great fun and instant gratification with the time i spent online. GL to them :) I will be buying and playing that also.<br />
<br />
Have fun wherever you end up. Fun should be the only factor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Most of the people bashing it havent played it by the looks of things.<br />
<br />
In my experience up to 20 (SHM) and 28 (BRD) was pretty much fine, yes there was nasty lag in the humungous zones but the instancing seems to have sorted that and SoE were running the servers to bursting capacity.<br />
<br />
The new class changes traits etc are all going in very smoothly, the content is great, it looks amazing, honestly stop the bitchfest for 3 seconds and enjoy your gaming.</div></div><hr />
