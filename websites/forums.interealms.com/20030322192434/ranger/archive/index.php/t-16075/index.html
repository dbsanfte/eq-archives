<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nice, any idea on proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drizzen tw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Proc is <br />
<br />
110 DD Fire based ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarmor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Proc is the wizard fire based 110dd.  It is the same proc that is on the Bow of Flames from VT.<br />
<br />
The new bow actually looks extremely similar to the Bow of Flames too.  Both have full ratios that are almost identical when you include the elemental damage, both have small archery mods (the higher 5% mod means that the skill will go from 240 to the capped value of 252, so that's an advantage over the older bow as is the non-elemental base damage).  In general though it almost looks like they used the same template for the bows.<br />
<br />
Note that the bow of flames has 50points of stat boosts (25sta 25dex) while this new one has 48 points spread over dex/wis/agi/int.  Both are 100hp items and 100+ mana items.  Even the saves are similar putting 30+ points into FR, similar range, AC, etc....<br />
<br />
So anyways it's a nice bow, but not overly unique.  I'm sure when the time comes I'll hem and haw about loosing dex and stamina and finally switch over to this new one, but for now the I'm fairly content with my old Bow of Flames.<br />
<br />
Congrats on making it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice, too bad it's still subpar to Agnarr's bow and very subpar to the Plane of Air bows that drop off mobs. What could I except from a tradeskill item though? It only takes 1000x more effort to make the PoFire bow than it does to kill Agnarr or the Plane of Air mini-bosses - you actually have to start up the Fennin Ro event, and then you have to hope it drops off the Demons in it, and as you get to the back of the event, the Demons would destroy Agnarr and the Air Mini-bosses simultainiously. Nice RVR guys.<br />
<br />
Edit: More bitching from me - the Staves drop in the Fennin Ro event as well. Nice itemization SOE. Ridiculous that this item is worse than the bow from Agnarr, I can almost see the justification for the dropped PoAir bows being better, even though this takes 1000x more effort to do. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Edit: Yet more to bitch about, the staves only have a *chance* to drop off 3 of the mobs in the F Ro event. And this bow sucks ass for the effort even more so - FFS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">only 100hp and no sta? wha da fudgesicle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, but the fletcher who makes this bow can, gasp, sell it maybe?<br />
<br />
Because it's a tradeskill, ya know.<br />
<br />
Did a quick check on Agnarr's bow and it seems to be no drop.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but the complaining that a fletchable bow isn't as good as a no drop bow is kinda silly.  It's a damn fine droppable bow, to put it mildly.  Might have to make Fletching one of my next skills over 200 (hate wasting AAXP on that tho).  <br />
<br />
Gryfalia<br />
<br />
PS - and there is no RvR.  There is no risk in the game, period.  There is only time spent.  And people huge into tradeskills have more time sunk into the game than anyone else..;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Droppable means NOTHING. The rarity of the components is ridiculous for how sucky the bow is - it needs to be upgraded.<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think a single person in the Elemental Planes needs or cares about selling items? No? Didn't think so. You obviously aren't anywhere there if you do. The ability to sell this bow means jack. <br />
<br />
What this is, is getting horrible loot from one of the Elemental Plane Boss' events that is only spawnable every so many days.<br />
<br />
Please learn what matters and what doesn't to the people doing these things - you obviously don't. Thinking we care about selling items... geez, maybe only the ones who eBay plat.<br />
<br />
P.S. - Hell I'd have them make it no drop if I could, maybe that would shut some of you ignorant people up. Then again, *nothing* in this game should be droppable excet for Artifiacts and special Quest items (IE, Aten neck). No drop is a stupid concept - the only thing that should be on items is a hard Required Level Limit and a Recommended Level limit , both of which are on almost all high end PoP items, sadly they're still no drop though, which is inane.<br />
<br />
Also, if this bow was worth the effort, do you think anyone would be selling it regardless? No, if it was worth the effort and time put in the people doing these things would be using it.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. - The Plane of Earth Fletched Bow is better than Agnarr bow, more or less, and it's components are INCREDIBLY TRIVIAL TO GET. You can take one group and farm them.<br />
<br />
Again, the Plane of Fire Fletched Bow, has components that ONLY drop in the Fennin Ro ring event, the staff only being able to drop from a TOTAL of THREE mobs in the event. And you can only do the event every so many days. It's like doing a rare mob in the elemental planes and only getting a spectral parchment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, I do know that people in the elemental planes care about selling stuff.  Your protestations non-withstanding.<br />
<br />
But thanks for deciding that everyone thinks like you do, and if they don't they must not be as 'Uber' as your FoH-ness is.<br />
<br />
Nothing like reading a couple posts like this Sean, and making my daily visit to FoHs board to keep cementing the opinion of FoH that Furor and crew has worked so hard building in so many people's minds.  And no, it's not 'jealousy'...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not as &quot;Uber&quot; as me? Hah. I think these people just lack complete common sense. I could not give a damn less about how &quot;Uber&quot; people are.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I see crappy loot for huge time investment and think - this is messed up. Not &quot;oooh, well they can sell it for plat&quot;, which is absolutely worthless to high end players unless they want to eBay it.<br />
<br />
Time+Number of people used to kill mob+big huge event =! Crappy, sellable loot that no one there gives a damn about.<br />
<br />
Common - freaking - sense.<br />
<br />
P.S. Let me further clarify this, if I am on a RAID with 45+ freaking people at the end boss event of one of the tier 4 planes, I except to get things that benefit the raid - not your twink, not you on your offtime, but the raid. Thus, &quot;plat items&quot; should not be from raids. The only thing that should come from raids is gear for people on the raid that is appropriate for the effort the raid took. Common - freaking - sense. It drives me crazy when 45+ of my people get some total piece of crap for their time, that doesn't benefit us in anyway, and people who weren't there think that it's &quot;OK&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry Sean, I didn't really start the original response going after you, but reading another one of Furor's posts, calling everyone behind him 'Cattle' and babbling about how much everyone owes him personally got on my nerves.<br />
<br />
There are many people out there who will never see the elemental planes.  They chose to be in small guilds, they don't have the necessary playtime (and let's be honest, there is necessary playtime), whatever.  It is nice that those people have access, through at least one means, of something that's 'very good'.  Not the best, but at least very good.<br />
<br />
If a fletchable (is that a word?) bow were out there that ended up being BETTER than no-drop bows, even if it were to come from uber high mobs, there would be a similar outcry the other way.<br />
<br />
And yes, if they had started with nothing but level limits/recommended limits that would have been cool, but I think by the time they came to that realization it was far too late.  They added it to new things (read: PoP in quantity), but going back was probably not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Just wish the level restricted crafted items from SoL didn't suck so much for the levels they are restricted to..;-/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khelzor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sean, didn't you know this bow was put in the game so you could bust your ass and make a bow that will trickle down to casual player? Why shouldn't a level 60 ranger with 45 aa do the same dps as a level 65 ranger with 200+ aa. Seems completely appropriate to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Because it's required level of 61?<br />

And regardless, even at 65 with 45 AA he wouldn't do near the damage as Sean..<br />

<br />
I agree with Sean that loot that doesn't benefit the guild shouldn't come from events that require a guild...therefore, an item used to make something that is only going to be sold in the bazaar or on ebay shouldn't be dropped by a boss mob during a raid.  That only makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
Likewise, a tradeskiller should be able to go out and freaking PICK UP stuff off the ground for his tradeskills...since the benefit for him is only in plat from the items he makes and sells.  Since only he benefits, all that should be required for him to get the components and create the item should be doable by himself alone.</div></div><hr />

Tradeskills take time but not too much. The top-end guilds spend more time raiding than a tradeskiller would on tradeskills. Getting 250 fletching didn't take much time; it was more of an annoyance. Raiding and learning to do things first and without spoilers is alot more difficult than you think (when no one else has done something, or it hasn't been spoiled, there's usually a ton of bugs to work around and the raids are usually more difficult).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually, nothing against the rangers here, but fletching isn't really a hard tradeskill.  Not even in the top three.  Smithing and Tailoring take far more work, and it seems after the changes Pottery is actually a toughie now (i.e. you don't get a skill-up on every other attempt..knew I should have gotten it to 200 before).<br />
<br />
Plus, of course, until somewhat recently tradeskills were the ultimate plat sink.  Experimental raiding was too, of course, with coffin costs and the like, something that is missing, mostly, in PoP.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, got to 194 in fletching in about 90 minutes..;-)<br />
Been working on Tailoring for, well, a long time and still at 179.  Clerics can't quad kite otters well.;-/<br />
<br />
Gryfalia<br />
<br />
PS - and I think we all know there are both advantages and disadvantages to going first.  For every thing that Furor claims to have personally made better for the world, there are at least as many things he has worked to make harder, or nerf other classes (necessary or not).  Drop rates get both increased (or made better, as in NToV) or destroyed (parchments anyone?).  Ah how I wish I had been in my server's uber guild when they had NToV, ST, etc all to themselves because they were in the lead, and VT, you get the idea.  The advantages to being the first somewhere are many, as are the challenges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diegaron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sean is right on about this one.  Loot coming from boss mobs that require 50ish people should drop loot commensurate with the time and effort involved.  PoP has fairly consistently disappointed us so far in this regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kaganfindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gryfalia, what is your current skill level in fletching?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">194 of course..;-)  Could be a couple points higher, but I don't think so.  I stopped there because 1) at the time I wasn't higher than 200 in smithing yet and I didn't want to risk getting too high to the magical 'only one skill can go over 200' level, while still being able to make various SoL arrows for my friends and 2) there was no real point to going higher yet, as I was just working on my Shawl quest and found I needed fletching, the only tradeskill I hadn't done at all yet (I wasn't a ranger, never saw a use for it).<br />
<br />
Of course, now that they have made fletching harder too, who knows.  I will admit I haven't tried since they nerfed it (since I had to desire to increase it yet).  But when SoL came out, and acrylia drops were increased, skilling up just wasn't that bad, except finding where to store it all..sigh, gave a couple tons to a ranger friend of mine.  So I probably ended up missing the boat on relatively easy skill ups in Fletching (much like pottery), but since Smithing was my bag, there really was no choice, as at the time the magical one skill over 200 barrier existed.<br />
<br />
My ranger twink is only up to, like, 135 or so..;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Originally posted by Gryfalia <br />
194 of course..;-) <br />
<br />
That's like getting to 158 in Tailoring and saying - wow this stuff is easy! All I need are some spider silks and vials of mana!  <br />
<br />
Fletching is by no means the hardest tradeskill, but its difficulty and expense increases exponentially past 202.<br />
<br />
Regardless, all I think Sean is saying is that the bow staves should drop off exp mobs in PoFire.  Not (or at least not only ) triggered event mobs that involve a raid.<br />
<br />
And I agree.  When you need 40 people to kill a mob, why waste a slot in the loot table for a single piece of a player-crafted item that is subpar to other, much more easily obtainable items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarmaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It really does depend on what part of the tradeskill you consider hard. If you're in a high end raiding guild and have 200k to throw away, then smithing is probably the easiest. Fast skill up rate and you can buy components easily to take you all the way to 250, it's just expensive. Brewing would be the hardest for you in this situation. Because it's very cheap to raise, the skill up rate is insanely low. When Fawyder Shakers trivial at 188 the only way to raise skill is a 9 item combine with irregular numbers, and you'll average around 100 combines per skill increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Akelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Since they nerfed fletching skill ups by about a factor of 4, and repriced the recipies that allowed you to get from 162 to 235 without going bankrupt, fletching over 190 is pretty much dead unless you have already made it there.  Other than the 3 or 4 people I know on Torv that are 250, I have not heard of another making much above the 220 range in ages.<br />
<br />
I would be interested in how you made fletching to 192 in 90 minutes; it took me 10+ hours from 0 to 202 with 226 base wis (druid mule, wis was easier to come by) and KEI to bump it over <br />
250, following the least cost route from Aolena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Was simple.  I sat in Thurg with my 250-odd wisdom and pumped them out.  Sit right in front of the guy, get carpal tunnel syndrome.  Really wasn't that hard and 90 minutes includes the selling to the vendor and what-not.  When did you try to do it?  I assume the fletching nerf would have made lower level fletching harder too.  Who knows, perhaps I found a black hole in the RNG (er, hmm, that might be seen as 'Ranger'...Random Number Generator..;-).<br />
<br />
Sorry, but Tailoring is harder raw materials-wise than fletching.  You can Fletch out to 250 using nothing but acrylia and the various condensed substances which end up being on vendors by the stack (relatively cheaply too).  Luclin did help tailoring too, tho, with the tailored acrylia armors.  But once they upped the acrylia drop rate, Fletching got all the raw materials it needed to collect for awhile, then purge it out and skill up.  Did you 250-max it out before Luclin came out?  At that point it was, IIRC, nothing but expensive bows to 250, so much more expensive.  And of course for tailoring getting rockhopper hides is still annoying, either expensive in the bazaar or killing popularly camped greens for them (I hate taking XP spawns from people who need it to, you know, XP).<br />
<br />
Smithing..well, assuming you have the ability to farm greens at an obscene rate, shadowscream armor is easy/cheap, yet mind numbingly boring and takes a long time (not even counting the annoying pre-quests to get the gear).  And heaven forbid someone is trying to farm it when you go there..tried sharing with 2 others couple days back..;-/  The expensive route might actually be slower these days, unless you mean 'way expensive' and just buying what you need from people in the bazaar.  And, of course, being a smith is nice because you need it to make gear for half of the other tradeskills...<br />
<br />
Brewing sucks...I...Hate...Casks.  Only started it to make tempers then decided 'what the hell, I'm a dorf..BOOZE' and got it to 162, until the casks got to me.  And at the time you needed foraged stuff to get higher.  I could go to, say, FV now and power it out to /200250, but I still hate casks..<br />
<br />
And we won't even discuss JC..;-)  Someday I will be bored and will max it, but why?  Blech.  Anyway, my wife doesn't want me to surpass her, and I can't get her to go over 190...<br />
<br />
One thing for SURE is true.  Get a guild that knows the items you need, and the various drops, etc, and life is MUCH easier.  And since I work on all tradeskills, it also helps to have 4 mules...bah.<br />

Gryfalia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Oh yeah, random aside.<br />
<br />
Didn't realise that the staff in question (from PoFire) actually was a 'loot spot' on the bosses in question.  I assumed it was an add-on drop (think finding undead shissar scales on rhag 1 or something), not in place of an actual drop.<br />
<br />
THAT is kinda retarded.<br />
<br />
Gryfalia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kaganfindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Acrylia arrows aren't an option on every server.  On Innoruuk you can find five or six of any type of acrylia ore at per day on trader mules for between 50 and 80pp.  That's an average of ten combines PER DAY.  for ~55-90pp(including the cost of the condensed substances which retail for 5-10pp) per two combinations.  Since the average rate of skill increases is 1/100 considering maximum relevent statistic(280) you can enjoy a whopping one skill point at the meager cost of ten days and 2750-4500pp per point.  Kid stuff, right?<br />
<br />
Let's say you're a wood elf, and you can do mithril champion arrows to 250.  Now you're down to one skill point average per two or three hours and ~3k spent, assuming 141+ CHA and 280 DEX or WIS.  Oh, and you can't have killed Tunare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you choose to go vendor purchased, yes.<br />
<br />
But acrylia drops a lot these days.  It would be more logical, and a HECK of a lot cheaper, to just take a day off and hunt those zones where it drops in quantity and do a skilling day.<br />
<br />
I am lazy, and a pack rat, so I just store up what I come across and have a tradeskill day, where I choose one, use up all the raw materials I have and try to skill all I can.<br />
<br />
Then I get annoyed at the 100% crappy selling rate on Dwarven Cultural...(to vendors that is, there is NO sale rate to players..;-)<br />
