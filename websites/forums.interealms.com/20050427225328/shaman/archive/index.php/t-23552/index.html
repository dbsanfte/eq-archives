<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sowinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i know everyone has their own personal 2 cp on &quot;the best way to get to lvl blah blah blah&quot;  i'm just posting this to maybe give someone an idea.  My warrior friend and I, starting at lvl 19, headed to Marus Seru to fight.  we stayed at the rock just past the entrance.  we stuck to hoppers until about lvl 22 then began pulling in the stonegrabbers.  occasionally a zelniak would rush us but it wasn't too hard to take them down.  we're both at 28 now and we're moving on to bigger and better places in norrath.<br />
