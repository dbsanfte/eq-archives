<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
Just dinged 58 last night and for some reason my canni dance key for Canni IV isn't working?  I have looked through the search and it won't let me put in Canni IV to find any specific situations.  I 2 box a lot and I will usually cast malo, slow, dot, and send pet and switch back to my Monk to kick some booty!  What I want to do is have a repeating Canni IV hotkey like I have with the other canni's to regen mana while monk is beating mobs down.  Does anyone have the /pause ##, /cast # down so it will work with IV?  I have tried literally 50+ combos with the pause and have only gotten &quot;you have not recovered&quot; message.  <br />
Any help would be great.  And I apologize if I missed it somewhere.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

The timing of the  canni IV is so painful its worth getting a horse or just using stoicism and canbalizing at this point. Before with Canni II and III it took 1.25 secs to cast it and 2.25 seconds for refresh (or 1.5 secs to be off and still work)  With Canni IV the cast time is 2.5 sec and it takes 3 seconds to  refresh (or about one half second to be off and still work).  You macro pauses have to be longer and with good timing you should be able to hit most  times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I stopped dancing once I got CannIV. I found I could only get the extra sit manna a fairly low percentage of the time. I bought a drogmoor and never looked back. I would simply chain canni till I was low enoughh to warrant a Kragg and heal back up. CannV and Torpor/Q change all that but that is a different topic alltogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Ronax I will try that when I get home!  If I was just playing my Shaman solo it wouldn't be and issue but I like to take it back to the Monk when in fights so I need the canni cast for mana regen while I'm on the other toon   :) <br />
<br />
Hope it works!<br />

I looked at  Ronax post too... the only thing I got to say about it is that it doesn't have sit command... so it assumes you are on a horse or lizard (Unless I missed something).<br />
So if I was going to rewrite something like that multiple times... I would do something like:<br />
<br />
/cast #, /pause 25, /sit on, /pause 35<br />
/cast #, /pause 25, /sit on, /pause 35<br />
/cast #, /pause 25, /sit on, /pause 35<br />
/cast #, /pause 25, /sit on, /pause 35<br />
/cast #</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I quit canni-dancing when I got Canni 4 ... it just seems more efficient to me to stand and chain-cast. Believe me, canni-dancing was a HARD habit to break. I don't have a horse, I doubt I will for awhile yet.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />

/cast #, /pause 25, /sit on, /pause 35<br />
/cast # <br />
<br />
So far as I know you can only do one action per command line in a hotkey.  So to get 5 casts out of one button push you would skip the sit command and just remain standing.  If you include a sit, which I wouldn't recommend for a number of reasons, you would only get 3 casts from one button push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blackke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No worries.....the /pause 55, /cast # worked like a charm! :D <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help guys.  I sit on my Leezurd whenever possible anyway so the sit is not a concern.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

You should go back and try it again now that we can see the mana numbers.  That plus the &quot;auto-stand when casting&quot; ability makes it much easier to Cannidance.  Reduces your canni time by about ~30%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I promise you, my post is about Macroing cannidancing.  Let me give you a brief history first.  I got used to hitting '3' on my hotbutton to sit and stand, I was able to put things like forage, sense heading, or /loc and do them each time I sat/stood.  I was frustrated that I could only cannidance 2 or 3 times in a macro even after the autostand command upon casting:<br />
<br />
example 1:<br />
/pause #, /cast 7<br />
/pause #, /sit<br />
/pause #, /cast 7<br />
/pause #, /sit<br />
/cast 7<br />
<br />
I had tried to cast 5 times and manually sit while casting using a macro like this:<br />
<br />
example 2:<br />
/pause #, /cast 7<br />
/pause #, /cast 7<br />
/pause #, /cast 7<br />
/pause #, /cast 7<br />
/cast 7<br />
<br />
But, I couldn't sit inbetween casts, because my hotbutton macro/sit thing wouldn't work.  Turns out you can run two macros at the same time, but you can do the keystroke to sit.  I never used Cntrl-S, so I mapped that in my options menu to the '.' key on my keypad.  Now I use the example 2 macro, and hit '.' to sit inbetween casts.<br />
<br />
Three cavets with hotbuttons that tooke me a while to figure out and others may find useful:<br />
<br />
1)  If you put a /pause and a /command in the same line, the pause ALWAYS occurs AFTER the line, never before.  (aka, EQ responds to them like a stack instead of a queue)<br />
<br />
Example 3:<br />
/say Hello World,<br />
/pause 100, /say this is a...<br />
/say test!<br />
<br />
If those three lines were in a macro, the following would happen:<br />
<br />
Uber_Shaman_01 says, 'Hello World,'<br />
Uber_Shaman_01 says, 'this is a...'<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt; 10 second pause &gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
Uber_Shaman_01 says, 'test!'<br />
<br />
2)  If a hotbutton macro was started, and its long and a group member decided to pull 3-4 mobs to camp... you don't have to duck out of the spells that are macroed and 'fight' with yourself to cast what you really want to cast.  Just have a hotbutton that is short or does almost nothing, and click on it from the macro tab  (the place you create macros to drag to your hotbutton bar).  A macro started from here will immediatly stop any macro currently started.  If you overwrite a long one with a short one, it effectivly stops the long one in progress.<br />
<br />
3)  The pet window that has the 'Pet attack' button is not useless.  If you are in the middle of a macro (aka cannidance) you can still sic your pet on things using this, if you don't want to type /pet attack.  As stated before, you can't use a hotbutton macro if one is already in progress.<br />
<br />
Hope this made sense and is useful to someone.  :)</div></div><hr />
