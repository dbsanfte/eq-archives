<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone that thinks BST have no purpose, or are not powerful are completely and utterly ignorant. I am so totally jealous of the class, and am considering switching mains to one because they are so brokenly powerful. Do some research.<br />
<br />
65% slow<br />
Block Skill<br />
9hp/9mana regen group buff<br />
Regrowth<br />
Shaman level 50's HP talisman<br />
+STA buffs<br />
225hp +ATK group buff<br />
Paragon of Spirit AA(1200HP and 450MANA healed over time, group, mana-free, 12 min reuse)<br />
Stonestance disc<br />
Pet + them nuking/melee WAY &gt; monk DPS<br />
<br />
So let's see....they can slow almost as well as me, buff just as well as me, can survive aggro MUCH better than me, don't have to bother healing people, get to beat on stuff, their gear matters(cos they're a melee) and I don't have to cannibalize cos I have a passive mana regen buff? Why the **** am I playing a shaman? Not to mention all their spells are bug-free and are VENDOR BOUGHT. The reason this class is so cool and well balanced is cos SONY made them, not Verant. Cya on the other side.</div></div><hr />

Also, keep in mind that that 65% slow is a RUNE TURN IN.  Not bought in FV at 51.  And they have no resist debuff, so it's harder for them to land it than it is for us to land slow.  People all over message boards like to bitch about how they'll never have 63, 64, or 65 spells, yet it's curiously ignored on these threads.  Isn't that special?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yea , i have to agree here , you are suffering from a serious case of class envy , BST or not overpowered , they are where they need to be.                                                                    They used to be completly broken and now they bring enough to the table where they are atleast not turned away from guilds and groups. They cant debuff for their slows , that alone is a big deal , a great deal of their spells are shaman spells from 15+ levels after we get them, so they are useless with a shaman in group/raid.<br />
<br />
I think if you think BST are so great (nothing wrong with that ) you should go level one then make a true choice on what is better. i have leveled one and gave him up for my shaman , just like every single class in this game. There is no better class then the shaman IMHO</div></div><hr />

I'm a 65 shaman with plenty of AA, my guild is breaking in Elementals soon. I have 3800hps and 4444mana unbuffed, so it's not like I'm some retard without a clue. Trust me, they are like shaman, just with the fun parts of EQ added in. (And the annoying parts out.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On top of everything thats been mentioned, the one really annoying thing to me about Bst are the epic.  There epic is a carbon copy of the ranger epic except the slow proc is 5% better and it provides 50more hp.  This, as a ranger, I can live with.  What I really dislike is a Bst can get there epic in a day with 1-2groups.   Over half the rangers out there who have Swiftwind (haste weapon) do not have Earthcaller (slow proc weapon).  This is because the bottleneck on the Ranger epic (Shattered Emerald of Corruption) is such a rare drop in Plane of Hate (even from Innoruk) that most ranger cant get it.  On top of that, the ranger epic requires 2 Planar Raids (Hate and Sky).<br />

I don't think BST is overpowered... Their slow might be somewhat comparable but unless they get a debuff like Malo(s) their slow doesn't do all that much good.<br />
<br />
A BST that was needling me about how good he is at slowing irked me once. I told myself fine, if he thinks his slow is that good, I won't slow and let him attempt to. Oh, I also didn't debuff with Malos.<br />
<br />
Needless to say after he died 6-10 times straight from the aggro I think he learned his lesson. <br />
<br />
BST slow isn't effective unless they have someone to debuff resists.<br />
<br />
He quit bothering me after this.</div></div><hr />

You realize beastlords were only around for about a year before PoP?  Gotta figure at least 3-4 months before there are enough (and there still aren't now) level 60 ones, so really high level beastlords (not counting the ones powerlevelled, etc straight to 60) have been around 6-7 months before PoP.  I don't consider that a *long* time.</div></div><hr />

I just want to know why this is bad.  Mana isn't an issue since we are shaman.  Lowering the mob's resists to land slow and nukes/stuns/dots/etc makes sense to me, so I Malos everything in an exp group in BoT (where I am sometimes the only healer/slower/CCer with 5 melees).<br />
<br />

I started a beasty on Sullon Zek a while back not because I think they are overpowered but because they were designed for maximum fun in all aspects of the game. They have a kickass pet on par with mages, can melee very well, inherit some of our shaman spells and of course have the very nice combo mana/hp regen line that is unique to them. IMHO, they are not overpowered but just designed well to remove the tedium from the game and maximize the amount of fun of melee and spellcasting.<br />
<br />
I do however miss root and gate and my spiritstone very badly and my fur boots for insta sow and debuffs and superior dots. My heart skips a beat everytime I get a runner especially one that is sowed...my beasty will never make a good dungeon crawler like my shammy for that reason alone.<br />
<br />
Beastlords have it good but I don't see them as overpowered.</div></div><hr />

I see, so the MR of a mob is a direct reflection of the skill at which I play my class and if I use one of my class's tools to do my job I am a terrible Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exp groups ... whatever. I don't even MEM Malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm just curious now, cause I'm one of those terrible shamans.<br />
<br />
What do you do when you get a resist and get agro?  Just channel through another slow?  If that's resisted, you just try again while getting pummeled?  Maybe you stop to heal yourself?  If so I don't see why malo is a bad idea.  You're just protecting yourself from getting agro on an unslowed mob by casting a debuf.  Getting agro on an unslowed mob is just a bad idea.  No matter how leet you are, a tank can handle it better.  And not all the time Malo is necisary on XP mobs.  If I have a pally/SK for a tank, I usually don't bother if they're on the ball.  If I don't trust my cleric, I malo.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for VT, eom's and pli's are the only one's that need malo, They just tickle if you do get a rare resist compared =)  Pli's are good after tash, we got lotsa tash happy-rune-casting chanters in our guild =)  On ugly pulls in VT, setup up targets before inc.  1 shaman gets 2 tankable, other shaman gets 2 other tankable, then a ffa to slow the mezed ones.  This is far more efficient and gets stuff slowed alot faster.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your comment about calling shamans terrible if they use malos and then saying your not a troll was priceless, thanks =)  Malo isn't a use or don't use thing.  It's situational.  However, I have it mem'd 100% of the time even with my clicky necklace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no malos here .. but malo all the time .. any mob that's a blue con or higher<br />
<br />
not only does it help with slowing .. but lets your rain spells be resisted less since it debuffs poison too.. what's not to like ?<br />
<br />
of course now you could ask .. who the hell uses rain spells all the time .. I do .. all the time .. to not use our best damage source is crazy .. against the right mobs, with malo .. it's as good as a bane of nife in the fraction of the time</div></div><hr />

/dismiss Arisai<br />
<br />
I expressed a situation in which Malos is needed where this BST claimed he was just as capable at slowing as I was.<br />
<br />
Single pulls... Why not Malo(s)? Never hurts and always helps. BTW, I'm not talking about the mobs that die in 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Multiple mob pulls... Same situation. Debuffing the mob never hurts, and always helps. Why do you think Shaman would love to get an AE Malo(s) type spell?<br />
<br />
Debuffing resists isn't always necessary, but it sure doesn't hurt to do it, and I think I can safely say that I am not an inept Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I take a hit and take just as much damage in chain armor with the same AC but yet can count more forms of hp regen offered more EASILY to my class.   Why should I worry.<br />
<br />
When I with focus can chain 3.2 second + focus healing Tnarg over and over and live comparably to a over agroing Beastlord slowing in Teir 3 that goes plop in second.  Why should I even care.<br />
<br />
Someone said the above poster has explained things perfectly the way they are.  You don't know how noob the both of you sound.<br />
<br />
Side note:  Personally, I like root.  Not for CC thou it minuimally helps at time but to stop a mob from summoning and to focus on my pet.  I don't care how much the Beastlord pet taunts.  Nothing was funnier when I saw a beastlord at a bubble (cleric was in mid CH on the MT) and a quarter of life frantically trying to get away from a non-rooted summoning PoP mob for a heal.  I had the same situation but rooted and backed off and got the heal off.  The Beastlord... He JUST DIED.<br />

My shaman has more power than any second rate beastlord could ever dream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take this quote from a necro on my server:  <br />
 I zoned into cod the other night, charmed and hasted my pet (kills too slow without haste, I get bored!), then proceeded to tell it to attack everything in sight. Pulls of 3? np. Nameds? np. 70 minutes later, I had another 4 AAs, 4kpp and 15k of bazaar loot... and thats not even exceptional.. thats maybe slightly above average.<br />
<br />
Where's this &quot;great risk&quot; everyone is talking about? If you're solo, the &quot;great risk&quot; comes from the 1 minute downtime you have when you die, then the optional 1 1/2 minutes you spend getting the xp back if you can't be bothered getting the corpse ressed later. <br />

I do agree with the guy who said he Malos when warrior is in group, but in my case its only to kill some time for him to build up agro.<br />
<br />
As for the beastlord debate. Fully spelled up, they replace shamans easily in exp groups, and perhaps exceed them. Especially with a cleric in the group to heal I'd personally on my mage prefer the DPS and mana/hp regen buffs of the beastlord.</div></div><hr />

If you remember, rogues used to be the same way.  Basically, they sucked hard for a the longest time until Verant took pity on them, then suddenly they became the uberest damage dealer ever.  It's the same with beastlords, they are currently Verant's &quot;pet class&quot;.  Verant encorages you to play them by making them powerful and group friendly.<br />
<br />
They will only be nerfed down to more reasonable levels when Verant decides there are too many on the server, and that will be a long, long time.<br />
<br />
So the question I ask is &quot;Hey Shaman, how does it feel to be about as useful as a ranger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Btw I play a 61 ranger and 60 shaman (not 2-boxed).</div></div><hr />

I don't HAVE to die when my slow is resisted on a fast-hitting mob and the cleric decides to complete the CH on the MT instead of switching to me.<br />
<br />
Oh, and anyone who doesn't use malo except on boss mobs is being nasty to the robes in their group.  Mages and wizards just can't get enough of this bear in their groups because EVERY nuke and EVERY wave of EVERY rain lands for full damage.  Even if there IS tash on the mob, if I malo, they do more damage, and the mage doesn't have to mala -- better that mage spends their time and mana doing damage and killing faster.<br />
<br />
Lazy frickin bears.  Once slow is on, we're not the superstars anymore.  Casting malo isn't segzy, it's not spectacular, nobody's gonna say &quot;woah, man, NICE malo!!&quot;  but you know, it's got class.<br />

Of course, my RL mate is a mage now, so I get intimate and nuke-by-nuke reports on how much malo is helping out (yes, even with tash) - so I guess I've got an informational advantage.</div></div><hr />

Yep, BST is a fun class.  I'd say I've had more fun with my 60 BST than any other class I've played.  On the other hand, now that I've grouped with a lot of Shaman in the last year or so and gotten a taste of Shaman spells as a Beastlord - I'm having a great time working up my Frog Shaman.<br />

FIRST Beastlords are not nearly as good at buffing. Not even close. You can get near the stat increase, but after you have cast 6 spells on each character in the group you will very quickly tire of this. I tend to avoid groups where I am going to have to buff endlessly as it is simply a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
SECOND beastlords were indeed *** for a long time. 6-7 months may not seem a long time for you, but when you are a joke class it seems like an eternity. I set aside my Beastlord for an extended period as it was just too depressing to play.<br />
<br />
THIRD I have been hunting in the elemental planes for a while, in BoT and tactics etc and never once gotten a rune. Sha's revenge (65% Beastlord slow) has not been in the bazaar for quite a while and I am not high up on the list to get it from the guild - funnily enough guilds don't see the value in using a rune on a 65% slow. Yes, there is a big difference in the 65% slow shaman bought at level 51 and the 65 Beastlord rune hand in. Maybe not in 12 months time, but I expect Sony to fix other aspects of shaman (ie dots) by that time.<br />

As if all shamans don't know how that is. Personally considering the group buffs you get, the single target ones you would be casting are Talisman, Infusion, Stamina, and Haste. Thats pretty much a normal thing for me. Lets face it though, shaman buffs are gimp, stat buffs are predominately a waste. Id trade my agi dex  stam and str buffs for your mana/hp regen and long lasting attk buff any day.<br />

<br />
To get close you need dex and str as well... Infusion doesn't quite cut it alone. As a shaman I buff with group focus and group stamina and maybe haste as well, although I was leaving that out as a non stat buff.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to trade the stat buffs, they would only get you the hp and atk buff that is overwritten by BSS and SoT. For the mana/hp regen buff you'll have to trade malo/malos line and all your healing greater than chloroblast (including torpor and quiesence)   :D <br />
<br />

Yep. I agree that a fully spelled Beastlord is more than comparable to a 51st shaman with a store brought spell.<br />

<br />
<br />
YES, even if the tank is doing his job.  I can outdamage a beastlord using Rains (casting fury) + JBB.  And woah, what a concept I have a pet too as a shaman.  <br />
<br />
Tappion Zek, what you hate being wrong here?<br />
<br />
Unless a mob mitigates slow.<br />
<br />
Nope noob, You sure, you know anything about the high end game.  My slow is still better than a beastlord even when slow is mitigated. <br />
<br />
Tappion Zek, thats twice your wrong.<br />
<br />
I hate to say it but shaman heals suck, they may be better then beastlords, but I'd still rather have a druid healer with beastlord mana regen buffs.<br />
<br />
So my heals ARE better than beastlords.  <br />
And why you bring up druids?  Oh yeah because you can't think of anything else and druids ain't worth their salt in a exp group in the higher tier planes.  Me thinks you are even in Tier two planes yet.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah Tappion Zek, Tnarg is a 3.2 second spell for me using focus.  I don't have problems chaining it.  And I did see a beastlord go plop where I was able to heal through it as the MT got his CH from the cleric.  Gave me the best laugh and this beastlord had better gear and more AAs then me.<br />
<br />
Cause we all know groups get shamans for their ability to run and hide.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else love the way Tappion can't handle a statement so he make half witted remarks.  To dodge that he wrong.<br />
<br />
Sorry to break it too you Tappion but Utility has controlled fights, won fights, saved other members in the party besides me.  <br />
And just between you and me I know I am NOT USELESS like the BST is in the scenarios in which a member in the group is below a bub of hp or caster is over aggroed against a summoning mob.  Some one has to stop the mob from summoning or do a fast heal other than torpor.  Oh yeah that person CAN be me with root or Tnarg.  Can't be the beastlord thou LOL he don't get neither.<br />
<br />
Tappion this is where you come in and make a pathetic, sad comment like well if everything was going perfect like in my perfect world the MT would always no matter what have sole aggro and no one would ever fall beneath a bubble of hp with a  good cleric.<br />
<br />
LOL, Tappion quite a fantasy world huh?  Now get your multiple posting names going and cry up me a storm.<br />
<br />
Because there is no doubt in my mind I am FAR MORE POWERFUL than any Beastlord Pft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">There's only two ways a shaman is better than a beastlord.  <br />
1) Healing<br />
2) Mob Control<br />
<br />
In all other respects, beastlords are <br />
1) better<br />
2) more useful<br />
3) don't compare along the same lines<br />
<br />
However, healing and mob control are two of the most essential skills for a support caster to have.  Beastlords have weak healing and really no form of mob control other than letting their pet tank adds.  They compare a lot to a mage in this regard.  <br />
<br />
Let's put it like this . . . if you had a choice to &quot;Multiclass&quot; tomorrow and:<br />
1) Upgrade melee<br />
2) get a new useful manaregen buff<br />
3) upgrade pet to do more DPS, and have more hps<br />
<br />
But in exchange you would have to:<br />
1) give up Malo<br />
2) give up Tnargs, Kraggs, Torpor, Stoicism, and Quiescence forever.  <br />
3) give up Focus and downgrade to 50% haste buff.<br />
4) downgrade slow 10%<br />
5) Give up all DoTs and nukes post 54. <br />
6) Give up the ability to Gate<br />
7) Give up the ability to cast a Root spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would it be worth the trade?  If you say &quot;Yes&quot; then you are ready to switch to a beastlord.  However, if you covet control over situations over and above DPS, you should stick with shaman.  <br />
<br />
After careful consideration, I am convinced that Beastlords are balanced.  I still think shamans need work.  Some kinda useful added ability that would actually get used in a group/raid situation.  Kinda like mages got CoH, necros got SC2, that kinda thing.</div></div><hr />

Don't get so riled up, no need to call names. Yes druids 4k complete heal can replace a cleric in exp groups, <br />
<br />
When you read my comment about our healing vs. beastlord healing, the may wasn't meant as a perhaps.<br />
<br />
Beastlords have been parsing near 140 dps+, I don't see shamans able to do their other jobs and do the dps at the same time while I feel beastlords can.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope noob, You sure, you know anything about the high end game. My slow is still better than a beastlord even when slow is mitigated. <br />
<br />
Tappion Zek, thats twice your wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
When going by purely a data sense, yes our slow is better by a few %, but when mitigated, especially the higher mitigation, groups will suffer perhaps one extra round tops if a beastlord or chanter was slowing. This to me really doesn't make our slow better in terms of helping the group preform more efficiently.</div></div><hr />

1.  Druids hardly hold group slots and when they do even if you drop to tier 2 planes MT whine that the druid heal spell is too little.  The Primary time I see druids in what appears to be a group is more and more a charm group or duo.<br />
<br />
2.  Tappion Zek what do think I do in an exp group?   <br />
a. send in Dogdog then Malo<br />
b. slow<br />
then sit around till the fight is over?  <br />
No, I cast Rains and JBB.  Whats more I take little aggro based on how rains work.<br />
<br />
Here is some math:<br />
Tears of Saryn does 650 damage a wave.  On average I get one crit every wave.  The times I get 2 crits rock.  Malo does reduce resists.<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryn is a 6 sec casting time spell and 12 seconds (for the 3 waves and recast time) during the 12 second time a JBB proc can easily be triggered.<br />
<br />
An Average Tears of Saryn for me:<br />
1300<br />
650<br />
650<br />
<br />
JBB:<br />
263  <br />
<br />
My Total Average damage in 18 seconds from spells alone:<br />
2863<br />
<br />
MY DPS = 2863 damage / 18 seconds = 159  ~ damage per a sec<br />
<br />
I could factor our dogdog in to the DPS but:<br />
<br />
MY AVERAGE Shaman DPS 159 &gt; Your preposed Highest Beastlord &amp; his pet of 140 DPS<br />
<br />
Then after Tears of Saryn refresh do I worry about aggro such as that generated by one of my dots no because Rains don't work that way and I immediately recast Tears of Saryn without fear.<br />
<br />
BST is balanced and where it should be second best to a LOT of things shamans already provide to a group.</div></div><hr />

Tears of Saryn is a 6 sec casting time spell and 12 seconds (for the 3 waves and recast time) during the 12 second time a JBB proc can easily be triggered.<br />
<br />
An Average Tears of Saryn for me:<br />
1300<br />
650<br />
650<br />
<br />
JBB:<br />
263  <br />
<br />
My Total Average damage in 18 seconds from spells alone:<br />
2863<br />
<br />
MY DPS = 2863 damage / 18 seconds = 159  ~ damage per a sec<br />
<br />
I could factor our dogdog in to the DPS but:<br />
<br />
MY AVERAGE Shaman DPS 159 &gt; Your preposed Highest Beastlord &amp; his pet of 140 DPS<br />

<br />
Nuking doesn't really turn out to that DPS even if you crit'd 1/3 of the time....  sure, your DPS while casting that 1 spell is 159dps over 18 seconds.  However That's not sustainable continual DPS.   If a mob lasts 23 seconds, your DPS drops down to 124.  Add onto that the fact that you have to slow a mob, add another 5 seconds and down to 102, If you canny at all, you go down more.  If a rain is about to land when the mob is almost dead, it gets resisted and DPS goes down more.  That's not even figuring in mana considerations.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, spell DPS equated like that != mele dps.  Even if you got a crit 1/3 of the time, you're average DPS would be lower than a BST imho<br />
<br />
Dot's are only viable for DPS in a group lacking DPS.  If a mob lasts for 45 seconds after slow, then sure it helps, but this is not a rocking group.<br />
<br />
In my opinion We have no spells that increase our DPS viably in a *Good* group.  It used to piss me off, now I just pull for my groups to raise the groups DPS.  I usually get another mob to camp around when the first mob is at 30-20, root it if he's hitting hard, or just have the tank taunt it off me while the rest of the group finishes the first.  It's also great on the clerics mana since the puller is self-healing 90% of the time and every mob at the camp is pre-slowed.  Once a mob is at camp, cripple it, heal up and grab another.  Canny as needed.  Also far more entertaining than sitting on a horse and casting rain and watching resist messages =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Bst's are great, add alot to a group, and can slow for groups.  Hell, bards can slow for groups.  Shamans are no longer powerhouses we were when slow + torpor &gt; *.  However, it's the durability, flexibility and endurance of the shaman that I like.  Not the DPS, not the buffs, not the slow.  We're a good combo at the moment, even if we're not the gods we were.</div></div><hr />

Hey I gave you my personal average.  <br />
<br />
1.  Hell I did not include my pet dogdog where the BST was.<br />
<br />
2.  Furthermore, I did not include if I had more than one crit which at times I do.<br />
<br />
3.  And lets remember its EASIER doing uber Spell damage than it is for a Beastlord to get his hands on uber God weapons that give him his best all time high of 140 DPS.  <br />
<br />
4.  If your going to bring up casting time of slow then it takes just as much time and lose of DPS for a beastlord to land slow with out us in the group.  So your point on the casting time of slow is moot.<br />
<br />
5.  If we are going to include resists why not include misses from the Beastlord or his pet.<br />
<br />
Please you can paint this anyway you like we do out damage BST if we want too.  And I'll tell you another thing it isn't that hard either.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, With 3 crits + JBB(during wave and recast) + dogdog I have a high DPS of 233.  <br />
<br />
If we were to go into my all time shaman high of 233 DPS at least it puts the beastlords all time high of 140 DPS to shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">5.  If we are going to include resists why not include misses from the Beastlord or his pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Say you are kidding me, please... :confused: <br />
<br />
A melee DPS figure ALWAYS includes MISSES. DPS = Damage Per Second</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">The entire reason I brought that sentence up was because someone tried to make it seem like you ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE MALOS to slow mobs, and therefore BST slow was totally useless. I personally only Malos boss mobs, and never need Malos for anything else. So really the BST has no more problem landing a slow than me. <br />
<br />
I mean no offense here but I have to disagree. If you are xping some place like KC or FG I'll believe you that you don't need malo to slow. But if you are xping in PoP, someplace like Tactics, BoT or Sol Ro; then you aren't slowing without malo. Some mobs I get lucky and slow without a malo, but I've seriously bounced 4 or 5 slows off mobs before while testing the mobs MR. I also think that you should malo to be nice to your casters. They want to do damage, malo helps them do more damage and you gain xp faster. Then there is the aggro, do you get much aggro from chain casting slow on xp mobs and getting resists? How does your MT and cleric feel about that? Malo + slow = easy slow with no aggro. That's playing smart imo.<br />
<br />
The very idea of calling someone a bad shaman because they malo xp mobs makes me think you are still xping in KC. I say if you don't malo mobs in xp groups you're the bad shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Hey I gave you my personal average.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Logs please.  I'll believe it when you post logs where you're casting tears once or twice *every* mob and criting 1/3 of the time with no resists.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  Hell I did not include my pet dogdog where the BST was.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ok, pet is 21 dps lets say.  realistic number.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Furthermore, I did not include if I had more than one crit which at times I do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hehe, nor did you include the times where you have 2 resists.<br />

<br />
3.  And lets remember its EASIER doing uber Spell damage than it is for a Beastlord to get his hands on uber God weapons that give him his best all time high of 140 DPS.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
True, no doubt there.  However I'd bet *sustianed* dps wise, even an average bst will outdmg us.<br />
<br />
<br />
4.  If your going to bring up casting time of slow then it takes just as much time and lose of DPS for a beastlord to land slow with out us in the group.  So your point on the casting time of slow is moot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
True.  However bst pet is doing more dmg durring this time than ours, but yes, moot point.  Fizzles, not getting all 3 rains to land due to resists or low hp's or casting a rain and having the mob die before it lands are *far* from moot.  But you can gloss over that, its cool =)<br />
<br />
<br />
5.  If we are going to include resists why not include misses from the Beastlord or his pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
lol, dmg per second = dmg per second, resists and misses are factored in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please you can paint this anyway you like we do out damage BST if we want too.  And I'll tell you another thing it isn't that hard either.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, With 3 crits + JBB(during wave and recast) + dogdog I have a high DPS of 233.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just curious.  Do you think a shaman is capable of a sustained DPS of 160 clocked from time of engagement to death for an hour or 2 of camping?   sure you can hit 160 DPS, but that is not your sustained DPS. <br />
<br />
<br />
If we were to go into my all time shaman high of 233 DPS at least it puts the beastlords all time high of 140 DPS to shame.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell, lets not stop there, lets load up all our poison and disease dots, epic and chain cast tears of saryn and Torrent of poison.  I bet you could reach close to 400dps.  <br />
<br />
But to make your group kill faster, sustained DPS is all that matters regardless of what numbers were talking.  Casting a rain every fight helps.   Getting 400dps 1 fight and then cannying for 3 obviously doesn't.  I'm of the opinion that our sustained DPS is far below most classes.  <br />
<br />
What I was eluding to in my previous post is that most rogues in a group over an hour have probably 80dps(making up numbers to make a point).  While a mob is at camp, he's probably close to 120dps.  I've been in groups where we drop mobs incredibly fast.  To the point that getting the next mob was taking longer than killing the mob. So what I guess my point is that maxing the DPS in your group requires mobs at the camp 24/7.  99% of mele pullers won't pull another until the first is dead.  Shamans do this the best in my opinion because we don't need to med, and we don't do very good sustained DPS.  Shamans increase DPS of the group and reduce DPS of mobs.  You can further increase your DPS by chain-pulling. <br />
<br />
But that's how I like to play my shaman, pretending to be a wizard makes me sad.</div></div><hr />

But I gave you my average and it is well within specification and limitations and draw backs.  But because I am lvl 65 and use MALOS you do tend see less resists.  But there are some shaman I see out there that think using malos is a waste of time... thats too bad.<br />

I'm talking PoV, Tactics, CoD, etc. I definately got all the gear in my magelo exping in KC. The point I was making with that post was that Malos is not required at all to slow. I never said Malos was a worthless spell, I just said if you're casting it on every mob ever, then you're wasting your time.<br />

I think you missed the point in defence of your 159 DPS which you are getting.     However, that is not sustained DPS.  Spikes in DPS mean nothing.  nukes are spike DPS if you're only calulating it over the time it takes to cast them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't really care about logs, but LOOK at it, your not getting 1 crit every cast and you are getting resists.  I'm a Malos shaman, I use it frequently. it's added security on slow.  It is nice for resists, but it doesn't eliminate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Tappion Zek so NOW you say 140 DPS is an actually average damage for the BST + pet.  Logs please because that is more damage than some mages and Best equip full AAed rogues claim to do.  <br />
<br />
Me thinks your making it up.<br />
<br />
talas213... are you 65th level yet.  Because level ALSO makes a difference with resists.   And yes I tend to get at least a crit with casting fury III in most waves.  Do you even have casting Fury III, Seriously?!<br />
<br />
Demisius and talas213 even spikes and miniums have an average throughout the fights.  Besides in your better exp group cases you know the ones with caster such as mages, wizards or druids also use wave damage in a fight which lasts less than 30 seconds easily.<br />
<br />
My Spikes of damage are more than enough to put the little MELEE beastlord DPS in a limited time to shame.   <br />
<br />
***I have even seen where the mob has come to the melees the 3 mages and myself(shaman) Rain in our group, Our waves with most already have loads of AA experience leave LITTLE to no time for melee DPS to occur.***<br />
<br />
I personally think these case of beastlord envy are coming from shamans that are just starting a beastlord and find it easier to level.  BUT HAVE NO IDEA YET OF HOW THE UPPER GAME PLAYS OUT FOR THEIR BEASTLORD.<br />
<br />
So come on, show me some proof about YOUR newly created beastlords that are already 65th level, have all their rune spells, and have their Fenn Ro uber weapons that allow them to 140 DPS+ damage.  Show me the revilation you all have had because so far all I have seen a number that your JUST throwing around and backing up with no really stat or even a theory.  Don't tell me what you fabricate or what your guessing on show, me some proof or even a theory.  Oh wait maybe you'll use your Beastlord 12 minute refresh 65th level equivalent torpor.  LOL<br />

Don't have any experience as a 65th beastlord probably.  And not even a theory on how this fabricated beastlord does his damage.  You just want me to believe you.  Your dreaming...  Give me some name of weapons, or damage in spells they use, give me some stat on weapons at least... give me something work with.

Oh and I generally malos everything, I simply assist of the puller and have malos casting on inc so it lands a second or so after the assigned tank engages the mob in question.

Tnargs is nice, but the agro on it is funny.  A puller pulled one of the pseudo-named undead around caprin and I healed him when he was inc cause he was really low hp's... So obviously he came and smacked me around.  That doesn't surprise me.  I then chain casted tnargs to stay up, and kept agro until the guy was at 10% health.  I'm sure our tanks were being a little lasy with the taunt, but still.   Tnargs can keep you up when youre getting beat on in teir 2 some 3 mobs from what I've found.  It's also great for getting a mob off of a CoD enchanter while keeping him alive =)<br />
<br />
<br />
And gagnar, your still trying to compare your spike dps to sustained dps.  Until you understand the argument that these 2 values are not equal, this is a more-so-than-usual-useless-argument-on-the-internet.<br />

<br />
65% slow<br />
Block Skill<br />
9hp/9mana regen group buff<br />
Regrowth<br />
Shaman level 50's HP talisman<br />
+STA buffs<br />
225hp +ATK group buff<br />
Paragon of Spirit AA(1200HP and 450MANA healed over time, group, mana-free, 12 min reuse)<br />
Stonestance disc<br />
Pet + them nuking/melee WAY &gt; monk DPS<br />
<br />
So let's see....they can slow almost as well as me, buff just as well as me, can survive aggro MUCH better than me, don't have to bother healing people, get to beat on stuff, their gear matters(cos they're a melee) and I don't have to cannibalize cos I have a passive mana regen buff? Why the **** am I playing a shaman? Not to mention all their spells are bug-free and are VENDOR BOUGHT. The reason this class is so cool and well balanced is cos SONY made them, not Verant. Cya on the other side.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm lets see last time I checked 75% is better then 65%.<br />
Vendor bought spell is better then rune spell.<br />
<br />
Canni &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Spiritual Whatever<br />
<br />
Replenishment &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regrowth + Spiritual Whatever<br />
<br />
Our buffs &gt;&gt;&gt; Beastlords period.  We have all that they do plus more.<br />
<br />
THe 225 hp/atk buff doesnt stack with pally or ranger buffs.<br />
<br />
Paragon of Spirit is a nice toy but doesnt really improve overall efficiency very much.<br />
<br />
Dps is better then monk but they can't pull so I would take monk over them if I needed good puller.  Or mage if I didnt.<br />
<br />
Gear matters for all classes. A beastlord is never expected to take agro so I fail to see why their gear is more important than ours.<br />
<br />
They cannot handle agro better then a shaman because they dont have maloxxx, that's a retarded argument.  When a beastlords 65% slow bounces off a BoT named and he gets agro his disc or AA's will not save him.  There is absolutely no way a beastlord would be able to slow a named in BoT period unless there was a shaman or chanter debuffing first, which defeats the purpose of the beastlord slowing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are beastlords a good class, hell yes.  They provide good utility with almost top notch dps to boot.  That's the role they have.  They arent gonna be taking shamans' places in groups however.  Your research shows raw data rather then showing how they really put it to use.</div></div><hr />

Level 65 Beastlords easily pull 140 sustained dps. I can't link you the parses as the eqbeastlord forums are down atm (or I can't access them either one). When I had my Beastlord parsed the results were as follows fighting at WW in the desert of PoV:<br />
<br />
Beastlord melee average: 67dps - WLK main and epic secondary<br />
Beastlord Spell Damage: 25dps - procs and 2 nukes (frost spear and ice shard) only<br />
Warder Melee average: 58dps<br />
Warder proc damage: 15dps - Spirit of rellic average 4.5 procs a fight<br />
<br />
Relevant buffs: VoQ, SoV, FoSo, Frenzy, SV, SD.<br />
Relevant aa: Paragon, BF5, CF1.<br />
Relevant conditions: Paladin tanking and attacking from rear, monk pulling.<br />
<br />
My gear is pretty average for my level as you can tell by the weapons, yet I could sustain this sort of damage all day. If I lost SoV I could self buff celerity for a small drop in dps and without VoQ I could drop back to one nuke to 1.5 nukes a fight.<br />
<br />
If a Shaman could continually outdamage a Beastlord I would say there is something seriously wrong given the utility of a shaman via heals, debuff and buffing. The way I see it the classes are very well balanced against each other and make for a great team together. Given some of the recent changes, the only real aspect shaman's need fixing is dots. A dot with the same or less efficiency than nukes is pretty lame.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Yeah, I'm glad to know that I'm still defined by a 51 spell. That just shows the class has stagnated.<br />
<br />
As for the buff thing. Stat buffs are largely worthless, you saying you'd need to add strength and dex ontop of infusion is retarded. Oh and to the stacking issues, since when does being overwritten devalue the buff?<br />
<br />
As to Whoraz, I don't care for beastlords, but debates are fun ^^<br />
<br />
Personally I like having max dex, and I know a number of melee and archers that want it maxxed too. Strength adds a little bit to ATK so people like maxxing that too for the highest ATK rating - not saying it greatly helps or anything, just that people ask for them.<br />
<br />
As to the buffs not stacking, The whole SoT,BSS/BMB and SV love triangle sucks. The only time I ever cast SV on a raid is when there is no pally there. And then I have to cast it dozens of times as rangers just love to cast SoT just to annoy the Beastlords out there. :) The buff itself isn't devalued in itself, it just has less applications than apparent.<br />
<br />
First off, I have a high level Beastlord and I do a lot of research of the classes I play.<br />
<br />
My apologies if I misunderstood you, I guess I read this the wrong way. Research is one thing but it doesn't do justice to the experience.<br />

She,<br />
<br />
so added up your BST does about 165 Damage Per Second in a fight, LOL.<br />
<br />
Beastlord melee average: 67dps <br />
Beastlord Spell Damage: 25dps - procs and 2 nukes (frost spear and ice shard) only<br />
<br />
Relevant buffs: SoV<br />
<br />
Tell me how much melee DPS are you doing during casting those nukes.  Oh yeah ZERO<br />
So  that subtracts either melee 67 DPS or aboutst 25 dps from you over all average Damage Per Second.   <br />
<br />
Making your Really DPS something like this 140 DPS.  But I still don't have a log and the poster above is talking about :( *sigh mobs in 'PoV' a .......tier 2 plane.<br />
<br />
I could have included when you cast slow right before the fight but I figure I slow too.<br />
<br />
Now lets look at what I said before if I am shaman that has a SUSTAINED and AVERAGE damage of 159 DPS WITHOUT my pet.  I am still outdamaging any Beastlord DPS.<br />
<br />
Demisius saying that my Average DPS is not a 'sustained' damage is stupid for I am chaining my damage so where is the lose?  The possible DPS lose is, oh yeah, like the last 6 seconds at most at the end of the fight big whoop.  <br />
<br />
When with my Average DPS being 159 and dogdogs is 36 dps I don't have much to fear from a beastlords+pet dps of ONLY 140.<br />
<br />
When it comes to my AVERAGE spell damage<br />
A.   I do USE Malos unlike some ppl that say it is useless too.<br />
B.   My level further reduces resists<br />
C.   I have max Dex<br />
D.   Casting Fury 3 (so I am pretty use to seeing at least one crit in my THREE waves.)  <br />
E.   And I don't need Speed of Vallon from an enchanter to get higher Melee DPS unlike a beastlord.  <br />
But if you want to introduce SoV into the mix from an enchanter then VoQ, Canni5, max FFT items are more than enough for me to keep up my AVERAGE sustained DPS from EASY TO FIND Spells.<br />
<br />
I still stand by the fact I do Sustain and Outdamage a Beastlord when every I feel like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">So I am sitting here and thinking how could my DPS be anywhere near as bad as a Beastlords.  How can I tone it even further down to show these crying beastlords that they are still second best at everything when it comes to their parent class; us Shamans.   <br />
<br />
Even if I chaining Tears of Saryn+JBB and get one resist and NO CRITs<br />
<br />
I am still cranking about 123 DPS with ease.<br />
<br />
650    1st wave<br />
650    2nd wave<br />
resist  3rd wave<br />
263 &lt;-- JBB<br />
<br />
1563 damage all in 18 seconds<br />
1563/18 = 86.3  DPS<br />
<br />
86.3 spell damage plus Dogdog DPS of 36 = 122.8 DPS<br />
<br />
Even during my downing periods I as a Shaman good general good DPS compared to a Beastlord in his best group scenario consisting of SoV from enchanter and Main Pally tank and monk pft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Gagner, do you understand parsing ?<br />
<br />
First you talk about misses, then about spells...his DPS figure is taken AFTER the fight and it shows whatever happened in this timeframe. So the ****ing melee DPS factors in whatever he does(misses, spell casting, sitting on his ass and not engaging, whatever).<br />
<br />
Gag, are you the only Shaman on earth who doesn't need to cast that sweet spell to regain mana ? Is you Cannibalize an innate ability ?<br />
<br />
You cast:<br />
<br />
Malos(400)<br />
Turgur's(250)<br />
Tears x2(900)<br />
<br />
You spend 1550 mana. Let's assume you have SCM3 and actually canni once between every tear and JBB cast(Tear will refresh before you are done with both btw), you'd spend about 1200 mana per mob. So assuming your exp fights last 1 minute and you have a downtime of 45 seconds before the next pull is incoming, i am also assuming you only cast 2 Tears per fight since a 3rd one would not be nearly as efficient(this alone will make your DPS drop btw).<br />
<br />
So for **** and giggles, let's calculate this.<br />
<br />
You spend 1100 mana every minute and then have 45 seconds to regain some mana. Here i am being generous with your mana regen:<br />
<br />
8x canni = 656<br />
7x VoQ = 126<br />
7x 21 = 154<br />
7x Nine = 56<br />
7x Chorus 168<br />
<br />
So Thot's super shaman could regen 1160 of the 1200 mana with Bard's, Druid's, Chanter's + perfectly timed Cannies AND assuming you would only cast 2 Tears per fight and STILL do 86,3 DPS(this is totally dreaming, sicne every mob would have to die within 30 secs. No group with 30 sec kill time will wait 45 seconds for the next mob). <br />
<br />
Know what's funny ? Not even this ficticious super shaman would be able to keep up with the mana expenditure...</div></div><hr />

A.  Do you understand I have no log go by and I have to believe.. What his parse of what looks to be a made up parse on a teir 2 mob? <br />

B.  Do you realize yes, Spell casting does affect a beastlord Melee DPS because they are doing None, zero, ziltch during casting time making his constant melee dps questionable.<br />
 <br />
C.  Do you realize that the couple last seconds of a battle make no difference for that is when LAST hit AAs kick in or someone does a bit nuke to finish the fight to look that extra special.<br />
<br />
D.  Do you realize with EASY and pretty bad DAMN Luck a 65 shaman and pet can maintain at least 123 DPS if they wish.<br />

This has nothing do with &quot;Thott's shaman Leet powah graphs.&quot;  This only has to do with pride in your class and not turning your back to play a lesser one.<br />
<br />
Sorry, if I have pride in my class.<br />
<br />
Yeah, VoQ, Canni 5, and FFT items do give me more than enough mana.  <br />
<br />
Gia,<br />
<br />
But how would you know...  it seems you stated you would rather die than channel or waste mana on a possible 2.6 second 1500 heal to save your life.<br />
<br />
Giac are you also a shaman that changes over to a So Leet beastlord which doesn't think Malos is needed?<br />
<br />
Beast is still &lt; shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">This only has to do with pride in your class <br />
<br />
I agree with you here as it obviously has nothing to do with facts or reality. But hey bro whatever floats your boat. Peak DPS and Sustained DPS are very different things. <br />
<br />
In a group setting a beastlord is going to do more DPS than a shaman on average throughout the course of the fight unless the shaman is tanking due to agro. It is entirely possible for a shaman to out DPS a 1337105|) for a brief period of time, but will fall behind again during the mana regaining stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Yeah, VoQ, Canni 5, and FFT items do give me more than enough mana.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Of course VoQ, canni 5 and FT 15 would give more than enough mana since this combination makes you not even regen 70 mana per tick, while the super shaman i pictured regened closed to 170 mana per tick(and he would still go oom if he'd put out 86,2 DPS)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
But how would you know...  it seems you stated you would rather die than channel or waste mana on a possible 2.6 second 1500 heal to save your life.<br />

<br />
Actually it seems as if your reading comprehension is lacking. I just stated that i have a hard time channeling a Tnarg's against an unslowed HoH guard(only a tier 3 exp mob btw). <br />
<br />
<br />
Giac are you also a shaman that changes over to a So Leet beastlord which doesn't think Malos is needed?<br />
<br />
Beast is still &lt; shaman<br />
<br />
Assuming that i was probably level 50 if not 60 before you started playing, i have seen the Shaman class degenerating over time and have kept a vast knowledge of the game and other classes' abilities, so that i can actually understand Arisai's point of view. <br />
<br />
Am i switching class? <br />
Nope. But it's not because i think that Shaman is the most fun class to play or anywhere close to being one of the top 5 classes in terms relative of power nowadays.<br />
<br />
Nowhere in this thread have i mentioned BSTs nor Malos either. Your DPS figures and comparisons have just been pulled out of your ass, so that i felt the need to comment them.</div></div><hr />

But She,<br />
<br />
Your figures come from what you &quot;Say&quot; is your DPS... seeing you don't provide a log.  <br />
<br />
But perhaps you just like to create a lot of your DPS from two different 3.2 second casting time nukes during every fight.  <br />
<br />
Oh and 6.4 seconds casting time during every fight is not a loss of beastlord melee DPS, yeah right.  And I know the concept of Parsing.  I know your trying to figure the Beastlord's damage over a long period of time and calling it sustain when there are periods where the Beastlord is not meleeing but casting.  What I think is funny your not willing to except a shamans damage over a long period of time as even an average let alone sustainable.<br />
<br />
&quot;It just no... no way a shaman can beat us ... why did I waste all this time on this class I won't except that my beastlord may be less in all respects still to my shaman.&quot;<br />

yes, with VoQ, Canni5, and FT 15.  I have no problem regaining my mana back because here is a concept there are others in my group who are using Rain damage and mob last less then 36 seconds which only require exactly 4 spells from me.  Then often times we need to work on the care in getting another mob.  In the elemental planes we don't always like adds.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and i agree with Arsia. You only need to malo boss mobs. If you have the mana or are bored, malo the rest *shrug* it isnt game breaking.<br />

As more BST reach level 65 and fill their books, you will become less and less needed/wanted in EXPERIENCE groups. It is a good thing that with a few melee(Who also have a hard time LFG. Rangers anyone?:) ) a Shaman can throw a good group together pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Here is a Question: Anyone old enough to remember when the Ranger Epic proced a 75% slow? Remember how hard it was to get an experience group then? Well in /time/ it is going to be the same way.</div></div><hr />

As far as I can tell, there are certain people in any class ready to complain about all other classes, all the time.  I'd suggest doing the search you talk about on the Monk and Mage boards - the threads you'll come up with have the obligatory &quot;nerf all classes but mine!&quot; posts, but in the last few months they consist mainly of people saying that attitude is pretty silly. (Particularly on the Mage boards - no PoP Mage I know or have heard from is dissatisfied with their class relative to the Beastlord class. Prior to PoP, yes.)  <br />
<br />
Did you actually read the threads you're talking about? It doesn't sound like it.<br />
<br />
You only need to malo boss mobs.<br />
<br />
I had to laugh - hard - at that one.  Ever try slowing as a Beastlord in a PoP zone?  If I had the option to Malo...  I do get tells from people asking if I can act as slower in a PoP group, and I have to explain that keeping me alive while I try to stick a slow on even mildly MR mobs tends to run the cleric a bit low on mana. :P<br />
<br />
Get a Shaman - I'll happily act as damage dealer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, let's see a mob lasts less than 36 seconds...<br />
<br />
Malos - 3.5 seconds<br />
2.5 seconds delay<br />
Turgur's - 2.1 seconds<br />
2.5 seconds delay<br />
Tears - 4.2 seconds<br />
JBB - 8 seconds<br />
4 seconds for Tears to refresh<br />
Tears - 4.2 seconds - At this point you get 3 straight resists<br />
<br />
So in 36 seconds you have done an average 1950(Tears)+ 263(JBB), which equates to a DPS of 61.5 DPS. 97.5 sustained DPS is like what you are looking forward to, if your pet is accounted for 36 DPS and you have a 30% haste focus for all your spells.<br />
<br />
Do you understand the concept of parsing ?</div></div><hr />

Funny the elemental planes where I xp are about Chain pulling, and when a few high DPS classes are around I get the &quot;interesting&quot; job to pull.<br />

<br />
Gagner,<br />
As far as I can tell you have no clue about parsing, about how high end xp groups function and about how hybrid classes can cast while melee'ing.<br />
maybe you should just let this rest before making a bigger fool of yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Maybe I'm under a misconception here, but I thought that Beastlords had an AA skill for double attack.  This thread seems to be comparing level 65 Shaman and Beastlords, so they should have their necessary AAs.  With a chance to quad every round, and a pet that can quad every round, I'm not really clear why they shouldn't be able to outdamage a Shaman, and in fact have a DPS at least somewhat close to a monk.  <br />
<br />
Shaman can add some damage, and they add many other attributes to a group, including slows, debuffs, hp buffs, utilities.  Beastlords add damage and some mana regen, as well as a few utilities.  I don't see why Beastlords wouldn't be outdamaging Shaman, and I don't see why they shouldn't be.</div></div><hr />

Actually I do understand parsing and furthermore many see it all the time besides me.  Rain spells do the most damage to mobs.  If you have 3 classes in the group that have Rain capabilities.  Melee offer LITTLE DPS this includes Beastlord DPS.    <br />
<br />
And apparently you think ppl are able to attack while casting now, heh?</div></div><hr />

Rain spells only do decent damage when the mob is not running around, when the mob is not to low on HP and when the mob is a low resist.<br />
Second a beastlord is not a pure melee class. They do have a good DPS when attacking but they are much more a pet class, And when using a 2-hander with a good ratio and timing the attacks well they can cast inbetween swings and losing little in dps while still casting.</div></div><hr />

The fact you name all 4 elemental planes as planes that are easy to chain pull is completely noob.  Especially in Plane of Water.<br />
<br />
And BS a group gives bad exp.  Better get use to groups with changes on test charm duo will not be as good as a means of getting exp.<br />

<br />
If your going to preech about a mob running about and not being controlled by a tank.  Well then bud your not in no high level group that has experience fight in the elemental plane. <br />
<br />
Moving and running about mobs effects melee DPS TOO your point is Moot.<br />
<br />
Sorry but the 65 Beastlords I'm seeing in the elemental plane do not use &quot;2-hander weapons.&quot;<br />
<br />
I do realize that a strike can be made right immediate after casting but your painting a picture of a slow 2 hander delay weapon on a class in the elemental planes that will have SoV.  And a Beastlord still needs 3.2 seconds to even THINK about casting a nuke.  And two 3.2 second casting time, nukes which beastlords are boasting about using here in every fight.  Is 6.4 seconds of wasted time they could be doing a much high melee DPS during that single fight.<br />
<br />
And you want further proof so if your a lower level you may understand how long do the TRIALS take with a damaging RAIN group, less than 30 seconds a mob AS INTENDED!  <br />
<br />
Not some corny beastlord wacking it with his cheese melee dps that don't win nothing.</div></div><hr />

Gag, you really have never played a hybrid have you? I suggest you stop arguing now as most everything you have said about Beastlords is completely wrong. In fact it sounds like all you have done is read about them on casters realm and that's it.<br />
<br />
There is a very nice 2hb staff that drops in Solusek that any Beastlord would give his left nut for. Just means you have to find another form haste.<br />
<br />
Here is a lesson on hybrids. They have an innate detrimental spell haste after level 51. At 65 if I right click my nukes and bring up the little box that tells me the cast time, it says 1.8 seconds with no other spell haste. BoR will reduce that further. What's more hybrids weapon timer continues to count when casting meaning that as soon as the spell is finished you attack. <br />
<br />
Lastly the numbers I quoted are not fictitious/imaginary/made up. They are the parses that a friend made of me fighting. The only reason the spell damage is separate is he could not pick those up and had to be calculated. All casting time IS included in the dps AS according to the common definition of dps.<br />
<br />
Finally I would love to see you go and use your precious rains in Hate or other vertically challenged zones. What a sight that would be :D<br />

In all fairness the game doesn't revolve around the plane of hate anymore.  A zone introduced 3 years ago.  And my guild really has moved on from zones like that.<br />
<br />
How it is:<br />
Beastlords are not picked over me when the guild creates groups for a raid.<br />
My buffs are infact better<br />
My heals are infact better<br />
My debuffs are infact better<br />
My haste is infact better<br />
Rain damage rest assured is how Verant intended mobs of the upper planes to be taken correctly with in 30 seconds.  At least, the general EQ community the trials prove to the majority of players that rain damage can be argued as extremely powerful damage.  Even more so than the damage of one pettie non-triple hit beastlord's melee.  <br />
<br />
It won't be too much longer before the days, I have seen BoT where a mage and Beastlord teamed for duo charming will end.  Where the exp become so bad do to the charmed pet out damaging the beastlord low dps.  Test server changes to charm are coming.<br />
<br />
No Beastlord, is no Main tank 'ever' for they have no taunt.  <br />
Beastlord is not the best slower and more importantly in the mind of the public there still lesser.  <br />
Hell, AAed Rangers as a melee support, are seen as more damaging.  <br />
<br />
You can spread all the garbage about whether you will get this god weapon's for yourself off this god in this plane.  <br />
<br />
Or whether if the mage with the 2-4K nukes and pet are your damage slot replacements.<br />
<br />
I showed you how I broke down my normal dps and I still stand by the fact that it is higher than a beastlord can obtain.  Furthermore, as discusted if I choose to; and at anytime and I don't need to blow a full mana bar to outdamage a beastlord, anytime I see fit.<br />
<br />
<br />
***Preach that Malos is not necessary all you want I knew the minute you mention that at the beginning of thread...  These ppl have not been to the elemental planes they don't know the level of these mobs nor the resist they have which makes it difficult to land slow or caster damage.<br />
<br />
Hell, the beginner of the post still has matchless velious dragon shoulders why am I going on.<br />
<br />
No, this is just Beastlords making up more propaganda to help them to find some sort of ease in the choice of their class.<br />
<br />
Hate to be so harsh but itsreality.  I don't like being harsh too often... and this does not need to go on.  So this is my last post in this thread.</div></div><hr />

If you do raindamage on the mobs in &quot;upper planes&quot; with more than 3 mobs in camp, you will die. Plain and simple. And you will not be able to single in, lets say water for instance. If you have been there you will know there are 2 guardians at the very beginning of the zone. Those 2 can be taken easy, sure. But the fastest way would be to let all dps hit 1 mob at a time there. not to kill both in 30 secs. <br />
<br />

I've seen that too, whats your point? The mage were nice to his bst friend and let him/her tag along for some exp.<br />
<br />
Hell, AAed Rangers as a melee support, are seen as more damaging.  <br />
This made me laugh. Have you ever seen a rangers dps with eq/ts? melee support? They play a very important role in the &quot;upper planes&quot;.<br />
I will not post any dps parser, you just have to trust me.<br />
<br />

Hell, you dont even show your magelo. I say his magelo is a very good one. If you dont come up with a magelo compared to Chukzombi or Jenamdar now after your statement you are making a fool out of yourself.<br />

This group you are talking about, lets call it the wonder rain group, what classes are in that group?<br />
<br />
Sofar You have talked about:<br />
1 Cleric<br />
1 Shaman,<br />
1 Beastlord,<br />
1 Tank,<br />
3 Mages.<br />
<br />
Now forgive me if my math skills are a bit rusty but is that not 1 member above the 6 man group?<br />
<br />
Also a funny statement about how your guild makes raid groups, You mean that you are placed (during a raid!) in a group because you have a better haste then a beastlord?, that you have superior buffs? (I actually think that SD is a more then decent buff), that you heal beter then a beastlord? If that is true you have no clue about how tier 4 zones work.<br />
<br />
Also you seems to enjoy spitting out a lot but give little or no statements about where you actually XP, what guild you are in and what gear you own.<br />
No magelo, low post count and a high class envy. You sure you aint a troll? (and no not the race)<br />

<br />
Sustained DPS means you can CONSTANTLY keep that DPS up--burst-wise, yours is higher than BST. This, however, does NOT hold true for keeping this up--you'd never have the mana to do it. Slowly but surely your DPs would fall to, what 70-90-DPS? Thats lower than She's BST DPS posted (Which totalled tonearly 200)<br />

Again, about that Parse ... The parsing factors IN the Casting Time where no melee was done into the Melee Damage parse. Its not The Melee DPS _or_ the Spell DPS. Learn something, kk?<br />

why?<br />
<br />
Several mobs in elemental planes has nasty AE, usually MA is checked with max distance to clerics, so they dont eat AE and get low health aggro;<br />
What does pet do mind I ask?<br />
They push!<br />
in regular elemental raid I dont see any pets unless clear trashs, now u see whats left for a bst?<br />
some crappy dot we dont use...SD when someone send a tell, Savagery and Ferocity when rogue/ranger request it..<br />
Hey all the sudden they become a buff machine like us except they dont get to slow mob (usually taken care of by us or chanters)<br />
<br />
now bst usually just tailing behind mob and hit like other melee and occasionally stack some dot and nukes.<br />
Fun? I dont think so.<br />
<br />
However they do rule in exp group, in tier one, two plane, maybe 3; but is that all you want for EQ?<br />
Wearing Velious armor and Luclin weapon kill some trash mob in PoP?<br />
<br />
Someone can settle with that, not me.<br />
when u see the bigger picture, you will realize many arguement are pointless.</div></div><hr />
