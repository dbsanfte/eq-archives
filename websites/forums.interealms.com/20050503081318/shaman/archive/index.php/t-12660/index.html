<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday, I passed through the trial of execution and got flagged for PoValor/PoStorms...as a 60 shaman with no epic, torpor, malo, mass canni, or any of the really good stuff :)<br />
<br />
We tried many times, and the last try was very exciting. Group was.<br />
<br />
65 wiz<br />
65 clr<br />
65 enc<br />
62 wiz<br />
60 pally<br />
60 shammy (me!)<br />
<br />
With two wizzes you can't go wrong! We AE'd throug the trials, enc chain AE stunning, wizzes AE nuking, and me AE slowing/Torrent of Poison. cleric melee'd (grr) and pally sat in the middle at the beginning of waves to position the mobs.<br />
<br />
The last fight with Exec was amazing. It took three tries to land malosini, and then i landed slow (mitigated)<br />
<br />
Cleric and I chain healed pally. Cleric went oom and I saved the day with a ch bomb /grin and a crit heal for 856. Wizzies crit in the multiple K's and we won the trial!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bodabag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I also got flagged finally this weekend.  Seemed like it's taken forever.  Kept getting to the Exe only to have a wipeout when he was about 50%.  Added a 65 Mage on last try and sailed thru it.  Feels great to finally be done.<br />
<br />
Gratz to you on your flagging.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why wouldn't the Cleric Melee? Can't sit anyways and they're actually pretty reasonable DPS wise with the nice hammers.  With Yaulp 6 going on a 65 Cleric, they're doing more damage than you are there and still able to heal *shrug*<br />
<br />
My wife plays a 65 Cleric and she melee's in every group we play in, the damage adds up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grats on your poJ flag, exe trial is great fun in retrospect ;)<br />
<br />
I did mine at 61 with torpor malo canni5 etc and it was bloody hard work, pushing my mana regen/manapool to the edge at the time, it's one of EQ's great rushes when you first win it ;)<br />
<br />
went back and did it for a guildy (60 war) at 65 with 80ish aa the other week, was a blast being main healer with Q while the druid banished and Ae'd out of boredom ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I'm sitting here messing with it right now... I've been flagged forever but I've been trying to get my fiance flagged so she can group with me in the places where it's worthwhile.<br />
<br />
They just beat it (had prime executioner to like 3%) but the servers came down before they could finish :(<br />
<br />
Group was<br />
<br />
51 cleric (average gear)<br />
52 Rogue (epic)<br />
65 Rogue (16 dmg piercer)<br />
65 Warrior (AE taunt, prolly an 8-8.5k hp war)<br />
65 Wizard (Uber, from one of our server uberguilds)<br />
65 Chanter<br />
<br />
There was time to spare on every one... key points I was seeing:<br />
<br />
1. Fast targetting by the MT<br />
2. AE taunt helps a lot<br />
3. Fast assist from everyone, get there and KILL NOW, do NOT miss even one second hitting backstab or whatever... keep reserve nuke power for if something took a little long to get positioned<br />
4. Have your MT sit in the middle so they go for him first - no one else sits at spawn time.<br />
<br />
They would have won if not for the server down (they should have waited till after :p) and toward the end the cleric was still at 50 mana.<br />
<br />
A really good tank seems to help a LOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Woot congrats!  Clerics with yaulp5/6 going actually regen more mana than if they were sitting, which they couldn't do without aggro anyway.  Their dps isn't phenomenal but every bit helps, especially in an event that places such a heavy focus on dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good job.<br />
<br />
One thing though, if the enchanter is AE stunning, there's no point at all in AE slowing.  You'd be better off just throwing in a nuke I would think.  <br />
<br />
Levels &gt; trials.  You get a few 65s in there, and anyone can pass.</div></div><hr />
