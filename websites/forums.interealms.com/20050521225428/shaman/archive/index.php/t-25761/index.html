<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well, I havent realy started to AA but i will in the near future. But can anyone post what aas i should get and maybe an order i will probably not go for then till i hit 65 but ill get that fast i hope</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>atana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know what level you are now.. but it might be wise to stop and get Canni5 along the way...<br />
<br />
It's that good. IMO it's more important then getting to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the general consensus for AA's is as follows:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3<br />
MC3<br />
Canni5<br />
MGB<br />
<br />
Having Canni5 opens up a whole new game for you.  I got Canni5 as soon as I could.  After those five, I think it really depends on your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Agassa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MGB? Well, if you plan to raid a lot then this AA is important. If not, then i suggest getting VP III as soon as you can. It is one of the most useful shaman AAs, allowing you to root-rot any non-summoning mob with ease and also providing great CC power in groups. It's also cheap compared to other major AAs like:<br />
ND III - grants additional hitpoints(always good!).<br />
SCRM - adds additional ticks to Q and also extends the duration of other buffs(FA still is the devil).<br />
There have been lots of discussions how good SCM really is, but ~10% mana pres is always useful.<br />
CA III/LR V - Defensive AAs. I suggest getting the spellcasting AAs first, then head for these.<br />
<br />
But before you even consider getting any of this AAs(well, except VP if you solo alot)...<br />
GET CANNI V!<br />
It's really that good. Get it. Use it. Be amazed. Love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's a link to a thread right here in the Medicine Cabinet forum discussing Shaman AA's: Lookie here! (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14626) <br />
<br />
This should cover you for the first 150 aa's or so.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, there's a lot of other good Shaman-related threads in that forum, too.  :p <br />
<br />
...and our very own Samanna has a wonderful reference site, Samanna's Reference Desk (http://samanna.net/), for all kinds of useful info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks, inc rep bump... oops. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">MGB sucks, it just saves time when you already have time.  Unless you raid with high numbers a lot, don't get it in your first 200aa.  Especially since Spiritual Channelling is available now.  Faster reset, infinitely more utility, also buffs a raid.<br />
<br />
Start out with:<br />
run3<br />
regen3<br />
mental clarity 3<br />
Cannibalization.<br />
Call of the Wild (cause you were a good player and went straight to 70, right?)<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
Spiritual Channelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spell Casting Reinforcement and Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery are almost a must-have.  I got both of those before I got SCM3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">samanna i love your site, but it's a tad hard to read with the white background and yellow text :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ok... so i'm color blind and have gama up so i can play EQ... lol.<br />
<br />
I just use the cursor to highlight it so i can read :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i got regen 3 after run 3 but if i had to do it all over again, i would have gotten innate metabolism 3 ahead of regen 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">metab 3, regen 3, and innate stam. were the first AAs I got.<br />
<br />
I went innate stam because I was hurting for HP at the time, and I wasn't able to get ND. Now that I'm working on my AA's much more, I plan to go back and get run3, not that it is really necessary, just saves you from casting shrew when you can't use clicky-boots (every sham should have those boots).<br />
<br />
I don't regret innate stam, but I do wish the HP to STA ratio was greater. Metab3 is good for those who use stat food and mounts. I usually use my mount when on larger raids, where you need every ounce of mana you can muster, and you don't need to move for position (strafe around MT to get target on mob and such.).<br />
<br />
regen is just like mental clarity, every bit helps, but not entirely necessary. of course, this is coming from the guy who has a ton of regen and decent FT from items :)<br />
<br />
but in general, run3, then regen3/metab3, are the most common starting paths. ultimately, its up to how you want to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, when you have the AAs to spare, going back and getting either innate regen3/metab3 (depending on which you got first) isn't a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Both are really, really useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I went back for innate metab 3 after about 100aa - a few K in the bazaar on stat food and i don't need to stock up on food or drink for a couple of months :)<br />
<br />
I would advise (almost) anyone not to put any aa into any stats until they are 500+ aa - if they intend to progress through PoP. I have well over maxed stamina and I haven't broken into Time yet - although I have a lot of EP pieces. <br />
<br />
I would just live with a few hps less and put 5aa into more useful aa's - 5aa's is halfway to Spritual Channeling almost :)<br />
<br />
I would say Run3 is about the best investment for your first 3aa possible, if you do dungeons or raids indoors. <br />
<br />
I'll never forget the quote I saw on Run3 'You don't have to be faster than the mobs, you only have to be faster than the rest of your party' :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG!  This is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would advise (almost) anyone not to put any aa into any stats until they are 500+ aa - if they intend to progress through PoP.

<br />
I'd have to agree here.  There's a lot of very useful AAs, and your stats are going to be hitting the caps (at least with buffs) before too long.  Even without Time gear, the stuff that you can get with 1 to 2 groups in Omens is probably enough to have you hitting the caps eventually.<br />
<br />
The only general AAs that I would recommend beyond the &quot;normal&quot; ones (Run, Regen, Innate Metabolism) are the Resists. The cap on these is pretty high, and with the dispells that some encounters have you can't always count on buffs to max you out.<br />
<br />
Beyond the basics to get Cannibalization, you kinda need to look at what role(s) you usually find yourself in.  I did up to LR5 to survive aggro a bit better, but have been focusing more on the Healing AAs since I'm spending more time (and mana) on spam heals or desperately trying to fill in when the Cleric or Druid die/go OOM.  For someone that solos or tends to do more DPS spells (nukes, etc.) you may want to work on SCF or DOT Crits.</div></div><hr />
