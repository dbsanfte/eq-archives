<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I was able to import all user information, which included post counts, passwords, etc.<br />
<br />
I *MAY* have a way to put up the old Shaman boards in another location for about a week that will allow you to pull off some of the old posts. I'm nto sure yet though and will let you know when I do.<br />
<br />
I'll be adding in board hacks which includes contributor field, quick reply, smilies, etc as I can over the next few days.<br />
<br />
As you can see, the boards are blazing fast right now and hopefully with a little preventive maintenance from now on, I can keep it that way.<br />
<br />
Thantu, I am VERY sorry, but I forgot to write down the custom color codes that were used, stuff like page background colors. Feel free to play with them and adjust as you wish to get them back. I added most of the forums, except for the Shaman hunting ground level forums. I wasn't sure how you wanted to set that up.<br />
<br />
Good luck with it everyone... as I said, hopefully, I can find a way to get your old boards up for a time so that you can import anything you might have missed in the last 5 days.<br />
<br />
Enjoy! And please let me know if you have any problems, or suggestions you'd like to make concerning the boards!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sunmoon, thanks!! :)<br />
<br />
ps-that one reply every 30 seconds sux :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe, figured you have to have some meat in your messages.. and that would take longer than 30 seconds ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vanbarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/cheer!<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the hard work Sunmoon!  We all appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry, I haven't been on the forum for a few days, so I'm curious as to what the problem with the old boards was.<br />
<br />
Also, if you're looking for suggestions on improvements, is there a way to remove the time limit on searches (can only do one search every 30 seconds)? It's very frustrating if the search returns no posts and you want to change the search options, but you have to wait 30 seconds to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the software for the old boards was corrupted or something like that, causing technical difficulties. <br />
So, Sunmoon had to re-install everything from scratch.<br />
<br />
Save for some cosmetic issues, the new boards seem far superior now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">*sniff* my posts have meat!<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: the interealms main page also needs to be updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Indeed, blazing speed. I really like these new colors aswell, very friendly to the eye, even better then the old colors. <br />
<br />
Wonderful job Sunmoon m8, thanks alot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/applaud Sunmoon! A truly wonderful job done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks everyone.. just wanted to add:<br />
<br />
Quick Reply re-enabled!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can you make the left hand margin column, with the poster info a bit narrower? I'm assuming 1024x768<br />
<br />
My spell locations table looks messed up because some descriptions no longer fit in 2 lines and wrap around...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Woot! You blink, you miss the page load! Sweet job Sun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not sure why it's doing that Viscerator :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for keeping us going Sunmoon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The main page that lists all the forums and how many threads they've got and last poster and all that isn't updating for me.  I've tried refreshing and the New Posts indicator, the Posts count, the Threads count, and the Last Post columns are all inaccurate.  I've posted in the Alchemy forum but it still says &quot;Never&quot; under Last Post.  I've read everything in some of the ones showing they've got new posts, but it still says they've got new ones.  Many of them that have posts are showing too few.  Although for those that do show they have posts, the Last Post info seems accurate...it's just not displaying everywhere it should.  In other words, it is accurate where it doesn't have Never...but Never is in some places that have posts.<br />
<br />
I'm too tired to be sure that makes sense, I can clarify in the morning if need be :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">wow looks different hehe, seems to be running fast tho</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sleek, fast...awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Great work Sunmoon/Thantu<br />
<br />
It's much faster now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks alot for all the work guys!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hey Sunmoon, not to add one more item to your already full plate, but I had a question. On the old board, there were different titles depending on your post count. Such as Lurker, Initiate, Disciple, Teacher, etc. Will these be reinstituted with the new board? or will I be a senior member for the next 875 posts? I was kinda looking forward to earning the honorable title of &quot;teacher.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Very well done, I love the changes.  *is giddy*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sunmoon your the best.  Just wanted to say how much I appreciate all your hard work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Good job Sunmoon!<br />
<br />
Shaben</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks everyone.. titles and the like will be returning. A new version of vBulletin (version 3) is coming out soon and all the hacks and stuff for this version won't work then. So, I'm a little wary about doing a lot of hacks for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Great! Glad to hear about the titles Sunmoon! Thank you again for all of your hard work! You are the best!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm pretty impressed.  The new sight seems to be working a ton faster.  The look is nice and clean too.<br />
I do have one feature request.  Would it be possible to allow us to opt out of the Javascript submission form, and just use a regular HTML form.<br />
I use lynx to read this sight most of the time, and that means that the only way I can reply is to use the quick reply box.  I can't start a new thread at all unless I switch over to IE/Netscape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Sorry Megumi.. I understand you use Lynx, but fully 99.6% of my users use MSIE, or Netscape. I simply can't change things like that without more justification :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">by the way...please move the private messages thingy up top again :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Excellent work guys... assuming you both are guys.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Sunmoon/Thantu,<br />
<br />
Thank you both for not only keeping this site going, but also taking time from your lives for doing this.<br />
<br />
Toh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>dfarls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Wow Looks great and is VERY fast. Nice job!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Fedayeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Nice Workover!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">by the way...please move the private messages thingy up top again <br />
<br />
Man, I have looked all over for this option.  I'm sure it is there somewhere's, I'll look again in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">These boards are way fast... Thank you so much for getting them working better... I could never really get into using it because it took 10 minutes to load each page.<br />
<br />
One request though... put a jump to board thingy on the bottom of every page... I hate having to scroll to the top to click &quot;General&quot; or whatever... especially after posting... cause then the back button doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Thantu, I can do it for you.. but why don't you try it first.. you need to look in the &quot;Templates&quot; section of the admin panel. I think the one you are looking for is called forumview or something. Look for an entry called {pmbit} or something like that.<br />
<br />
It's actually very powerful once you get the hang of it.</div></div><hr />
