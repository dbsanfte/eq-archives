<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
Lord Inquistitor Seru looked up from the many papers spread across his desk, annoyed at the disturbance.<br />
<br />
His guards stepped aside to admit a young gnome; the insignia on her armour identified her as a cleric of the Custos Armonum Order, one of the highest ranking orders in the towers that surrounded the Arx.<br />
<br />
'Foolish Child!', Seru's thundering voice boomed off the cold marble walls. 'Who are you to disturb my thoughts, without the proper regard to ceremony and Honour required by the Arx!'<br />
<br />
'My Lord Seru please!' the gnome ran forward into the light to fall prostrate before Seru's anger, sobbing. It was only then he noticed the dents in her armour, the bloodstained, torn cloak. He bent down and gently lifted the gnomes head, and his gaze softened as he saw the broken newly healed skin, as though terrible magics had coursed through her very blood.<br />
<br />
'What is it child?' Seru said gently, 'What has befallen you?' <br />
<br />
The young gnome composed herself, then began her tale.<br />
<br />
'It was a normal day in service of the heart. I was on my shift of guard duty within the Inner sanctum, guarding the magical tapestry. My suspicions were first aroused when my comrade didn't return from his patrol though the inner chambers; he was only a few minutes late, but I had a word with the other guard on patrol to go and hurry him along. A few minutes passed and neither of them had returned, I began to suspect something was wrong. I thought I heard a muffled scream, but my duty was to guard my post at all costs.<br />
<br />
It was then I heard a strange sound, like flapping footsteps. They paused just before my line of sight, and a strange vile smell of swamp mud assailed my nose. The next thing I knew, this ugly green head leered around the corner at me. It was a Troll !<br />
<br />
&quot;Vile Beast!&quot; I cried, and smote it with the reckoning of my lord Mithanial. The Beast bellowed and fled back along the halls from whence it came. Such a vile creature should not be allowed to descecrate the pristine halls of my order, So I gave chase. The Troll seemed to be limping, leaving a trail of debris as the mud and twigs fell from its armour, as though it had been rolling in the deserts of Marus seru, and diving deep into the pools of dawnshroud. I continued the chase, and saw it duck through a doorway.<br />
<br />
I paused at the doorway, the troll was in the corner of the room, looking confused and cornered. I smote him once more, once more the troll bellowed in pain, and I ran into the room to finish the Vile creature.<br />
<br />
As I ran towards it, the troll barked two gutteral words and suddenly roots burst through the marble floor, entwining  my legs and pinning me fast. I strained against my magical bonds, the troll grinned briefly, and muttered a few more words. A ungodly smoke billowed from his fingers, engulfing me in a poisonious fog, making me feel very uncomfortable; with a simple curse he gestured at me and a stream of insects flew at me biting incessently, each little bite draining my very will to fight. I smote it again, but the beast barely flinched under my onslaught, it seemed to be waiting for something.<br />
<br />
Then I heard the heavy stone door behind me begin to slide slowly shut, and I realised my mistake. I looked wildly around the room, only then seeing the bodies of my fallen comrades. The troll again grinned at me, and I saw the malignent ancient chaos within its eyes. I looked closer, and where the mud had fallen from is armour I saw intricately crafted chain of unearthly power; many of its garments were fashioned from hides of dead creatures and flickered with untapped power <br />
<br />
&quot;What business do you have here, foul creature?&quot; I questioned wildly, hoping to buy myself some time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I 'serve' Katta&quot; the troll grunted sarcastically , then laughed mockingly, seeming to find some inner mirth in this statement.<br />
<br />
Then, the laughter suddenly turned to a string of harsh vehement curses and I felt my soul tear with pain. Reeling I summoned the beast, flailing wildly yet each cut seemed to heal itself almost as it landed, a glowing ring of cold crystal light surrounded the troll and I could almost hear ancient whisperings of long forgotten spirits. Ignoring my blows, the troll began another harsh chant and I screamed as deadly posions tore through me, Again I flailed wildly, but the incessant biting of the insects had dulled my skills and slowed my reactions.<br />
<br />
Again the troll cursed me, again the poison tore through me. Every blow I landed seemed barely to stagger him, and the wounds closed almost as soon as they landed. I felt my self weaken, and my sight began to dim. I had only one chance left. Calling on my last reserves of magic, I created a portal to my guard point, slipping from his grasp!'<br />
<br />
'What happened then child?' Seru questioned, feeling his anger once again rise.<br />
<br />
The gnome continued:<br />
<br />
'I appeared at my guard point, and called for help. Luckily three of our brave elven warriors were close at hand on the other side of the tapestry. I summoned the vile troll and they all charged into him with gusto hacking and slashing with keen cruel blades. <br />
The troll bellowed in genunine pain this time; after giving me an angry glance it one again fled off into corridors. I heard him cursing the elfs, so I summoned him back once again. Pushing me aside dismissively, the troll turned and shouted a brief curse at the leading elf warrior. The elf sneezed and flew backwards into the wall, seemingly paralysed. Again biting streams of insects swarmed through the room and roots burst from the floor.<br />
<br />
Over and over I summoned the troll but he seemed to dance just out of my reach, keeping me rooted and bound to the spot. The warriors swung wildly at him over and over, but soon they became subdued by the insects and bound immobile like myself. I again summoned him, but he just stepped away, panting and bleeding heavily now, his essence seemingly spent.<br />
<br />
Glaring at me, the troll whipped out a large Iron bound book and thumbed through the pages with a practised ease, the runes glowing briefly on the page he paused at. I summoned him again, but he snapped the book shut and laughed, pushing my feeble attacks aside. Then he paused, surveying the room: four of our finest guardians straining at our bonds intent on his murder. Laughing, the troll muttered a few sort words and vanished into a cloud of vile smelling green smoke, leaving his last words of &quot;Mees be backs&quot; echoing faintly through the room.'<br />
<br />
'Come now,' Seru said comfortingly, 'A terrible thing has happened, but the danger has passed us for the present.'<br />
<br />
'Oh no my lord Seru!' exclaimed the gnome, 'the news is much worse'<br />
<br />
'The troll had gone, and we were healing our wounds and recovering from the foul magics. We had sent for replacement guards, and my brother, another young gnome in service to the Heart had returned from the council chambers. <br />
<br />
I told him of the dreadful events that had assailed us, and he said he would return to help us after he filed the report from the consiellium. He wandered off down the corridor, and that was the last we saw of him! All we found was his bloodied robe and some troll footprints in a pool of blood. the report was stolen!'<br />
<br />
Seru moved round his desk, and sat back at his chair <br />
<br />
'This is grave news indeed' he mused...</div></div><hr />
