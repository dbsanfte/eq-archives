<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, everyone has 'em whether they admit it or not, so I was just wondering -- what are your playstyle quirks/pet-peeves/preferences?<br />
<br />
For me, the big one is mana.  I always want full mana, no matter what I am doing.  Honestly, when I see around 40-50% mana I start to get nervous.  Not sure why, other than I feel safer for the &quot;just in case&quot; factor.<br />
<br />
Another one is constantly looking at my EXP bar.  Man, I wish I could stop doing this, hehe.<br />
<br />
Plat in the bank.  Gotta have it!  <br />
I purchased a cheap horse recently (for medding and fun purposes) and am starting to replenish my funds.  Slow-going sometimes, especially considering that I don't pharm, but I want to see k in there, not double or triple digits.<br />
<br />
Four, full stacks each of food and water always.<br />
<br />
Check friends/GUILD list constantly.  I think this is just a nervous habit.<br />
<br />
Pet-peeves:  People who tell others what is right and wrong about playing their class.  Granted, to a point, there is a right and wrong way to play one's class (especially when other players' lives depend on you), but that's no reason to preach down to someone about how to play, unless you see them doing something that is just extremely counter-productive -- like a shaman tanking, stopping only long enough to buff him/herself, casting no debuffs, heals, or buffs on others (grrr). <br />
<br />
Those who don't use common sense while playing (see above).<br />
<br />
Class-haters.  These people are basically supremacists.  <br />
You're a ranger?  Sorry, we're full; Druids suck because . . . well, they just do!;  Paladin?  Nope, no hybrids allowed;  This club is for DPS classes only!  All others get out!;  If you're not a chanter or cleric, we don't want you in our group!<br />
Idiocy.  Pure, inexcusable idiocy.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  One more peeve -- People who go ape over being inspected.  Honestly not trying to start anything here, so I'll just leave it at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Reorganizing my bank and constantly buying new food, even though im only 1 food and water from full.<br />
<br />
Also banking the cash in plats and the rest in coppers. Never in gold or silver. Sometimes i catch myself telling my rl buds how to 'properly' save the money in the bank.<br />
<br />
Also, im a buffstacking nazi.... and I constantly spam /who of the zone and /who GUILD all, but i attribute those more to pvp awareness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The usual cannibalizing constantly even when FM or doing something that in no way requires any mana. Cecking up on guildies and exp a lot too.<br />
<br />
I'm a million times more pissed at the total retards who can't take advice than those who dare give it. There's nothing more detestable than people who when asked to do something respond with: &quot;Don't tell me how to play my class.&quot;. I tossed someone out in lower dogs and left them there for that offense and I'll do it again. This usually concerns bards and enchanters not knowing when they can tash/OoS.<br />
<br />
If someone takes the bloody time, effort and courage to give yo some input on what you're doing you'd bloody well listen and listen up DAMN GOOD. People are VERY carefull about this in EQ and if they have to tell you something you can bet your ass what you are doing is wrong as hell.<br />
<br />
Okay so I've ran into the occasional person who spams everyone about what to do all the time in an overly bossy way. But even these people usually know better than those they're bossing around.<br />
<br />
Running into these people is what makes me miss all the startegy games I used to play more. There you could just tell tthe cocky people telling me not to advice them because they knew what they're doing. Ok you and a dozen of your buddies against me and we'll see who knows what they're doing.<br />
<br />
It didn't shut them up of course but it gave a great deal of personal satisfaction knowing that you could always prove that they did not beating them at seemingly impossible odds.<br />
<br />
In EQ you can due to class balance and total progress linearity never do that. If you've played longer in EQ you will have better stats and some classes are simply better at PvP than others. OMG gotta go learn WC3 no more don't tell me what to do, squish them like ant mmm yah...<br />
<br />
Bah who am I kidding I'm stuck...<br />
<br />
But I will never forget the countless times I ran in to people boasting about their skills being so superior they needed no help in the web based BBS type game Earth2025. All I can do now is not group with them but there I would crush them like ants and laugh when they'd cheat to eat me assuming I must have had to dismiss them so easily...<br />
<br />
<br />
/rant /rant /rant<br />
<br />
I really hate these people...<br />
<br />
Even more than I hate beggars in EC.<br />
But I hate those a lot too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tehh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same here with constantly checking xp.. Heck, I even do it when raiding ToV and my group is'nt getting the xp... Just a bad habbit I guess :)<br />
<br />
I'm pretty fussy about my food also, anytime I have foraged food that is not vegetables I destroy it or right-click... I need that double stack of water and vegetables in the bottom 4 slots of my last back... /shrug<br />
<br />
Last one is when grouped with other shamans who don't reply to questions along the lines of what debuffs/dots are you using?  I'll take the other to make we don't waste mana  ie : you dot (p and d) i'll debuff/slow etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Quirks<br />
I must have my bags in the correct order in my inventory, I'm often found checking that they are.<br />
<br />
Canning when I dont need to - I think we all do that<br />
<br />
Cannidancing when I dont need to - I've been 60 since well before Luclin and got Torpor after a few months of dinging but I still catch myself canning and then sitting when I don't need to sometimes.<br />
<br />
Trying to Cann when I'm playing my cleric or druid - I've learned the hard way not to put anything important/offensive in the key number I use for Cann with Sere.<br />
<br />
Oh and now and again I'll play a different game and it really confuses me when I log back into EQ, AO is the worst one for it. I took a couple of months off EQ and only played AO a while back and when I came back I kept forgetting that doors in EQ don't open automatically for you and kept dememming my spells instead of casting them.<br />
<br />
Peeves<br />
<br />
People who use 'PST' in public channels, argh! Credit the community with some intelligence and just say no to PST!<br />
<br />
People who overuse hotkeys in groups and raids about what theyre doing, especially melee who have an 'I am assisting soandso' key, argh! Hotkeyed emotes will have me grinding my teeth within minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Peeves:<br />
Clerics that use celestial healing/elixir instead of CH when the group has a 55+ warrior, then are constantly heard saying LoM.<br />
<br />
When the level 54 monk, warrior, etc. refuses to just let me chain pull then takes 5 minutes between each pull trying to figure out how to get less than 4 mobs while I coulda just gotten a single due to level difference.<br />
<br />
Pickup groups that are afraid to actually push their limits.  I don't mind taking things slow at first and seeing how the group does, but when you're having to wait on respawns because it's so pathetically easy it's time to look for more stuff or harder stuff to keep it interesting IMO.<br />
<br />
Beggars<br />
<br />
Guildies that make friends with Sarnaks. :/  Sarnaks must all die, and they happen to be great xp as well. :p<br />
<br />
Quirks:<br />
Like everyone else it seems, I catch myself canni-dancing even after I've hit full mana from time to time or just out of habit while I'm sitting doing nothing even.  :/<br />
<br />
I also like to keep over 60m if possible.  It's saved my butt on several occasions when a pull went wrong and I suddenly found myself having to slow 6+ mobs while tanking several of them and gettin some resists till the chanter could get em locked down.<br />
<br />
Checking my xp bar too often.  Watched xp bar never moves. :(  Maybe it's just level 59 though...<br />
<br />
Slowing stuff that I know will die in 20 seconds or less.  Waste of mana and I'm generally an efficiency freak in xp groups, but old habits die hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quirks<br />

<br />
* Watching a fellow Shaman in our hunting party casting a DoT or Slow on a mob which we can take out in 30 seconds. Usually the DoT is casted when the mob has only 1-2 bubbles of life left.<br />
<br />
* A fellow Shaman in our hunting party who doesn't use regen or canni for mana recovery but tells me to use Bear Form for faster mana recovery. <br />
<br />
* Hearing our fellow Shaman saying 20m, 30m or OOM after he casts his Slows, DoTs and has casted only 1 heal on a party member.<br />
<br />
Quirk<br />
====<br />
<br />
* I don't mind be the healer in a party, but I prefer that we keep a sharp eye out for a Cleric. It's hard to balance being the main healer and people demanding several buffs and they want me to debuff the mobs in chain pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Peeves:<br />
Seeing other classes whine on message boards about not getting compensated for buffing. Hello?? You have buffs, if you don't want to cast them don't do it. Just quit moaning about it.<br />
<br />
People sitting on raids when &quot;Inc&quot; is shouted. I hate that, it drives me absolutely batty. I've gotten to the point that I won't even attempt to save the moron caster who didn't stand. Screw 'em, not my fault they're dumb.<br />
<br />
People arguing about loot policies over guild chat/ooc/shout/raid channel. Grrrrr.<br />
<br />
Level 50+ Shaman with a Testament of Vanear and they're not doing tradeskills.<br />
<br />
People that think their guildtag automatically makes them Lord, High Ruler of the EQ Universe.<br />
<br />
Spell price gouging.<br />
<br />
Quirks:<br />
Ghetto mezzing. I enjoy doing it, keeps me from being bored.<br />
<br />
Canni-dancing when I don't need to.<br />
<br />
Fudging a bit regarding my mana status. I know how much mana I need, someone else might disagree ;).<br />
<br />
Buying bat wings in bulk (200 at a time).<br />
<br />
Making sure I have 100 food/water each time I start playing.<br />
<br />
Getting summoned and dying. A raid isn't a raid if I don't die *grins*</div></div><hr />

You die, and reasonably ask &quot;Why didn't you heal me?&quot;<br />

<br />
&quot;I need all shaman buffs&quot;<br />
&quot;I Have 150 spells in my book, which ones do you want?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmm, All of them. I'm tanking here you know.&quot;<br />

Perfectly innocent conversation I had last night:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey..what's that funny looking earring?&quot;<br />
<br />
(me) &quot;It's a fishbone earring, it gives perma enduring breath..&quot;<br />

&quot;no&quot;<br />

&quot;Let me see it in the TRADE window&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sorry&quot;<br />

(player runs off into the distance)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Quirks:<br />
1) everything from bags to items has to be in a certain spot, even where they sit in the bags.<br />
2) 4 stacks of food, four stacks of water<br />
3) batwings, full stack<br />
4) I get all twitchy if I'm at full health, I sometimes cann when I'm FoM because I hate being FoH.<br />
5) I communicate ... A LOT.  I want the chanter to know when I have 2 resists on slow, or when a mezzed mob breaks and starts to lay a smackdown on me, or letting the part know my mana situation after every pull, or letting them know how long they have till I restart the rebuff cycle ...<br />
6) I love to buff, get used to it.<br />
7) I'm mostly in greater bearform, I like it.<br />
8) if I lose a pet during a solo session I tend to not recast it and do it without the pet.<br />
<br />
Peeves:<br />
1) people who ask for stupid buffs when I'm LoM (had casters asking for HoS)<br />
2) loot whores, hate them with a passion.<br />
3) random unasked inspections<br />
4) healers who try to top off my health when I have more mana than they do<br />
5) this one really ticks me off ... charmers who don't tell me what, or worse still, IF they're charming something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Quirks:<br />
I can't sit still and watch the auctions or just chat with folks, etc.  I can usually be seen running laps around the nexus or Kelethin while shopping or chatting.  (Has gotten me 10k'd a time or two :) )  As a bonus - it keeps the beggars from catching me.<br />
<br />
Dying in remote zones I have no busness being in and forking out big bucks to get a rez there.  <br />
<br />
Peeves:  <br />
Shorthand d00d speak:  plz, ne1, m8, h8, u, ur, etc.  Acceptable in high stress fighting situations only, when typing time is at a premium. <br />
<br />
Camps that involve sitting and doing nothing for extended periods of time.  -see quirks <br />
<br />
Ignorant people who are either unaware of or unwilling to admit to their lack of knowledge.  - This covers the criticism givers/takers mentioned in the above posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Peeves, in no particular order:<br />
Folks who...<br />
1.  ...use PST in every shout &amp; auction.  What, we're gonna phone ya?<br />
2.  ...talk like this ---&gt; &quot;Y u h8 PoM VI? Y?&quot;<br />
3.  ...are reasonably high level (mid-30s +) and have no clue what they're doing, AND<br />
4.  ...who then proceed to tell everybody else what they should be doing.  (&quot;Dont slow mob ur wasting mana i will heal tanks&quot;)  ?  /boggle<br />
5.  ...still haven't twigged to the fact that buffs now fade on everybody at a slightly different time.<br />
6.  ...constantly ask for buffs they already have, or don't pay attention when I'm calling out I'm casting a long-cast spell on them (ie, Harness) and take off as it's almost done...<br />
7.  ...don't answer me when I ask what they have, and just reply &quot;Need all shaman buffs,&quot; then causing me to waste a bunch of mana to find that they already have Focus and Stamina up.<br />
8.  Trying to Cann when I'm not a shaman.<br />
9.  Puppydog who, despite the fact I'm sitting 2 feet away from him, proceeds to walk around the entire chamber before stopping next to me.... on a good day.<br />
<br />
Quirks:<br />
<br />
1.  Keeping Root up in #1... always<br />
2.  Obsessively organizing my spellbook, and having a bank o' hotkeys devoted to spell switching.<br />
3.  Canning when I'm full o' mana.<br />
4.  Preferring to bind wounds when I'm under 70% over healing.<br />
5.  2 stacks o'food &amp; drink:  1 stack &quot;normal&quot; for each (fish rolls and water) and one stack Uber (Frost giant steaks and Fuzzlecutter Formula 5000!)<br />
6.  2 stacks batwings... until I can find that new spell :(<br />
7.  Trying to take agro from the tank when fighting mid- and low-blue mobs... still working on that darn defense skill.<br />
8.  Tradeskill addict.<br />
9.  Constantly wishing for a /dolt list right next to our /friend list.</div></div><hr />

=============<br />
<br />
* SOW my pet please while we're at a chain pull camp.<br />
<br />
* Clerics asking for SOW and other combat buffs and then runs for zone when he gets hit once.<br />
<br />
* Getting several /tells from a new caster team mate asking if I want to duel pets while sitting at a camp and the puller is brining back giants.<br />
<br />
* Monks asking for haste and several other buffs during combat while I'm struggling to keep them alive and canni dancing.<br />
<br />
* Four team mates telling me four different job combinations that I should be doing for the group in group chat at the same time and then somebody pulls.<br />
<br />
* Casting several buffs on a Cleric and then in turn the Cleric demands money up front for symbol buffs. <br />
<br />
* With Cleric in party as primary healer, I find with certain individuals that I have to throw in stealth heals to keep fellow team mates alive. You know things like seeing the tank down to 1/3 of a health bubble of life and the Cleric is still sitting on the ground.<br />
<br />
* Getting a rez from a Cleric and after telling him my story that while I was training a bunch of mobs to zone, I saw several people recovering at the zone line. I didn't want to train them so I stopped and died. The Cleric told me that I should have trained them to save myself. My jaw dropped when I heard that.<br />
<br />
Sorry for posting so many anti-Cleric peeves but I've never seen so many inept Clerics over a 2 month period. Did all the Dr00ds decide to create Clerics one day?</div></div><hr />

I have a lot of peeves; some of the main ones are:<br />
<br />
Meatheads that start pulling immediately after the cleric and I finish buffing, completely oblivious to the concept of mana and how it equates to healing.<br />
<br />
PST, and every other acronym for every damned spell and item in the game.<br />

Everything has to be in my inventory in the exact right spot.  A place for everything, and everything in it's place. (you should see how long it takes me to loot my corpse)<br />
<br />
Keeping my mana bar and my health bar exactly even at all time.  I dont have to say my mana to my regular groupmates anymore.<br />
<br />
Ghetto parking - If I'm playing my cleric or my shaman, regardless if I'm playin with one of chanter friends.  I know it bugs em sometimes, but if we have 2 or more mobs in camp, at least one of them is gonna get rooted, whether it needs it or not.  I cant help myself.<br />
<br />
Keeping the ranger I group with sometimes at 50% health or less.  He goes out of his way to get aggro most of the time.  I like to see him twitch when he gets below a bubble of health. :D <br />
<br />
I cant stand having my buffs out of order.  I'm not that anal retentive in real life.  But they have to be lined up just so in game.  <br />
<br />
peeves<br />
<br />
I usually hate grouping with other shaman, whether I'm playing my cleric or shaman.  I'm constantly thinking &quot;well, that isnt what I would have done&quot;.  Or &quot;why the heck is he casting that spell?&quot; etc etc.  It's bad, I know it.  Some things are probably done alot better than I do it.  Just the evil in me I guess<br />
<br />
Casters of any sort that cast on mobs before the main tank toushes them (barring chanters, or root parking).  Nothing like seeing the mob make a beeline to the wizard who just stunned the mob before it gets to the camp spot :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Someone you've never met before sending you the ominous first tell &quot;HI&quot;, which you know, is going to be immediately followed by &quot;do you have anything for a bard?&quot;  or &quot;my corpse poofed, do you have anything to spare&quot;, or the ever popular &quot;can I have some plat?&quot;</div></div><hr />

==================================<br />
<br />
* Any non-team mate touching our mob that we brought back to our pullpoint. One time a non-teammate Rogue ran up to our mob touched it and ran off. I informed our team leader that the rogue probably pick-pocketed the mob. We also only foudn a few GPs on the mob. The Rogue kept buzzing past our camp and I got his name. We approached the clown and he said he was &quot;...attempting to fear&quot; our mob for us.<br />
<br />
* A team mate that somehow fears the mob while at 90% health (probably instill doubt) and the mob runs off full speed into an area infested with wandering mobs.<br />
<br />
* Cleric using his best heal spell on me after informing them I don't have as many HP as the tanks. Conserve mana and use the smaller heals on me and the other casters.<br />
<br />
* A Gnome Enchanter showing me his toolbox filled with exotic meat stacks and going into details on his cooking skills while the puller is bringing in 3-4 mobs.<br />
<br />
* The same Gnome Enchanter running off to Charm Snow Bunnies while the puller is bringing back 3-4 mobs.<br />
<br />
* Enlarge/Shrink my pet please.<br />
<br />
* A Wizard (I beleive it was a WIZ) decides to pull and kite ice giants while we have a full party with Cleric. The same Wiz bringing back 5 giants back to camp.<br />
<br />
* Being told by a Shaman in zone that looking for a Cleric for our chain pulling group is a waste of time because (1) You don't need that much healing for the mobs in the area; (2) Clerics are a waste of time because they sit there doing nothing and take away XP from the rest of the group; (3) I was a l00zer because I should have been performing all the healing even though party members want tons of buffs and debuffs done.<br />
<br />
* Tanks not paying attention that the Cleric is getting beaten on. The only way to grab our tank's attention is stating that I can't buff them anymore because I'm using all my mana in keeping the Cleric alive. LOL!</div></div><hr />

Also in a normal exp grind group I usually get bored and have lots of mana so just heal the shamans because they waste a lot slowing. (Don't nuke because I just don't).<br />
<br />
I don't mind the melees who cant type or have a good memory so they say 'haste' and 'hp please' as long as they dont mind till the next time I have downtime, because I know people who usually forgot and such.<br />

I hate when people who require every stupid buff possible.</div></div><hr />

Where the hell is my haste!!! On my shaman it pisses me off when someone asks for a stat buff, I usually will ask them if they still have haste up, &quot;no haste faded 5 min ago&quot; grrr your asking for a useless str buff when you've been fighting unhasted for 5 pulls?? /boggle <br />
<br />
I was also in a hole group when some jackass pulled 5 mobs so after I root parked &amp; slowed all of em I was chain casting jbb while canni'ing, after they were all dead, I reply 60m to a mana check &amp; some idiot tells me to stop wasting my mana on nukes!<br />

=====<br />
* Love it when Clerics ask each member of the party how many HP they have.<br />
* Love it when Clerics ask tanks if they like to keep their HP low for berserking purposes.<br />
* Love it when a Cleric sees me casting alot of spells and then says &quot;FM, canni up and I'll throw some small heals on you.&quot;<br />
* Love it when I get a Cleric that communicates with secondary healers before pulls in regards to healing certain tanks when a pull goes really bad and a whole lot of healing has to be casted.<br />
* Love it when the Cleric is LOM and informs the party before the pull to to slow down the pulls so the secondary healers can take over while he/she meds.<br />
<br />
Honest! I like Clerics a lot. I must have been very unlucky in teaming with some real bad cases in the past several weeks.</div></div><hr />

Peeves.<br />
*People who auction things with no intention of selling them.<br />
<br />
*Level 60 melees who as me for zing (extinguish fatigue).<br />
<br />
*Melees who tell me to slow down the pulls.  Kill faster I say!  (they have given up telling me I can't pull)<br />
<br />
*Golden Efreeti Boots.  I hate them.  My druid goes barefoot.  There will be no GEBs on any of my accounts.<br />
<br />
*Rangers and their buffs.  I love rangers dearly, but really, it takes them 20 minutes to buff themselves and they have to stop all the time to refresh them.<br />
<br />
*People who won't go places without a cleric and an enchanter.  /yawn<br />
<br />
*5 people all telling me group focus/regen/sta is fading.  Yes thanks, it's a group buff - I have it too.<br />
<br />
*I really hate buffing haste.   I really hate people who are rabid about omfg I need haste right this minute ahhh plz!!!  then forget to tell me later that it has been worn off for 20 mins and I have to ask if they still have it.<br />
<br />
*Henora tells the group &quot;Torpor - Henora&quot;.  Group says &quot;Okay lets move&quot;  /sigh<br />
<br />
*Clerics that won't heal me when I am getting pounded, then heal me all the time when I am just canning back for mana.<br />
<br />
*Tanks who bitch about me using torpor to heal them.  I actually let someone die once because they complained so much about it.<br />
<br />
*Our pet.  That little SOB is always training me, disappearing, warping and suiciding after I spent a bazillion mana buffing him, changing targets midfight.  argh.  <br />
<br />
*People who say &quot;Henora has unlimited mana now that she has torpor&quot; - well yes, I do, but it is not INSTANT mana.  It doesn't mean I can do gfocus, regen, grp sta, and haste everyone and be instantly FM and ready for 3 inc.  Gimme 30 seconds, geez.<br />
<br />
*People without RS3.  <br />
<br />
Quirks<br />
*I carry my alchemy bags with me all the time.<br />
<br />
*My bags are always in order.   I hate clutter.  I reorganize my bank, bags, spell book, etc regularly to make it cleaner or more efficient.  I must have all spell components, and an assortment of gear and potions.  3 stacks of food and water.  Usually several types with the longest lasting types on the bottom of the stacks.<br />
<br />
*The canning all the time thing, and always having regen up - even when just sitting around - gotta have regen on...and acumen.</div></div><hr />

5) this one really ticks me off ... charmers who don't tell me what, or worse still, IF they're charming something. <br />
<br />
Everytime that happens, they charm something ~right~ as slow would have landed, I have to restrain myself from beating their heads in. :)<br />
<br />
Another peeve is people who ask for buffs without paying the slightest bit of attention to what they have already.  I don't much care for people who absolutely cannot bring themselfs to ask one of the few shaman there personally for buffs, instead of spamming it in /say or channel multiple times.  fortunately most of my people are well trained now ;) <br />
<br />
Quirks, well I also have those times where I just hit cann4 out of reflex, sitting at FM and health.  I'm kinda a freak on making sure my mana is always up.  Like some other people, my backpacks absolutely ~have~ to be in certain spots, with each bag holding certain things in certain spots.  I'm not very good at keeping food/water though, I typically run out in the middle of something.</div></div><hr />

over casting...i tend to cast spells when i dont really have to, like a second root just to make sure =-)<br />
<br />
people who dont think i can heal well enough...ive never let anyone die since i got GH a few levels ago.  <br />
<br />
buff beggers...i will give a sow, but people who come up to me asking for str/sta/regen etc are just idiotic, cant you see im grouped here?<br />
<br />
stingy bastards: sellin an item for 1k, they say ill give you &quot;500pp&quot; =\<br />
also, 'donating for sow', then they give you like 5 gp...i hate that.  if they donate they should atleast give something i can use...<br />
i dont ask for donations, but dont pass up a ripe opprotunity =-) once i got 20pp for a sow, jus cause the guy felt nice =-)<br />

<br />
I've seen this happen in real life. I went to a used car lot and was watching all the new cars being brought into the lot. I took a look at one which had a whopping 105,000 miles on it. One of the salesmen came up to me and said that he can let the baby go for $12,000.00.<br />
<br />
/cough<br />
/gasp<br />
<br />
The salesman tried everything to get me into the car. I said I had to leave and meet some friends for dinner. He said I can take the car for a few hours and take it for dinner. Finally he said he'll get his manager. The manager came out, introduced himself, smiled and said he can sell the car to me for $6,000.00.<br />
<br />
/cough<br />
/gasp<br />
<br />
Not that I would ever buy the car, but I sure would never buy from that place. The nerve of them to make an offer that high and then drop the price by half. How can you trust a place like that? The car wasn't even worth 6k, more like 1.5-2k if the engine was running fine.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I declare that &quot;I don't deserve a rez&quot; when it was something really stupid.<br />

If, in a pickup group, my groupmates get all excited about seeing an enchanter LFG, I send a tell typing... very... slowly... so that they'll be taken already. Then I jump all over paladins and mages and druids.<br />

Finally, I occasionally put way too much effort into buff-timing. For example, I'll cast celerity on my pet, then wait 30 seconds before casting it on a player, so that I can get just enough early warning to get the following:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I thought I was the only one who does the banking like Asta, all in either plat or copper. When I bank I drop everything on me in plat slot, and all which doesnt fit in it goes to copper. I got pretty good collection of copper pieces on my vault...<br />
 However my biggest neurosis in game are buffs... I'm neurotic about having certain buffs in certain slots, like I have to have Grim Aura first, second is Sow, then Uv from my Sc Bracer, and after that comes the stat buffs, and finally Focus and other &quot;good&quot; buffs. I get nervous immediately if someone casts Aego and c3 on me right after res. Sometimes I even cancel buffs like Focus just because they are in wrong order. I do this even if there's no Dispelling mobs around... <br />
<br />
 Currently my biggest peeve in game is PST. I have no idea why I hate that stupid acronyme so much, but is just irritates the heck out of me when someone spams same 6 lines in /auc channel and has PST attached to every line. I think we use enough acronymes in everquest already, we dont need one for every damn purpose. <br />
 Using PST is like assuming that the person who would be interested in buying your wares would be smart enough to know what PST means but stupid enough to stand a thumb in his rear because he doesnt understand how to send you a tell about it. <br />
 Yea I've heard many excuses in using PST, like it's for telling the possible buyer what's your preferred method of contacting you and so on, but come on, who trades items in /shout or /ooc after the initial auction is done? Auctions like &quot;/WTS PSC, PGT, SCHW, JM. PP only, PST thx la~&quot; make me see red...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Quirks:<br />
<br />
<br />
 As with many others I have to have my bags in the right order, and everything within them has to be in the right order too.  Bags in my bank are the same with evertyhing withing them organised just so.<br />
 Always hitting canni.  There are times I am FM and health at 80 and I still hit canni.  Just cant help it.  Normally I keep health and mana at the same level.<br />
 Cant just sit still.  Have to run about and jump up/off stuff when trading/chatting/doing a boring camp etc.<br />
 All my spells have their slot.  From the top: Heal, Gate, Canni, Regen, Haste, EB, Root, Slow.  Only 3 I ever swap out are regen,haste and eb.  Sometimes now I am 55 swap out gate for superior heal for non fight healing.<br />
 Slots 7 &amp; 8 on ALL my hotkey panels are JBB and Canni.  I have tried having other things there but just cant help hitting those keys when trying to do one of the above.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Peeves:<br />
<br />
 People asking for buffs then running out of range.  If someone does this twice they dont get that buff anymore.<br />
 Used to hate having to cast HoS then Str and Dex.  I hate buffing enough as it is, I like to slow stuff then kick its ass, my pleasure in this game does not come from spending my life buffing people.  I do it, but dont enjoy it so was glad when they fixed that bug.  Typically they fixed it just as I hit 55 and now do Tnarg, Str, Dex but that doesnt irritate me as much for some reason.<br />
 Quad Kiters.  I realise this is the way the make xp but I HATE it when I turn up to places like CS, there are loads of spawns about then 2 dr00ds turn up and there is fook all for anyone else.  They also never seem to look where they are going and drag their mobs straight through you when you are fighting so suddenly you have 5 wyverns on you and your dog.<br />
 I really hate the fact that I have to spend a gajillion aaxp points to get my stupid ass dog not to run after every frikkin mob that tries to hit me.  It is bad enough that he seems to randomly wander round dungeons every once in a while and bring me back a whole load of mobs he was playing with, but to me that skill is just an insult.  Should have been a command from the start.<br />
 PST.  I am happy to become part of the Just Say No to PST group.<br />
 Plz.  Irritates the crap outta me.  If you want me to cast something on you you can at least go to the effort of typing Please.<br />
 Beggars.  The more I play this game the less polite I am to people asking me for stuff.<br />
 People inspecting me.  Quirks me if they do it once, but always figure they may have done it accidentally etc.  Had a chap following me round the Bazaar inspecting me yesterday, was red to me at 55 as well so wasnt a begger,  but everywhere I went I saw the message '&lt;irritating twat&gt; is inpecting you'.  Finally got peeved, turned round and did a /say WHAT DO YOU WANT?????.  He stopped.<br />
<br />
<br />

'Buffs faded' - Umm.. Who's buffs and what ones????<br />

Shaman that don't know what 'timed buffs' are.<br />

Always checking guild and friends lists.  Always saying Hi to folks when they log in.<br />

Biting people in greeting - especially in bear form :)<br />

Sticking my bear butt in people's faces while waiting for something to happen on a raid. };)<br />
<br />
Cannibalizing at full mana ;p  And I too make sure I don't have anything important set up on the same key I use for Cani on my other characters.<br />
<br />
Cooking stat food and giving it out on raids.  I love handing out pickled giant and giant steaks on Kael raids as we go along ;)<br />
<br />
I hate iron rations, I always tend to have some sort of stat food, even if it's just Paladin pickles.   Pickled Wurm, Giant and Centi steaks are my fav.<br />
<br />
I hang onto no-drop/lore items until I can figure out if they're for a quest or not and if I'd want to do it.  I have a couple bags of junk in the bank.<br />
<br />
Grav flux!! I *love* being Grav Fluxed! ;)<br />
<br />
I carry my keys, resist gear, eb item, fish scales, bat wings, and invis to undead potions everywhere I go so I can be prepared for anything that might come up :)<br />
<br />
When I die I immediately mem sow and invis and cast 'em if I can, no matter where I'm bound.  After almost getting killed by that stupid Drow in WC after dying on a Hate raid, I never sit there waiting for a rez without doing that.</div></div><hr />

i also keep everything just so.  spells in the same slot each time, and hotkeys always the same places.  Allows you to play reasonably well while watching TV, or in nearly any state of intoxification.<br />
<br />
always feel the need to pull in exp situations, assuming i can pull singles.  <br />
<br />
<br />
peeves-<br />
people who say hi to each other in ooc/shout channels.   send a tell, like i care who and how many friends you have.<br />
<br />
how mobs never dispell stat buffs, only focus/clarity/aego<br />
<br />
grow requests.  if you could only punch people through a cable line.  And shrinking a 10 group raid, on the flipside.<br />
<br />
groups that claim camps from the zoneline.  And then you see the ooc, &quot;such and such group looking for more&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Beli Mawr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I have a lot of alts, and my biggest pet peeves involve pick up groups.  I sometimes luck out and get a really god group, but usually they are...umm..how shall I say this...sub-optimal.<br />
<br />
I hate low level pick up groups where half the group is anon...and only the non-anon ones answer a class check.  Grrr.  Then I get to play guess-the-class.  Hmm, OK, we got one in a dress, I'm guessing caster.  Could be a monk...no, definitely not a monk, he's got a mug in each fist.  I don't SEE a pet, I'm going to rule out mage.  Further observation necessary.  Generic looking dwarf...OK, you might be a warrior or a paladin maybe?  Oh, the dwarf starts casting heals, ding ding ding we have a winner, he's a cleric!<br />
<br />
This is how things usually go in the low-level pick up groups I find myself in:<br />
<br />
We have a group of 5, no one is pulling despite everyone being FM.  Everyone mills around, or sits, or whatever.  I ask a few pertinent questions (&quot;so, who's puller?&quot;....no response.  &quot;Everyone at FM?  Shall we begin?&quot;...no response)  I finally deduce that we are waiting for our 6th to show up.  Except that he seems to be lost.  More sitting around.  Breaking news: the mysterious 6th joined a different group.  Time to search for another!  OK, we found a wizard.  One who even knows his way around the zone!  We expect him any minute now.  More sitting.  Then, finally:<br />
<br />
/so-and-so tells the group: Wizzy is here, plz invite.<br />
/groupleader says: Name?<br />
<br />
(Standing directly in front of groupleader is a caster in robes with a flapping, red, diapered familiar in tow. )<br />
<br />
/groupleader says: Name of wizzy?<br />
so-and-so points at ObviousWizzy.  Yeah you!<br />
/clueless member says: Do we have someone OTW? Cuz I got a guildy who wants to join.<br />
/so-and-so tells the group: Invite this wizzy plz!!!!!<br />
/groupleader tells the group: Who? this guy?<br />
ObviousWizzy has joined the group<br />
you tell your group: welcome, ObviousWizzy.<br />
/ObviousWizard tells the group: Sowme.<br />
You begin to cast a spell<br />
ObviousWizzy is surrounded by a lupine aura<br />
/ObviousWizard tells the group: Fook! I gtg. Dad needs to use phone.  I have a ranj3r OTW to replace me. L8ter doods.<br />
<br />
Prepare for more sitting around!<br />

<br />
-After playing a Monk to 56, I always destroy silver/copper... even when I'm not playing the Monk.<br />
<br />
-Having my inv window open. Constantly. Just something to do while sitting around. Check exp, check HP, check gear, etc etc.<br />
<br />
-Spellbook fiend. All spells must be in the same area of the book as the others of that kind.<br />
<br />
-Have to have every spell. Sense Animals, True North, I don't care, if I can scribe it I'll have it.<br />
<br />
-Trying to Canni when I'm not playing my Shaman. Oops.<br />
<br />

-People who ask me for a zing that have &gt; 100 sta.<br />
<br />
-People who use &quot;plz&quot; in association with &quot;sow&quot;. If you can't ask like you're literate, don't bother asking me.<br />
<br />
-HoS and Regrowth ALWAYS being dispelled. It never fails, if a dispell lands on me, I'll always lose one of those two buffs.<br />
<br />
-People who join a group and immediately ask what class everyone is. If you can't tell by now, I don't want you in my group. This is especially bad when everyone in the group has an epic.<br />
<br />
-eBayed characters. Die, now. I don't care how many characters you've played to level 30, you still suck at playing a 60 Chanter.<br />
<br />
-Being stunned by a backstab.<br />
<br />
-Losing all of my buffs if I zone with less than 1 bub of HP.<br />
<br />
-PEOPLE WHO TALK IN CAPS ALL THE TIME. Or even better... FOREIGN PEOPLE WHO TALK IN CAPS ALL THE TIME.<br />

-Clerics who demand gems but don't Symbol/Aego.<br />

-RL men with EQ women characters. Why, God? Why?<br />

-People who don't know the difference between: there, their, they're; who's, whose; your, you're; to, too; etc etc. Please show your education wasn't a complete waste.<br />
<br />
-Being in sight of a Luclin spire just as it goes off.<br />
<br />
-Being ported by a Luclin spire the moment you arrive. Two bonus points if you don't have a port shard either.<br />
<br />
-F8, line of sight, Y axis, etc. Not functional most of the time.<br />
<br />
-That occasional mob that resists *everything*. Random number generator, my ass.<br />
<br />
-Luclin. The most annoying cluster of zones I've ever experienced. Timesinks anyone?<br />
<br />
-People that invite me to join their guild out of the blue.<br />
<br />
-People recruiting for their guilds in public channels. Yeah, that's gotta be a quality organization.<br />
<br />
-People with the genius to come up with names like &quot;Luvkitten&quot;, &quot;Supratwinturbo&quot;, &quot;Drizzt&quot;, etc etc. Even better are the unpronounceable names, like &quot;Faeaeaeiiiallea&quot;.... or names starting with a double &quot;i&quot;.<br />
<br />
-The recast time on Bind Affinity. I guess it was way too unbalancing to be able to cast Bind immediately after memming it. Same goes for SoW.<br />
<br />
-Mraaka. Nuff said.<br />
<br />
-People who've been playing the game for three years, but don't know how to get from Freeport to Qeynos on foot. Or from Druid Ring X to anywhere else. It's best when they've been led through the zone a million times, but still can't do it on their own.<br />
<br />
-Rogues who refuse to be invised because they can Sneak/Hide at 0.3mph.<br />
<br />
-People who /shout &quot;Help!&quot;<br />
<br />
-Being killed by a green-con mob. Grrrr.<br />
<br />
-Attention whores. &quot;Soandso tells the group, 'I can't pull because my husband is at work and I'm so lonely and my kids are annoying me and everything is so terrible and will you please love me?'&quot;<br />
<br />
-Being told &quot;It's just a game.&quot;<br />
<br />
-Cheeseball roleplayers. Roleplaying is great when done well, but using &quot;aye&quot; and &quot;m'lord&quot; don't make you a roleplayer.<br />
<br />
-Requesting people click off their SoWs when I'm about to cast Bih`li, seeing &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot; x4, followed by &quot;sow plz&quot; three minutes later.<br />
<br />
-People who begin and end their sentences with &quot;lol&quot;.<br />

-People with a macro for EVERYTHING. I once grouped with an Enchanter who had &quot;AE stun on *** a krup ghoul knight ***&quot;. Another favorite is the assist macro. Just shut up and do it.<br />

======<br />
<br />
* While sorting through all the messages in the local &amp; global /auction channel, seeing people with messages like &quot;...want to buy uberitem_1, paying cash!&quot; Like when did the EQ banks start offering platinum credit cards?<br />
<br />
* Seeing real annoying messages in the local &amp; global /auction channel like this &quot;WTB uberitem_1 10k | uberitem_2 6k |uberitem_3 9k | uberitem_4 40k | uberitem_5 16k | uberitem_6 9k| uberitem_7 13k |uberitem_8 2k | uberitem_9 10k | uberitem_10 5k | uberitem_11 9k | uberitem_12 22k WTS PST&quot;. Even with the buying message in front, there are so many items and prices that it make it look like they're selling everything. After 5 minutes of this, the account that is posting this message every 10 seconds start posting rude comment to the /auction board saying that he wants to buy these items and stop sending stupid messages to him.<br />
<br />
* Spending endless hours looking for an item in the global chat channel, getting a response, spending 15 minutes discussing the price with a seller and only to have the guy say &quot;...I think I'm going to keep it and give it to my little brother&quot;. <br />
<br />
* Getting so tired from playing the game that the WTB begin to look like WTS.<br />
<br />

1. Buff order always the same.  Spirit of the Wolf has to be at the top or else I'll end up clicking something off just to get it at the top.  Don't ask me why!  Oh, and the right click Thurg bracer for Ultravision is always on, and usually the 2nd buff.<br />
<br />
2. Destroying silver and copper after every kill even if it's 1 of each.<br />
<br />
<br />
Peeves:<br />
<br />
1. People who say in guildchat &quot;hey guildmate_01, send me a tell!&quot; when the guildmate is both online, on their main, and chatting in guildchat - /boggle, why can't you just send them a tell yourself?<br />
<br />
2. Back in the Dreadlands days, people who would always ask for a haste refresh when I had it timed with my pet.  Not that they knew this, but it was still annoying.<br />
<br />
3. Same thing, back in the DL days, when everyone in the group would always want me to give them SOW, and they'd never move an inch.  I realize that &quot;you never know when you'll need it&quot; but it just irked me.<br />
<br />
4. Odd buff requests, such as an enchanter asking for a stamina buff constantly in a Chardok pick up group a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
5. People that ask me for SOW ever since I got my Black Fur Boots!</div></div><hr />

Must have spells in the same boxes. <br />
<br />
Must always have 100pp on me<br />
<br />
Canning when full mana<br />
<br />
Always slowing when another Shaman in the raid is slowing -- too ingrained.<br />
<br />
<br />
Peeves<br />
<br />
The word WOOT.  Cant stand it, dont really know  or want to know what I means.   Dont really know why I dont like it.   My own personal protest is to use the word PANCAKE in its place.   Makes as much sense, and, well, I like pancakes.<br />
<br />
Its DYING or LYING not DIEING or LIEING.  Even VI cant get it right.  During the Halloween event in WC they could not spell dying correctly.<br />
<br />
Strangers coming up to me when I have 2 Bubs of health and asking for buffs.   I am a healing class, if I had the mana to heal my self, I would heal myself.  If I dont, I dont have the mana to waste (not waist) on them.  Torpor has resolved much of this problem.<br />
<br />
drOOd  or dorf to describe druids or dwarves.   Maybe just because I am not 17 <br />
<br />
Prolly Is Probably that hard to type?<br />
<br />
Most dude speak in general  Ur was a city in Mesopotamia, not a spelling of your Phat Lewtz and the rest.  Probably a generational thing...<br />
<br />
K instead of OK.  Lets count the number of letters saved...<br />
<br />
KK is even worse-- not even a letter saved.<br />
<br />
People who give me grief because they think my price is to high on item X. Hey, if you think it is to high, dont buy it.<br />
<br />
After a group wipeout, people who leave before all bodies are recovered or resurrected.  Of course there are exceptions to this, it is the people who go of to do something in-game that are the offenders. <br />
<br />
Whining in general.<br />
<br />
The plural of Shaman is Shaman<br />
<br />
It is &quot;Koadics Endless Intellect&quot; no &quot;Kodiacs.&quot;<br />
<br />
The you give adviCe when you adviSe.  Use the correct word.  <br />
<br />
People who put &quot;season&quot; or &quot;winter&quot; instead of level.  Don't really know why it is annoying, but probably it makes them sound like a druid.<br />
<br />

<br />
It is not an English word. It is not sha + man (like fire + man).  The entire word &quot;shaman&quot; is Russian.  It does not conform to the English rules of pluralization.<br />
<br />
Main Entry: shaman <br />
Pronunciation: 'sh-m&amp;n, 'shA- also sh&amp;-'mn<br />
Function: noun<br />
Inflected Form(s): plural shamans<br />
Etymology: ultimately from Evenki (Tungusic language of Siberia) samAn<br />
Date: 1698<br />
1 : a priest or priestess who uses magic for the purpose of curing the sick, divining the hidden, and controlling events<br />
2 : one who resembles a shaman; especially : HIGH PRIEST 3<br />
- shamanic  /sh&amp;-'ma-nik, -'m-/ adjective <br />
<br />
So, keep using &quot;shamen&quot; if you want, but it's the kind of thing that makes my teeth itch.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
PS I consistently sing lyrics incorrectly, even after people tell me the correct lyrics.  I drove a coworker crazy yesterday but singing under my breath all day &quot;I'm coming up, I want the world to know<br />
Got to let it show,&quot; instead of &quot;I'm coming out&quot;  Yay, Diana Ross!</div></div><hr />

I'm j/k of course.  Hail, fellow TM-ian!<br />
<br />
P.S. -- I've heard people using that &quot;gn0mish&quot; phrase all over the place, but I must be out of the loop.  What does it mean? <br />
<br />
Hey Rodahn! Yay Tarew!<br />
<br />
Yeah, the list is long, and could be made longer pretty easily. Maybe someone should consolidate all of the most-common annoyances and make an EQ Ettiquette post someplace? Not like anyone would read it or abide by it, but the gesture has promise.<br />
<br />
The &quot;gn0mish&quot; thing is a Trynytye (I freaking hate that name, add bastardized spellings of common names to my list) trademark. He/she (a she-male player, too) has a hotkey which does:<br />
<br />
&quot;Trynytye sex0rz~ %T gn0mishly.&quot;<br />
<br />
....as well as....<br />
<br />
&quot;Trynytye hugs %T for 5,000 points of gn0mishness!&quot; Or something equally as lame.<br />
<br />
It's just a d00d spelling of &quot;Gnome&quot;, the same as &quot;n0am&quot;, etc. It also means you're a card-carrying member of the &quot;About To Receive A Sizeable Train From Chikarsis&quot; Club. It's pretty exclusive, hard to get into these days. Mostly because it's full.</div></div><hr />

(1) People who say, &quot;Sow plz&quot;. Now, if you want my damned Sow you better gimme a damned good reason to load it from my spellbook :cool:.  Once I was asked by one person, &quot;Sow plz&quot;, and up came another who said, and I quote, &quot; O mighty shaman, might I have a SoW please?&quot; Guess which one got it...<br />
<br />
(2) Newbs who act like my only purpose in this whole damned game is to buff them. I was doing IGs and had to rebuff, k? I was at like 20m, 80 health, with a giant about 1.7 minutes from popping. So I buff up and start to canni low. About half way through this low-lvl shaman walks up and says, &quot;Can you buff me?&quot; Now, I would have done it had she waited for me to regain my mana and such, but this gal was in some big hurry. Every 1 minute she'd make a comment about buffs. Finally I told her I was way to pressed for mana to buff, and that I was sorry. Get this, SHE calls ME a jerk, gives me a run-down of why I should buff HER, and then turns her a$$ around to ask the mage at the other camp for a DS. He had been watching and said...well....HELL NO. I am NOT here to PL you with buffs, if you want em, you wait for em.<br />
<br />
(3) Enchanters, only a select few, who scream bloody murder when they draw agro, and then get royally pissed when I slow and DoT the mob to draw agro in order to save their arse. I know they want to mezz, but when the tanks are busy and they're gettin pounded on, I do what I can to keep them alive. Mind you these are only a select few.<br />
<br />
(4) This only happened once, and I was in Splitpaw at the time. I had a cleric say this to me in group chat, &quot;Gar, you heal the tanks, while I nuke the mobs to death.&quot; That cleric was in the group another 3 seconds before the leader kicked her arse.<br />
<br />
Bad Habits:<br />
<br />
(1) I have to stay at 3.8654324578 - 4 bubbles of health, no matter what. I'll cannibalize to that amount even at full health...:rolleyes: <br />

<br />
Um...grouping together is TEAMWORK.  Sabotoging the other group members isn't the best idea. Mobs are either MEZZED or DOTTED, not both and it's a good idea to decide which way it's going to be BEFORE the pull.<br />
<br />
Why?  You dot, the enchie mezzes, the enchie has aggro and now has an angry, unmezzable mob beating the snot out of him.<br />
<br />
It's okay to decide that it's more efficient to root/dot and &quot;cook&quot; the mobs instead of mezzing...but it's important to make sure the enchanter knows what you're planning.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I guess &quot;protecting the enchie&quot; is MY playstyle quirk...considering my real life love played an enchie to 57.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cannying too much.<br />
<br />
Benefit spells on the top half, offensive spells on the bottom half, root, heal, and canni are never unmemed. <br />
<br />
JBB, MA, and Slow on the same key on each keypad.<br />
<br />
Protect the chanter at all costs.<br />
<br />
Spellbook must be organized. Each level I have to re-arrange the darn thing. All buffs together, all offensive together, heals, etc. I have been known to re-organize other people's spellbooks *laughs* but I do ask first!<br />
<br />
People who don't realize that when I'm the only shaman on a raid that everyone can't have ALL the buffs. (I'm always the only shaman too. /sigh) - my guild is working out a great buffing strategy though! The only 60 Cleric and I do the buffs(group aego - HoS, group sta and agi), she mod2's, I canni, and all non-clerics heal us up. Saves a lot of downtime.<br />
<br />
Checking inventory often to make sure my current equip matches my current group role.<br />
<br />
Peeves -<br />
Sow Plz. I really wish our boots could cast on others. <br />
<br />
People who think shaman can't pull. Then I go and pull a single blue out of ten mobs just to prove them wrong.<br />
<br />
Clerics who heal me when I'm just canning down, and then we have to wait for them to med. Let the FM druid heal me.<br />
<br />
Clerics who don't heal me when I'm yelling OUCH in group because I'm getting pasted by a mob who resisted slow.<br />
<br />
Anyone who can heal who isn't backing up the cleric when the **** hits the fan.<br />
<br />
People who won't freakin sit still. ESPECIALLY on a raid. There is zero reason to be bouncing around and it is distracting, and usually dangerous. Sit your butt down. Stand up on INC though <br />
:D <br />
<br />
People who argue with me while I'm leading a raid. If you have a suggestion, that's great, but don't piss me off, I'm busy here.<br />
<br />
People who lead raids badly. /shudder  (It's soooooo hard to not step on their toes)<br />
<br />
People who think that spamming/dueling/generally goofing off is ok when you're on a raid in the pit of hell and a single mistake means hours of CR. /grrrrrr<br />
(I lead a good portion of my guild's raids, and I'm a tyrant <br />
;) can ya tell? However, we have a great sucess rate and have a lot of fun!)<br />
<br />
People/groups/guilds who run over other people to get somewhere without even talking about it to work out a compromise.<br />
<br />
Think thats about it. :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">I would like to start with peeves, then I'll hit my quirks.  Might sound negative, but its early for me and I'm grouchy right now so I have a valid excuse.  ;)<br />
<br />
Peeves (not in any order)<br />
<br />
1)  People spamming shout/ooc  for whatever.  Asking for something a few times or only once every few minutes is fine, but asking like 5-7 a minute gets old real fast.  I guess they figure that annoying someone is what is needed to get an answer.<br />
<br />
2) People answering a question with some stupid, worthless answer.   (Example: 1st person asking when the next portal goes up or down and the reply from someone is something along the lines they the should pick their nose and and eat what they remove to get their answer.)   Obviously someone not very mature, but a waste of text on my screen nevertheless.  Funny, don't see many of these types of folks at the high levels.  (Oh darn)<br />
<br />
3) Loot hogs.   Everyone pays for this game.  Everyone should have a fair and equal shot at loot.  Simple as that.<br />
<br />
4) People who grouped with you and then have to log less than 30 minutes after joining becuase its time for bed or dinner.<br />
<br />
5) People who demand an item drop for their twink when it is needed by someone who is their with their main.<br />
<br />
6) Being deneid a tp becuase I play a shaman and have Sow.   (Don't ask me why, I am clueless here.  Fortunately only happened once.)<br />
<br />
7) Having non-shamans tell me what my buffs do.   I'm well aware what they do, I cast them just about every day I play.<br />
<br />
8) Druids KSing.  Used to be a problem until it dawned on me to simple use root with poison dots.  Stoped that real fast.<br />
<br />
9) Beggars.<br />
<br />
10) Someone once told me they found Cann 4 on a merchant and was saving it for their level 25 shaman.  I'm not impressed with folks that like to boast they got something for just buying it.  Getting a deal on a purchase is one thing.  Getting something just to boast about for a twink is a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Ok, enough venting.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Quirks<br />
<br />
1)  Having my fingers hang over the keys to cann.<br />
<br />
2) Being to polite/socialbe and trying answer every tell nicely and in complete sentences (must be the writer in me).  <br />
<br />
3) Wanting to loot just once in every zone.  *chuckles* I just have this curiosity to loot and see what mobs can drop.  After I do it once, I might want not to loot for another 8-10 kills.<br />
<br />
4) Very faction concious.  Hate losing factions important to me.<br />
<br />
5) Having my containers organized on me in a particular way.<br />
<br />
6) Asking a lot what buffs folks need during a raid.  I just love to buff.<br />
<br />
7) I like to DD as well.  When I'm not needed to slow or cripple, I DD.<br />
<br />
8) Melee.  Ever since I got my defense high enough for phase spiders in DN to miss me a few times in a row and of course get agro from slows, I just stay there and crush/poke away.   Anyone who asks why I'm even bothering, I just reply that I'm neutralizing a mobs regen.  :)<br />
<br />
9) I like facing a situation that is difficult.  An example is when I was the only shaman on a raid.  I had to buff and slow.  That can be a challenge when you have 15 tanks and constant pulls.  I like having to plan my line up of buffs and on who, cann when I can, but keep things moving.  Think of it like the level right before information overload.  This is where EQ can be fun for me.<br />
<br />
10) Trying to memorize spawn/drop tables.  Just trying to make my time effecient while playing.  ;)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I'm talking about when they already have agro, and are getting eaten alive. Regardless, I'm going to do what I can to draw agro off them. I'd rather pull agro with slow, then DoT so i KNOW they're going to come after me. Plus, EBolt only lasts 45 seconds...<br />
<br />
Just be sure you clear your intentions with the enchies FIRST..if an enchie is getting pummeled, generally they will try to stun and then mez.  So, it's possible that they still might be able to grab aggro back from you and get turned into enchie pate.<br />
<br />
I normally did the root &quot;it's rooted, back up&quot; to save my enchie. (we did have the advantage of playing side by side, so it was very easy to verbally communicate what I was doing).  That and slow, a slowed mob is a far less dangerous mob.<br />
<br />
I would have to think, that if the enchanters are pissed at you for dotting, that you aren't doing a good job communicating what you are doing.  Or they have said, &quot;please don't dot, I'm trying to mez&quot; and you ignored them.  <br />
<br />
Dots or mez, not both.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">It's only a select few, as I said. I've run into 3 chanters in my career that have done this. I always tell the casters that if they draw agro to let me know, including enchanters. I'm just making sure they stay alive, and yes, I DO tell them I plan to DoT and slow. Usually they understand and we do our thing, but every one ina million don't seem to care what I try to do to save their arse, which usually gets them dead. If my slow gewts resisted, ands they don't cast, I can usually steal their agro. BUT if the slow dun stick, and they keep trying to mezz...well....we get a dead enchanter... But I do understand what you're sayin Glor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">1) Dr00d speak<br />
2) Buying batwings when only down 1, same for food and fish scales<br />
3) Checking the exp bar alot<br />
4) When my pet dies soloing, 50% of the time, I go LFG afterwards or leave.<br />
5) Groups who don't want to try that &quot;hard&quot; mob, even though we are waiting for repops and are all FM.  Even if it will be an easy fight.<br />
6) Raids that get started way late because people log in 10 minutes after it was supposed to start asking if they can come, need someone to pick them up, then wait... I have to buy food...<br />
7) People who leave the camping spot to buy food.  This happens alot in Solb.  I can understand if you are 1000 lbs. overweight, but just ask someone in the group to summon it for you.<br />
8) Casting useless buffs on people, like haste on the druid who likes to melee.<br />
9) People who think Shamans shouldn't pull, I have pulled Solb and the Hole plenty of times, and never gotten the group killed.</div></div><hr />

(3) Enchanters, only a select few, who scream bloody murder when they draw agro, and then get royally pissed when I slow and DoT the mob to draw agro in order to save their arse. I know they want to mezz, but when the tanks are busy and they're gettin pounded on, I do what I can to keep them alive. Mind you these are only a select few.<br />
<br />
I hear Cripple and Insidious Decay are good taunts....</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who just roll up on you and inspect are NEVER polite, friendly passers-by who are curious about something you're wearing. They are ALWAYS beggar d00dz.<br />
<br />
It's a simple issue of respect. People who respect you as a fellow player will actually TALK to you, ask intelligent questions about something you have, and ask before they inspect. People who don't do not respect you. They see you as just another mark or potential buff source.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Yup cripple pulls great aggro and it fast cast and no recast.<br />
<br />
I use it for that very purpose when grouped with enchanters when they get aggro.<br />
<br />
Of course I'm rarely grouped with enchanters so normally I just pull a mob away with slow/bane and root it. But with an ench slow/cripple is preferable. After all I only need to take aggro long enough for them to stun it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Quirks:<br />
<br />
Love playing with clerics with clicky valour buff - heals 200ish? hitmpoints for no mana. I just wish I had canni2!<br />
<br />
Always have gate memmed. Haven't used it in an emergency for a loooooong time - always have root memmed. Have used it in an emergency daily! Also have heal, canni, regen always memmed, always in the same place.<br />
<br />
Emote on cannidance button. Irritates everyone I'm sure! But, no-one's complained about it, but I do get several complements (&quot;Shaben bites her arm and chews thoughtfully&quot;).<br />
<br />
Prefer to play with just 1 or 2 melees rather than a full group. Just seems more efficient, and more fun.<br />
<br />
Love JB buffs. Hate normal buffing if only healer.<br />
<br />
Fashion freek. Try to keep up full plate look.<br />
<br />
Shrinking / growing groupmates when possible (in dungeon, slow pull rate or waiting for pops). Shrinking myself when in bearform (and following druids around whilst anon!)<br />
<br />
Taking revenge on Mobs when I come back and am higher levels. I still take perverse pleasure in killing those damn undead musicians. And hill giants. And griffins. And most of permafrost - carnage I tell you!<br />
<br />
Not killing intelligent beings unless they attack me first. Well, I broke this by killing genoids for lots of cash gems. Felt bad about that. But I did tell them they'd ruined their lands, they'll not ruin mine!<br />
<br />
No &quot;original&quot; peeves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, you show me a chanter that can take a beating for 45 seconds while your EBolt wears off.  No how, no way.  DOTs have nowhere near the agro of a mez spell.  If you DOT a mob a chanter is trying to mez, the chanter is going to get pounded to a pulp.  If you want to get agro from a chanter, slow the mob and SIT DOWN.  You will immediately draw agro and the chanter then can mez much easier.  <br />
<br />
Never, ever dot a mob an Enchanter is trying to mez...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">If you want to draw aggro off an enchanter for ANY reason. Don't cast a Dot on it.<br />
<br />
Root it and stand on its toes. It will beat on you Even if the chanter has 1 hit point. Since you have good AC and HP (You do I hope) you will take a few hits while the chanter recovers his wits from teh almost death and will mez the Un dotted critter.<br />
<br />
Root is your friend. It is more powerful than a heal. It gives you the one thing in combat you need most. Time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Quirks :<br />
<br />
- Heal, canna, bane, dd (swapped for buffs etc at need), root, slow, malosi, haste (swapped for buffs if enc in group)<br />
- Seeing how long I can last on one bag of food.  Don't go buy more until I have see either &quot;You are low on water/food&quot; msg.<br />
- Bag's organised in same way, with same stuff always!<br />
- Holding onto useless items on the off chance that someone, somewhere may make a char that might need them.<br />
- Not buying equipment.  Tend to wait until I raid/group somewhere that I can pick up the item I want. (Exception JBB which I am trying to buy on The Nameless now PST!) :D <br />
<br />
Peeves :<br />
<br />
- People that ask for buffs, only to have you cast them and not stick.<br />
- People that send tells saying &quot;Can I ask you something&quot; only to go on begging you for equipment.  I don't mind helping people that ask for advice about stuff.<br />
- Clerics that don't heal me after a big canna session.  A good way to make them see the error of their ways is to stop slowing mobs so they have to heal the tanks more.<br />
- People that run up inspect and run off, without even looking at what you have.</div></div><hr />
