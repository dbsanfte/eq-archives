<br />
I just saw a performance at a local college, I went out and bought the DVD and a CD soundtrack.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got the horse right here <br />
The name is Paul Revere <br />
And here's a guy that says that the weather's clear <br />
Can do, can do, this guy says the horse can do <br />
If he says the horse can do, can do, can do. &quot;<br />
<br />
Sky: &quot;I am not insinuating that you are clocking Mindy's cheesecake, but I will bet you the same $1,000 you cannot tell me the color of tie which you are wearing right now.&quot;<br />
Nathan: &quot;..........No bet!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Sky: &quot;My old man once told me: 'I regret that I cannot stake you to a good bankroll so I will therefore stake you to some very good advice. One day you will come across a man who has a deck of cards on which the seal has not been broken. This man will bet you that he can make the jack of spades jump out of the deck and squirt cider in your ear. Son, do not take that bet, for sure as you do, you will end up with cider in your ear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luck be a lady tonight <br />
Luck be a lady tonight <br />
Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with <br />
Luck be a lady tonight. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It says here: <br />
The average unmarried female <br />
Basically insecure <br />
Due to some long frustration may react <br />
With psychosomatic symptoms <br />
Difficult to endure <br />
Affecting the upper resperatory tract. <br />
<br />
In other words, just from waiting around for that plain little band of gold <br />
A person can develop a cold. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
It's the best!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit, running the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York.  Marlon Brando showing he could do it all, even kind of sing and dance, a little.<br />
<br />
The musical was based on the works of a very talented columnist and author named Damon Runyan.  If you have never seen the live show, watch for it next time it comes to town, community theater can usually do a good performance, high schools even have a chance at it.  The movie is one of those rarities, almost as good as the live show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That school has some amazingly talented kids.</div></div><hr />
