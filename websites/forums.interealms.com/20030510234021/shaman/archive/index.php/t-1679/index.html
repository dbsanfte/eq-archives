<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Trooper Vayrk (or something like that) is back in business again in LoIO. So if you have some explorer knives you can turn them in for faction. I havent had time to check if you can still buy the knives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Saw that Vuark is back in use, but I bet he is there only because the knives are not sold anymore.  Gonna check Rathe anyhoo.<br />
<br />
Even if they got rid of the vendor something tells me the mindless hours of camping required to get enough knives is still going to be MUCH less than the bone chip madness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I managed to buy the knives before they were taken off the vendors. Boy am I glad I held onto them. After the last patch the trooper was indeed back in place and accepting knives again so I turned mine in.  After only 14 stacks my faction was maxed (at indiferent, I am tribunal barb) with all faction hits on this quest. This was without any prior faction work for the factions other than legion of Cab. Id say the faction hit for this quest is MUCH better than bone chips for sure. Maybe VI removed the daggers from vendors but upped the faction gain? <br />
<br />
Anyone tried, with indiferent faction, to do the cudgel quest after the patch?</div></div><hr />
