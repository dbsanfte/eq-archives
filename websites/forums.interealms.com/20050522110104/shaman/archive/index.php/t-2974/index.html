<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, <br />
I just dinged to 27 last night and was wondering about wisdom, when is it good to go for HP AC over wis. I don't want to totally neglect wisdom of course, but I stress HP &gt; AC &gt; Wis for the most part so far. I've got 137 wisdom at lvl 27 and am about to change out my charred guardian shield (+9 wis) for a Sarnak Battle Shield a friend gave me (+0 wis). I guess I'm trying to ask when it's best to get some + wis gear, when will it be most beneficial to me.. thanks for any help :)<br />
<br />
BTW, 650 HP/613 AC unubuffed ATM :p</div></div><hr />

Are you FM, but can't take a hit?<br />
<br />
Depends on play style - do a search on the topic and check out the thread about a person with a 136 WIS.</div></div><hr />

Not even 10 times in the past week!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ralahast...for my own play style, AC is king over everything else. I personally rate AC over HP and HP over WIS. At 30 I have AC of about 740ish self-buffed, 867 HPs and a WIS of 120ish. I can easily tank 2 blues and at end of fight have usually 60%-75% mana and 75%-90% health. I have yet to run out of mana..solo or grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AC &gt; All until you hit the soft-cap (1100-1200), start raiding at a high level (55+), and get Cannibalization.  At that point HP becomes more important.  Wisdom doesn't factor into this anywhere.  It's simply not an important stat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HP, AC, and WIS would be my top three stats.  That being said, I try to concentrate on ALL stats equally.<br />
There is no stat that &gt; all, IMO, but that's just my playstyle.<br />

Seek a balance, grasshoppa, seek a balance.</div></div><hr />
