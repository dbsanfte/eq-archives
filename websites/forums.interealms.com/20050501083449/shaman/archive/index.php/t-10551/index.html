<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kadira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With just under a yellow left til 52, I returned to KC to solo near LCY as I waited on guildies to get on for our raid.  <br />
<br />
There was a 3 team group there, and they were doing pretty good.  We worked out an arrangement where I would take their adds.  <br />
<br />
A bit later, a shaman joined them.  I told them then I would start working the 3rd or 4th add since they now had a shaman.  The shaman sent me a tell saying &quot;why?&quot;<br />
<br />
I laughed and replied, &quot;whoops, okies, I'll wander to the basement.&quot; <br />
<br />
As I turned to go, the entire group shouted in unison:  &quot;NO!&quot;<br />
<br />
I was perplexed, as the shaman adamantly requested I stay under the &quot;same policy as before&quot;, (his words, not mine).<br />
<br />
Well as fate would have it, a group comes flying through with a fair train.  I go into the usual slow, root, dot pattern, working the adds and spreading them out.  I herd the 4-man group to the center of LCY as I now have all sorts of decorations on the walls, (some of whom are casting).  <br />
<br />
I put dogdog on on of the casters, and the other shaman starts pumping heals in my direction.  <br />
<br />
Two break root, I put one back where I had him, and other shaman roots the first.. only glitch is that he stuck it in the middle of the room.  I re-dot both and nuke to break the root, pull the mob to the wall with the others and re-root. <br />
<br />
By then, the train is pretty much dead, I am Canni-dancing, and the last two break root almost simultaneously.  The shaman manages to get a root on one, gets resisted and almost killed on the other (slow faded), but the rest of the group dispatches it. <br />
<br />
After about 15 minutes of conversation, I explain to the shaman to keep HoS up at all times with chloro, open with slow then drag them away and root/dot as needed.  <br />
<br />
I then telll the shaman to visit www.eqshaman.com, click on message boards and review The Shaman's Crucible.   The young shaman. (my level) was not bad, but seemed to get flustered with more than one add.  I explained that the trick is to slow 'em, spread 'em out, then work them down, or, if you see no way out, call for the evac.<br />
<br />
By the time I left, that 4 person group was able to handle what looked like 3 adds, so another job well done. <br />
<br />
What floored me, is that later we hit the guild raid in PoN and I saw a 59 shaman making the same mistakes.  I asked the shaman what was their alt, he replied &quot;63 enchanter&quot; .  I said, get root out (he did not have it memmed), and use it like a single target mezz.  He laughed, &quot;stack them n rack them, heh&quot;.  I said &quot;yuppers, because only half my stuff are sticking.&quot;  <br />
<br />
He told the raid, &quot;changing line up, Kadira now working slows and heals, execpt when she resisted LOL&quot;<br />
<br />
He told me that he made the shaman becuase his guild needed a slower, and pl'd to 58 in a couple of weeks.  He spent the rest of the evening asking all sorts of questions, and ultimately, I sent him to Misty Thicket to practice aggro management on diseased rats.  He later told me that MT was now &quot;required training&quot; for new members.<br />
<br />
POINT:  Most of the &quot;new&quot; shamans are pretty good at working their traditional roles, however, the full range and usage of their spells and abilities seem to elude them on occasion.  EVERY shaman I have diffidently (key word there) offered advice too has recieved that advice happily.  <br />
<br />
At 51, I supposed I have darn near mastered my abilities to this point, but I paid for that knowledge with soe much time played getting to 51 I am almost ashamed to admit it, LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, that's one of those things that used to seperate good players from average players. Back when i played my ranger (when they were basically the walking dead) one reason i always got a group was I was very capable of peeling mobs off, and rooting them away from the group. Allowed a karnors group to do alot more then it could normally without an enchanter (note this is like 3 years ago I know it's kinda silly now). I find the same rules apply now a days, as a shaman when I'm grouped i do the normal buffing and slowing, but if no crowd control is present, I will slow then DOT to nab agro (If they ever do fix our DoT agro this will be one reason i will miss it ^^) and park it.<br />
<br />
Sadly, with the lack of dungeon fighting now this skill won't be learned as often. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is some of the most fun a shaman can have....<br />
<br />
I even had a monk FD train me on purpose once in HHK and just resorted to slow root parking adds.<br />
<br />
I killed 3 before I had to zone (started fight with only 1 bub of mana) and the monk vacated for good.<br />
<br />
Slow is the key.... slow is 75% of a mez even if you dont root park [ casters excepted ].  Root Parking is the skill that makes a shaman an artist instead of just a powerfull slow caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Root parking is definately a great skill to obtain, but it's so much more fun to tank stuff =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's amazing how many people don't know this basic stuff.  I'm played on a 2nd computer, I get maybe 40% of my player's brain time, yet I'm a better shaman than many I see out there and due to my limited capacity I can only play myself 2/3rds of my potential.  Very sad.  I should always play second fiddle when grouped with another shammy, yet so often I end up being the main debuffer/slower/healer/parker...</div></div><hr />

You are either the bravest person in the world or a complete fewl ;)<br />

I goruped with a 63 sham last night in PoD.  But it must have been someones alt cause he didnt have his epic,  didnt cann and was in PoD at 63.  I say that becuase this person was in one of the upper guilds on my server.  But it all worked out.  <br />
<br />
That's probably the 2nd time i have grouped with another shaman in 6months or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't really think it's a shaman problem as much as with EQ in general. You don't see many clerics healing to grab agro then root parking the adds these days either. <br />
<br />
Same goes for druids, given a bit of room to maneuver and mobs that aren't immune to snare, the good druids can also work wonders when it comes to keeping adds busy. But given the amount of whining that went on at DG after they increased agro on iCH, I get the feeling that 90% of the druids out there had never cast a heal in a dungeon before they got iCH. <br />
<br />
SoE hasn't helped matters either. Now you have trivial outdoor zones to lvl to 65 fast, all it takes is little time, no skill required. The players that leveled slower in the early days had a lot more time to learn. From what I gather, once you get to 65 many mobs will be root/snare immune, hit for over 500 and often mitigate slow. Not exactly the ideal environment for a shaman doing CC. They've narrowed the options so much lately that it's less about skill and more about what gear you have. <br />
<br />
Finally, I think all of the 2-boxers have something to do with it. Most of 'em are convinced that they can bot a shaman or cleric just as well as they could play as a main. Unfortunately, they're right. Even if they're only playing the cleric/shaman, they still tend to play em as a bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What is amazing is most people do not know how good Shaman are for crowd control. There have been many time that the group I was with started freaking out on a 3 incoming without a Chanter. I have a hot key set up that basically says Calm down the Shaman is here to save your hides. Slow Slow Slow, Root Root, Dot, dot Dot, heal, heal. <br />
<br />
The Group has a good time and are opened to what a Shaman is capable of.<br />
<br />
Too many times I am stuck in a group that expects nothing of a Shaman other than buffs and Slows. I have found that the groups that I get tend to expect more of the Shaman they group with after I'm gone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I played my original shaman back pre-kunark, and I must say, a properly played shaman is one of the most useful, powerful classes out there. We never had a cleric, but would do things in one group most people could only dream of.<br />
<br />
A badly played shaman, is a waste of a character.<br />
<br />
POP makes the game alot easier, and ya, it is too easy to level now, too easy to twink, a ton of characters of all classes out there that are just terrible.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My experience is that root-parking isn't as useful in the planes. Simply because root breaks too often. Having a snarer in the group aggro things around in circles wirks pretty well though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree Zoulen, and also note that if you're not in a PoP zone way below your capabilities, your MT cannot tank 3 long enough to get them all slowed with Turgur's and root parked.  You can gamble with Tigir's and no MR debuff, but if you do the typical Malosini-Turgur combo , the tank is dead before you get the third mob slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Root parking with shaman is so easy.  Try learning to do it with a druid! =)  My first char over 50 was a druid, and this was when kunark first came out.  I learned root-parking in KC as well (before it became newbie haven).  Just snare or something for aggro, and pull things away and root.  I never died.  I was a bit of a ballsy druid if I do say so myself.  I remember we'd get an over-pull, and I'd say &quot;you guys go zone, i'll fend them off&quot;.  I'd kite mobs around, root parking so we wouldn't train, and the melees/casters would zone.  I rocked heheh.  With a shammy this is so easy it's sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Something Ive done many times in outdoor zones is run the adds around the chanter untill they can mez after the first is mezed ill turn and root whats left till chanter has time to mez the rest. Ive also done this when an add cant be rooted works wonders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In a non PoP zone the slow-sit-root method of CC is downright amazing and will always impress a group when you save their asses from a nasty pull. Also, peeps really appreciate our pet a lot more when you sick it on a caster mob that's parked so it's not nuking others in your group.<br />
<br />
In a PoP zone though...ugh..root either is resisted or lasts 2 seconds and even after a malosini it hardly lasts long enough. Trying to manage malosini+root+slow while mobs are hitting for 300+ is just too much sometimes. No problem with one add but you can't pull off those amazing stunts of root parking 4-5 mobs like you can in a non PoP zone unless you get really lucky with resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The 62 root spell usually goes to duration unless broken with a dd spell.  Until then our roots suck in pop.  Not sure how effective our lower level roots were in luclin or high end content pre pop because i didnt do any of it till I hit level 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've grouped with some seriously crappy shaman in DL on my alt....course i've grouped with some seriously crappy players of all types there.<br />

Owell, back to PLing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">***, shaman get root?!?!??!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The 64 root actually seems to work pretty well in PoP a lot of the time.  I notice more root breakage in HoH than I do in PoV, could just be bad luck though.  I know I seem to die every time I try to solo/duo in HoH LOL Not my zone!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, I will admit that I haven't been playing EQ that long, let alone a shaman, or have I had to worry about having to do the slow, slow, slow, root, root, root, thing yet, but I was thinking this over and came up with a  question. If the mobs are all stacked on top of one another, how do you target them individually.  Is it just keep clicking the mouse till you get the next one, or is there a key to toggle between mobs, or do you try and get them while incoming (but that would draw aggro, wouldnt it?).  Please offer some insight to this.<br />
<br />
<br />
***Now returning to your usual intelligent thread***</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Target one slow root move back a few steps so they are out of range and repeat proccess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Slow has a nice aggro built into it. if you slow a mob that is not engaged you can pretty much garauntee he is coming for you. When he gets to you root him and move to the next. You need some room to do this well. The amount of space depends on teh number of adds but you want enough space so each can be handled without dealing with the others ideally. The reality is a little more situational though. <br />
<br />
Always keep slow and root up and you will get out of most situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I disagree with the people saying that root is useless in PoP. Admittedly, at my level (61) it isn't all that useful past the tier 1 planes but root parking has never been very dependable when facing mobs that are close to your level. <br />
<br />
I've always used immobilize since the mid 50s and it's served me well (in combination with Mal-x) in the T1 planes in. Having a druid along makes it even easier. They always seem to have a 3 minute root up and if you train 'em to overwrite your root once you've got a mob parked out of the way and malo'd, it makes a pretty potent combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Root's definitely not useless, but the duration of the 3-minute Root in Tactics is 90% of the time not 3 minutes. Usually you're better off going with Greater Immob because it's faster-casting, uses less mana, and has a better resist check (-30 MR).<br />
<br />
I'm usually the puller and CC guy for my normal exp group, and if our tank's not around, that's my job too. Lotta fun, and I'm finding I get bored if I don't do at least two of those things now =\</div></div><hr />
