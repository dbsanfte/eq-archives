<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Remus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I believe I am now 190 in Alchemy... and I have a number of other trade skills from the 180s to 190s range, with only Blacksmith at 200.<br />
<br />
No trade skills of any kind are over 200, yet after 100+ combines I can not get my smithing skill over 200.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else has this problem?<br />
<br />
I usually have my wis &amp; str at the cap of 280.  I am not using the tinkered item to boost my skills during combines.<br />
<br />
Since I went past the old skill cap for Alchemy at L60 I am afraid that counted as my &quot;1&quot; trade skill to go over the cap of 200.  Thats the only thing I can think of...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if a GM can look at your skills and see if you are bugged?  Hard to believe that I cant get even 1 skill up after 100+ combines since they made smithing easier to level up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am also a 200 Smith.  200 Fletcher.  190's in Baking/Fishing. 160's Tailor. 170's Brewer.  180's Jewelcraft.  Low 100's alchemy. :p<br />
<br />
You have run into your own personal wall at 200 smithing.  The skill-up will come eventually.  Combine attempts in excess of 400 have been known to occur without a skill-up in smithing before.<br />
<br />
The trouble zone generally starts in the high 180's and drops in the 220's from everything I've read.  I've been posting at Eqtrader's for a long time, and the Primal Scream section history is FULL of threads like yours, wondering if something is broken after making XXX # of attempts.<br />
<br />
188-189 have been my personal enemies while skilling up.  Each time it took an inordinate # of combines to get past those 2 points.  After that, a skill up every 20-30 combines (20 being my goal) resumed.  YMMV.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
