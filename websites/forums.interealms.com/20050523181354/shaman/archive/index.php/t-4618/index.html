<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. When I first made my shaman, I didn't know much at all about the shaman class. Since they were a WIS-caster, I put 25 into Wis and 5 into Sta I think. Did I make a mistake? Will it affect my solo-ing career in the future?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you are fine, play on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If anything, you did it perfectly.  In retrospect, I'm sorry I didn't use my 5 remaining points in STA.  Maxing out WIS is the best idea, for certain.<br />
<br />
As Kariina said, play on!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what else would you put them into?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You will find, in time, that initial stats mean very, very little in the long run, and what might be technically best later in life often makes the lower levels harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All stats can be raised as you get better gear.<br />
<br />
Initial stats dont mean anything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's what I did too.  Worked well so far...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I put 14 points into dex at start.<br />
<br />
Hey the book said it was the stat for offensive combat. I wanted to hit more. (and it was March of 1999)<br />
<br />
God that book was so wrong on so many levels. (Grins)<br />
<br />
You are fine. Play your shaman and enjoy the bility and power that the class entails. But know this. You are not an elf. You are not a druid. You are a shaman. Born and bred, for battle and pain.<br />
<br />
Fight like it is your last breath, and be generous to your friends. Walk with pride, and carry a big big hammer...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lol, idiot me put 10 into Str ;)<br />
<br />
Level 60 now and doing fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
 Kamidari, I wish I could bookmark that qoute and haul it out everytime a high lvl player berates a beginning shaman on having a 'high' wis.<br />
<br />
Absolutely correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Putting most points into wis for a wis caster good, If you had said i had put 25 into int now that might be a different story heh. Now go Keel stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stupid me actually thought those green stats meant something, so I ended up NOT maxing wis and settling it down to a round 100, while splitting the rest between sta and...CHARISMA! Yes I can hear you all groaning now :) But in the end it's never really bothered me much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah. speaking of idiots I put 5 into wis, and the rest into stamina. Sure I've got some extra hp now but my wisdom always seems very low :(  I have over 1500 hp buffed, 850 ac buffed, and about 170 wisdom in bear form. Doesn't seem too bad but I run oom a lot :( Level 47 now btw :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>xemical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I put 10 points into charisma. :confused: 4 into wis, rest into str / dex i think. i made it like a D&amp;D character, spread them around. go go charisma!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i put 15 point into int and im doing fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">after hearing go go charisma i feel so much better about my charisma....60 shaman doing just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">OK, you screwed up if you didn't put all your points into a stat that avoids:  groups where the puller overpulls, soloing where people pull trains over the top of you and you thinking &quot;what the hell, that named is BTM, he's lower level, I can take him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, as far as I've seen in the game so far, there is no stat that does those things.  You did just fine  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Im just asking because I saw a post and it had some information about putting all my starting points into Stamina because then I would be able to canni more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">what ? noone else followed the guidebook in 1999 and put points into CHA ? shame on you ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dulthun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am also in the school of starting stats don't mean much.  I have a lvl 55 WE warrior.  Starting STA was 75.  I put all points in STR not knowing that that was the easiest stat to raise.  Point is I still tank as well as those ogres (although the unstunnable from front I miss on occasion).  Can't say much about shamans yet, but as stats go, you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd say put all your points in Wis as well - AC gear is easier to get than WIS gear with AC (most WIS gear tends to suck in the AC department).<br />
<br />
So that extra 25 wis will help you when you have to make a choice between 7 wis rings or hp/ac rings...<br />
<br />
Of course, as a tradeskiller, I've got abnormally high wis to begin with :) And I'm always looking for wis boosting things... I'm probably the only person who wants their epic so they can GM in tailoring easier!<br />
<br />
Muwahahahah :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">same thing i did here so you must be on the right track. have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I guess I kinda find it a bit amusing when I hear folks talk about how they have like only 180 wisdom and they run oom a lot or whatever. I only had 156 wisdom after i got an upgrade at level 56. And all the time before that I was able to do just fine with liberal use of the cannibalize function. Heck, I was only healer in the tower in Unrest at level 24 with a wisdom of 90 way back in the day (summer of 99) and was able to function just fine. If you have lower wisdom, adjust your play style. You should be fine.</div></div><hr />
