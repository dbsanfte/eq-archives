<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wonder how he figured that out.  Must have actually read the shamans complaint this time.</div></div><hr />

However, Woody is a fool.  I completely lost any respect I might have had for him after his comments on slow not being one of a shaman's primary abilities.<br />
<br />
This time his comic implies that by complaining we brought this &quot;opposite effect&quot; business with slow on ourselves.  <br />
<br />
Sorry to break it to you, but that effect came with POP off the shelves.  We complained that mitigation sucked and VI said they put it in to avoid making lots of mobs unslowable.  Sure.  That's why the week after Scott Hartsman said it, a whole zone turned unslowable.<br />
<br />
Our complaining, which i prefer to think of as questioning, of slow mitigation had nothing to do with the new &quot;opposite effect&quot; feature.  We simply have a message to tell us that it is really happening, rather than just suspecting it.</div></div><hr />

I see him as a Buffer / Healer / DoTer not as a slower and its how I see all Shamans. You need to not see yourself as one spell or you will ruin the enjoyment of your class for yourself.<br />
****!<br />
<br />
Dis explains all dem peeps who ask fer Agi afta &quot;Inc&quot; message frum puller.  Den again, mebbe dis perp and him's buddy will change dem's mind wen dem hit 14th and get Walking Sleep. :rolleyes:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As already stated. Somebody with an artistic talent and wit doesnt necessarily have a clue. He doesnt need a clue to be funny.<br />
<br />
Woody usually is funny. Nobody expects him to be an expert in Everquest. I expect he (like many of the readers and forum-writers) is a casual players. As a casual player you dont care about maximum efficiency. You dont care about dps, you dont seek the optimal group. You tend to fight mobs where the Enchanter easily survives aggro from slowing, you tend to fight mobs were you can tank unslowed mobs.<br />
<br />
Add to that the fact that some tanks seldom see what doesnt directly affect them (meaning everything except shiny bufficons and statchanges) and you know why they think slow is one of many things and of minor importance. Those people take Shaman in their groups for perceived advantages, without logs to prove them right or wrong.<br />
<br />
Those are two different worlds, and for that you shouldnt bash Woody! Praising utility spells was a dead giveaway for me! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">maybe he just has a very 1 dimensional experience with EQ. Maybe all he's ever played is a warrior or ranger or something. To him, all he sees is the shaman complaining about Slows not sticking or being mitigated, and the cleric complaining about how much harder his job is. Does the tank care? not really, as long as he doesn't die. Someone who hasn't experienced being a caster at a high level might not understand why the meditation periods are so much longer, and wouldn't connect it with the complaints from the shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Frankly, I've found that most melees have very little conception of mana or what casters do.  If they're full health, the whole group and everything about the pull rate is perfect - no matter what anybody's health is but the melees, and without respect to mana at all.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people want to be the big tough guy and roll up melees first; it's a little kid being a tough-guy thing.  They charge in brash and foolish and don't really know what's going on.  I think most people choose melees as their first characters if they're unacquainted with the game.  Even people I know who have played for years and sometimes seem very competent often don't bother asking what mana is like before charging off to pull more mobs after a hairy situation; they just have no real conception of mana or managing the flow of mobs to keep mana at an acceptable level at all.  As long as they themselves are not dead, then everyone's 100% mana and it's all good, end of story and you're lucky you can just sit on your asses 95% of the fight and leach all my experience while I'm the one who's doing all the fighting. ;)<br />
<br />
Few are the melee who don't duel in the middle of a raid and then ask for rebuffs, tell you that you can put focus on them WHILE they are pulling a mob(sure bud, pass ME the quad 700's ASAP while you FD and I'm trying to malo and slow), wander out of range just to practice turning circles while you are casting group buffs, stand apart from the crowd when they know you are buffing just so you have to make a special effort to buff them and them alone so that everyone in the raid can know their all-important status, etc. ad nauseam.  <br />
<br />
The melees who pay attention to the game situation as a whole, including mana, are few and far between.</div></div><hr />

If you're reading this Woody, in this game there is no forest, there are only trees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People make WAY too much of what a certain class is or should be.<br />
<br />
It's a game, you play by the rules set forth by the people that created and govern said game.<br />
<br />
If you want &quot;something more&quot; play DND.. there's hardly a strategy in camping the static spawns in a dynamically static MMORPG such as EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No he didn't.</div></div><hr />

Amazing how complex a topic humor can be. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">nah, you're right Darjeeling he didn't say &quot;slow is not one of shaman's primary abilities&quot;.  My first impressions stand from his first posts here, (regarding the whining shamans) which are now deleted, or edited (by him) but in this round, he did say this:<br />
<br />
&quot;When someone thinks of a Shaman... I surely hope they don't think SLOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think SLOW is class defining&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not class defining.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, it is.  Slow is part of what defines our class, it's a large part, whether you wish to admit that or not.  Feel free to tell me that I don't know how to play my class or that I am a lazy gimp because I think slow is our class defining ability.  Slow, in combination with Cannibalize is what our class is balanced around, imo.  For example, Slow is why we have small heals, cannibalize is why they are inefficient.  <br />
<br />
At least I have years of play experience as a shaman to back up what I believe.  Woody, as a level 50 warrior, is prepared to tell the shaman class this:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just saying that Shaman's should reevaluate themselves instead of focussing on one spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without slow the whole game would need to reevaluate themselves.  Slow is one of the most powerful spells in the entire game.  Possibly the most powerful.<br />
<br />
I know very well how to play my shaman, how to use our various tools and I will argue until the last day that I play everquest that our class revolves around slow.<br />
<br />
When was the last time you seen a group shouting &quot;Group looking for dotter&quot;  .... yeah, like never.  But &quot;Group looking for slower&quot;  I see that everyday.<br />
<br />
As far as his comic goes?  If the joke wasn't &quot;Look the shaman complained and made it even worse for themselves!&quot;  what was it?  Cause I don't get it.  I don't typically find myself to be so humor challenged but there's a first time for everything.  :)<br />
<br />
He even admitted in his now locked thread he had no idea what was going on.   So in conclusion, I don't find his comic funny at all.  I find it irritating that he makes up this crap about us, the concerned shamans (who aren't the only class that slow mitigation effects) who posted the original complaints and got VI looking at their broken slow mitigation implementation and got them to work on putting in messages.  Finally, I don't like his comments about our community.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I will tell you this much: there is so much whining about this one single spell that there is no way I could read every thread&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah well maybe we are whiners sometimes, but dammit, this is a good cause, a cause crtical to our class and I feel we are justified.  And outsiders can't just walk around talking trash about us!  :p</div></div><hr />

Course Henora would be 110% correct to say people don't /ooc &quot;Looking for a Canner&quot;<br />
<br />
Woody - you're level 50 bubby - get to 51 in Sol B, spend some time in Seb where sans slower you are Froglok paste. In the meantime keep cranking out those cartoons. Once in awhile you are funny. This wasn't one of them.</div></div><hr />
