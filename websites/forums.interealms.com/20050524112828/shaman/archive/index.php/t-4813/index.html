<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've done a few searches, and can't find a good definition of what exactly poison &amp; disease counters are, and what it is they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well if your asking what I think you are when you cast a spell on a mob you have the initial resist check and if that passes the spell is put into effect.  At this point there is an effect that processes till completion.  This is seen in our dots in the dmg per second and # ticks.  I am getting ahead of myself.  When the spell is cast and passes resist check another component that can be added are counters.  These are used for &quot;cureability&quot;.  For example if a dot cast on you has 5 dis counters and your cure disease spell cures 3 counters then it will take two casts to cure that dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While it's not completely true, consider the counters to be a mark of the 'severity' of the spell.  There are poison counters, disease counters, and also curse counters.  The various cure spells remove a specified number of these counters when cast.<br />
<br />
Each poison, disease, or curse has a set number of counters when it hits a player or pet.  For instance, Bane of Nife has 10 poison counters when it hits.  Cure Poison (level 20) cures 1 poison counter when it hits.  Thus, you'd have to cast Cure Poison 10 times to 'cure' the spell.  Each cast would remove 1 counter.  However, Disinfecting Aura removes 20 poison counters and 20 disease counters, so it would cure Bane of Nife in one cast.<br />
<br />
Just an FYI, Remove Curse removes 8 curse counters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh.. ok that all makes sense now.  That's why the slows have disease counters also... for being able to cure the slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">counter have 2 part of meaning :<br />
<br />
1, like above poster said, it use by remove counter spell(remove cure, remove poison, remove disease ) to determine how many casts to success remove that spell<br />
<br />
2, it use to determine how much agro you receive instantly, Disease counter used to have big agro and now seen zero agro after fixed the slow's agro issue, poison counter still have big agro on it(Tash, poison dot)</div></div><hr />
