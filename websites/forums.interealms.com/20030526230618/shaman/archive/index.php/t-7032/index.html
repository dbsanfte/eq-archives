<br />
This spell is listed as 55th level.  Group shrink spell.  Uses a buff slot (so it can zone with you, and can be clicked off).<br />
<br />
It's pre 61, so I am thinking it's vendor bought.  But, I don't remember seeing the first night I had pop, and I certainly dont have it in my spellbook.<br />
<br />
Someone said that it is vendor buyable, in the plane of knowledge (a friend of a friend of a friend kind of thing).<br />
<br />
Ok, before I spend the night scouring every vendor I can find in the Plane of Knowledge tonight, anyone have this spell?  Did you buy it?  Where did you buy it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Donlo's Dementia is the effect on Umbracite Swarm Orb from Vex Thal. <br />
<br />
It does not have any buff slots. Dont know anything about the spell though, but since its the same name, doubt its any buff slot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">God I want this spell. Trying to shrink peeps with the raid feature blows. You have to leave the raid and get invited by others in the raid to then shrink them. Then you have to leave the group and raid again to shrink others. That's just stupid. <br />
<br />
You would think that if they can flag only certain looters within the raid that they could also flag shrink so that you could shrink anyone in your raid as though they were in your group so that you could shrink them. <br />
<br />
If we could just find this dang spell it sure would solve a ton of problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's listed as a shaman spell, so it's not just an item effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whats the betting that this is more rare then grp acumen :(.<br />

The Mage community has discovered some NPC's in PoK that will take PoP items with spell effects and strip the item of the effect and give you the spell scroll that you can scribe.  I don't know if it applies to this item or not but it's worth a try.  You can read up on the quest here: www.magecompendium.com.  Go to the General discussion forum and read the sticky post &quot;Spell quests&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so im going to give up an umbracite swarm orb to get a spell that uses mana to cast group shrink? sounds good to me...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crack is bad, mmmmkay<br />
I have the orb, and now we see them rot.. But even still<br />
I would no more trade in my orb for some stupid spell...<br />
My bet is VI once again forgot to put the spell drops in.<br />
Not a major suprise, I mean Cha would of been more useful<br />
then group agility, dex and str. But wait that would <br />
require thinking, something you don't need to work at VI.<br />
