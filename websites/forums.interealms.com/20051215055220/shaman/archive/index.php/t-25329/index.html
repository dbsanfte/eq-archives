The same exact thing happened to me. They need to add more level 30-34 quests.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip Barm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is okay to grind a few levels too, it is actually faster than questing in most cases. Remember too that horde was finished last and doesn't quite have the quest goodness the alliance does.<br />
<br />
Too low for shimmering flats? Get a buddy and whup ass there, alot of quests there and easy fighting.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I'm out of ideas, I'll do a /who 30 and see where folks are, just to get an idea.  If you don't mind heading to the undead and/or tauren areas, there's all of THEIR 30's quests to do.  The day I have nothing left to do in WoW but grind out exp EQ-style is the day I'm done with the game.  ;)<br />
<br />
There's an elite dungeon on the undead side that I can't remember the name of, but our group of 3 should be just about powerful enough to get to the end of it, from what I've heard - to finish a quest for an 8 stamina ring.  Some kind of Keep?  Bah, my memory sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shadowfang Keep. Probably can't finish it at 30 but you can make a dent. Shimmering Flats is good advice, I spent some time there.</div></div><hr />

You're playing WoW Litchbane? What server/faction?</div></div><hr />

Tarren Mill has lottas quests...there are some quests in stonetalon that are perfect for low 30's Charred Vale area...<br />
<br />
Also,  are you sure you did all the Thousand needle ones?  the quests in Shimmering flats area kept me busy at least to lvl 31 or 32...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Def. do Tarren Mill, I had the same problem in CB on my undead mage when I hit 30.  It was weird going back there and walking through Southshore on my Alliance char, I kept expecting to get jumped by the guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LARRYHILL01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hit Taren Mill today.. Ya thats where I needed to be..Also tried those elite dwarves at some castle... Capt Ironass or whatever his name is &gt; me!!<br />
<br />
Tks for the tips tho Im back up to 15 quest in my log book and moving right along!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you just want to grind out a lvl or two, try killing the elite mobs outside Scarlet Monistary.  At 32 (or maybe 33 iirc) my hunter could just kinda solo them, if I was ready to run at the first sign o an add (happened a lot) but EXP was good, esp if you have the quest to get their hearts, and you can kill two birds with one stone. <br />
<br />
Maybe you and a friend could tag team them, until you both got some lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LARRYHILL01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ya I can usually take down mobs pretty easily that are 2 to 3 levels above me because I play the drood and shaman at the same time....problem was I couldnt find any quests to do at 30 they all were too high for me to get (greyed out !) or too low... I dont partically like to grind... did way too much of it in EQ... Im a quester now that WOW has shown me the fun of doing them.<br />
<br />
Its all good now tho.. Tauren Mill is the spot for 30 to 35+ from what I have seen today!  Now if I could only log back in and continue the fun I found today =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Im on my way through 33 now and I did most of the Hillsbrad quests. One of them had me go visit the horde village Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands. That place also seems to have a lot of quests so that might be worth checking out too. Theres also a windrider and and inn there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At level 30 I started on the quests in Shimmering Flats, and also did a lot of stuff in Stranglethorn Vale.  The stuff in the far north end of Stranglethorn is very much in the level 30 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hehe, on a pve server cool, Stranglethorn in the low 30's on a pvp server? Ha, fun, but death.<br />
<br />
I actually ran cover the other day for a 34 shaman in our guild in ST. I stealthed around while he fought, I probably killed 20 people that jumped in and tried to kill him, nothing like seeing a level 35-45 person thinking he has an easy kill and then pimp slapping him off the map.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Shimmering Flats is good for low 30's, then off to STV at around 35-37?</div></div><hr />

Ya we have been farming this for drops. I picked up the 776ac shield and 24 damage 1h axe there. Very nice items for my level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The dagger drop from the large boar dude is also very nice.  Don't forget to keep your dagger skills up, they are great with windfury to stop those pesky casters from casting!</div></div><hr />
