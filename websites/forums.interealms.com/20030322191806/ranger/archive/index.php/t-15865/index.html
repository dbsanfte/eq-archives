Seeing how most ppl are flying through the lvls now, I'm wondering.. how hard would it be for a 52 ranger w/o swifty to get a group?<br />
<br />
A friend of mine said to just go LFG in PoT.. I wanted to check with you guys and ask what you think my chances are for finding exp groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zero to none.PoP Tier1 yard trash mobs hit for 250+ and scale up fast.If you brought a guild group you *might* be able to do some areas.But to get an xp pick up group you would have to be 55+ to even stand a chance.I am 61 and wont invite anyone below 58 in Tier1,in Tier2 its 60+ only.<br />
<br />
I am not trying to dis you bro,just giving you a straight answer to your question.Others will say &quot;hell yeah you can get a group&quot; which you just might but it wont be a steady or sure thing,not by a long shot.The worst thing you can do for your xp bar is sit /lfg for any extended period of time.And some are going to bang on me for my &quot;elitist&quot; attittude.But the fact is when I hunt for xp I HUNT,and the people with me need to be able to sustain a reasonable dps to make it worth my (and their) time.<br />
<br />
Where are you hunting now? Are you in a guild?Maybe we can tell you a better hunting ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah at 54 the only times I go is with guildies or friends. Everyone I talk to says at least 55 for the tier one places. And most of the time they wont take you unless you have either swifty or a haste item higher then 30%. Which by 55 you should have at least one of those two options. I'll be hitting 55 in a day or two but probably still wont spend a lot of time lfg in the tier ones. At 52 I would just grind and grind away in JP/Velks/KC/DSP. Start epic if you havent all ready. Save up 5kpp and by the ssoc portion of the epic as its cheaper and quicker then getting and funding a raid in sky plane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tanyi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 52 it's kind of a big liability to your group.  I went to planes around 55 and couldn't get a group worth a darn in Tier 1 zones.  At 60 it's pretty easy.  As I recently got my flag for pov/pos I have sat LFG for hours there and no one wants to group with a ranger. We have tons of dps with archery, but get passed over for sk's/paladins that can actually take a few hits, but a smart ranger won't become a liability.  One time in PoJ we had a 51 enchanter in basement camp, she died so many times we couldn't even kill 2 mobs in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, rangers are SOL until about 55.  However, I have had luck with some other low level characters grouped with me.  For example, we had a 51 pally tanking and a 51 shaman providing slows east of werewolves in PoN and had not problems (we had a 58 cleric healing, a 55 chanter, a high level wiz, and myself to round out the group).  It worked pretty well unless I pulled more than one mob.  The chanter was not very good, she kept mezzing herself with AoE mez whenever I pulled 2 mobs (ugh).  Other than that the xp was pretty good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Norwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree - if under 55 expect a lot of down time, at 55-58 expect to get a group but it may be a little wait, at 60+ its not to bad to find a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With Guild people I would expand my range some however for myself using PoN as an example:<br />
<br />
If its a 55 Group for near side of river<br />
<br />
If  a 58-60 group its the far side of the river<br />
<br />
If its a 58+ group with a great cleric and a heavy tank its far side of river and pulling horses from the platu to the planes below (Great Exp) - normally will pull 3 then slow pull time the bugs to med up and look for parchments before pulling horses again (~20 min spawn).<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;weakest&quot; group I have gone accost the river with was: 58 Ranger, 55 Paly , 61 Chanter, 61 Bard, 58 Wizard, 48 cleric.<br />
<br />
I / We only did this because it was a guild group (excellent players and well equipped) and we did well and even took some horses... but with anyone else I would say forget it . That is not a typo a 48 Cleric (on horse) we had to push on rune, and all classes abilities to get an occasional horse.</div></div><hr />
