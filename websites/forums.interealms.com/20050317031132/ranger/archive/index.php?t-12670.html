<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eliak Quickblade</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bunch of us from my alliance went down to the caves in PoN last night (underwater) to do some exploring.  We tracked a red con (at 61) named bat called The Bullybug Bat and killed it.  Immediately another named red con spawned in the next cavern over so we went and kill that too.  The second was a named Hobgoblin,  &quot;The xxxxxx Hobgoblin&quot;.  Upon this one dying another named Hobgoblin spawned in the next cave over so we killed it.<br />
<br />
Finally, the &quot;Hobgoblin Anguish Lord&quot; (iirc) with 2 friends in the next cavern.  He was rooted unlike the others and had 2 other red con guards rooted beside him, some mephit and a bat.  Anyway, we were a bit low some key classes and whiped to him due to some adds, but he didnt seem that hard.  Had a Knockback ae or something and hit really hard....the mephit and bat hit quite hard too.<br />
<br />
The hardest part was keeping up with the spawn in the cave he spawns in.  There were about a dozen static hobgoblin spawns here, some red to me at 61.  Spawn is quite quick and hard to keep up with.  The hobgoblins are tough, hit for 400+ but dont have tons of hp and the bats are really easy.<br />
<br />
Oh, we had about 40ish people to start with and about 30ish by the time we fought the Lord.<br />
<br />
One last thing, make sure you have everyone you need when you go to this spot as I hear they disabled CoH in the zone.</div></div><hr />
