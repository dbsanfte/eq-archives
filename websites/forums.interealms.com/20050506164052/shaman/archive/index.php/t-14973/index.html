<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is one petition I care about.<br />
<br />
The sound from cannibalize after 4 years is excuriating.  I can't play with sounds now because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't mind the new cann sound.  The old one was more grating.<br />
<br />
If they could remove the carpal tunnel I get from chain canning I'd be happier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did, it's called canni5.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm grinding, I'm grinding, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't mind the sound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I two-box a lot, so I spend a lot of time looking back and forth between my laptop and my desktop.  I find the sounds very helpful when doing this.  I know by sound exactly when to press my JBB hotkey after I hear the sound of the completed Canni cast.  Then I can tell by sound when the JBB hits and it is time to use my Canni hotkey.<br />
I don't relly care if they change the sounds, but I definitely don't want them removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The MOST annoying sound in the game comes from Familiars.<br />
<br />
That freakin' flapping wing sound is just infuriating. I'd rather sit by the water in EW than sit by a familiar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">NO, the most annoying sound is when you get hit while in bear form.  That stupid bear-grunt sound.  I don't use bear form any more because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Now that bear-form noise is one that I would like to see removed.  If I didn't need some of the other sounds, I would turn off sound completely to be rid of the bear-form noise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd rather they removed the particle effects from Canni.  I like to turn on particles and see all the swirlies and sparkles from time to time, but with me casting as often as a bard and constantly having those puke green clouds in my face it gets too annoying to deal with after about 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
I was pleasantly surprised to see some of the new particles effects a while back and would love to be able to see them more often while in xp groups.  They can actually be handy at times when you have multiple mobs with the exact same name in camp.  makes it a bit easier to see what's being cast on which.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Guys, you're getting off topic. This thread is supposed to be about what's best for me. Start your own threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Denied, many of us use the sound to time cann4 without actually staring at the spell gem waiting for it to start to recover :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If yer gonna feedback, feedback about focus overwriting Cleric self buffs and the stupid height filter on the map function defaulting to ON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OR feedback how the spell book randomly closes...i'm not using the fancy schmancy new spell mem thingy my books are arranged and its faster &gt;&lt;~...took my druid 6 tries to mem gate the other day..sure glad it wasnt an emergency or something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And why is it why I proc my Soulstripper that the effects are delayed about 1 tick.  That's really annoying, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's like that for all lifetaps.  I notice that when casting lifetaps with my SK.</div></div><hr />
