<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are some strategies people use for oracle vs oracle duels?<br />
Let's assume both are lvl 60 shamans with full spell book.<br />
<br />
What kind of resists would you go for?<br />
What kind of weapons would you use?<br />
What kind of armor would you wear?<br />
What kind of buffs would you use?<br />
What spells would you have memmed?<br />
Any special items worth getting for dueling purposes?<br />
Your strategy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Poison and Cold resist.<br />
Runeetched Icewurm fang, or even better, Winterstorm<br />
Armor with HP.<br />
Use 2 insta clicks, crap buffs, rh, focus, mr, pr, cr, regrowth.<br />
Have Torrent, Bane, Torpor, Malo, Counteract poison, Abolish disease(Not if you have the legs), Cloroblast, Flash of light memmed.<br />
Fungi, JBB are special. Also golem metal wand for stripping his buffs.<br />
<br />
Strategy:<br />
Keep your pet alive, Kill his pet. Attack his pet fast if he cast dispell on you(his pet poofs.), Dispell his Torpor(remember to back off pet.)<br />
<br />
Try to Bane and then torrent his pet. It could get it killed. If he torrent you, step away fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what have I forgot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Instead of two slots memed for abolish disease and counteract poions, isnt it easier to just use disinfecting aura?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You got me thinking there, Walruss. You are right it's better to have Disinfectant aura. But that's because it takes 2 cast of Counteract to remove Bane or EBolt. Disinfectant does it in one cast. I just tested it on myself while camping RF</div></div><hr />
