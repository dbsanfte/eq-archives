<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Previous to the most recent patch pets, regardless of thier level, could take any buffs that were cast upon it.  So a level 1 mage pet could take level 65 shaman buffs.<br />
<br />
This afternoon a cleric friend of mine was leveling his beastlord alt.  the BST is 24.  I topped off the BST's buffs with level appropriate buffs and memmed the spellset I use for buffing my own pet.  I got &quot;spell is to powerfull for intended target&quot;.  I tried the next step down in buffs...same effect.  I had to use my pre 50 buffs on the pet as nothing else would stick.<br />
<br />
Interested, and mildly annoyed, I headed to PoK to search out pet classes in various level ranges.  I found a level 44 magician and a 45 shaman that were willing to help me out.<br />
<br />
The level 44 magician pet was blue to the magician, so under level 44.  Post 59 buffs would not stick, just like they wont stick to PC's at 44.  The 45 shaman pet was blue to the shaman, so under level 45.  I could stick Focus, Boar, Diaku and FA on it, even though the pet level was under 45.<br />
<br />
Im thinking that SOE has tied acceptable pet level buffs to the level of the caster.  Interesting, and as I said, somewhat annoying even if it IS a &quot;fix&quot; to the way it should have been.  But seeing as that pets have always been able to recieve the best buffs in the game regardless of level (or at least, since I've been able to summon a pet circa 2001) this isnt a &quot;fix&quot; but a nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I have no problem with buff level limits on pets any more than I have buff level limits on players. There are too many easy paths in the leveling journey as it is.<br />
<br />
This nerf, if called that, fits right in there with the group &quot;exploit&quot; nerf that would let virtue and KEI be cast on lower level players. Some see it nerf, some see it balancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This one of the listed changes in the same patch which allowed pets to zone, as there feared what pok would be like with every pet class just starting out asking for the top buffs.<br />
<br />
It would have made it far to easy for pet classes to powerlevel themselves.<br />
<br />
P.S. You can still do this for charming classes by having a high level Enchanter/Druid/Shaman charm a low level mob buff it up, break charm and then let the low level charm it  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am not sure if I would call it a nerf... but they really should tell us this stuff. This is certainly one of my pet peves with them, you make these kind of changes the least they could do is tell us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alluring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think Hobart mentioned this in his June 30th update over on the EQLive boards.  Look here (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&amp;message.id=2782&amp;no_redir=true). <br />
<br />
- Made it so that pets now follow the same rules as players when it comes to buffs. If the caster is not high enough level for a spell to land on them, then it also will not land on his pet.<br />
<br />
  It might have &quot;mysteriously&quot; been left out of the patch message though, since I didn't spot this particular change in the patch message archive, looking back as far as June 16. /shrug<br />

It was an obvious exploit when you could buff a newbies (starting at lvl 12) pet up to 3k hp w/ haste w/ Q w/ FA.  It is funny stuff when I'd throw on all the buffs to my BL's warder and FA while the little sucker procs 12 times in a fight.</div></div><hr />

Until that player just got access to elementals and is in your guild, despite having levelled from 0 to 65 in a month and soloed all the way.  This player is very likely to not know much about his class and certainly likely to know very little about other classes and game dynamics in general.  Does that affect you?</div></div><hr />

It does affect a lot of people though mainly through the selfish attitude of some of the people who do it.<br />
When i start an alt off i normally get him to 15 or so before twinking and you know how many times newbie zones become empty of mobs because someone is going through the mobs like a dose of salts :)<br />

If it ain't in the patch message, it's a &quot;stealth&quot; change. Not everyone<br />
has time to go searching the web for changes when a patch comes<br />
out. <br />
<br />
That said, sounds like a fix that should have been made a long time<br />
ago. Whoever said this was probably done due to pets being able<br />
to zone, probably hit the nail on the head.</div></div><hr />

No, it's standard SOE quality control.  A &quot;stealth&quot; change would be something they intentionally left out of the patch message.  This was probably left out due to their standard levels of incompitency.</div></div><hr />
