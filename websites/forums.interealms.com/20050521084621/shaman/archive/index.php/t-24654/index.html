<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kryton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I will be honest I have been borrowing a friends shammy for a few weeks now I usually play a warrior or necro. I like the shammy allot but when trying to kill old dragons like Wooshi or Sev I can’t land one damn spell. The shammy is 65. My necro can land every damn spell he casts but the shammy can’t land anything. I have tried casting from the belly of the dragons I try to land my resist debuff with no luck.<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong?<br />
<br />
I did search here could not find the info I am looking for<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You try to land your resist debuff?<br />
<br />
Malo/Malos is unresistable, use those. ;)<br />
<br />
Standing point blank helps, but with many targets you need Malo and Tash (procced or not) on top of a ton of luck to go around.<br />
<br />
It all depends on what youre fighting. I think there is a table of slowablility lurking in the medecine cab... search for it. Maybe those old dragons are unslowable.</div></div><hr />

It was mainly the dots I wanted to land I tank the dragons with my Necro and DPS is key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman spells are the most resistable spells you will find in game. <br />
<br />
A long time ago Shamans were penalized with that, because we had a spell line to lower a mob's resists. Other classes didn't have the ability to do that, so their spells were made harder to resist. <br />
Fast forward today, many classes have some sort of debuff for the spells they are casting, yet they kept their innate resist modifications for their spell lines, while the Shaman's damage spells are still as resisted as ever.<br />
<br />
You aren't doing anything wrong, it's just how it is for Shamans. Resists are the most limiting factor when it comes to a Shaman's damage out put(the other being aggro which is relative to the equipment of the people you play with). Unfortunately, there are no foci available in game that innately reduce spell resists(with the exception of the Spititkin Tunic's effect, which I have yet to see any parses of).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You need to find out what those dragons have for resist. Cast Malos, Insidious Decay (for disease debuffing). If you use disease dots they last longer, When you use Bane and Anathema along with the poison dots, BoN and BoS you can drop the HP down quite a bit. Honestly I always have loaded: Malos, Root, Slow, Quin, canni 4, Blood of Saryrn, Bane, Anathema and Breath of Ultor (i have the 9th spell gem from AA).<br />
<br />
I usually use these when soloing as slowing, in my opinion helps a ton when they inevitably break root. The great thing about Bane, Anathema, Blood of Saryrn, and Breath of Ultor is they don't have a DD component to them so there is no crazy breaks in Root. <br />
<br />
Give the Malos, Malosinia, Insidious Decay a shot, then play with what dots land on him most. Just keep using those dots and you should be in good shape and still have time to canni4 canni5 when the time is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">most of the kunark dragons are a bitch to slow.  after malos and a tosh stick proc you might have a chance with our god slow (because it has a neg resist modifier,) but honestly you prolly wont land any spells.  i ALWAYS have trouble casting on any kunark dragons as they are nearly spell immune (well use to be, but they have major resists still today.)  saying that, you may get lucky and land spells every now or then, and if the shaman has a lure procing weapon that will land.<br />
from all accounts i have read about soloing kunark dragons, the shaman was in pretty nice gear (high resists) with a lure procing weapon.  they meleed down the mob with the dog helping.<br />
as someone already stated, you aren't doing anything wrong.  it is the mobs ungodly high resists that is the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't even bother casting anything after malos on old world  dragons with my shaman when I used to hunt them with my bro. Was just a waste of mana. Did all the dps with my druid and just healed/cured with the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While I can't confirm this, I have a feeling that certain dragons have a &quot;sweet spot&quot; so to speak.  The area under/in the dragon that you can land spells from, I'm guessing, must be very small on some of them.  Klandicar for instance, I have this certain spot I like to stand and it seems like I have a higher stick rate.  Course, I could just be delusionsal:)<br />
<br />
But yes, like other shaman mentioned above, our spells are cursed.  Most casters, like necro's, get innate negative resist checks on their spells.  Shaman do not.  We have the highest mana costs, hardest to land, longest cast time, etc.. of all the casters.  What do we get in return you might ask?  Uber, uber slow of course.  Is it mitigated to hell and back? Yeah.  Did we get anything in return?  Naw:)</div></div><hr />
