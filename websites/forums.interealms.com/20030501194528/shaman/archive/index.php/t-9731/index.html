<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious any hint of this? Thought they alluded to it at a fan fair before Poop release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wait for the next expansion. :p<br />
<br />
At this point, I don't really want to go chasing for more parts into all teirs of the PoP strata anyhoo.  It would make lots of sense to involve those suspicious looking epic-wielding mobs in the library, but I doubt the next series of epics are even in the game.  An even scarier thought is that new epics are in-game, but nobody who is sufficiently flagged has discovered the quest yet.<br />
<br />
I'm sure if they get implemented you will hear some fanfare from SOE about it long before.</div></div><hr />
