<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mystt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All, I have been trying to find a listing of the Special Mata Muram Trail Abilities that you receive when you beat the MPG Single Group Mata Muram Trials.  Does anyone have a listing?<br />
<br />
I have heard that it increases your Resist Cap by 5 when you beat each one for a total of +30 to all resists caps when you beat all five.  Is that all you will get?<br />
<br />
I realize that the trials are needed for personal progression but I have yet to see a listing of the rewards from these.  Lets pool our information and make it available to the shaman community.<br />

As far as the resists. From what i've heard it raises cap by 8 per (10 for last) total of 50. So at lvl 70 with aa and all trials you can get to 600 in resists. Which makes sense given the neg 400 and even neg 500 resist mods ae's are having in OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I beat 2 of them, lists 2 0f 6 in my AAs but still capped at 525 resists. Bugged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally haven't beat any of them yet. I have heard talk of them getting bugged if you buy other aa's after beating the trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You get 8 per trial and if you complete all 6, you get all resist caps raised by 50.  You can get 575 max to all resists.  The Discordant Defiance AA is 5 per level now and not 10 like on Test.  They are no longer bugged.  If you lost them by training another AA before the last patch, you can get them back by hailing any Projection in MPG.</div></div><hr />

Resist cap goes up 5 per level so at level 70 is 525. 25 more for aa is 550. 50 more for trials is 600.</div></div><hr />
