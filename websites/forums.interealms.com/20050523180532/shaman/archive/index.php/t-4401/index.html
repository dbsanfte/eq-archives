<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know you said they repatched it, but everytime I try to<br />
load EQ it crashes back to desktop as soon as I attempt to enter the game. <br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where are you actually crashing?<br />
<br />
opon startup? log in? charcter screen? character login?<br />
<br />
Are you using the default UI?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Right after I select mycharacter and waiting to enter the world. I hear the music, then the ambient sounds then a black screen to my desktop.<br />
<br />
I'm using the Blue skin that was posted here a while back.<br />
That's about it. It loaded fine yesterday.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Update the skin?  There was an update after this patch, the compass window broke the old version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same thing happend to me.<br />
same UI<br />
<br />
the UI is not compatable with new patch or some such, all I did was delete the folder where the UI was, and repatched.<br />
<br />
have to settle for default UI or another thats been updated, if the Blue one has not yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, you need to switch back to the default UI.<br />
<br />
Or get an updated Blue UI.<br />
<br />
To switch back to the default, just copy all the files from uifiles/default to uifiles/blue  (or whatever folder the blue ui went into)<br />
<br />
If that is too technical, look around and see if you can find a better explaination, you aren't the only person having this problem I am sure :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just updated my Blue UI, here it is.<br />
<br />
Just follow this link and download it here, it should fix your problems (if your using my icey blue UI).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To protect your UI when new files are added, only have the UI files you have downloaded/adjusted in your custom folder, leave everything else in the default folder. The sites that tell you how to load a skin all say copy everything from default into your custom folder, and then add the new ones, dont! Just put the new ones in there.<br />
<br />
EQ now looks for UI files in default if it can't find them in your custom folder. <br />
<br />
If the same thing happens after doing this then one of your custom files needs overwriting too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went back to default till these ui's get updated. Just get back in to your uifiles and copy your default. Then rename one of the defaults to the ui your are useing on your characters. Start eq and it will load the default instead of the new ui and you will be good to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Copied over the new UI. It works great now.<br />
<br />
Thanks bunches.<br />

<br />
Instead of doing this, there is a /everquest/UI(character name).ini - this has a line defining what skin you last loaded.  Simply edit that to load the default, until you get the mod updated.</div></div><hr />
