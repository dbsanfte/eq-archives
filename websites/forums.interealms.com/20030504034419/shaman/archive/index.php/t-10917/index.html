<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Regnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm level 39 now but without Canni II. I've been working on acquiring the components for the quest and have obtained all of them with the exception of the &quot;strange ochre of clay&quot;. From what I understand, this drops off a mob in City of Mist. I hunted there recently and had a HELL of a time, it's train city. Also, I don't have much of a direction on the drop, just a note from a forum message on Allakhazam that it dropped off an &quot;army behemoth&quot; near the bridge. Nothing more on Allakhazam.<br />
<br />
Any alternate sources for this component? Also, I have both flavors of Shaman Powder, the black and the white. Both are lore and were obtained from frogloks in FV. Will one of these work?<br />
<br />
Appreciate any suggestions for additional and alternate ways to obtain this spell upgrade. I have Chloroplast now, but still Canni I...<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

The shaman powder from FV will not work.  You need the black &quot;shaman powder&quot; from a Yun Shaman in TT.  Btw what server are you on.  I have some clay in the bank you can have if you are on Vazaelle.<br />

Where to find an army behemoth is in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=8125). You may also find the strange ochre clay sold in Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a clay for sale in bazaar FOREVER - thought for sure someone would snap it up.  Maybe no one looks there.  About ready to destroy it.<br />
