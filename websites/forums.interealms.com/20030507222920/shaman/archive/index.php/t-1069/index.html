<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mjod Eaglehart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm looking for the Fat Alligator in the Swamp. This is part of the gatorsmash maul quest (yes, I know that I don't really need todo this part, but I like questing). Anyway, I've been hunting in the upper NE quadrant, a bit further south than Guk and west as far as the troll shaman vendor at the &quot;hand&quot;. I've been killing any and every alligator I see (even looted an alligator skin for a hobbit quest).<br />
<br />
I play on test which means it's pretty much me, a basher or two, and the occasional slayer killing stuff in that upper NE quadrant. So if I miss the Fat Gator chances are he's lost to me. I've been using the skele tower as a &quot;home&quot; base of sorts. Allakhazams suggests that Bull Gators may act as PHs, or not. Also, Giant Water Moccasins may be on the spawn table, or not.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try hunting near the zone to south ro.  I've found hime there before long ago when I actually wandered around the swamp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It sounds as though you've just been unlucky so far. Definitely follow Oogg's suggestion and stick more to the South Ro zone area. You can also wander down to the spell vendor hand, and across to the ruined tower as well. Killing Bull Alligators is probably the right thing to do, plus anything that appears to be on their spawn table (Giant Water Moccasins seems like a good bet, though you should be able to tell what is slowly taking the place of all the Bull Alligators that you kill).<br />
<br />
At least the Fat Alligator seems to drop the quest piece every time, for what it's worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have always found him near the tower.  Just run around there killing gators and casting Sense Animal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OMG your post brough back memories.  With my 1st Character, a halfling druid, about 2 years ago I spent two weeks straight camping Bull Alligators in de Swamp trying to get the alligator skin needed for the leather foot raider quest.  I killed hundreds of Bull Gators it seemed!!!!  I eventually got the Leather Foot Raiders Cap, hardest I EVER worked for a single piece of equipment in the game.  Darkforge and Totemic quests were jokes in comparision.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, from my little hobbits experieces in de Swamp, I suggest you keep killing Bull Gators.   I believe they are the placeholders for the Fat gators.  I would have the Fat's spawn as I was killing Bull's.  You are also in the correct area, between the skelly tower and SoRo zone.  <br />
<br />
If they still have not fixed it, make sure you go to the top of the tower occssionally, the spawns used to get  stuck up there in a bunch, and you had to go up there and clear house to get more to spawn.<br />
<br />
If you know any halfling druids on the server, maybe you can recruit them to track for you, tell them they can get alligator skin for Leather Foot Raider's quest (shhhh so not tell them how rare the drop is).  The Fat's dropiing the quest part much more frequent.<br />
<br />

Good Hunting to YOU!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mjod Eaglehart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ahhh... isn't that the way it goes. After less than 20 bull alligators the skin dropped for me (saving it for a needy hobbit).<br />
<br />
In the process of leveling a bit before I continue this quest (I started at level 15). I also believe the Giant Water Mocasins (sp) are on the spawn table.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replys, good hunting all.</div></div><hr />
