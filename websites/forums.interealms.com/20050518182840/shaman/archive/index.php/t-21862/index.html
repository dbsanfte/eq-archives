<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ryan/Rytan posted this on eqclerics (bolding mine). I thought it was rather interesting.<br />
<br />
That really is the root of the problem, there's just too many classes for not enough roles. Most of the time class balancing involves robbing Peter to pay Paul. There's really no way around it. I talked to a few people about this at the summit briefly concerning healing. Honestly I think that having shaman/druid/cleric all being able to heal more or less the same is good for game balance, as long as the rest of the classes abilities balance out to make them equally desirable. The problem really is how many players actually want to see that happen? How many players would be frustrated and/or quit over a change of that magnitude? Tough questions that don't have a simple answer, but then again, that's my job.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dreamx2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think its good rob peter and paul because if it wasent for peter or paul we wouldnt be in the situation were in now. So do what u did for the other classes for us instead of telling us were sol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dreamx2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You dont think because u robbed us for pete and paul people arent going to quit either, in my eyes all ur doing is trying to conserve ur losses for you companys money benefit u have no desire in what people want sony is in the buisness of quick fixes so conserve there losses. People complained about there classes so u took away from ours, now were complaining and ur not doing anything because i dont think u know what to do without substaining a substantcial loss either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even if shaman could heal as well as a druid, the first thing most shaman do when a mob is pulled is cast Malos and then slow it. That alone will be enough to stop a shaman from being the primary healer in GoD exp groups 90% of the time. You cannot heal while you are debuffing. And with as hard as these mobs hit, most groups need them slowed ASAP.<br />
<br />
I know as well as anyone how little changes to things sometimes have huge effects in-game. But Ryan has failed to make any needed changes to Shaman for far too long now. Its time to give shaman at least as good a healing spell as druids have. Its time to put in some very high damage, very short term, low aggro DoTs. Its time to give shaman an improved SoW spell. its time to give shaman a THIRTY MINUTE BASE DURATION Avatar. Its time to forget the useless stat boost buffs. Anyone in elemental+ gear should have STR/STA/DEX/AGI maxed out or very, very close to being there. Its time to boost Shaman nukes SIGNIFICANTLY.<br />
<br />
Its well past time to step back Rytan, and say, &quot;Yes, shaman have slow. But we have reduced the effectiveness of slow two expansions in a row now, and we have increased mob DPS by incredible amounts. Its time to give shaman the option to do other USEFUL things with their mana when they are done or cannot slow the mobs being killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sadly, Shaman are very, very close to being in the same position today that necros were in a couple of years ago. Its Rytans job to correct that problem. And lets pray he does so before the majority of shaman follow the knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what he forgets is fun, balance doesnt make things fun. this is maent to be a game and meant to be fun. so make it fun.<br />
<br />
i think none would mind cleric being able to solo? none would mind there 6k dd to undead. or that they are powerful against undead. hell i wouldnt mind them being ok solo against normal mobs if they want.<br />
<br />
what i want for shaman is to be fun, debuff and slowing inst really fun that why every is glad to have shaman because they dont want to do this.<br />
<br />
so make debuff a very quick. then we can get to the fun stuff that is doing damage or healing.  i still think cleric should be slightly beter at healing than damagem and that druid.shaman are better at damage then healiong but not by the margains they are now. at the end of the day a cleric will still be generally healing, and a shaman back up. but you give them the choice.</div></div><hr />

Yes! There we have it. The core of everything. The game designers ask for our opinions, we voice them because we want to have fun. I totally agree with Bara Cudar here except that the changes does not even have to be so exaggerated to make it more fun.<br />
<br />
They seem fixed at keeping us on a level where the game is not fun for us, and that will in the end result in even a bigger exodus of players.<br />
<br />
Its fixing our issues we have already agreed on  that it all will stand and fall with. Because playing an inferior class is not fun. Unless they back the game to where it was around Luclin and PoP. If SOE wants the game to be fun for the Shaman class they damn well need to stop design content that makes us unwanted in a group. <br />
<br />
I do not think they will lessen mob DPS or HP where our heals are enough or slows will make a big difference. Lets hope they have a HEAVY reduction on mitigation in OOW.</div></div><hr />
