<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TnT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off quick intro - I'm a (just turned) lvl 18 iksar shaman on Druzzil Ro.  Hello to y'all.<br />
<br />
Second just out of curiosity what is the best fishing zones you guys have found?  Inside Cabilis I get 14 and 15 lb fetid bass' a lot, but I haven't travelled very far considering I'm only 18.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Being Iksar and all, I don't recommend you try this, but if you position yourself just right, you can go fishing in the well in Halas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOIO is a good place to go fishin, the river leading down to the lake is a nice relaxin spot to kick back and wet a line.<br />
<br />
I also reccomend Ice Clad ocean any bit of land around there can net ye some good fish. In Paineel by the Hole entrance is a nice place too, very relaxing with a couple of shade trees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try the river near the giant fort in WW.  Refreshing, quiet, and near a easy camp of drop-happy giants!<br />
<br />
I pulled mostly fresh fish out of here, took along a spit and made fish rolls (Buy wings at the vendors near cabilis) up to mastery in baking before I was level 20.<br />
<br />
Good fishing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best place is MM by the lake near the zone in.  You can exp from 20-27 effectively there and while medding you can fish. :)  Better than playing gems ;)<br />
<br />
When feeling sedate, I fish in the caves in surefall, Rivervale, NK (barbie camp), the temple in UG, CT gator pits used to be nice and relaxing (not so anymore), OOT, Halas lake on zone in (lots of white fish).  DO NOT fish in FV.  You catch ALL sorts of good eating fish, but they're all different weights and so don't stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like the fishing in Cobalt Scar.  You can catch Cobalt Cod there and give them to anyone making Arctic Wyvern stuff.  My favorite fishing spot prior to this was the moat in Unrest.  For some reason that moat is chock full of fishies.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*sigh* You all are fishing rookies.<br />
<br />
My friend taught me all about fishing and it's way more than a &quot;relaxing spot in a zone&quot;  You have to find a place where you can fish while you're getting exp.  You have to bait your group towards a body of water telling them how much better the pull spot is over here by the water. Then when they finally get there, you sit back and let them rake in exp for you while you fish/forage all day long.  If they ask why you aren't helping in the group just make up something about &quot;I'm mana pumping&quot; or something else useless.  This works best as a necro as most people don't expect you to be able to do much anyways (even though we all know differently)<br />
<br />
I'd have to go with LOIO for the low levels. Easy to bait your group down to the water.  Plane of Growth is nice for the high levels. Can sit in the creek all day and fish and just wait for your class drops.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My favorite fishin holes:<br />
Lake Halas<br />
Black burrow <br />
Ill Omen<br />
Lake in Trakanon's Teeth.<br />
Creek outside Thurgadin<br />
Mistmoore.<br />
<br />
Only place I hate?  FV, for the millions of differently-sized Fetid Bass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sleeper's Tomb  :)   Bit harder to do now that mobs see invis again and the water is all the way down were the warders were.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I'll get to go fishing in Vex Thal soon. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just wondering, but what does fishing give you?<br />
<br />
i know you can fish for fewds and all, but whats teh beneifit other then that?...and a nice relaxing time, kickin back w/ a beer..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My personal favorite is one of our guild chanters.  He's working on some of the high end pottery stuff, and one of the components is fish . . . from sebilis (go figure).  So, he puts on troll illusion and goes and fishes under the bridge.  People are starting to refer to him as 'that troll under the bridge.'  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I lke Akanon the best.  Big lake in the middle of the city. Never anyone there and the clock sound is hypnotic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The ice floes in Iceclad are nice, very relaxing.  Also nice is the pool at the top of the river in LOIO.  Just don't go -in- the pool...  My favorite spot, though, is the back side of the pillar in Oasis, facing away from the beach.  The fishing isn't really that great but nobody bugs you.  Which is mostly what fishing's about anyway.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'll echo Cobalt Scar. OoT is nice, you get some seaweed, and some other stuff. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fetid&quot; : &quot;Having a heavy, offensive smell.&quot; (And we're eating this stuff?)<br />
<br />
Here's some fishing weirdness.<br />
<br />
Faern has had the same fishing pole since level 5. Has used for hundreds, possibly thousands of casts.<br />
<br />
Dreadstone (My monk) breaks fishing poles like their made out of balsa wood.  I went through THREE in about 30 minutes one day in Cobalt Scar. He has to carry backups whenever I decide to increase his fishing.<br />
<br />
Wierd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bah, /rude fishing<br />
<br />
The last fishing I did broke my Ancient fishing pole from sirens, when 'fishing' for lodi in Iceclad..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've always been partial to the wall of water inside PoM...stand right infront of the wall and fish away</div></div><hr />
