Again, we have been ousted from a role we have played in groups.  Apparently, VI has decided that Rangers should not be pullers…period!  Since limiting us to outdoor pulling and then making numerous un-harmonizable mobs just wasn’t enough now they have nerfed Harmony to the point of making it useless.  Now, we are no better than your standard warrior at pulling, well not even that good since we have to dump agro once we pull.<br />
Last night in DL I was resisted constantly – whether blue green or other.<br />
I have read their response on why they have done it and it still sucks for them to nerf a bread and butter spell like this with out making the ‘upgrade’ available if one is really coming. Jesus, Paladins can pull better than us now.<br />
Why is that after each expansion they must destroy our class while doing it??</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.<br />
<br />
By the way, one spell does not limit you to your pulling abilities.  Don't even bring up anything about pulling closely packed social mobs.</div></div><hr />

Lol good one :)<br />
<br />
Epauls news flash for you, post level 53 (assuming you stay in Karnors for that long) Harmony is totally useless to you in groups, as you will be in  either Sebilis, or in Velketors.<br />
<br />
In Umbral Planes, I could care less, stuff there is easily mezzed for the most part, and monks/shadowknights need a job in outdoor zones too, other then hitting auto-attack and then going afk for 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Stop the god damn whining, we're getting a new harmony spell anyway, and hopefully it will work in new Cazic Thule also.</div></div><hr />
