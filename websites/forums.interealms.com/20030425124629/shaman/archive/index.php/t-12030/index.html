<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">at the risk of sounding redundant . .. ...<br />
<br />
so i play a 54 shaman,<br />
have around 10k in the bank,<br />
and am looking to upgrade.<br />
<br />
questions:<br />
<br />
in your opinion, which item would be money best spent?<br />
<br />
1) jaundiced bone bracer (around 14k on lanys)<br />
2) earring of the solstice (i've seen all the pieces for around 6k total)<br />
3) glue factory horse (~8.5k)<br />
<br />
for all you ubers out there, when does the jbb's effectiveness taper off?<br />
i can't imagine the dps from a 300 point nuke every 8 seconds is<br />
all that remarkable in pop groups or raids.<br />
<br />
does the trick of turning luclin horse/race models off still avoid<br />
the negative effects of a horse, i.e. head, acceleration time, slower<br />
than sow run speed?<br />
<br />
how does the earring of the solstice's FT I effect compare to the<br />
mana saved by permanent sitting regen from a horse?  i'm assuming<br />
the FT I is negligible.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
on another topic,<br />
this 54 shaman is my main -<br />
- i'd like to start working on<br />
velius quest armors.<br />
<br />
how do the SS / kael / thurg / PoG                 <br />
armors compare for a shaman?                       <br />
<br />
what factions are least tediously<br />
acquirable?  i've killed a few giants<br />
so i'm tentatively on CoV/dwarf<br />
faction, but if this is a mistake<br />
i'd like to remedy it.<br />
<br />
could anyone supply a link or a<br />
brief walkthrough of how velius<br />
quests work?<br />
<br />
i'm currently unguilded - no faction obligations there.<br />
<br />
thanks for the guidance.<br />
<br />
oh, also if anyone has random gear suggestions here's my<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am not uber but i had a similar quandry not long ago and bought a lizard and it's the best thing i ever bought to date. Sitting down mana regen is the snizzle + canni + stocism = less downtime and no aggro while doing it.<br />
<br />
You will probably get a range of answers but they will all be along the lines of <br />
<br />
Horse then JBB<br />
JBB then Horse<br />
<br />
and Solstice coming last in both cases.<br />
<br />
If you have a horse you have to run Luclin Models these days for it to work so you will have a head infront of you but nothing shrink won't fix. A lizard's head doesn't get in the way but they have a slighlty bouncy run, it doesn;t bother me because i only move when i need to loot a mob.<br />
<br />
And the glue factory horse is dead slow but if you need to run just click it off.<br />
<br />
HTH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">JBB is still EXTREMELY useful at 54.  I'd definately go JBB first, then horse, then earring.<br />
<br />
JBB usefulness starts to taper off at 60 with Torpor - mana is cheaper so you can just nuke if you feel like it.<br />
<br />
Idunno how Stoicism affects that equation, but my guess is not much given Cann III/Stoicism regen rate will be much lower than Cann IV/Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">JBB &gt; Horse &gt; earring.<br />
<br />
JBB + Horse is very very good.<br />
<br />
After torpor,  JBB is not as usefull because the opertunity costs to use it become much larger.<br />
<br />
JBB 8 seconds 263 dd nuke<br />
Can IV or Can V + Torpor == huge amounts of mana that can be used to cause damage.<br />
<br />
You can cast a DoT in a few seconds that does a lot of damage and then get the mana back very fast, or you can JBB.   Oh how I wish I could add the epic dot  ( in PoF last night but no tear :( ) which has a very good cast time / damage ratio even if it's DPS is not that huge.<br />
<br />
The JBB has good DPS but its cast time / damage ratio is identical to its DPS where the performace of a dot is much much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">JBB, no doubt at all in my mind. I agree that JBB effectiveness tapers off post-canni V and post-torpor, but I still use mine at 62 sometimes. I'm getting tempted to sell it but I've held back so far. Its still great for killing greenies or adding that bit more damage when I can't be arsed to non-stop canni and torpor instead. I also continue to use it for soloing PoP tier one mobs. At 54 the ability to do 30 dps mana free is very powerful, particularly for soloing. <br />
<br />
Horse gives about 20FT I think? Assuming your mainly hunting in PoP (i.e. outdoors) I'd go for the horse before the earring without a doubt. The horse + JBB is a great combo. Remember the horse is useless to you in indoor zones like Sebilis and Velketors (although it works in CT :))<br />
<br />
JBB &gt; Horse &gt; earring<br />
JBB+Horse = uber combo.<br />
Earring is nice, but nothing like as game-changing as the other two.<br />
<br />
You can cast a DoT in a few seconds that does a lot of damage and then get the mana back very fast, or you can JBB (my emphasis)<br />
<br />
Radag - I think the casting time issue only really comes into it once you have insane mana regen - i.e. you need canni IV, canni V, horse and KEI/Pot9/Bard song before you reach the level of not being able to cast spells fast enough to match your mana regen. Oh boy I do love Winds of Marr :)<br />
<br />
Before that stage I think mana efficiency is key. For soloing, that generally means DoT and then JBB as nukes are very inefficient for soloing.<br />
<br />
For grouping, mobs probably don't tend to last long enough for DoTs so use rains (and/or nukes), and JBB if/when mana starts getting low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In my 2cp opinion the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>touk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">JBB then go lizard i sold my horse to get a liz and its way better i hated shrinking every time i zoned.<br />
with a JBB you can cast and still get the mana regen from sitting on your lizard. Sure 263dd isnt that much ut in a fight i can get off maybe 10 casts from the bracer while getting mana back and its always cool to see your name as the slayer.<br />
Touk Season 59</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get horse/lizard first. JBB is pretty pointless without one in my opinion, your time is better spent medding, especially if you are grouped. And a horse is still very useful with no JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just got a lizard...OMG!!! Best money I ever spent. But then again I don't have a JBB so I can't help ya there.  <br />
<br />
Horse is great though...sitting regen/mana regen is AWESOME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Horse &gt; JBB &gt; earring<br />
<br />
Of course, you'll be using earring and horse when you're 65, and JBB will be rusting away in a bag.  But prior to canni5/torpor, JBB does kick a lot of ass.<br />
<br />
The cheapest horse will be part of your gear until you get emp/seru horse, or blow 100k on the best horse/drogmor because you don't see much else to spend your money on.  So keep that in mind too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For SoV armor..<br />
PoG = Thurg. Both sets are almost identecal in stats. Has I recall its the arm's and legs that differ on the 2 sets, and thats not by much. 2 of the stats revers on them. Like say the PoG arms are 4str 3wis the turg would be 3str 4wis. (not actul stats just #'s off the top of my head)<br />
<br />
Kael and SS are the better two of the armor sets. Kael has better AC. SS has better resists I belive it is. But your guild will problly be the deciding factor on which set you end up with. If your guild is giant allied then Kael. If they are CoV then SS. Unless you plan on buying MQ's then you will have to compair both sets and decide witch you like better.</div></div><hr />
