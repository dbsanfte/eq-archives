Actually I would say it is the exact opposite.  I easily put out over 200DPS soloing.  However, in groups, I can barely do any DPS because mobs die too fast for dots, and our nukes are a joke.  Our heals just don't do enough, and slow is just getting less and less useful as time goes by due to slow mitigation and low-hp mobs.  I wouldn't go so far as to call us gimps, but we are definately heading in that direction and I have seen nothing from GoD to make me think otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">200 DPS unloading your entire arsenal maybe...or tons of focus effects and AAs.  Either way, we don't hold a candle to Necros, Bards, Droods, or Enchanters in the soloing department.  Our strength is mob manipulation, not DPS.  We don't have the luxery of charming a mob that hits for 300+, and Alpha dog couldn't do that on the best steroids available to professional athletes.<br />
<br />
All in all we can do both pretty good, but we aren't at the top of the list for either since slow mitigation graced us with its presence.  The reason I say we excel in groups, is that most people dont have ubah gear with stats maxed out.  Our other abilities are necessary as long as a Bard, BL, or Chanter isn't availble :P<br />
