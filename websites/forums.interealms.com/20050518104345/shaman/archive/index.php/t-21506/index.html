<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssnafu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the May 12th patch I've noticed that at times I can't duck out of spells.   This morning I finally figured out what was going on. Full-size and single shrunk I can duck out of spells fine, but if I'm double or triple shrunk, I can't duck out to interupt spells.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this problem?  Its a pain in the neck on long fights when I'm relegated to patch duty after the mob is malos'd and slowed-- or when trying to assist heal when the main tank goes down on an open raid :(.<br />
<br />
Thank ye,<br />

<br />
The problem has been happening for over a month.  Pretty much since the change over to dx9</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, this is a known bug, I saw it on the EQLive forums somewhere.  It may have been occurring for awhile for some, but I too have only noticed it since the May 12th patch.  It seems to be random, since others I've grouped/raided with think I'm crazy because they can still duck.  Oh.. I also cannot jump when double-shrunk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just broke my own mez with my chanter tonight thanks to this bug, started casting my nuke on accident, hit duck then clicked the slow I was trying to cast and didnt notice in all the battle spam that I hadnt really ducked...after all the screaming that goes on about breaking mez early I was all set to bitch when I see my own name, I was all ***!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have run into the same problem, and it seems that at least for me Levitiation seems to fix it even if double shrunk. Of course floating up and down can be a bit annoying too in some places... <br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only problem I've noticed is you can't duck out while on a slope if your double shrunk. I can duck just fine everywhere else though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seems to happen on certain races.  Maybe large races.  Tested it on Barbarians (duh, Im a barb) and can not seem to duck after two shrinks.  After being totally shrunk on elf classes, they can still duck.  Havent checked with ogres, trolls, or cats tho.  My work around as a barbarian is to only shrink once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have heard barb shaman in guild having problems with this however as a frog i have not.  Suspect it is tied to larger races since they are shrunk more.  Perhapse a temp fix if lev doesnt work is small race illusions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For a while I had this bug. I was trying to make sure I had Levi on no matter where I was if I could, since if you were floating you dindt get affected by it. However, it has been fixed for me, and works like it used to no matter where I am, flat, slope, floating, underwater, whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I thought that it was just a bug for large races, because the only ones that I'd ever heard complaining were those, however last night in uqua.. I said something in /say mode like &quot;man, this bug where I can't duck out of my spells while shrunk really blows&quot; and I got a few tells from some clerics letting me know that they are having the same problems, so it's not just large races.<br />
<br />
I usually just end up growing myself once and that solves the problem.  Isn't always ideal in a raid environment, but I'll settle for the discomfort of a few others to be able to quickly duck out of a spell.</div></div><hr />

SOE should consider putting a &quot;cancel current spell&quot; hotkey into the game. I would surely use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yep suffering this problem as a troll, and its fairly recently started, will /bug it again I suppose. It seems to be triggered more when I have been on my drogmar and click it off, especially when shrunk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kumtha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I try to avoid shrinkage now as several bugs happen to me when I am shrunk. The one mentioned here is annoying. I also get this realy anoying one. It starts in melee  with a message that the mob is to far away. Mind you I never move and this usualy happens in an area where I couldn't be to far away if I wanted to. My natural inclination is to move closer. This doesnt help though so I have taken to &quot;backing off&quot; lol. What usualy happens is the mob runs up to stand in the same spot I am. I now get the message that I can't see my target. I then back up and nowI am back at square one with the your target is to far away message. I hate dancing realy and with mobs it is even more annoying. This situation happens most when I am double shrunk but it also happens when only shrunk once as well. I tend to get hung up on the geometry more when shrunk as well. Steps are still a problem somtimes when shrunk. I find myself useing my mount less and less now since DX 9 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't know if everyone already knows this (I'm too lazy to scan the other threads on this subject) but Form of the Bear and Form of the Great Bear don't have the ducking bug.  The only problem is that even being a shrunk bear you're bigger than most people at full size.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm back to wearing bear clothes full time when hunting now, because of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have no trouble ducking but I'm in bearform with one shrink on me.  I've haven't had a problem with ducking for a very very long time.</div></div><hr />
