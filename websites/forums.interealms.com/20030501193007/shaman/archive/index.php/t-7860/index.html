EDIT:  Purchased in game for me by my guildleader, using 20kpp of my funds and the rest out of his own pockets (purchase price unknown at this time)!  /happy  /dance   /cheer  :) :) :)<br />

Hoped I'd never have to make this post, but I'm desperate for Torpor.  My guild family isn't hunting 60 scroll droppers often enough.  I don't have high hopes of looting it.  There are several others on E. Marr also currently searching for Torpor.  I have no desire to enter into a bidding war with them.<br />
<br />
I have 40kpp cash to spend.  I would prefer not to bankrupt myself for this, but I will do so if necessary. :(  I can arrange a loan if necessary for more funds.<br />
<br />
This is a plea from a small guild shaman (sole Oracle) for a spare copy to be sold from an upper tier shaman that has access to the guild scroll vault to me out of kindness.   Or to anyone who has a spare copy...Ppppplease? :)  (Did I mention I was desperate?) :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
