<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wandering through Everfrost with my ranger collecting turnips, so decided to run over by the caves and track. Was pretty surprised to not only see Lich of Miragul, but also 2 glacier bears up all at the same time. :eek: <br />
<br />
Just a freakish accident, or is this common nowadays?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think it's more common as such, probably not many now simply quest for totemic. There are better items out there, for shamans and clerics now as well, so the old world armor is left untouched. Totemic Helm aint too bad though, I like mine, which I got only at lvl 49 heh.. Never was able to get the bear, since it was always camped, and in the end, I &quot;forgot&quot; about him..<br />
<br />
And one day I remembered about it, and decided to go after it. Bear was not up, took me a week (and one death from Miragul) to get him, and even that was after the patching. But by that time, I had spent a week in the caves (druid friend with me as well), and mapped the Miraguls path down to the smallest details (thanks to Assidous Vision spell, neat &quot;spy&quot; spell).<br />
<br />
Anyway, server came up, I logged on and was only person in EF, besides the lvl 2 barb warrior. I ran a bit away from the skellie house, where the rod for wizards is, and bumped into the no one else then the bear! Rooted it, DoT'ed it and ran back, as I was sure that Miragul is still around.. And the bear took off in another direction! Bloody pathing.. At that moment I said to myself &quot;Screw Miragul, I WILL GET THAT BEAR!&quot; and ran after it. Caught it in the caves, and killed it. Got the skin, cast Gate and just as the portal was opening and I was dissapearing, I saw Miragul charge me.. Neener, neener, too late!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got the bear twice and never had problems with Miragul.  The  approach I took was to sit in the little entrance cave, just after the ramp that you swim up, close enough to see the traffic in the corridor but far enough away not to aggro the lich.  Park dogdog (if you have one) at the water's edge.  The bear eventually walks right by; pull with Burst of Flame (fast casting) and run back to the water.</div></div><hr />

Still wear mine at 59 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wear mine as well, and don't actually even imagine of getting something better in a long time, being the casual player, at off-peak hours, in a &quot;not uber guild&quot; :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I won the roll on a Rune Etched Hat in Hate last week, but I'm undecided as to whether my trusty old Totemic Helm is better ... still wearing the Totemic until I make up my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just curious.... been a while since I did the totemic quest. Isn't there a drop in CT that you need? (Now with CT revamped, I'm curious if anyone bothers with this quest).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Once i can get my smithing up I am going to try for that Artificers ringmail helm (only problem is wearing a chain helmet :()... its better.  For its age totemic helm still is worthy though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ranthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When CT was upgraded all the old mobs where moved to the Ferrott just outside CT. There are 5 pryamids that the Lizards spawn on. The page can be on anyone of these.<br />
<br />
On my server this has become a popular place to Power Level and these pryamids are cleared reagularly. Just about anybody can pop over and loot one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Berserker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Doubble Bear is at the same odds as it always has been.  I have seen 2 glacier bears up 3 times, but then again I have killed many a bear.<br />
<br />
The thing is now the spot is not camped so if you want to get a bear you will need to clear the spawns yourself.  Due to the distance of Everfrost peaks and the drop in value for the helm you will find nobody there any more.  Go in and kill the placeholders the 2 wandering icebones and come back 7-8 hours later.  I do believe that the spawn is on a 6 hour 50 min timer.<br />
<br />
Gluck the bear is an easy grab, and the helm is nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks, heh..but I wasnt after a helm. Just was surprised to see 2 glacier bears up. I remember back when my friends and I were doing totemic quests that bear was a pain in the butt. Yes, kids, there was a time when people actually wanted totemic. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My barb shaman still wears almost a full set of totemic, after I had accidently bumped into Griz at L51, I had finished my set =) Of course, I don't play him anymore, I went Iksar =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">JB armor is almost as cheap as Totemic and far superior nowadays.  I had much trouble banking my Totemic helm for a JB one but in the end AC wins.  At least the Totemic helm stays for my tradeskill gear!</div></div><hr />
