<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not core - requisites, but just something to give us some flavor and mix it up a bit if we wanted to.  Back 40 levels or so we were melee'ing right in there with the mobs, how about remembering those days.<br />
<br />
===================================<br />
<br />
Double Attack AA - passive (grants ~200 to double attack)<br />
I'd like to see an AA to let us have double attack - we're the heavy-hitters of the 3 priests and were (formerly??) called Norrath's &quot;battle-priests&quot; right?  Let's see something to at least let us out-melee clerics.<br />
Maybe even 5 levels of DA ... 1 = ~50, 2 = ~100, 3 = ~150, 4 = ~200, 5 = ~250<br />
<br />
Bash AA - passive (grants ~50 to bash)<br />
How come a 60 lb. gnome cleric with a trashcan sized shield can bash better than an 800 lb Ogre wielding a shield the size of a buick hood.<br />
or multiple levels like the DA idea.<br />
<br />
Ferocious Spirit AA - passive<br />
Pet focus AA - makes dog lvl 60, with moderate increase to hp and max hit, and allows Dual Wield/Double Attack without weapons (like other pets, even SKs).<br />
<br />
Critical HoT AA - passive<br />
How about a chance to CRIT a tick of Quiescience or something?<br />
<br />
Breath of Spirit / Breath of Nature AA - activated (nnnn refresh)<br />
DRUIDS SHOULD GET THIS TOO ... ~50% rez.  For those times 3 zones in the back of the dungeon when the cleric dies and everyone's just sort of standing there looking around going ... &quot;hrmmmm&quot;. <br />
<br />
Withering Curse AA - activated (nnnn refresh)<br />
Curse your target lowering his max attack AMOUNT by nn%.  Say reducing the max an opponent hits for by 30%.<br />
<br />
These are just a few ideas brainstorming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As neat as a critial tick on HOTs would be, I still don't like the idea very much.  The most important thing about healing is that it's consistent.  We can find out quite easily the maximum DPS of a mob, and the average DPS.  <br />
<br />
Because we know these numbers we also need to know how much healing per second we're doing also.  Trying to rely on a random chance to crit to keep my tank alive does not sound like fun to me.  Everyone would plan for the spell not critting at all ever, and the mana saving from something like this would be marginal at best.  While it would be nice in some rare cases, it's actual usefulness is lacking.  <br />
<br />
I would much prefer a substantially better HOT without needing crits, or a strong quick spotheal spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think a low percent rezz (hell, even 0%) on a decently long AA timer (72 minutes or something) is a great idea.  Rezz is too important to have only three classes have it - especially considering if anyone is going to need a rezz it is most likely the paladin (tank) and/or cleric (healer).<br />
<br />
I think ciccero's brief example was a good explanation of this.  Pretend you just spent 3 hours clearing to the very end of tipt, and the cleric's invis fades and he dies.  What do you do now?  Without a necro or paladin, you're going to be starting over.  If GoD instances didn't have respawn, I wouldn't feel so strongly about this, but with the way GoD is structured I think it is time for rezz to be passed around a little more.  Being able to 0% rezz one person an hour is not going to substitute a rezzer's spot in a group, but it can definately keep the group from wasting hours and hours of clearing due to bad luck or a moment's inattention.<br />
<br />
Forget about all your biases from our previous discussions about whether or not we need a rezz, and forget about all the times we have made fun of the druids for asking for a rezz.  With the game in the state that it is in now, I think it is time.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come a 60 lb. gnome cleric with a trashcan sized shield can bash better than an 800 lb Ogre wielding a shield the size of a buick hood.&quot;  I can't even begin to count the number of times that I have said the exact same thing.  I honestly don't think our melee abilities are that big of a deal, but I think that we should be put up to at least cleric melee levels, because being inferior to a gnome cleric or a dainty female high elf at meleeing just irks me.<br />
<br />
I don't care about double attack.  I'd rather have a damage bonus, but honestly melee is not a big deal for us.<br />
<br />
As for your withering curse idea, you have to remember that if they were to implement something like that, it would only accomplish two things:<br />
<br />
1)  New content would just be 30% harder to compensate.<br />
2)  Old content will be even more gimped.<br />
<br />
Critical HoT ticks are a great idea.  I also think we need a healing-adept equivalent for them as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frankly IMO the pet should be able to dual weild inately etc.  I'll be **** if I'm going to pay for another aa that should of simply the case from the get go.  Like the rediculious group buff for pets thing heh.<br />
<br />
I admit the melee focuses are interesting but I'm not sure I'd agree with the above to that extent.  Perhaps something more along the lines in how clerics got upgraded in terms of melee would be more suiting a priest than strait upgrades to melee skills.</div></div><hr />
