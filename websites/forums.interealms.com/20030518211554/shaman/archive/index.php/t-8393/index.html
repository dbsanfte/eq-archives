<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in DN last night and we had one of these drop off the phase spiders.  I didnt win it but I liked the stats on it. <br />
<br />
Does anyone think that I would be wasting my time trying to get one?  Is there a Bp that would of better use of my time?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">After asking the crucible serverwide channel, the response I got for a comparison between the PSC and Polished Tin Mail Shirt, was to take the shirt. I paid 2k for my Polished Tin in the bazaar about a week ago. PSC is 17k.<br />
<br />
That was the consensus of those wiser than me, and my hand-me-down advice to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe the PSC stats are batter (that is what I am wearing), but the cost is significantly higher.  I hunted these for 3 months with my wizard, and came across a few, but they are very rare.  I killed about 500 spiders, and got 9 PSCs.  If I were to buy a BP, I'd buy the tin mail shirt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We had one drop when we went after vilefang, but it was random. The phase spider carapace is nicer, perhaps, since it has 25 hp and 9 sta for 52 hp total, but only 6 wis. The tin shirt clocks in at 46 hp and 10 wis. <br />
<br />
I'd rather pay 3.5k for the tin shirt - the price on Rodcet - than 17k for the Carapace. They are very close in stats. Also, the graphic.. Carapace is a dark plate, and probably would look bad on a cat. Tin shirt is the uglier of the two silver chain looks... it looks like the Ikky Regen BP. Barbed Ringmail looked better, had a pretty design near the wasteline. But I can't have everything, and cats look much better in any chain than in plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Phase Spider Carapace is 28 AC, +6 Str, +9 Sta, +8 Agi, +5 Dex, +6 Wis, +7 Int, +6 Cha, +9 vsMg, -3 vsFire, +5 vsCold, +8 vsPos, -4 vsDis, +25 HP.  Classes: Bl Ra Sm C P Sk B Mk Ro Wr<br />
<br />
Polished Tin Shirt is +28 AC, +7 Sta, +8 Dex, +10 Wis, +25 HP, +25 Mana, LORE MAGIC   Classes: Ra Sm Ro. All Races. <br />
<br />
The tin shirt is substantially superior for a shaman because it has both hps and mana on it, and increased wisdom.  You want as much hp/mana as you can lay your hands on.  Don't sacrifice wis/mana for hps tho.  You need them all.<br />
<br />
The price is irrelevant here.  The shirt has a lower price because it's not wearable by as many classes.  Monks like the PSC because of the weight, and that drives up the price.  Leather and chain classes like it because it doesn't look like leather or chain.<br />
<br />
Count your blessings and get that shirt if you like.<br />
<br />
What would be better is if you could get your SS breastplate.  I know it means a lot of tedious (and probably open) raiding, but it's a very good breastplate.<br />
<br />
Same with the legs, btw.. you'll likely be wearing those into Vex Thall when you're ready :)</div></div><hr />

I think you got those backwards there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urthshade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">is ikky better than the tin mail or should i just get the tin mail for a cheaper amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depends what level you are.<br />
<br />
Before say 55, the ikky is FAR better than almost anything else you can get (except a fungi).<br />
<br />
Up to 60, the ikky BP is nice, but perhaps you can afford to lose 5 points of regen for some extra AC - I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
At 60 with torpor (so I am told!) the regen on the iksar BP is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK.. let's try this again :)<br />
<br />
Don't sacrifice wis/mana for hps :).  You still need the hps because mobs tend to slap you around some, but your mana pool is still your biggest asset.<br />
<br />
I thought a lot about what aura of battle does for us in the last little while (because I've been trying to rate gear.. the process sucks hardcore btw because of the complex relationship between our gear stats and how we use that gear).  <br />
<br />
I use the kind of arbitrary AC=3 wis=6 hp=3 mana=6 agi=1 sta=1 aob=100 ft=100 system.  I say kind of arbitrary because you also have to factor in focus effects in deciding if something is a good upgrade, and there isn't really a good way of quantifying those.<br />
<br />
AoB.  2hp/tick.  20hp per minute.  That's a miniscule amount when you have 2400 hp.  Even if you have 1200 hp.  AoB=FT1 or pretty close, when you cann it down to mana again.  AoB would be a nice thing if it was just a freebie and not a goal in itself :).<br />
<br />
We eat 148hp every time we use cann4 for something like 84mana (I'm working on cann5 atm but the hp-mana ratio isn't much different as far as I can see).  That means that one mana is worth about 1.75 hps to us.  The other way, 1hp = 0.57 or so mana.  That's why raw mana is so much more important to us than hps.  Also why 20hp/min is just silly.  It would take us 7 minutes to regen enough hps to cann once.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah.. I didn't make a mistake above :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The reason I stated that the PSC is better (IMO) is because it is similar to the tin mail in mana/hp, but it also gives saves, which I personally have precious few of.  Added to that the fact that it raises other stats, and it's nice.  The other stats are not as important as hp/mana/ac, but it's nice to have them along for the ride.  As an iksar, our starting STR sucks.  You can't go wrong on either, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I make a point of factoring stamina and agi because they contribute to hps and ac, respectively.  If you wanted to focus on strength too, you could add something into the analysis pretty easily.  Just weight it more heavily.<br />
<br />
I agree resists are very important, but it looks like as you progress through the various expansions, it doesn't get important, really, until velious, at which point practically everything has saves on it (or you might look on it with some disfavour if it doesn't have any saves, even).  That means that you're looking at velious or later expansion gear to get it.<br />
<br />
It also doesn't appear to be too terribly important at level 50 and below, but once you start going through your 50s, your gear mysteriously attracts more of it.  Even so, I still have 2 bags of resist gear (in addition to the jaundiced bone buff clickies) that I carry at all times, so you might consider hanging onto stuff that has good saves but only soso stats as well, until your regular gear has more saves on it. :) <br />
