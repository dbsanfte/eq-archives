<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahgnillig</div><div class="date">03-30-2003, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just thought I'd post here the info I heard in the EQ2 development forum earlier today... I think it's pretty interesting how they see Rangers in the new game.<br />
<br />
The devs were talking through how the class progression system would work, and it's basically going to be on three levels.  The first is the class archetype, either Fighter, Mage, Priest, Rogue or Tradesman.  They chose to use the Fighter archtype as the demonstration of how the system would work, and said that at this level, everyone who took the Fighter archetype would be equally able to &quot;tank&quot;.  <br />
<br />
After the player has chosen to be a Fighter, they then move on to the next choice, which would be Warrior, Brawler or Crusader.  <br />
<br />
The most interesting point (to me at least, as a Ranger) came after Crusader.  At this point the player would be able to specialise futher, becoming a Shadowknight, Paladin or Ranger.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how this fits in with everyone else's view of a Ranger... but it did surprise me.  I was expecting Rangers to be in the same category as Rogues rather than knights.<br />
<br />
That was the only character development path that was discussed in detail, though they did mention that contrary to some of the rumours flying around they were not doing away with Bards! (they'll be in the Rogue category).</div></div><hr />

<br />
weird that they would put ranger's under fighter, doesn't really make sence, ranger's are more rogue than warrior, most games with class systems like that have ranger's with rogue, DAoC being one example.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eldakka</div><div class="date">03-31-2003, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many variations on a ranger.<br />
<br />
If you take the AD&amp;D style (even the EQ style), then the warrior-&gt;crusader-&gt;ranger makes sense, as the ranger is a 'warrior' with some priest spells (druid type). So the crusader would be (I'm guessing) a general warrior/priest hybrid, with the paladin being a specialisation of that hybrid on the cleric side, and the ranger one being a specialisation on the druid side (conceptually at least, EQ2 may not have a druid for example).<br />
<br />
Maybe it would be possible to go priest-&gt;[some warrior/priest type hybrid]-&gt;ranger as well? And then rogue-&gt;[some rogue/priest type hybrid]-&gt;ranger.<br />
<br />
Each of those would merely emphasise an area of the ranger. The warrior path would be stronger tanking type abilities, the priest path would be stronger spell abilities, with the rogue being stronger sneak/hide scouting type abilities.<br />
<br />
I like what little I've seen of the shadowbane type progression, where you can reach a ranger from EITHER of the 'warrior' or 'rogue' archetype trees. I would imagine that if you went warrior-&gt;ranger you would be more the wilderness warrior. And if you went the rogue-&gt;ranger you would be the wilderness scout.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could see the description of rangers being &quot;crusaders of the forest.&quot;<br />
<br />
To me, rangers are the fighting class protecting the wildlands, paladins are the fighting class protecting civilization, and shadowknights are the fighting class promoting anarchy.<br />
Each of the three &quot;crusades&quot; for some cause.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think your analysis is right on here.  Rangers traditionally have been wilderness oriented warriors with a bit of magic thrown in.  Sort of wilderness paladins.<br />
<br />
It would be cool, for those who desire it, to have a &quot;scout&quot; class that uses a rogue progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atanas</div><div class="date">04-06-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might also have to so with the spells/weapons we get.<br />
<br />
If they are similar to EQ1 then :<br />
<br />
We got heals like paladins, we got ATK buffs like SKs and we can use 2hs as well as the knights.<br />
<br />
Plus we are hybrids (like the knights) and Rogues are pure class (so are monks).<br />
<br />
So,  it does make sense to put us together with the knight classes from that point of view I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brawler, I would suspect monk....but, ya can't have a whole categore devoted to just one class..  I expect to see a few new classes too.<br />
<br />
Maybe under rogue, might have backstabber, and archer?  Who knows :)</div></div><hr />
