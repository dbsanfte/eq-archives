<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know about you guys but I've been really annoyed about the zones they chose to revamp. I can see that the PoM revamp was needed (even though many shamans liked to solo there) but other zones such as CoM and CT just don't seem necessary. Given that the revamp to CoM hasn't come yet and it could just be a tweak to the spawn rate/number or loot tables, but it still makes me nervous.<br />
<br />
Improvements should be made to zones that could be more fun, such as Najena or Unrest, since anyone with SoL won't go there anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have ideas what zones could use a change instead of my favorite zones? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CoM was good, except for a few pathing issues, and the crap loot.<br />
<br />
CT needs a real overhaul. It's as hard as the planes, with less reward all around. Either they're giving it an exp bonus, or making it easier. <br />
<br />
Personally I'm going to miss Siren's Grotto, which was a zone so pointless that it was fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">something tells me you're gonna like griegs hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seeing as how loot in the new &quot;pocket&quot; zones and Veksar eclipses anything found in comparable older dungeons, they almost need to tear them all down and rebuild them just to keep up.  No one wants to really spend time in a spot with sub-par loot anymore unless the exp is insane.  PoK killed the need to go to a dungeon close to home, so most old-school exp grinds are vacant because they are too hard or give poor experience.  <br />
<br />
Why the heck is SOE even wasting time with revamping old dungeon zones when they are about to release an expansion that is nothing but dungeons? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some people are bored of yet_another_copy_of_dreadlands_01 and enjoy dungeon crawls?  They just need to make the risk / reward worthwhile.  Need a key to get into a dungeon, up the cash loots (hello Seb).  Hopefully they'll do it right (hey, quit laughing, it can happen.   The moon was blue yesterday afterall).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Changing Unrest in any way at all would be a crime!  I still go and visit every now and again just because it's unrest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As far as Sol C and Chardok B and what not, I have been very pleased with their revamps.  The new droga was VERY VERY VERY good to a small group of friends and me (i got ornate arms, boots, and a bracer while i was 52-54, just doned them for the first time yesterday  :D ).  I love a good dungeon, and i am really looking foward to what LDoN has in store.  I just hope that there is enough new, fun, and hard stuff out there to keep me satasfied untill the next expansion or a better MMORPG comes along ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LDoN will be a lot of fun, can't say much more than that.    They've mentioned in their own releases about the group of 4 or more, but I'm not sure if they mentioned the raid of 32 or not.     If not, edit this out please.     It's gonna be the best expansion yet for everyone of all levels/gear imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm I really like the droga change, solc, and veksar are very good. I do agree that pom change is not needed, all was needed there is quests fixing and zone in changed so more people could get there. But I am looking forward to the other changes like HS, Velks changes, sirens grotto and Dragons necropolis. Dunno why they revamping CT again I thought it was good just needs a bigger exp bonus to compete or something. (btw f pop thx)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Amphybius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't mind a revamp of zones that are so infrequently visited.  Siren's Grotto anyone?<br />
Zones that serve little purpose other than to waste your time as you are running from Zone A to Zone C are annoying at best.  However, there are a lot of great zones that you can sneak on into and solo or small group without ever running into other folks.  I guess I just want to have my cake and eat it too!  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
In all I just hope things spread out a bit and become more entertaining at the same time.<br />
Here's to hoping!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PoM's zone in needs to stay where it is...   not enough mobs and long spawn times.  Put a lot of people in there and it'd be a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Siren's Grotto is a neat zone, and I enjoyed hunting there most of the time, but the pathing in there was SO buggy I eventyally had to give it up just because I was sick of my 20% hp mob vanishing into thin... err... water, or getting stuck untargetable in a wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think the biggest problem with a lot of those zones was the pathing (e.g., CoM, CT, Charasis). I haven't been back to exp in any of those spots since they made the changes to the pathing, but based on my experience in other zones those changes were wildly successful.<br />
<br />
So if pathing is no longer an issue, the only things I'd like to see changed would be stuff like requiring a rogue to get past the locked doors in CoM, Charasis and Dragon Necropolis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Long as they dont screw with any of the EPic mobs in CoM i dont care what they do to it. Mess with me epic mobs there and i will be a bit miffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">com is a great spot to pl a peep at 40+ i gonna be pissed if its now crawling with harder mobs ((<br />
<br />
I hope they change some of the keys in HS from no rent to just no drop.  <br />
<br />
I am very nervous about this patch (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Korbis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree, unrest is the epitomy of a fun zone. I'll never forget going there with my level 17 cleric when bronze armor was 2pp per AC. Grouping was fun, then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They can change all they want but it won't change players.  Players will always migrate to the easiest / fastest xp available.  And unless they do huge zem changes on every dungeon in the game I don't see anyone leaving lake of thunder anytime soon to go dungeon crawl .. which is why I believe LDoN will probably be just another download expansion that gets lumped in with LoY.  I mean really, why leave PoP, powering an aa every hour, just to crawl through a dungeon with a very high risk and a likely less reward for your effort?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think people go to zones for 4 main reasons.<br />
<br />
- Fun<br />
- XP<br />
- Loot<br />
- Newness / Exploration<br />
<br />
Sometimes they go hand in hand, sometimes they are exclusive.<br />
<br />
Droga on Quellious often has 3-4 groups going in there.   The XP is good... very good I'd say... but still not PoP xp.    The coin loot is amazing, and the named drops are &quot;ok&quot; but the real amazing part is the quest loot.   Very rare drops, and someone has to free the prisoners... but the loot is awesome.   Don't want to do your 8th shawl?  Get the FT 2 shawl + stats in Droga... will take you a long time (unless lucky) to get all the parts, but great reward while you also get xp/coin.<br />
<br />
Everytime someone logs in... it's not about UBER xp.<br />
<br />
For example... I'm only 63 right now... I know most BoT groups want 65s with lots of AAs, but still, I've gotten some invites to go there.    I do sometimes go - quite simply because the xp is amazing... but sometimes I just don't feel like dealing with the uber peeps who care purely about the DPS of the group and optimizing to ****.<br />
<br />
A good Droga crawl will net me good xp, some coin, and loads of fun.<br />
<br />
I was in Nurga for awhile... a few of the quests there are upgrades for me... xp is piss poor with most of it light blue, coin is bad (unless you luck into a few gems).<br />
<br />
My point is... there's a lot of options... and I hope VI realizes this now.<br />
<br />
Newness / Exploration only lasts for a couple of nights... sure, tons of people will check out CoM to see what's changed... but how many will stay?<br />
<br />
Fun, XP, Loot... only if it has at least 1 of those 3 elements.<br />
<br />
There's room in Norrath for all types of zones.   Doesn't always have to be about the fastest xp... but if that's what YOU or anyone else wants, more power to you... I'm glad Droga only has 3-4 groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Reiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Anyone been to CoM yet to check out the changes or any of the zones that got revamped.  Kinda interested to see what they changed and I don't get off work for another 6 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Please do tel on any of these zones... HS still need keys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Serv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">City of Mist now has lots of dreg and human lunatic models now and less undead it seemed. The castle is still keyed, so I didn't see what was changed past there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Less undead? =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Serv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Seemed that way, could of just been a wacky spawn, but there were only a few spectres and skeletons around.<br />
<br />
<br />
Howling Stones is... the exact same thing, but mobs hit for more. Cazic-Thule seemed unchanged. Pretty useless changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hm ... Howling Stones where MoBs hit for more and *still* HT out the ass? No thanks. <br />
<br />
As long as they left the undead tower in The Hole untouched, I'll be happy. With SU3 on my Paladin and the Shaman there for heals and buffs, it should make for quite the EXP spot with the ZEM, undisturbed at that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Long as they dont screw with any of the EPic mobs in CoM i dont care what they do to it. Mess with me epic mobs there and i will be a bit miffed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Student log and the rest of the pages for the epic still drop.  Droped the Spectral Courier last night and got my Log.  Also a named pops in and around the Stable.  I think its called a Plaguebone Warlord.  Dropped a decent 15AC 8Wis 40Mana Clr/Dru/Sha back piece.  Cant remember what its called but not too shabby at all.  he also drops caster arms but didnt score any of those.  Not sure about Ghiosk though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just did a 4 person group in The Hole.  Level 63 Warrior, Level 65 Shaman, Level 65 Magician and a Level 56 Wizard.<br />
<br />
First of all, it was awesome to see some of the newer models in there.  I liked the addition of the gargoyles and the HUGE golems they added in the upper area.  But then when I tried to slow things.. it quickly ruined any hope I had for this zone.<br />
<br />
My routine is cast Malos then cast Turgur's.  Once you get to where you're fighting the metallic golems (they only get partially slowed if you even land slow at all..) the resists are INSANE for magic and disease.<br />
<br />
We went all the way from the top down to in front of the old Undead area then made a left down to Yael's old area.  And let me tell you.. I could NOT land slows.  This is a really stupid 'revamp'.  I was going OOM from debuffs alone just about..   Malos.. try to land Malosini... resist.. try to slow.. resist.. try Grummus.. resist.  Whee.  Not my idea of fun.  Ended up just healing only.<br />
<br />
One thing I've always noticed about The Hole even before the revamp.. the elementals there always had super super high resists.  Now it seems those resists have been carried over to about 90% of the other mobs in the zone.  I think the only mobs I was able to land slow on were the ghosts and even then it either took too many casts or there were some that just wouldn't land at all.  Hell the mob would be dead and I'd still be trying to slow it.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, it's decent exp further in even at level 65 but don't expect to have any fun if you're the only healer.  You can't slow and you have to spend all your time healing and trying to regen the mana you blow from that healing.<br />
<br />
After that we headed off to Howling Stones and went through the North Wing.  Only thing different I noticed there (from the North Wing only) was that the Shadowknight skeletons are now the greater plaguebones instead of the sepulcher skeletons.  No idea why they reversed that.. /boggle.</div></div><hr />

The stuff that drops there now is just sold to vendors or I head to the Gorge to gather the heavy clay that I need for pottery. Totally wasted zones.</div></div><hr />

- Newness / Exploration<br />
<br />
<br />
I would have to disagree, sadly.  I think MOST people actually go to zones for 3 main reasons --<br />
<br />
1.)  XP<br />
2.)  Loot<br />
3.)  All the zones with the best of the above are full.<br />
<br />
It's a cynical view, I know ... but it seems to be on target.  Sure, there are those that thrive on the fun and adventure in this game, but most people are reward-driven in a much more tangible fashion  (which is laughable, since it's all ones and zeros anyway LOL).  <br />
<br />
PS - for a fun crawl, take a mid-50s group through the hand area/tunnels in Veksar.  I love that zone :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I couldn't pass up an opportunity to post on this.  I am VERY sure that based on my observations that the priorities to almost everyone is:<br />
<br />
1) LOOT<br />
2) Exp<br />
3) Fun<br />
<br />
Peeps will take less exp to get good loot.  Now, it's only when you are decked out that you put #2 into play, or if you have gobs of aa's then #3 starts becoming priority.<br />

Now of course there are exceptions, but I think that most peeps are powergamers at heart (and there is nothing wrong with that).</div></div><hr />

well in theory that makes the place easier, as the sepulcher skellies are the comonest mob in there.  the greaters probly HT for more tho, as they are higher lvl mobs.<br />

I have killed the Captain twice, and both times he dropped the key, and both times he spawned in the small houses between the Goo House and Lhranc's temple.<br />
<br />
The key opens the Front door to the Castle, and is added to your key ring. Its called a Stone Key.<br />
<br />
The key will NOT open the second skyhouse doors, on the way to Neh Ashiir, so you still need a rouge for this bit.</div></div><hr />

Greenies that mitigate to partial, resist like hell...then when you finally crawl down to the bottom to get the real dark blue to 65 mobs I can't slow them to save my life.<br />
<br />
Was me, 65 warrior buddy and my druidpet.  The mobs don't have that high of hitpoints but I was unable to land magic slow or snare on any mobs starting from the tunnel leading down towards the tower...past the pool with the ranger epic dude.  Even though the warrior was tash sticking them.  I even had trouble with Grummus after malicious decay.<br />
<br />
A monk friend came down to join us which helped a lot because they have pretty low hitpoints.  Thank god because I couldn't tank a grummus slowed golem or garg without heals from my druid.  They don't hit that hard, less than 300 I think, but they freaking quad and mitigate stupid grummus.  With quies on I was getting owned (5500hp/1250ish ac  with LR5)  by these guys.<br />

We got to the bottom, poke at the new Nortlav (we couldn't seem to get him below 82%) and then evac'd out... would have been better if evac hadn't left the warrior, but that's another issue altogether.</div></div><hr />

I agree that Nurga and Droga are actually very successful revamps but Sol C?!?!?<br />
<br />
That place sucks!<br />
 - zoning in to lava is very annoying and doesnt add anything at all to the gameplay<br />
 - zoning out to Sol B sucks too since mobs see invis and it can be difficult to get out of the lava<br />
 - sometimes getting adds on pulls and other times not getting any at all on the exact same pull sucks too<br />
 - unslowable mobs sucks in a dungeon where you can't move around very much<br />
<br />
Sol C is the worst zone I have been to in several months.</div></div><hr />

I like most of the zones that have come out since PoP: Droga, CharB, SolC Veksar, even some of the LoY zones are pretty good (but lacking in exp) like Nadox and Hate's Fury. <br />
<br />
... but yeah, if you can't slow reliably in the Hole even with Malos, that means it's a waste as an exp zone. I doubt an enchanter would be able to mez either in that case. <br />

  If nothing else, the risk of a nekkid corpse run through SolB and having to swim in through the lava will keep out a lot of the idiots. Same thing goes for Chardok B. Yeah, it's a bit of a pain but it does have it's benefits :D <br />
<br />
  Getting trained because a mob warps through a wall is annoying, granted. As for unslowable mobs, I don't think I've run across any and crawled through most of the zone (never done the ring event though, I hear those are unslowable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I have done the ring event in SolC. All mobs, including the final one are fully slowable. It is fun, but not difficult. I think out of the several waves I only needed to malosi on a couple before slowing. Slows were rarely resisted, and I was a 59 shaman at the time.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I am assuming that you are talking about the huge spider ring event. On the way to that event you will have to pass many giants in the lava. Those were a bugger to land anything on. We had three on us at once and they were all yellow/red to me at 59, and I couldn't get a malosi/slow/nuke/dot to land for love or money. The rest of my group was 65 and they were fully resisted on everything as well. If you plan on grinding through to the event just be prepared to hunker down and heal your melee when you get to these mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I've been in the new Hole every night since it was released. Yes it's almost pointless to try slowing the elementals and constructs. But the undead can be slowed, and I found it an interesting opportunity to try changing my role in the group. FWIW we got down to the undead tower with me healing and a ranger tanking. I never slowed a single mob.<br />
<br />
Yes I had to heal a lot, but I still had mana to malo (to help the nukers - you don't need to do damage yourself to add to the killing speed) and throw the occasional nuke.<br />
<br />
All in all I like the revamp, the only downside to xping in there is having to fight through the greenies to get to blue mobs.</div></div><hr />

Obvious assumption if you feel no ill about cheating on the epic is that you did it or plan on doing it, and therefore, I don't care what your dumb cheating ass thinks.<br />
