<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shimmera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am just curious about this.<br />
<br />
Has a final plane been reached?  I'm going to assume it hasn't, but have there been any hints about the name?  Like, Plane of Power?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KaabaCloudberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe its the Plane of Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lenas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It hasn't been reached yet technically, but some people zoned into the Plane of Time due to a bug back when planes of power first came out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rolyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Makes me wonder . . . . <br />
<br />
Plane of  Time . . . <br />
EQ2 is supposed to take place in a different time from EQ1 . .<br />
It will take a Looooong time for most folks to get to Plane of Time . . . <br />
<br />
Is it possible that VI will ever do something like:<br />
Once you get into the PoT, there is some uber quest or mob you have to finish, which flags you to move onto EQ2 with your current character?  Maybe a key that accesses a time-portal in PoT, that whisks you away into the future?   (EQ2 is in the future, right?)  Maybe all equipment stripped or something?<br />
<br />
The difficulty of getting TO Pot, let alone finishing the final step, would ensure that hoards of EQ1'ers wouldn't swarm EQ2 on release day.<br />
<br />
Also, it would be a great way of stretching the longevity of EQ1, and not alienating a huge portion of their player-base by forcing them to loose all the effort they've put into EQ1.  By removing the gear, they would not have a bunch of twinks running around in EQ2 with gear that's not available in that game.  Maybe have a level - compensator as well - you drop to half your current level or something (you regress in age/level as you travel from EQ1 to EQ2 or something like that).  Maye have a conversion algorithm or a series of choices you make to transform your current race/class combo to whatever EQ2 will offer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a thought.  Would be kinda cool though - a never ending story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Molinu Fu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thats a really good idea..<br />
<br />
Ane judging by past Verant far to intelligent for them to actually do it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saemayel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unfortunetly there will be no transferring of Characters from the current EQ to EQ2...a lot of people are dissapointed in this but its just not physically possible.The new EQ which is slated to be released in the 4th Quarter of 2003 uses a totally new Graphics Engine and Character Advancement system.<br />
<br />
In EQ2 you will be totally in control of what exactly your character can and cannot do..you want a Ranger that can also cast Physical Buffs(ie:Shaman)then you work you way towards that by training specific abilities via points that are awarded as you level.<br />
<br />
IMO I think this is a great way to run a game of the magnitude of EverQuest because it allows for greater character customization...in the end it will all depend on how they can get the codes implemented.<br />
<br />
As far as the old EQ(ie:Current Version)Sony has stated that they do plan to continue supporting it and releasing expansions/addons but not as much as they will support the new on.<br />
<br />
If your curious as to the next expansion for the current EQ keep your eyes on this site.<br />

It is still only a blank slate but I await it with baited breath.<br />

I agree with this statement 100% ... so many people complain about VI sucks , this game is messed up , blah blah blah.... yet they still play hours on end...<br />
<br />
However, to add to the topic, I have seen several screenshots posted on various boards from the emulator that shows PoTa and B.  In A it has a big clock in the middle and the rest of the area is broken up into four different areas ( Ice Age, Pyramid/Desert looking area, forest place and one other).  In PoTB i saw pictures of a room that had four corners, and in each corner there was a room with a picture of a god, so possibly you will have to go back and fight these gods (i remember seeing Innorukk, Cazic, Bertox, and one other possibly was Rallos not sure though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>J'horra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Has this expansion taken longer to get through then the others?  How do people seem to rate it or like it?  It just seems kind of odd people haven't gotten to the final plane yet.  Though I guess I don't really know how long it should take so I could be way off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KaabaCloudberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Luclin is largely considered to be the worst expansion ever due to the bane/key time sinks.  They were mostly broken when that expansion went live as well, adding further exasperation to the players.  I was mostly playing DAOC when Luclin came out though so don't know much about it, came back and everyone was elsewhere it seemed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>frankrizzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like Borzak's comment too.  So many people complain about going to work, yet they still do it.  I for one am not happy unless I'm complaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kianwan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Plane of Time will prolly be breached in another 1 or 2 months Id think. (depending on how much of a pain water ends out beeing) <br />
But Sean or someone else thats actually in the elemental planes atm would probably be a better judge of that.<br />
<br />
Daesun : So, instead of complaining about the things you find wrong in life you just sit back and hope that they get better without doing anything about it ? That imo would be alot more sad.</div></div><hr />
