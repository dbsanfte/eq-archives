<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At 25 I'm trying to hunt solo, and I was wondering what normal downtime should be.<br />
<br />
I have hunted in three different areas:<br />
<br />
Chickens in SK. Kiting. This is the most cost effective for me. Takes about 2-3 bbls mana. Problem in finding a new mob to kill which adds to downtime.<br />
<br />
Neterbian Lair(sp?) fungoids. Root roting. Much less efficent. Takes almost all my mana and 1-2 bbl health. Endless suply mobs, but hardish to pull singles (neccesary).<br />
<br />
Maru Seru(sp?) Rock hoopers. Kiting. All mana, mostly full health. Endless suply mobs, easy to pull single.<br />
<br />
All of these areas give a LONG downtime. I was wondering if this is normal at my lvl or if I'm doing something wrong?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No matter what you do it will be a long down time.<br />
<br />
At 53 it takes around 5 min to go to FM and FH with no C on and just regen and canni.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunalty there is not alot you can do except get someone to toss a C on you and just keep canning with regen on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The more levels you get the easier it will become.  A regen item would help, but not as much as more levels.  If you are soloing succesfully at 24 then you are doing pretty well.  It will get easier each time you get new spells.  <br />
<br />
After checking out your gear: maybe doing the Totemic quests would be a good way to get a cheap upgrade that will help you with soloing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At lvl25, with a partner, Netherbian was great exp.  Save the money you make and buy equipment in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Split Paw Hide Gloves - 10pp<br />
Runed Circlet - 50pp<br />
Ulthork Arms - 50pp<br />
<br />
<br />
Will help add some Wis.<br />
<br />
For some free boots, Invis, head to Maiden Eye.  After you zone in, go to the end of the tunnel, make sure Invis is still up.  Follow the wall to the right over the hill.  On the otherside of the hill is where groups nomrally pull the Coterie.  Ask them kindly if no one wants/needs Shrouded Boots (AC12, +4Str, +4Sta, +4Agi, +4Dex, +4Int, +4Wis, +5Chr, No Drop), if you could loot them.  While waiting for a pair to drop, stay invised.  When a pair drop that no one needs, loot and gate out of ME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ermmmmmm<br />
<br />
Dont add Wis!!!<br />
<br />
Add HP/AC, and for the love of god, dont buy Split paw gloves :X<br />
<br />
I do agree w/ the boots idea, i support doing that 100%.<br />
<br />
Anywya, hunt netherbian w/ a melee partner, do netherbians if you can, and make alot of PP.  <br />
<br />
<br />
i dont know an cheap Wis suggestions that retain an acceptable AC, cause i never had that problem... All i know is that i knew a shammy who had 110 wis w/ bearform on at level 40, and i never saw him oom :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From lookin at her Magelo, I think we just have a new player here who is completely poor and destitute.  I think she needs suggestions on how to obtain decent cheap/free items.  The boots idea was a good one.  She could also try camping the zone in Karnors Castle for Jarsath armor nobody wants.  Some of that has wis, and all of it is acceptable armor for her level.  Nobody usually loots it since it's not great for lvl 45 and up, and it's common drop off all named mobs.  <br />
I'd tell her to check the bazaar as well.  There should be lots of pretty cheap decent equipment out there.  <br />
<br />
Above all . . WORK ON DEFENSE!!!!!!!!!  <br />
I say this to all new shamans and I'm saying it to you now.  I want to see you gain FIVE points of defense for every level you gain!  Don't level before gaining those five points!  You have to be hit by mobs to get defense to raise, so be sure to get hit enuf to get the points ok?  Now drop down and give me twenty!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh yeah, good idea Lan...Jarsath, completely forgot about it!<br />
<br />
The Jarsath legs are great for you right now, 15 ac, 5wis.  I use them at 48(grrr so close to 49 i can smell it), but they make me look like a fashion disaster =\.<br />
<br />
All teh jarsath would be good upgrades from what you have, and should help considerably.  While your there, try to get greyish bone chips for the canni2 quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for all the replies.<br />
<br />
I interpret the responses I got this way.<br />
<br />
- When spending money, buy more AC<br />
- My downtime is normal<br />
<br />
/Merry<br />
<br />
PS Its a male toon, but who can tell with a made up name :)<br />
PPS Right now I'm soloing because I need to rise my stats. Paludal between 19 and 25 did nothing good for my melee stats.<br />
PPPS Doing the totemic (boots) right now. Stupid orc chief never drops the item though :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think I'd seriously work on upgrading ac. Unfortunately there aren't many good money and loot camps at that level. Gnolls in SK drop decent cash and FS weapons, and you can always find some birds to solo. <br />
<br />
Maybe head to frontier mountains in a level or two. Decent cash and a couple of the drops would be upgrades for you. You won't be able to solo there but getting a pickup group as a shaman should be easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">20-30 is the low point in a shamans career. Damage is low, and your melee is losing ground unless you have a great 2hb, which requires twinking. Grit it out till you get your dog at 34. It's all up from there pretty much.<br />
<br />
I thought paludal was good exp till 30, or has it greened out? If not, i'd recommend sticking with there as the exp is too good to pass up.<br />
<br />
If green, try to get a partner for mseru. The mobs are plentiful, and non-aggro. If you need to solo, you could try Swamp of No Hope skell camps, or Lake of ill omen goblins.<br />
<br />
For gear, i don't recommend going to zones you will die in and begging for freebies. Always struck me as a cheesy way to play. Doing the totemic quests will teach you a lot about different zones and give you the satisfaction of earning your gear. Also if you have friends could try take a group to Runneye for the blackened iron stuff.<br />
<br />
Could also try to save up a few hundred plat and get some rygorr. Should be very cheap these days and may even be cheaper than the duffrenite for totemic. Could also try the giant fort in FM to get a forest loop or two.<br />
<br />
Most shamans go for AC to offset the damage mobs deal on you. Followed by hps because of the value of cannibalizing for more mana. Don't ignore your wisdom though if you find your mana pool is insufficient. Later on you will be looking to acquire some kind of regen item. <br />
<br />
For now though, study the tips at the top of this page. There's good advice there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I too would suggest doing at least some of the Totemic quests (which it sounds as though you are beginning). They offer good AC, all of the MOBs you need to kill will give you experience, and they'll show you some zones that you probably haven't been to. After you get the Boots completed, I would suggest you work next on the Bracers, as they are not difficult to obtain, and it seems in looking at your gear that you would really benefit from a pair of AC 9 bracers. You might also want to drop into the Bazaar every once in a while and see if you can't find some cheap Ry'Gorr pieces.<br />
<br />
As for combat tactics, it may be that kiting is now actually efficient (with 100% DoT damage to moving MOBs), so that may be best for reducing downtime. However, it is very important that you keep up your Defense, and that can only be done by engaging the MOB. Try this, just to see if it makes any difference: melee the MOB, and use just enough mana (slow, a DoT or two, whatever seems to work for you) so that you finish the fight somewhere around 2 bubbles of health. You should have more mana than health and can then heal yourself. Cannibalize just isn't very efficient initially.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lots of good advice. Thanks all.<br />
<br />
I'm slowly accumulating money (by selling silk and HQ skins in bazaar). Allready bough a couple of Ry'Gorr pieces as they seemed to be good AC at an affordable price. I'm getting close to maxing my melee by tanking at end of fight, so I think I'm good in that regard. I will not go to high lvl zones to get left over drops. It seems to much like begging and I think that most of you agree that there is nothing more anoying than a beggar. I can ask for advice, and if in a group I will somtimes ask for a specific piece that someone else looted, but I will NEVER beg.<br />
<br />
Working on the totemic, but I will not finish it. I will go through the motions of getting the tounge? and tentacles?, but the price of the duffrenite is more than the boots sell for in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Down time? whats that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have to agree with what one of the others said. Go to Karnors Castle (yes its a dangerous run for your level, but worth it hehe) and just hang out near the zone. At least on my server, the jarsath scale stuff is almost always defaulted to rot, and people usually will call it out that whatever piece has dropped and where so that people can just come loot it if they want to. It is excellent gear for the price (free!) and will vastly improve your current gear. Are kitty shamans able to wear sebilite scale stuff? If they are, that is another option for purchasing stuff once you get a little bit of cash built up. Also, look for a spider fur belt in the bazaar. You can find one pretty cheap alot of the time, and it has great ac and hp on it (I was using one until a week ago when I got this minor upgrade in cazic hehe). Anyhow, good luck to you! You are in the grey area where your dot's do very little damage compared to the amount of HP that the mobs you are fighting have. But if you are pulling it off, more power to you :)<br />
<br />
Hmm, one quick upgrade for you would be a bloodstained tunic. It is one raw ac less than what you have currently, but it will add 4 wisdom and 4 agility (iirc) and that should make up for that one ac. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I had the same problem as you at 25, my downtime wasn't as long because of natural Iksar regen, but it wasn't too much better. My mana regen improved once I got more HP's, more AC, and Chloroplast. I'm never OOM, and rarely aim I low on mana........I got LoM one time in the last 3 levels because of 5  (total) resists on Malisement, VoS, and Togors. Damn Rhinos !!! <br />
If you find yourself going LoM alot, maybe get some more Wis +mana gear, but for the love/hate of Cazic Thule do not sacrifice alot of AC to do it. We aren't druids so let's not dress like one shall we ? <br />
Here are some upgrades you can make for cheap.<br />
Spine Chill Spear +6 Wis effect: Ice Shock - Primary put Slimey into Range slot. <br />
Blackened Alloy Medallion for neck +AC +5 wis +mana preservation II - saw them for 50pp in Bazaar. That item alone could help you out tremendously.<br />
<br />
I know I'm probably gonna get flamed for this but oh well, if things are tough in Luclin go to my homeland...Kunark. Lake of Ill Omen should be good until 30. Slow, DoT, Melee....easy as that. <br />
Totemic may be a good option for you to try for next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Don't think I would spend my hard earned money on a Spine Chill Spear. Think it would be an expensive WIS item for me right now. The proc doesn't start until lvl 40 or something. Right?<br />
<br />
Will look for one of those Blackened Alloy Medallion though. Other than that I'm slowly (money permitting) replacing most of my armor with Ry'Gorr. They cost about 100-200pp a piece (give or take).<br />
<br />
Are there any other procing weapons I could use at my lvl? Maybe not really useful, but I have never had one, so I thought it would be fun.<br />

<br />
PS Great advice, keep em coming :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Merry,<br />
I had exactly the same problems you are having now.  I started EQ a year ago, and was having a hard time.  My shaman is my first character past lvl 9, so there was no way to get good stuff without working for it.  The Totemic armor quests are great!<br />
<br />
Do the Totemic quests! Especially the Helm! <br />
By lvl 30 I had a full set of totemic. I quested all the pieces but one by myself. For the harder mobs (GRizzleknot, Grifenne, Lancer swordfish, Centaur Charger), I often had help from other people in the zone. <br />
<br />
The key for me was hunting in the zone where the drops were. Every now and then I would OOC that I was lokking for no-drop item X from mob Y. That way I never stopped XPing but still got the drops i needed. <br />
<br />
For the mobs that I didn't get help on, I learned some good EQ survival skills (how to pull, dungeon pathing, solo techniques). I'm not saying that I'm better than any other player, but I am better than I used to be!  I still pick the brain of most higher level shaman I encounter!<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
PS I dont think its looked down upon to head to Karnor's Castle to look for Jarsath armor pieces.  It's not begging because there is a significant amount of danger involved, and the armor is no-drop.  I waited at the zone line for trains, and healed and buffed the groups that didn't have shamans already.  Every now and then politley OOC that you are looking for JArsath drops in exchagne for lvl 24 shaman buffs.  most melee characters wont turn down more str and sta or regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Spine Chill Spear I think procs at 35 or 40 I can't remember. but it adds +6 wis and isn't too shabby a melee weapon. the proc is only for like 38 damage, very small and my dex is low, where it only procs once or twice every third fight. <br />
I got mine for 100pp in the Bazaar, and they've been around that price range on Innoruuk ever since I got mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tantobourne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I never bothered to think about how bandaging helps downtime but I have mine at 201 and after cannibalizing my arse off I hit the bandage macro and bandage back up to 70%, that combined with chloro keeps me in the goods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The Drakkel Icegrinder is a 2HB which procs,  you shoould be able to get one in the bazaar for 100-150pp.<br />
<br />
About the BAM, if you see one for 50pp buy it quick and sell it for the 750-1000pp that they go for on my server !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I haven't hunted in luclin at that level but I did do the Lake of Ill Omen path at 20s after south karana.<br />
<br />
I would look for forest loops for earrings. These have 3 wis and ac+agi. Perfect as these drop in the giant fort in FM. You may find that doing something till 27-30s before attempting a group in the giant fort.<br />
<br />
I would agree that keeping your defense maxed is optimal, I did a long spell of just root dotting and then had to spend some time 10-20 levels later just tanking stuff for the skill increases as my offense hit 200 well before defense. For this you will need ac/hp compared to wis.. think tank caster rather than armoured druid :)<br />
<br />
If you want to train up offense/piercing look at &quot;Spear of Mortification&quot; as a swap in weapon for the job - it has no stats and low damage but has a very low delay with a stun to boot. Perfect if your grouped with an enchanter.. if your not tanking then this will help get those skills up quickly.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I would also suggest looking for a mana conservation 2 item (I'm not sure but I think runed mith bracers have it, these also have wis too). This will help effectively add more mana to you - especially as it will make regeneration/cana more mana efficient. Thus helping down time.<br />
<br />
Other than that I can't really help, I was in old school totemic/blood stained tunic till SS and believe me you have good armour compared to carrie at 25!!<br />
<br />
Ahh those where the days... when I was green with envy at a totemic bp... I even got lent a Iksar BP when they first dropped.. the regen for a level 24/25 shammy is obscene :)<br />
Pity I had to return it :/</div></div><hr />
