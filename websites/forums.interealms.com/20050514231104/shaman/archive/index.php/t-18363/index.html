<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, it will be interesting to see what type of changes this will bring to the face that we see of EQ.  <br />
<br />
I've been one of the lucky few people that has never had any problems in the game that required GM assistance.  Ive never had to email Sony for anything.  I always liked the way tha tAbsor presented himself and could empathize with some of the dificulties that he faced on a day to day basis, having been manager of a Customer Service office myself.  I'm glad that he has moved onto something that he enjoys, and hope that he is able to implement some interesting changes to the design departments.  Having listened to players bitches and moans, ideas and thoughts for 3 years puts him in a possibly unique possition to make the game better for all of us.<br />
<br />
I say good luck Absor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, a steaming pile of dog feces is still a steaming pile of dog feces. Absor's promotion does beg one question - <br />
<br />
What level of the Peter Principle did he validate and lord help us - what is he doing now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i didnt really mind absor, he could have let us know what was going on more consistantly, other than that i think he did a good job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Absor better than Abashi? Hardly. They are both equally inept to do any CS related job.<br />
<br />
Abashi: Working as intended!<br />
Absor: It's an emulator!<br />
<br />
Arrogant, clueless, incompetent CS type people. Not to mention SOE should know by now that players know *FAR* more about EQ then any SOE Dev/CS guy/GM.<br />
<br />
Absor's reaction to the hacks/dupes shouldn't have been talking out of his arse and arrogant reply without   0.00000001 seconds of thinking: It's obviously an emulator! He should have said: we'll take a look into it fast. Even if he never planned to. <br />
<br />
One worthless CS puppet gone. Good ridance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Despite the legitimate criticism some of the childish namecalling in this thread is rather uncalled for. SoE and Absor are likely far from perfect and there are of course several issues that could use discussion and improvement, that's no reason to fall back into personal insults.<br />
<br />
Yes i know, i am no mod, but that constant unconstructive SoE bashing starts to tick me off a bit. Call me a VAK if you must, would fit quite well in the level of some of the previous posts.<br />
<br />
Oh well, good luck in the future Absor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There is good cause for unconstructive bashing....4 years of constructive attempts have proven futile and meaningless.<br />
<br />
So, we have our third SOE sock puppet to tell us things that either A) We already know, or B) Are wrong.<br />
<br />
Joy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hehe, I used to be a manager at Wal-Mart and whenever someone got demoted or just moved to another position because they could not handle the one they were in, its was presented to people as &quot;a new opportunity&quot;, or &quot;a new challenge.&quot; You would say &quot;so-and-so has decided to take on a new challenge&quot; then you would move them to something they would be less likely to screw up. :)<br />
Looks to me like maybe his performance was not quite what was acceptable going forward and they offered him something else rather than fire him because he has been with them for so long.<br />
And the word developer can mean many things, not all of which directly impact the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Lol ... pretty scary that the Customer Service Manager for the last 2 years is moving up(?) to the Community Relations Manager position. Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Any takers that the Customer Service position will remain unfilled ... well, not like there has been anyone there lately anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Absor ever post here? lol.</div></div><hr />

His WHOLE JOB was to communicate with the player base folks...</div></div><hr />

Yeah he has....usually 2 sentences a year pfft</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I find it amusing how people can say absor did an ok job as community relations manager, although he didn't communicate well.<br />
<br />
His WHOLE JOB was to communicate with the player base folks...<br />
<br />
I'm betting that most of his job actually entailed much more than just communicating with the player base.  While that was certainly the part of the job that we saw it probably was only a small part of what he did on a day to day basis.  I would think that most of his job was involved in answering emails, PM's, letters and such from not only players but other companies that he company formerly known as Verant would interact with.  Press releases, interviews, information distribution all came from his office.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that he always made what I considered to be the right choices, but then I didnt have as much access to nearly as much information as he did.  He was also responsible for trying to save SOE as much face as possible, which is what I see when he says things like &quot;Its an emulator&quot;, or&quot; we are looking into it&quot;.  <br />
<br />
As I posted before, I have never had any problems that needed any help from the customer relations folks.  I suppose that I could get all bent out of shape about things that happen in the game, but this is a game.  Its something I do for fun.  I dont know about others, but getting all worked up because of things that I dont have all the information about isnt fun.  I dont think its fun to scream and cry about people that I dont know who are doing things for reasons that I dont have access to.<br />
<br />
But then thats me....</div></div><hr />

Some of you guys would tee off on your grandmother if she worked for SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Absor did an ok job I think, but didn't seem to take a very balanced approach to places he visited. He might post one or two times a year here or on the cleric board, but he could always stop by gu comics once or twice a week to make a comment. Seems that he would visit places like the safehouse more too, thats just my general observation though. If you're going to be communicating with the players you should be giving all of them an equal shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Y'know, I emailed Absor twice.<br />
<br />
Once was about a pathing exploit where you could get NPCs stuck and kill them without them able to reach you.<br />
<br />
Second was about an item bug, where an item was tagged with an effect that made no sense.<br />
<br />
Both times, he passed the issues on to their testing department and they were silently fixed within a couple of patches.<br />
<br />
What's that prove?  Maybe nothin'<br />
<br />
Maybe that yeah, he actually was doing his job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have to agree that he was a hell of a lot better than Abashi.  Good?  eh.  He at least never said anything as remotely asinine as the &quot;miniature troll&quot; comment, which is still to me the most ridiculous thing out of anyone at SoE/Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">He may have been doing his job, but he totally dropped the ball with these recent exploit/hacking issues.<br />
<br />
He was flat-out embarassed on the Graffe thread and made the entire company look completely clueless (because, yes, he is the relations manager -- aka, the voice of the company).<br />
<br />
This is not a new opportunity.  This is similar to when professional sports coaches are &quot;reassigned&quot; only to, shortly thereafter, resign and pursue other opportunities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Absor posted regularly in Graffe because Wizards are one of the most vocal and tightly knit group of players.  He just acknowledged a thread about himself in regards to this news.<br />
<br />
Shamans do not really push as hard as the wizards for any changes.  In customer service, you usually try to fix the squeakiest wheel.  Grats to him anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">&quot;Please remember that we all have our own ideas of how the game should be and they may not all be implemented or even considered (I for one feel that Halflings should rule Norrath, for some reason the Dev team is not with me on this). &quot;<br />

Quote from the new guy.....<br />
<br />
Never... Ever... I as a member of the Halas community will EVER take an order from a Halfling.<br />

Soo..why didn't he post on the warrior boards? Were they not vocal?<br />
<br />
Answer: He played favorites and was completely out of touch with several class communities</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">No community relations manager is going to have the slightest chance of success if he adopts the same policy as Absor or Abashi: to simply act as the official mouthpiece of SOE.  That leads to them uttering nonsense such as 'working as intended', 'spell drops are fine', 'there will never be any soulbinders' and so on.  He should not simply repeat worthless assurances given by the dev team: all that happens is that he loses credibility.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that instead the new CRM realise that he can work far more effectively if he considers himself the player's advocate and adopt the players' belief set, not the developers'.  Let us judge whether something has been fixed or not: after all we are the people actually 'testing' EQ.  If the player community says its not fixed (and not one or two individuals) then it probably isn't.<br />
<br />
Oh and one other - rather obvious - point, though it appears to have been missed by SOE in the past.  One or two uber guild leaders do not represent the player community, and in fact have very little knowledge of EQ as it is played by the vast majority of SOE's paying customers.</div></div><hr />

Got to totally agree with this.<br />
Furore is nothing but an if i dont get my way type of person im going to throw my toys out of the pram.<br />
Thott well what can i say apart from i wouldnt p%%s on him if he was on fire.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately as theyre organised uber raiding guilds tend to make more noise than the other 90% of players in EQ so their word is taken as gospel by SOE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I believe the customer relations folks at SOE read most of the major boards like this one, and thus have a very good sense of the range of opinions out there among all player types.  When they make unpopular moves or neglect important problems, the boards are full of complaints about it.  This is how we really communicate with SOE, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
