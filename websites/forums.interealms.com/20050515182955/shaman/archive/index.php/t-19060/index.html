I cannot see any resposes past my post if I load the thread.  I can see the thread post count go up, but that's it.  I tried posting on a 2nd thread, and I can't get it to refresh either.  In fact, on the 2nd thread, the only thing I see when I load it is the original post.  In the thread list, it has 6 responses, but none appear when I load the thread.  Yes, I've forced my laptop to refresh the webpages with F5.  The 2nd thread title is:<br />

have you tried closing all your current browser windows and start the browser completely new (so no other instances of the browser open)<br />

maybe then try deleting the cache of the browser and restart it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alluring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Honestly--not to be flip, but why?<br />
The benefits of that are price deflation. That puts fairly decent items in the hands of younger players (decent being relative to level of course).<br />
<br />
With each expansion, mobs seem to hit harder for the various levels. Compare lvl 15ish-20ish zones for SoL versus old world norrath. Younger players actually need decent equipment to handle some of the later expansions.<br />
<br />
Clearly, there is a problem with that--as time progresses, we see more and more uber equipment because nothing ever leaves the economy without a deliberate nerf . . . but still.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.<br />

Shaman do not need anything. Lets list all that we get as it is and how good they are.<br />
Pet: 7/10<br />
Slows: 8/10<br />
Hastes: 8/10<br />
Buffs: 10/10<br />
DoTs: 7/10<br />

Over all we are one of the best classes to solo with and group with. We don't need anything. Unless other classes get something to make them better.<br />

I actually am posting in spite of myself—and it’s gonna be a LONG post. These threads tend to be excruciatingly painful to read, mostly because the people posting have no clue what they’re talking about. (No doubt some will immediately point fingers at me.)<br />
<br />
My bonafides, such as they are—my main is a 65 shaman with 557 AAs. I’m the raid leader of a time enabled guild, and yes, we have cleared time in under 6 hours. What does that mean? Besides the fact that I’ve played a shaman for a good long while and that I’ve had to memorize most of the abilities of other classes, not much. However, it does mean that I have had to play almost every class out there at some point. Those on which I have spent the most time are druids, enchanters, clerics, warriors, monks, rangers and wizards. I’ve spent the least time playing beastlords. (For the class of trolls who can’t refute something so resort to insults—yes, I have a life, a girlfriend who is entirely too good for me, a job, and I do exercise. )<br />
<br />
First, I’m going to take a moment to be elitist—one of the earlier posters was exactly right. Shaman are comparatively very powerful at level 60 (compared to other classes). HOWEVER, from levels 61-65, especially with the inclusion of AA abilities, the other classes take a major jump in power. Shaman do not. Shaman are very static in power from 61-65. That leaves them noticeably behind the curve on balance. I am going to be talking about end game shaman (level 65). If haven’t played a level 65 shaman, and aren’t correcting something I say about a class other than a shaman, you don’t have any business replying. My response to you is, “talk to me when you’ve experienced it.” Shaman have not had a significant upgrade since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Shaman are not hybrids. We are a priest class. Originally, near as I can tell, our role was to be sort of a battle priest. We trailed slightly in healing, but had higher melee caps. That was useful up until about level 50ish when mobs started to beat the tar out of us.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to today—clerics now out melee shaman at the end game. Out of curiosity, I dueled a cleric (weapons only). I was using a 1hs 23 del, 32 damage with a 450dd proc (-350 resist check on DR). The cleric was using his summoned hammer. Same hp, same haste on both characters, close to the same AC (I was higher!). The cleric won. Clerics get the slam ability too. Only large race shaman get slam—and it caps at a skill of (1)—or maybe (0). I forget. Other shaman have no ability or spells to stun a mob. I think I can safely say the ‘vision’ for shaman no longer is that of a battle priest. What about the rabid bear AA, some may ask. If you spend the AA on it, and the max AA to hasten it, you get 5 minutes of better melee every hour and 20 something minutes.<br />
<br />
Let’s look at nukes a sec. Shaman have 2 types of direct damage (dd) spells. One is a rain which pisses of chanters and gets resists you have to use to believe. After malos, I usually get at leave 1 of the 3 waves resisted. While I’m mentioning it, why is it that it hits FOUR targets once, or 1 target 3 times? However, if we cast it on four targets and stand close, it hits four targets ONCE and will still hit me for all 3 waves? Love those game mechanics. Oh, yeah. Rain spells can’t be used next to your without nuking yourself, and it the mob moves or is pushed out of the rain effect, it won’t get hit.<br />
<br />
The other line is direct single target nukes (cold and poison lines). We have one fire nuke (our first nuke at level 1) and never got another one. Our best nuke is 925 damage (cold) but takes 7.8 seconds to cast! Do the math and you’ll see that RANGERS can out nuke us—they can just cast twice and do 1400 damage before our spell gem has even refreshed from the universal 2.2 second delay between cast times. Our poison line does less damage, though is marginally faster. Our dam/mana ratio is pretty awful too. This problem is exacerbated by the GoD spells currently on test. Somehow Shaman are the only class not getting a larger nuke. Clearly we aren’t nukers.<br />
<br />
Okay, so we aren’t nukers or melee. What about healing? One of the biggest fallacies floating around is that shaman don’t need to heal because we have slow. Wrong. PoP mobs, or LDoN hard mobs hit hard. Rumor has it that GoD mobs hit harder. I don’t care if it’s slowed or not, or if you have a time equipped tank or not—mobs get lucky and can get good hits in on everyone. A single max double hit (1 round) in a hard ldon does more damage than our largest heal—and the cast time on that heal is 10 seconds (and isn’t affected by spell haste). That doesn’t, of course, address the fact that people take damage BEFORE it’s slow. Our heals are significantly worse than a druid—for the same mana.<br />
<br />
I could go into a long analysis of fast and slow heals, but the bottom line is . . . shaman are lacking. I don’t know of any 65 shaman that use our 10 second (in)complete heal of 1950. Everyone uses tnargs—base 1300 heal because we can get AAs and focus items to make it . . . close to the BASE druid fast heal. Our heals barely touch a tank with 10,000+ hp. We have no group heals. Even a druid gets an AA ability to heal the group. Paladins are getting a new nearly 1k single target heal (1 second cast time!) in GoD. Not to mention that they OWN for group heals. Strangely, in GoD, clerics, druids, and paladins are getting new heals. Shaman get a new heal over time that does an extra 60 hit points of healing every six seconds. Hate to break it to ya Sony, but even slowed PoP mobs do more than 300 OR 360/tic. I shudder to think just how effective we’ll be in GoD (the image of bailing a leaky boat with a spoon comes to mind). Okay, so we’re not very good healers (a hybrid WARRIOR class out-heals us!).<br />
<br />
How about pets? That seems to be the vision for us in GoD. We’re getting lots of new pet abilities. The shaman community has done LOTS of tests on pets so far. Base dps on dog dog is 12.7 dps. If we carry around backpacks of rusty weapons and give it two weapons (since shaman have NO items to summon a weapon), it can suddenly dual wield. Fully buffed and weaponed, it can do around 38 dps. (all numbers dependant on AC/level of target, of course—these targets are blue con mobs at 65). Just for reference, our level 56 poison DoT does similar dps. The only class with a pet worse than ours is the single level 55 druid bear pet (which is so patently bad as to not really even qualify). Shaman pets are just bad. Okay, so we’re not even CLOSE to a pet class. Our pet qualifies as a low level DoT at best. (BTW, thanks Sony, for giving us a ton of new pet AAs in GoD—I’m sure it will get our pet up to maybe 45dps for only 150AA pts. /sarcasm off)<br />
<br />
How about DoTs? All of our DoTs are stackable—we can do major dps if we stack 8 DoTs on a mob! Now . . . uh . . . oh wait. I’d have to unmem slow, cannibalize, heal(s), malos . . . erm, nm. Our top 3 DoTs can do decent dps. Blood, Breath, and Bane—maybe up to 1000/tic. Of course, in a group, you’re tanking if you cast all that. Not to mention it has to be a pretty piss-poor group if the mob lasts long enough for you to cast all those. Well, we can solo—but solo exp was nerfed pretty hard. We have to root/rot too, since we can’t melee mobs (even slow) in PoP effectively—see discussion on our heal over time spell (quiescence) above. On a good note, we’re getting a new DoT in GoD. Currently, it’s yet another of our disease DoTs—whoops. Did I forget to mention that our disease dots take 2.1 minutes to run? Unless you’re soloing, when was the last time you were in a group that took 2.1 minutes to kill a single mob (besides a named or raid level mob). Our entire disease line of DoTs is useless in a competent group. It’s a complete waste of mana—you’re better off nuking with that slow-as-heck nuke. But look at the bright side—we get a NEW useless DoT. /cheer. In GoD we at least get crit DoTs, never mind that it costs a heck of a lot more (30AA last report) to get them. Who cares if it cost casters a lot less to get their crits. Screw the DoT classes.<br />
<br />
Well, now, let’s come to the big thing—slows! Shaman are the master of slows! Sort of. Beastlords cast it faster. Enchanters cast it almost as well. Shm-75%, ench-70%, bst—65%. Current parses of mitigated slow (ie everything endgame) seem to indicate that the above percentages are reduced proportionately. Let’s look at mobs ‘slightly’ effected by slows. That means it’s about 25% effective. Multiplying it out yields: Shm-18.75%, ench-17.5%, bst—16.25%. Not too impressive is it? Don’t worry! Shm can heal! (We’ll just ignore the fact that shaman healing was last changed before mitigation was put in!) So what if mobs are doing almost their full unslowed damage! Shaman can slow so they don’t need heals! Right? On a good note, we get a new slow in GoD—it does 60% slow instead of 75%, costs more mana, has a TWELVE second refresh (cause we never get more than 1 mob in camp), lasts 42 seconds instead of 6.5 minutes, and will fizzle more because it’s level 65 instead of 51, but it’s NEW! I’m in a rush to memorize it, let me tell ya!<br />
<br />
What about buffs? Our stat buffs are vital for those end game people who need the additional 2 strength to hit their cap (hint—there aren’t many who aren’t well over the caps). What about avatar? +140 attack and stats? Well, the BL (a true hybrid—the total twit who called shaman a hybrid class needs to be shot to improve the gene pool) can give more attack with their buff. HP buffs? Shaman can only do 430hp unless the target has less than max stamina. BLs can do about as well.<br />
<br />
Mana regen? A lot has been made over this, but it’s getting deflated constantly. Enchanters and (in GoD) clerics get a free bar of mana every once in a while (depends on how many AAs they spend). The FT cap is pretty big. Horses. Paragon, SD, VoQ, Bot9, clicky buffs—thinks ain’t as far spread out as they used to be. Shaman mana regen is good, but not god. Since DoTs are apparently meant to be out primary mode of damage (never mind agro issues), I also invite you to go look at the mana costs on those—it’s obscene. They also get resisted a lot.<br />
<br />
Someone tell me again how overpowered I am because I can solo Lodizal or Yeldema. I hate to break it to you, but so can other classes. Hell, a warrior on our sever solo’d Yeldema before PoP came out!!!<br />
<br />
Does any of this start to make you wonder why some shaman are annoyed? In GoD we get a DoT no one wants, a slow no one will use, and a ton of pet AAs for a pet that sucks rocks. We’re getting a new cannibalize spell that is LESS efficient than the one we have (it’s more damage per cast but gives a lower percent of mana back—nets to about 1 more mana per tic). We can’t keep up on healing in a group because one resisted slow and our tank gets pounded to heck and we’re reduced to chain healing with no time for another slow on hard mobs. We get no group heals, even like the 40+ minute AA for druids.<br />
<br />
So to all you pundits screaming, “overpowered”, I say you’re morons. Hybrids out heal us, melee out nuke us, and we’ve got more pathetic ‘skills’ and spells on the way while everyone else gets upgraded.<br />
<br />
Oh well. At least I can go solo Yeldema if there aren’t any warriors camping him.<br />

To whom it may concern,<br />
<br />
The issues presented by Chutoi in the thread linked below truly deserve some serious and honest review by the devs and decision makers.<br />
<br />
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056591-9.html<br />
<br />
I've been playing since P4 beta and have several mid 50's characters, the highest level being a 56 Shaman. So while I can't personally attest to the validity of his arguments, I *do* follow the Shaman community very closely (via the Shamans Crucible forums) and know that most of his points are discussed frequently by the community.<br />
<br />
I know that a few SOE folks have dropped by the Shamans Crucible and posted on the forums from time to time in the past. I just wanted to bring this particular post to your attention since it was so well thought out and presented, and truly seems to embody the opinions and concerns of the Shaman community itself.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope this post and the issues presented within receive due consideration and appropriate action.<br />

I would LOVE for SoE to wake up and finally realize how it is to play a shaman but I am not holding my breath for any change at all. In fact I bet Ceno will be around to tell you to delete your shaman and start a beastlord way before we see any tangible response from SoE ;)</div></div><hr />

on your own messageboards. It gives a very detailed listing of things that just doesn’t make sense when you compare how shamans have developed in strength since release and particularily in the last couple of years compared to just about all other classes.<br />
<br />
When you read it think about what it is a shaman is supposed to do best and how that ability has “improved” the last couple of years while our other abilities has suffered because of our “extreme superiority” in that single ability.<br />

utter bull and the shaman community knows this! <br />
<br />
Shamans making out like bandits all ready and even after [u](Edit) GoD. <br />
<br />
For all you that don't know how a shaman fights they slow the mob and get in its face. Those that can't be slowed shamans have a problem with (oh but now they are getting a disease based slow that is practically unresistable in (Edit) GoD expansion and they have and already an unresistable disease debuff to help it land just incase). The Shaman litterally dots the slowed mob in the faces and takes the damage for their pets. Did I mention too that alot of shamans with their own buffs top 200+ in their alot of their stats buffs like agi, sta, dex (helps in dodging mobs, health, and casting while very slowly being hit). Shamans can very easily in gear and their AC buffs get to the soft AC cap of 1250. And they have HP buffs. And if that wasn't enough a shaman with Regrowth, bear form, AAexp points, his own regen potions, as a regening race, fungi tunic Regens a hefty amout of a tick infront of a mob. <br />
<br />
NO WONDER A SHAMAN COULD TANK THE LODI TURTLE AND JUGGERNUTS IN OS. <br />
<br />
Has anyone noticed the recent upgrades are pretty gear towards the fighting style of shamans thou offer to many other classes. <br />
<br />
slightly pre-(Edit) GoD<br />
1. New AA exp Combat Stability allowing a shaman to take less damage while up infront of their 'slowed' mob <br />
<br />
2. New AA exp Combat Agility allowing a shaman actually DODGE better while up infront of their 'slowed' mob <br />
<br />
3. Brand new 75% heal (no 10 seconds is not to long to wait infront of a slowed mob... why? because shamans wait 8 seconds to cast their JBB for free... How do they get off spells you say? Easy their own high 200+ dex buffs, the 75% slowed mob, and oh yes if they are a ogre they don't even worry about being stunned or interrupted. <br />
<br />
after (Edit) GoD<br />
<br />
1. The Dots are Crazy powerful. &quot;MOOCHO, serious FAST damage we are talking about.&quot; <br />
<br />
2. The new dog pet will be an awesome addition. The dog will do more damage like a dot for the shaman. <br />
<br />
3. New stat buffs to get maybe even to 255 in all their stats <br />
<br />
4. The New shamans hp buff is a Very nice addition for soloing. <br />
<br />
5. The brand new disease base slow which is hard to resist. <br />
<br />
6. And Hyena failed to mention that yes shamans are getting a new DD spell but that they have always done not that much damage in DDs. That Dots are used most by shamans in raid encounters to begin with. <br />
<br />
When it comes down to it, it is pretty impressive what a shaman can tank in the degree of high lvl mobs while they are just simply soloing for exp. <br />
<br />
AND I HAVE NOT EVEN GONE INTO THE (Edit) GoD AAexp abilities that could help them to tank uber mobs even more.<br />
<br />
<br />
hopefully ppl will take this the right way.<br />

Very well thought out and concise discussion of the shaman class and attitudes within the shaman playerbase of everquest.<br />

And yes Litgruv, this may be deja'vu.  And if that doesn't tell a sadder story than any you have heard about the shaman class, nothing ever will.<br />

It's fun that we still have people (melee) using the &quot;But you have slow&quot; arguement against us for soloing etc...<br />
<br />
Mainly because I was bored, I've solo'd a warrior to lvl 55.  No two-box, no power lvling just me and the mobs.  The warrior has some ok weapons and armor all of which was easily purchased in bazaar.  I did a few things, like buy buffs and buy haste/sow potions.  But the number one thing that gave me the edge, imho, was damage shield.  I made sure I got fresh DS when I set out but I also had.  Soloing a warrior to 55 (this was done some 6-8 months ago) I went from EF to BB/QH to NK/SK then went to FV and solo'd dogs.  Finally ending in DL.  Based on my experience (and I suck a** as a warrior) and the newer weapons/armors/buffs/augs I'm not sure I'd see it too difficult to solo to 65.  Itwould be boring and slow, but possible.  Could easily do 60 I'd imagine.  Funny thing is it took me just as long to solo a mob as a warrior w/DS as it did with my shaman w/slow.   Some of these melee seem to be underestimating the power of a good DS.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

Sony get your heads outta your collective hinders and pay very close attention to that post IN ITS ENTIRETY make no mistake that fixing one thing is not the key to creating a well rounded Shaman class, regardless of the abilities or lack there of any other class.<br />
