There was a poster named &quot;TheWarrior&quot; who talked so much trash, I had to write a song.<br />
<br />
So here is TheWarrior's theme song, a song from his point of view.  To the tune of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; by Dire Straits.<br />
<br />

Pull the mobs with the Archery<br />

<br />
We got to forge our own damn armor<br />

<br />
I cant solo, my downtime is too long<br />
I need a cleric to powerlevel me<br />
I just got killed in the Eastern Wastes<br />
by some bad-ass Snow Bunny<br />
<br />
We got to forge our own damn armor<br />
Smithings only at twenty three<br />
We got to lug these two handed weapons<br />
Can you taunt this Dervish off me?<br />
<br />
I can't run when something agros me<br />
Theyve got snare as a last resort<br />
Why do people always tell me that I remind them<br />
Of the poop in West Freeport<br />
<br />
We got to forge our own damn armor<br />
Smithings only at twenty three<br />
We got to lug these two handed weapons<br />
