<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>exiledchild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all <br />
<br />
 I am lookin for a good place to get decient xp now that I am 52. It looks like my long love affair with the bloodgills has finally come to an end and i will have to venture out from my watery home to find new lodging where the action is more suited to my lvl. I am not apposed to mind numbing boredom, just like to find good wholesome XP at a decient rate and i am a happy man. <br />
   I was thinking of going to the entrace to the whole but was looking for some other options since it has been taken the last few times i tried.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should b able to solo the Hole entrance (assuming its free).  You can also solo in Jaggedpine Forest; staring at animal butts all day long is a safe, though very boring, way to attain xp.<br />
<br />
If I'd a druid I could bot, as well as my ranger, I'd know more about where you can duo.  Unfortunately, I'm all I've got, so I cannot tell you much more.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you want to group, there are a few more options available . . .<br />
Bring some friends to the Hole, go and lfg in Velks, Seb, KC, Chardok, etc.</div></div><hr />

Not the fastest exp., but it was steady and controllable, and not bad coin due to named drops and acrylia.</div></div><hr />
