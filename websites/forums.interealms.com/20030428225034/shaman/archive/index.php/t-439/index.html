<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently started working with Alchemy, and I am at a skill level of 42 (trivial on ITU potions).   I figure the best way to increase skill is to go to the next level of potions that people actually buy, even if there's a 30 point diff in skill, and just do that.  Since this is the way I usually do trade skills, I figured my next best bet was shrink potions, which are trivial at 70'ish.  <br />
<br />
My question to you is this.  Alchemy is the only trade skill that i've worked on that I have yet to find a chart listing the best possible way to get to such and such a skill level, or 0-180.  Basically i'm wondering if there is a link or if any of you have seen a list that says &quot;do this potion til it trivials, then this til it trivials&quot; basically showing the cheapest possible way to max alchemy.  I know i'm asking for alot, but it's better to ask, then to not know.  Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The following is how I leveled up my skill with the least plat(after practicing and having required level). Keep in mind i was mid 50's before i starting taking alchemy serious. My wisdom was also 225+. Starting with Lesser vigor(4pp) max skill at 17. Next is Lesser adroitness, cohesion, power, or accuracy(4pp) maxed at 22. Then minor cold or antibody(4pp) maxed at 27. Then minor heat, purity, or null(4pp) maxed at 32. Next, is sow(5pp) maxed at 37. Then IU(11pp) maxed at 42. EB(12p) maxed at 47. Dmg shield(10pp) maxed at 52. Disease or Poison Tx(7pp) maxed at 57. Ultravision(7pp) maxed at 63. Shrink(9pp) maxed at 70. Stability, Vigor, or cohesion(9pp) maxed at 76. Accuracy, Power, or adroitness(9pp) maxed at 83. Null or antibody(9pp) maxed at 90. Aura of heat or cold(9pp) maxed at 96. Aura of purity(9pp) maxed at 103. Spirit shield(27pp) maxed at 110. I then did a few greater negation(35pp) to about 117, and then switched to Kilva skin flame(30pp) up to skill 136. Greater Stability , Vigor, or Cohesion(18pp) to skill 143. Then Greater Power, Adroitness, or Accuracy(18pp) to skill 150. Now, you can either do Greater Aura Cold, Antibody, or Null(18pp) to 156 and then Greater Aura Heat or Greater Purity(18pp) to 163 OR start with Grow potions(11pp) until skill 175</div></div><hr />
