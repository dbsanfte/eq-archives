So I cut my charisma down to 40 and tried to slow some blue/white/yellow cons and had a horrible time.  I had to cast mali line on them to get it to stick (lvl 45, 198 WIS).  CHA to 127 and I almost never have to debuff them first.  Yellows sometimes but not often.  And with 127 CHA I almost never get resist on normal mobs on slow.<br />
<br />
So I'm assuming slow landing is somewhat charisma based.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know at what point CHA will stop helping with this?<br />
Like...is there a point where once you get over a certain amount of CHA, slow does not have any better chance of landing?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of getting some nice +wis leggings (got Totemic now heh) and dropping my Book of Obulus (as I almost never heal enough for it to be useful) and getting a second Opal Encrusted Stein.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This one got beat into the dirt a couple years ago.  Folks posted pages and pages of logs, statistical evidence, etc.<br />
<br />
Other folks rebutted it saying CHA didn't matter, etc.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, in my own experience, 2 factors help to land slows -- proximity and charisma.<br />
<br />
This isn't a guarantee that it's gonna land every time, but in my own experience, I've found that charisma over 100 and being right under the mob really help to land that slow on the first cast.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary, and some folks will probably say it doesn't help...<br />
<br />
Whether or not it helps, that's anyone's guess, but I don't see how it hurts either.<br />
<br />
As for REALLY high CHA, say 150+, I haven't found that to make much of a difference.  Certainly not enough to warrant giving up AC / mana / HP / resist gear for the extra CHA, it's easy for us to get CHA to 100+ via buffs, and if you can get it to 125 or so without giving up much other gear, I'd say go for it.  In ToV, etc.  I try to run with around 110 - 115 CHA to help land those slows.</div></div><hr />

There's been a lot of Tub thumping on the whole Charisma and Slows subject.<br />
<br />
Here are some interesting threads.<br />
<br />
Personally somedays I think it does make a difference, and then others I think Nahhh. ;)<br />
<br />
Yes, charisma again (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4042&amp;highlight=slow+charisma) <br />
<br />
Charisma and slows (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2018&amp;highlight=slow+charisma) <br />
<br />
Does Charisma help us Slow, Debuff, Root? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1931&amp;highlight=slow+charisma) <br />

Cha..?? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=691&amp;highlight=slow+charisma) <br />

Once you've read all that you'll still be undecided either way!<br />
<br />
I think If you've got that mana and it makes you feel better, then go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If the entire Dev team came here and posted that Charisma helps land any spell better I still would never buff my charisma of think about it. I go for days without seeing a resist on slow. Not one resist in 3 hours of fighting at the bank in Chardok. One or 2 in SG AND I was actually landing slows on Seahorses!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I heard spinning around 10 times real fast then trying to slow a mob lowers resist rates...but only if its between 3-7pm game time, on a full moon, on days with the letter 'T' in them.<br />
<br />
I carry a chicken around with me just in case I need to slow something.  439!  Doink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ergomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">im an ogre sham and i have a lovely 42 charisma and I never buff it ever and dont care to.  I can land slow npnp at 60 you should have an enchanter around for raids etc when slow is important.  However I have had a green mob resist slow then land it without debuffing on a Guardian wurm at lv 59 /shrug</div></div><hr />
