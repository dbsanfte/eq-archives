<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a new 65 shaman without many AAs and only Q for my 65 spells.  I belong to a relatively large family guild.  We have enough firepower to take on a dragon like Xanamech, but lately when we've tried the shamans in the raid are totally resisted for slow.  <br />
<br />
The latest tactic was for one shaman to Malos and some of the lower levels to Cripple.  I as the other 65 shaman cast the first Turgurs, then all the shamans tried to chain-Turgurs until we got one of them to land.  The chanters tashed and crippled also.  None of the shamans landed a slow and we all died quickly.<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah; he's really MR, but is there some way that we're missing to help mitigate that?  What stratgies have you all used to get this guy slowed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We have done this dragon a dozen or so times. Found that a combination of Tash, Malo(s), and Malosini line pretty much make a slow doable. Once he's slowed he's cake.<br />
<br />
The big thing is to have a good, durable MA. Believe our MA strat is to have cleric DI MA, let gnome do his thing, and MA goes defensive using his AOE taunt to keep aggro(I think, could be wrong on this part). We've never had MA lose aggro that way. Other thing is to have healers use fast casting heals.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perhaps a silly question but you don't mention one anywhere....<br />
<br />
Do you have a bard playing OOS or equivalent for extra MR debuff? It makes big difference.<br />
<br />
Another thing to try (I've not done Xana with slower role) is having one shaman dedicated to disease slow. Malicious decay + grummus may have a better chance of sticking and giving you a pre-slow of 40%.<br />
<br />
Levels is also very important - ok you're 65 but are the other shaman too? Having a few 65 shaman will greatly increase your chances.<br />
<br />
Finally - don't forget your chanters and beastlords. Might as well have em throw some slow attempts in the mix too if you're struggling to slow with the shaman you have. I'd have chanters slow before cripple, aggro is similar for each anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zeal4u</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did Xanamech this last weekend and got slow to land. I malo'd, chater tashed. I tried ton slow after malo, failed, then hit with 'sina and tried, failing again, 3rd try i moved up to melee range and 'poof' slowed Xanamech. Dunno if getting in melee range made a difference but on some mobs it does /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Getting in melee range with a lot of mobs is very important<br />
<br />
1. You really can't ping pong the mob around<br />
2. Reduces the resist rate a lot I find. This is something i think all shaman should get use to doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should Malos and Malosinia first.<br />
<br />
Have enchanter Tash, then move up close and try until it lands.<br />
<br />
Did this, took a few resists, but i got him slowed.<br />
<br />
Watch out for aggro :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The lowest Xanamech was when my guild used to fight him was 95% when slow landed.  <br />
<br />
Used Malo, Malosinia, Tash, and Slow.  Slowed him at 99% once heh.  Downside was I kinda had to be just about right under him to get slow on which mean I was dotted instantly...or dead (which only happened once).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why try to land malosinia first unless you're getting aggro?  It's a waste of time.  If you're not getting aggro cast nothing but turgurs.  That one time malosinia landed turgurs could have landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I slowed him at level 56/57 with me and a enc tashing = anyone can slow him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zamrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Leave it to the magicians to malosinia, just Malos(malo if you dont have malos) fast, and make sure that the magicians understand that they are expected to land malosinia after malo(s). Make them announce it in RS or a ooc or whatever, and you should easily be able to be casting slow no later than 30 seconds after you have started the fight, that should easily land.<br />
Zamrak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I slowed him real easy (first time!!!).<br />
<br />
I cast malos, had asked for tashes and OOS from a bard, not sure if that helped. We burnt him down but that gnome bugged on us.<br />
We kept him mezzed as we cleared before we let him follow us, is this a strategy you use? What about during fight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Killed him three times, always had slow land first time with just malos and tash (was maybe hosed one of the times).  I'm pretty sure I was rigjht underneath it to prevent pingpong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just did Xanamech yesterday, had a dearth of shaman on the raid (4 level 65s, one 61), but no mages at all! Had the 61 shaman on disease slow just in case, one to malos first, and the rest of us stood just behind the MT and alternated slwo with malosinia. <br />
<br />
I cast malosinia(resist), slow(resist), malosinia(got stunned), slow (landed).<br />
<br />
One thing this did highlight is that, although its best to stand by the MT for aggro purposes, it does also put you in the way of the directed AE stun. If you stand behind, you don't get this problem. So a bit of a dilemma there. Basically, you want to know your tank. If you are sure they can hold aggro, then get in melee range behind the dragon. If you have doubts over their aggro holding ability, stay by the MT and just take the stuns as they come.<br />
<br />
Oh, and quiessence/torpor/stoicism yourself as the gnome walks in (make sure it lands before Xana is activated else that's a bit more aggro for you), then you don't have to worry about any AE damage whilst slowing.<br />
<br />
As for letting mages malosinia - you can't chain cast turgur's due to spell refresh time, and malosinia actually fits quite nicely inbetween. Its also low aggro which is good. So you might as well help out with the debuffing, particularly if you're like us and didn't have any mages along anyway :)<br />
<br />
All in all, I'd agree with the others here, you should have him slowed pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">...had a dearth of shaman on the raid (4 level 65s, one 61), but no mages at all! <br />
<br />
Wow!  You call 5 shaman a &quot;dearth&quot; of shaman?  Sounds like a LOT of shaman to me.  Or a misunderstanding of the meaning of the word &quot;dearth&quot;.<br />
<br />
http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=dearth%20<br />
<br />
We generally have a plethora of shaman as well, as many as 6-7 on a raid at times.  We'll assign one on Malos, 1 or 2 spamming Malosinia, one on MD/Grummus, one on cripple.  Everyone jumps to Turgur's when they get their first spell cast, so the Malos guy is on Turgur's pretty fast.  All need to cast from melee range.<br />
<br />
If for some odd reason we only had me, I'd probably do Malos followed by Turgur's from melee range.  If Turgur's bounces cast Malosinia during the refresh, then back to Turgur's regardless of whether Malosinia landed or not.  Alternate the two until Turgur's sticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">psst... play smart..... sacrifice a weapon-shield ranger to buy those few extra precious seconds to slow!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arctycwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have slowed him several times pre 65.  We used to send in the bard with OOS, chanter to tash, shammy malo and then slow at will.  He's cake to slow at 65 with malos.  Being in melee range helps also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oops. Yeah, plethora is the word I was looking for not dearth. :) Quite often its just me, or maybe 2 of us sometimes. Having 5 was just crazy! :D Certainly helps a lot though, you'd be very unlucky not to land slow pretty fast with 5 shaman.<br />
<br />
Weaponshield ranger isn't a bad idea. Is it really necessary (jokes aside) to sacrifice em? Only need a short time with WS and then as soon as its slowed MT can taunt Xana off the ranger I should think, might need AE taunt I suppose. I don't know much about rangers....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there any other reason rangers exist in game???<br />
<br />
Nah seriously, Get your debuffs done fast in the first 10 seconds... Have the WarMT taunt... When the Shaman01 yells &quot;SLOWED&quot;, ranger stops pretending to be a tank and MT starts his pull time whack/hack job.. Once WS is down MT pops AE taunt for good measure (and prolly defensive disc).<br />
<br />
In the event that the Shaman01 never yells slowed, as well, gonna be a rough fight period :P<br />
<br />
BTW - WS makes alot of raid encounters cake.... Think about it /wink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks for all the great tips.  We took down the dragon on Sunday.  I shrunk and stood directly behind the tank to slow as suggested, with other shamans on debuff.  Malos, Malo - BANG!  Slow.  I took the AOE hit, but the dragon didn't attack me directly, so I could help with patch heals on the tanks.  We successfully killed Xana, but had a glitch with the gnome, so he died and we missed the flags.  But the take-down was a thing of beauty and we will do it again.<br />
<br />
Thanks to my brother and sister shamans for your help and advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Glaknuka Darkrage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">what was the glitch? if he didn't give you factory keys it may have been that someone else had gnome aggro when xanamech died. this can happen very easily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">what was the glitch? if he didn't give you factory keys it may have been that someone else had gnome aggro when xanamech died. this can happen very easily<br />
<br />
One of the palys spot-healed and LOH'd the main tank, so when Xana died, he had aggro.  He thought to camp out to eliminate the aggro but instead of camping, he /q'd out.  This left behind a ghost &quot;NPC&quot; of the paly for a few seconds, which attacked the gnome and killed him.  The paly was extremely chagrined when he logged back in to find that his avatar had killed the gnome.  <br />
<br />
Lesson learned:  if you get gnome aggro after Xana dies, stand there and die yourself if you can't do the 30-second camp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You should be able to have someone memblur the gnome if aggroed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">memblur the gnome after Xana dies, he usually wont give the flags for hails.  We saw this problem before, probably something in there to blow the flags, if you try to mez the gnome away from the dragon, so he doesnt die from rippostes on enrage, because of positioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yes, DO NOT memblur the gnome after the fight starts. Memblur all you want before he activates the dragon, but from that point on leave him alone. <br />
<br />
One person (Shaman/druid/ranger normally) can aggro him and root out the way somewhere if you are concerned about him dying to Xana. That person will have to root and camp out after the fight to loose aggro. Best to find someone with the flag already as I'm not sure if they can get it after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Arctycwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You can't mem blur the gnome in the dragon's room or even too close outside or he won't give up flags.  Had it happen 3 times with a couple guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Now it's somewhat off topic, but I will leave togors up too, and if turgur's is resisted I cast togors, with spell haste it's like 4 seconds, longer cast and less of a slow but this way you can chain cast untill it's slowed, then I will go back and slow with turgurs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">He is like a lot of magic slowable raid mobs.  Sometimes he is really really hard to slow, sometimes you will stick it on the first try.  Melee range to reduce resists is a fairly convincing, if not provable, theory.  I have seen other shamans stick slow from max casting range as well though.   <br />
<br />
I am usually the only shaman present when we do him, and it is not unusual to get 6-8 resists after tash/malos/etc, standing inside the mob's body.  He is just tough to slow sometimes.  Bring a good enough tank and enough healers to fight him unslowed, because he may be unslowed for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've slowed Xanamech loads of times for my guild (yes, we farmed the 41% neck item a lot). I've rarely been resisted, even from pretty far away. My standard debuff order is Malos, wait for tash call, wait for OOS call, Malosinia, Turgur's and voila. <br />
<br />
To whoever said that doing sinia was a waste of time: An additional -15(?) debuffage to make sure that the next Turgur's has that much higher chance of landing is not a waste of my time. I consider malosinia my primary resistance debuff on raid mobs, not Malos. <br />
Malos helps me land sinia, which in turn lets me debuff with that much more confidence. It's 5.50 extra seconds (counting recast time) - your clerics *should* be able to cope with that, and you have the bonus of DD spells from yourself and other classes being more likely to land. <br />
<br />
Leaving the siniaing to the mages is all well and good, but when I want something slowed, I want to be sure the debuffs are landing not one second later than they're supposed to = I cast them. <br />
<br />
Good luck on your future attempts =)</div></div><hr />
