<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gryyfindergirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 54 Mage main, and I love playing with my shaman friend so much, I am going to make one :). I have a few K to spend on my new alt, and was looking for some decent items. I already know that HP/AC&gt;wis gear. I think I will have some cultural barb armor if I make a barb shammy, but I was thinking maybe Ogre or Troll. I will get PLed to 16 or so, and then will just set myself loose in PC, and no more PLing after that. (Hate people who PL an alt to 50+ and have no idea how to play the class)<br />
<br />
So, any suggestions on gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have the K to spend look at some of the ogre smithed armors. REally nice stuff there.  THe Barb cultural is substandard IMO.  Some pieces are laughable, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Get yourself a Solstace earring.<br />
<br />
In my opinion,untill you get to level 24ish..maybe even closer to 30 MANA is much more important than hp.  After 24 you make mana with hp, so you can make the switch there. However, with the availibility of very cheap KEI mana usually isnt a problem anymore, so you could go hp/ac straight out of the box.<br />
<br />
Check out some of the magelos under the names here.  shaman gear seems to follow trends at certain levels.  Pick the level you can afford and camp the bazaar for a day or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gryyfindergirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, thanks for he suggestion. Also, any &quot;really nice&quot; gear that I can camp with my Mage, keeping in mind I am not much of a&quot;Camper&quot; (hate sitting waiting for a rare spawn to drop a rare drop, rather farm and buy it in the bazaar)</div></div><hr />

Hiya check out my magelo some of it is spendy but alot is pretty affordable i think my set up is pretty decent i plan on upgrading slowly after i hit the 50+ ranges</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fine Antique Ring (AC 3, HP 30, Mana 20, Mana Preservation II, No Drop, Ring). Fairly easy quest. (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2193)<br />
<br />
Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid Mask (AC 3, Int 3, Wis 3, Sta 3, MR 3, HP 10, Mana 10, Spell Haste II, No Drop, Face) Another easy quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2203). Need invis to do it, but one or 2 vendor purchased Invis potions should be sufficient if you run the quest below that level. Only component to turn in is Sarnak Blood - dirt cheap to aquire.<br />
<br />
Beginner's Magic Manual (AC 7, Int 6, Wis 6, HP 15, Mana 15, No Drop, Secondary/Range, Rec Level 45 but usable well below that)Yet another easy quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2218). Only component needed is purchasable for 100pp or so in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gryyfindergirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good ideas, I forget about the PoK quests. Will have to try them. I am going to (try) to do this without a lot of twinkage (mid level gear for the most part) and without PLing/KEI whoring, as knowing what a class can do without KEI and Aego and uber_buff_00 just makes it so it's easy when you DO have those nice buffs :). I will prolly transfer some items from my mage. That Obulas Death Shroud and Book of Obulas are very very very tempting, but I think I'll just leave them be, maybe pick up a few focus items from PoK. I think I am going to do Barb shaman, as I can get a full set of Tribunal gear from a friend who has it banked, and if it has something in it's slot, I won't be (as) tempted to by a nice twink item for it. <br />
<br />
As for leveling, I was thinking <br />
<br />
1-5 Everfrost<br />
<br />
5-10 Shadeweavers Thicket<br />
<br />
10-16 Shadeweavers side of PC<br />
16-25 PC Bandit camps<br />
25-30 Unrest/Dawnshroud<br />
30-35 Dawnshroud Tribals (need acrylia for my main)<br />
35-45 Crystal Caverns (uber dungeon XP bonus, and very familar with the zone)<br />
45-51 Dreadlands/Dreadbone theif camps<br />
<br />
at 51 I will just start grouping in tier one planes with my guild, and go from there. Hoping to hit 51 in about 3-4 months<br />
<br />
My favorite shammy line...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...lom, pull a single. I'll just deal with the double I know you will pull anyway.&quot;</div></div><hr />
