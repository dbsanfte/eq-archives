<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Annimaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the best combat skill to work up? Piercing or 1HB? Maybe even 2HB? Or is it wise to work them all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Piercing first and foremost.  There are alot of spears in the game for Shaman at all levels, Ebon Spear, Darksea Harpoon, Epic, etc.  Then 1hb and 2hb last.  We lose too much in stats/hps going 2hb till elements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went peircing, then 2hb at 51, and now that I've grabbed a soulstripper, 1hb has become my main. It outdamages the Howling Harpoon I was using before</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The majority of shamans use pierce, simply b/c spear of fate is a spear. <br />
<br />
However, soulstripper is very nice for melee damage. So are some 2hb weapons. I would personally train all 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I started off with 1hb (n00b with a centi)<br />
Got my hands on a piercer asap<br />
Got a soulstripper by pure luck! Ran into the mob when was zone was new and he tried to kill me and my two buds.  But we won and i got an insanly awesome 1hb. (LUVZ her 1hb)<br />
Maxed out 1hb now i got me a new piercer and I'm gonna max that.(the one you all highly recomended. . .bad with names eheh can't recall it now but its got that 85dmg DD on it and costed 4k)<br />
<br />
I tried out 2hb once but decided against it as i never got my hands on one that didn't hurt my overall stats alot. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, losing one of the most lucrative slots in the game (secondary) is too much for most Shammy's.  Don't know too many endgamers who still use 2HB exclusively.  The other problem with it is that it's just plain too slow.  1HB tend to be a lot shorter delay and since we're on such a poor melee table, high delay tends to lead to low DPS.  I gave up 2HB a long time ago and haven't looked back (and there's no reason to max it now, with the PoP charm in my slot, instead of the melee one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Asyth,<br />
     It sounds like you are talking about a REIF (Runed Etched Icewurm Fang).  It is truly an awsome weapon: low delay, good stats, and at 35 it does an 81 pt proc that goes off fairly often.  I started out soley with 1h bash, then at 45ish, I started working on piercing (when I got my REIF).  I never bothered with 2hb (but I'm thinking about it).  My 1hb is maxed, and my Piercing is 192.  2hb, well.....ummm......4! hehehehe.</div></div><hr />
