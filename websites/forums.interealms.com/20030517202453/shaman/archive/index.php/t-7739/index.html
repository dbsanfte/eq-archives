<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Luthe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night my guild tried to kill good old scaley klandicar.<br />
<br />
We tried Malo, Tash, Sini, OOS and turgurs and kept getting whalloped.  Even with three different shaman trying to slow (2 level 60, one level 62) we still kept getting resisted.<br />
<br />
Is there a trick to getting this bitch slowed that i'm not aware of?<br />

<br />
In my experience sometimes you're just battling with the random number generator on Kland and everything will bounce, another time it'll slide on first time. Bard with a tash stick and orb used to be your friend when he was being troublesome but those tashes no longer stack.<br />
<br />
Don't rely on him being slowed in order to kill him is the best tactic, have good DPS and don't hesitate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have to stand right underneath of him. I've had slow land on the first attempt and I've had slow resisted everytime until the mob is dead. But proximity, after debuffs and levels course, is the most important part of slowing dragons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
same as with many other dragons, go into touch range for spells to land.<br />
<br />
From my experience sticking Malo and Tash is enough for slow to land, did it some times. But you might end up with resists all along, so better have all shaman try till one scores.<br />
