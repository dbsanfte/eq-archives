<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are a lot of skills and spells out there that provide for good eye candy, but don't really amount to much in the long run.  Look at rabid bear, reload time is insane, and only lasts 3 mins or so.  Some people are quick to dismiss eye candy in such cases as nothing more than just that.  But lemme tell you this, Everquest is a game, a game where you're meant to have fun.  Sounds kinda cliched, but it's true. That last sentence also sounded cliched, but damnit it's true too! :D<br />
<br />
A lot of these eye candy skills/effects/spells make the person all warm and tingly inside.  People are cheering you on, and you're liking it.  Look at me for example, I have 1 point in healing gift.  Not the most useful skill, especially for a shaman, but getting to the top of the AA ladder is not a race, I can take my time.  <br />
<br />
I became venerable only once I got 22 points, but it didn't bother me in the slightest, I was sprinkling my points left and right.  Some skills were vital (hi, 80 base wis here!) and others not so vital ie spell casting fury (***).  On the other hand, I see a lot of shamans spending their first 6 points in general (run3 + something random), then the next 12 on MC, and then straight to canni.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, canni 5 makes us that much more efficient, especially on raids, but is this efficiency always fun?  <br />
<br />
That's why I've been dabbling around really.  As much as I want Canni 5, I don't wanna feel like a mindless drone grinding 24/7  constantly reminding myself &quot;must... have... Canni!&quot; I wanna kick it along the way, and the crits I pull off every once in a while do actually make me happy and make the game more fun.  <br />
<br />
Example:  Few days ago, there was this pickup Tormax raid at around 5am.  Since the fugger is resistant to ice, I decided to mem burst of flame for ****s and giggles.  The healing was amazingly very well handled for a pickup raid of this calibre, so I had time every once in a while to BoF.  Well, eventually, I got a crit, for a whopping 6 damage!  People were thinking of this as a fluke, but soon enough, I score another crit for a WHOLE 6 damage! Anyways, it did bring a smile to my face, and that early in the morning, any form of amusement uplifted my spirits significantly.<br />
<br />
But it's the very little things like that which make my gaming experience more pleasurable.  I like it when I perform an exceptional heal because of the word exceptional, makes me feel all special and stuff, especially in a raid with 40 people.  There you have 10 people chaining heals on the MT, and there I am, standing out alone in the crowd as the only shaman with a crit heal, so chances are, people are gunna remember me more than anyone else because of that one single crit emote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're not truly uber unless you're using a White Ceramic Band (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12137) - right-click manaless Burst of Flame !!  That's 7 mana saved every 3 seconds! <br />
<br />
The idea that this ring is in the game is so hilarious, I had to buy it.  :)<br />
<br />
Also love the &quot;You have been covered in a sticky substance&quot; message that comes with the fungi staff- inevitably someone says &quot;What the hell what that?&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
Even running around Everfrost with the horse up, or in bear form.  To true newbs, it's just amazing to them.  :)<br />
<br />
The other side to your argument, of course, is that you have a limited time to play... and that since you're a component of groups, guilds, and raids; that you should use that time in the way that is most efficient.<br />
<br />
I'm with you on this one- as long as the major efficiency steps aren't ignored (shaman not slowing, etc.) and as long as you're not on some cutting-edge raid, it's all about having a good time.</div></div><hr />

Ha when I was a true newbie I was a dark elf warrior. I met this druid around the bridge area in nektulos forest. I couldn't find him because he was invisible. He appeared right in front of me I was like &quot;Sweet!!&quot; hehe :p  lol bear form woulda probably scared the heck out of me since I was so busy being chased and killed by young kodiaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ouchy Dathurts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Speaking of bear form. One time i'm headed to grobb to sell and i pass by the guk entrance and see a troll warrior noob killin the frogs. So i run away and put on bear form and sneak up behind him.<br />
<br />
Ouchy says &quot;Time to die XXXXXX!&quot;<br />
Ouchy begins casting a spell (Ice nuke)<br />
<br />
Guy craps his pants and runs for the guards at grobb. Used a sow potion on the way. I was dieing laughing, was too fun =D Felt bad for making him use a sow potion though so i gave him a stack and buffed him up =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lomotil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehehe!!<br />
<br />
That reminds me of a reason I will give myself if I ever start a necro...<br />
<br />
Spectre form in Oasis just to mess with people would be so fun..just once!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spec form with a spec pet :D<br />
been done . . . still fun haha!<br />
What's also fun is for a mage to summon a SG pet and &quot;train&quot; the docks.  Monster summoning . . u know. ..<br />
<br />
Eye candy is eye candy.  If you ever get bored of the tiny thrills and are ready to gain POWER get canni5.  <br />
<br />
Then again I killed myself twice last week with that skill.<br />
DOH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ROFL you too Land?   LOL, killed myself in the Grey while camping my shard a couple days ago with C5 - I am still working on hps and am only 1850ish unbuffed.  Hadn't noticed Focus wore off and I Cann 5'ed heh.  Had to laugh at myself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eye candy&quot; is fun distraction for sure.  How many level 60s remember that we have charm animal (or is it befriend animal?  LOL *shrug* one of the lower of that line).  I can't beleive I am about to admit to this, but hey, I was able to laugh about it then, and the longer ago it happened the funnier I find it :-p  I was in LoIO sometime I think in my mid 40s dinking around - had just buffed some guild member's lowbie alts I think.  Anyway, was looking through my spell book and found that spell and thought hey, I'll check it out and have some fun.  I charmed a cat (sabertooth or whatever they are called in LoIO) and took him to the smaller pond along the river b/w the lake and the FV zone and buffed him up.  I had him follow me in to the water and sent him after one of the fish in there.  I sat at the bottom laughing, watching my cat &quot;pet&quot; fight this fish, having a good ol time and not thinking or paying attention.  Glanced away a quick sec, and looked back to see Loading, please wait.....  I had sat at the bottom watching my cat kill this fish til I drowned LOLOLOL :-p  OMG I felt stupid, and even more sheepish when a guild cleric saw me nekkid at my bind point and asked how I died.  He laughed the whole way to my corpse, the buzzard :-)  Then again, so did I heh.  Anyway, have fun with this spell if you have forgotten about it and are bored some time - just don't drown yourself doing it!!!</div></div><hr />

with Werewolf form in WK! Boy did that suck! haha<br />

Named werewolf chasing me around, casting Clarity! OMG its an evil spell that named werewolves cast! AYEE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Biguss... want to know what is more pathetic than going out and buying a White Ceramic Band? I am a potter and I deliberately made a bunch of the silly things to hand out to some of my guildmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Haha, for some reason it's always funny dying when ya drown unintentionally.  Reminds me of this time I was with this wiz in kedge, in seahorse caves, repop was coming up, and he got jumped.  So I do my best to bail him out, soon enough I get an add, but I manage to kill both seahorses.<br />
<br />
Like 30 seconds later, the tard drowns, turns out he was afk the whole time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ouchy Dathurts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When i played my druid i decided it'd be fun to charm an elephant in SK and buff the hell out of it. So i do, give it everything i have and start to fight things with it....Then it breaks charm and starts kickin my ass. Tried to fun but it had sow =P Totally smoked me =P osolame.<br />
<br />
And like 2 weeks ago i was helping my friend that came back from like a year leave get her Grey shard. I dont have an EB item (kill me now) so i put EB on. So we're killin stuff and i didnt notice the  buff go down. Suddenly <br />
YOU are being hit for 360! <br />
YOU are being hit for 360! <br />
YOU are being hit for 360! <br />
So I start panicing like a retard and lookin around for a mob, NOTHING. Start looking for a trap i might have hit, NOTHING. Start looking for a mobs AE (even though its hella fast), NOTHING. Then i'm like oh yeah, that whole EB thing. Sit down to get out spell but its too late. Man that sucked =P<br />
<br />
I'm such a noob =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bearform in Everfrost is ALWAYS fun.  The n00bz there are fighting bear cubs all the time, and here comes a flying, red-conned BIG bear!  I always see a couple of them backing up and a couple actively running for the guards.  But I always cast a few buffs on them and sometimes hand out some nice equip to make their days brighter.  It's inevitable though, I always get a twink who askes me for a PL when I'm doing some Karma work.<br />
<br />
And if I'm ever feeling down, I just go swimming.....   Hate to say it, but when I'm swimming, I'm DAMN CUTE!  :)</div></div><hr />

This was back when the only way you could use the [] command was to create socials, it was a fun trick and few people knew it.  I was having a pretty fun time with, &quot;please bring me a [coke]&quot; until she finally caught on.<br />

I am holding the screenshots for blackmail purposes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh my guild's name is Drowned Legion.<br />
<br />
I bet you can guess why. <br />
<br />
Lets just say level 60 shaman, Level 60 thief. I have drowned on multiple occasions due to stupidity. I once went to see if I could find Veskar. With no Breathing item. I got halfway there and still had a bit more than three bubbles of air so said Sure I can make it....<br />
<br />
That death I didnt even get a res for. I didnt want to explain it.<br />
<br />
Or having to explain how a level 60 shaman can die in West karanas. Running while AFk is a bad thing . The damn river curves..<br />
<br />
<br />
To this day if I go to Halas I swim to the bottom of the lake. I have to. I can't help it.<br />
