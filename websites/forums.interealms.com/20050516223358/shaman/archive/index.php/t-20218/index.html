<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone point me to a precis of the 'new' shaman abilities and spells (I know there are not many) that came with GOD? I bought it but got so pissed off with the crappy deal that I rolled a Berserker and all but forgot about my shaman and now am feeling a little ' behind the times'<br />
<br />
Anyone able to help?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One entry found for précis.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Main Entry: pré·cis  <br />
Pronunciation: prA-'sE, 'prA-(&quot;)sE<br />
Function: noun<br />
Inflected Form(s): plural pré·cis  /-'sEz, -(&quot;)sEz/<br />
Etymology: French, from précis precise<br />
: a concise summary of essential points, statements, or facts <br />
<br />
I'm not in law school or going for my teacher's degree so I thought a dictionary reference might help me and anyone else who didn't know what the hell you were talking about :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Barb, figured I would try to help a bit if I could.  <br />
<br />
Spells: from GoD we get a new HoT, new disease dot (oh boy!), new situation slow (has a negative magic resist modifier, but crappy spell duration.), and a new canni that has been flagged as ancient (so we are not going to be seeing that one.)  If I am not mistaken most of the others drop while doing GoD Trials.  Not real sure because I haven't really done much of the new GoD content.<br />
<br />
Abilities: Not much really to be honest.  Spell Casting Subtlety seems to be praised as well as the Burning Affliction AA's.  That's about it really.  We get 2 more levels of Spirit Call, but upon achieving the 4th rank our dogs each have roughly 250hps..... <br />
<br />
The only good news I can give you is there seems to be a way to max out our alchemy skill with a combine that will only run us about 8pp per attempt.  There was a post somewhere about it in the General Section.<br />
<br />
So......nothing really outstanding.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
