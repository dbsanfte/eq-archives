<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the implication of &quot; in which your characters were non-resurrectible&quot; pretty much kills that idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually,  There will be &quot;perma-death&quot; in SWG.  Once someone achieves &quot;JEDI&quot; status they are allowed three deaths.  After third death their character is killed permanently(deleted). They must then start over.  This may have changed, but I havent seen anything yet on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldnt play a game like that. It goes against the concept of building and developing your character, if he could be dead in an instant (especially if it was due to griefing or another player's mistake). Even the text-based game I used to play didnt have perma-death. Well, actually it did - but you had to either be extremely careless or intentially work at killing yourself permanently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my limited experience, if it is an ongoing AD&amp;D campaign, characters don't generally die because you have a party adverturing together and if one person has to roll up a new character that character won't be able to keep up with the rest of the group.   The DM has a lot of flexibility in AD&amp;D, also, that a computer just wouldn't have.  The DM knows if someone is griefing, and is unlikely to tolerate it (well, if it is a DM I would play with), while a computer can't make that distinction.<br />
<br />
I am a member of a local gaming group which runs gaming sessions which only last for one afternoon/a couple of hours.  So then you could conceivably die, but it wouldn't be that painful, since you wouldn't have much time to become attached to your character.<br />
<br />
SOE makes a lot of money because people *are* attached to their characters  - I know a lot of people who don't even play anymore who keep paying SOE money every month because they don't want to let go of their character.   Guilds wouldn't work with their current structure - what would happen if the leader died?  How many people would want to raid?  <br />
<br />
There are people who like this type of game (I'm not one of them) as there are permadeath MUDS.  They tend to be really small, though, and definitely don't have a population that would support a for-profit MMOG.  There might be a market, but I don't think they would get anywhere near the subscription numbers EQ gets.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
haha no kidding, and that is why I only played ad&amp;d once!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hadina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The idea isn't to turn the whole game into perma-death, just have one server. Personally I think it would be kind of neat, I know I leveled my first shaman from 17 to 43 without dying a single time.<br />
<br />
I think it would work to have perma death initiate at level 14 or something, since shamans and druids have sow by then and you dont instantly die to everything. If it started at level 1, youre screwed if you mess with the wrong fire beetle :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I suppose if you really want to do it, you can just police yourself. Go to Stromm and start a new character, and when you die delete it. Takes some willpower but if its for the personal accomplishment then it would be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Too much fear of death would have people killing easy mobs with no real fear of dying.  Rather than going out and stretching thier limits.  For me, not knowing the outcome of the fight beforehand is one of the most fun parts of the game.   Permadeath would mean constantly starting over at the beginning.  I wouldnt last past the free trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think to have a permadeath type game, you would have to even the playing field a bit.  How many NPC's would you have with 10 million HP's?  You take two people outside of the MATRIX give em both guns there's about an equal chance of death, even if it's Barney vs The Rock.  In today's game you take an NPC same level, same race, same stats and everything they've got 10-20 times the hp of a player char.  Sure dragons and gods should be the pinnacle of achievement for any guild to kill, and there would be the corresponding deaths, but the sense of achievement would be much greater too.  Think about if you had just killed some ubber mob and gotten one of the choicest pieces of equipment in the game.  Then turned around and gotten trained by some knuckle head and ended up dieing, would you be happy?  I know I wouldn't come back for more.  Just my thoughts on the subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Think you would have a right bugger of a time finding a Death Touch volunteer  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Haha yeah, or people to tank high end mobs...think about doing even small things like the Caprin cycle...one of the mobs in that is unslowable and quads for 1700 + procs 5k lifetap, 2 procs in a row and the tank is dead reguardless, wouldnt that suck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We would all still be in Befallen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What if when you died you just started over at level 1 as your previous character's son or daughter?<br />
<br />
Or maybe just lost a level?<br />
<br />
Or, wait, maybe just lost 2-3 blues of experience?<br />
<br />
There are lots of steps between &quot;permanent death&quot; and &quot;no death penalty&quot;.  The death penalty is pretty light these days if you can get at least a 90% rez, and 90% rezzes are pretty common at 60+.  I kind of agree the death penalty should be higher.  But complete character wipe?  I don't care to be that &quot;realistic&quot;, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Man that aint no lie. How long would it have taken to bring down any dragon in EQ had this been the case?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I could see a server where you could loot your corpse but no rezes aka no exp back from your death, that would be pretty cool i think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I just thought of a better idea than this &quot;perma death RP server&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
Ok...it's mostly like a normal server...except one thing.  When you try to loot a mob, every bit of data on your computer is deleted except one small program, which would then activate.  When it activates, it flashes colors and shapes on your screen in such a way as to give anyone epileptic seizures severe enough to kill them.<br />
<br />
Seriously, it'd be better than a perma-death server.    :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">remember there are way tooooo many chance to death during level up, and it take tooooo long to level up too; nobody like spend hundred hours to level up a character and can lost is very very easy;<br />
<br />
only way to feel fun with this idea is reduce chance to death, and make level up easier; to reduce chance to death you need fully equipment with 100hp/mana on every slot at lvl1. to make level up faster, every mob give 100x more exp, so you can ding lvl50 in one night, and lvl65 in one week......<br />
<br />
man, please go play Diablo 2 if you think that idea is fun, this is EQ</div></div><hr />
