<br />
Just wanted to share with my shaman bretheren that, after 9 months of being 1 flag away, I am finally EP enabled.  /dance<br />
<br />
Still no Sol Ro for fire, and no guild to group with in the EPs...but tagged along with my old guild for the flag.<br />
<br />
MAN it feels good to have that finished. :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, carry on...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well planes are cool, XP even better.<br />
so now you should start your gear hunt :)<br />
as mace from water, shield from earth<br />
and when you get acess to fire then<br />
belt, shoulders and range from fire :)<br />
good luck and happy uhunting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Well, any gear would have to be single groupable, really, since my guild isn't EP flagged.<br />
<br />
I already know about the sharkspine, and if I can ever get some friends to camp Water, I'm definitely going to give it my best shot.<br />
<br />
You mention some other items.  Shield, shoulders, belt....any names of the gear?  I'll go find some information on it if I have the name. ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Plane of fire has single groupable nameds that drop stuff like a FT3 belt, 41% haste cloak ,etc.  That's what he was referring to.<br />
<br />
So does POW-- that's where the sharkspine comes from.   <br />
<br />
Both great places to get frags for your gate necklace, good to great experience, tradeskill drops, and some nice loot.<br />
<br />
By the way, pet swarm items drop in those planes too.  BL and warrior and pally in POF, and SK in POW.  Other goodies in POW too, it's just a great place.<br />
<br />
If you can get a single devoted group, you can do very well for yourselves with no more than that.<br />
<br />
Grats on your accomplishment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know the feeling I was EP flagged 3 days ago when my guild FINALLY after numerous wipes kicked RZtW's ass.<br />
<br />
Had some groups in PoE and there seem to be lots of 1 groupable nameds with decent loot not to speak of kick ass exp there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome, thanks for the support and the info all! :)<br />
<br />
Wouldn't you know it, I'm not in an EP flagged guild so I figured I'd never get any groups in the EPs, but last night some friends had a pair of groups in Water and I got invited to come along when they heard I got my flag.  So...my first day flagged, I got my first piece of loot.<br />
<br />
No...not a sharkspine, but hopefully that will follow.  I got a pretty nice shoulder item:<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20889&gt;Mantle of Seascales&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
Talk about luck.  Let's hope it continunes! :D<br />
<br />
Ok, I'll stop bumping this now...just a bit excited. ^_^<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />
