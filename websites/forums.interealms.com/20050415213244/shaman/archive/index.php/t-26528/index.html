There is an AC softcap for EVERY class. You want to go over to the official SOE boards and read the developers post on the monk forum.<br />
<br />
It's a softcap, because above a value, armour has diminishing returns.<br />
<br />
For example, for monks it's 1160 &quot;cap&quot;, and 1:40 return after that.<br />
<br />
Mitigation AA's raise the softcap (ie, to ~1400 for monks if they have ALL mitigation AA's).<br />
<br />
Each class has a different softcap and different ratio.<br />
<br />
What that value is for shaman I don't know, but I DO know it's &lt; 2000, as thats what warriors are at.<br />
<br />
So up to a point, AC is very useful. After the softcap (modified by AA's), it's less useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here is Rytan's post;<br />
<br />
Your AC cap was lowered. That was absolutely and unequivocally a nerf. I didn't mean in any way to imply otherwise.<br />
<br />
Let me give a more full explanation of what happened, though. Here's how the AC formula used to work before the patch immediately preceding PoP:<br />
<br />
The AC from your items was added up, but the value used for it was hard capped based on your level. This was the same for all classes. Once you had 289 raw AC from items (or 385 as a cloth class, since they get less effect from item AC), that was it. More AC from items wouldn't do anything.<br />
<br />
After this, it added your class bonuses (including the monk bonus, which is equivalent to your level + 5 in raw item AC), defense skill bonus, agility bonus, and the AC from spell buffs.<br />
<br />
[/b]Total AC at this point was capped again, this time based on class. In the Kunark-era code, this was a hard cap, but sometime during Velious it was changed to a soft cap for melee classes only. The return was fairly small, though.[/b]<br />
<br />
<br />
The pre-PoP patch did a few things:<br />
<br />
- The cap on item AC was no longer used except at lower levels (twinking was a concern since that was before recommended level items were in heavy use).<br />
- Shield AC was added to the class-based cap to give shields more viability<br />
- Class AC caps were changed. Monks were lowered the most, but beastlords were lowered to the same level as druids (yes, they were nerfed too). Cleric and shaman caps were raised above druids. The caps generally followed the armor archetypes of plate/chain/leather/cloth.<br />
- All classes were given returns on AC over the cap, not just melee classes. All casters and priests received the least, followed by the melee classes. Rogues got the same return as monks, as did berserkers when the class was added. Beastlords and rangers got slightly more, followed by bards, then knights, then warriors.<br />
<br />
The overall goal was to make the average dps (including mitigation, avoidance, block/dodge/etc.) taken for melee classes to be approximately:<br />
Warrior &gt; Knight &gt; Monk &gt; Bard &gt; Ranger = Beastlord = Rogue<br />
<br />
Aggregate data from live servers at the time was taken to determine median-AC stats for each class. Parses were run against NPCs 3-4 levels lower, facing front. The characters had cleric AC and shaman agility buffs and faced the NPC. The results of the parse were consistent with statistical analysis of the formulas in code:<br />
<br />
Class  War  Pal  Mnk <br />
Level  51  51  51 <br />
Raw Item AC  184  181  107 <br />

Avg Dmg / Round  87.4  91.7  86.1 <br />
DPS  50.8  53.3  50 <br />
<br />
<br />
The problem was that the average plate-equipped warriors and knights had barely any lead on monks in mitigation, due to the monk bonus, but the monk still had the lead in evasion. Contrary to popular belief, this is what prompted the nerf to monk mitigation, NOT high-end monks being rampage tanks.<br />
<br />
The changes had little effect on average level 51 warriors and knights, but since the average level 51 monk was over the new nerfed AC cap, it increased their average damage taken per hit and increased the percent chance of max hits (in the above example) to 13%. Monks who had better than this median AC were hit harder by the nerf since it lowered their effective AC even more. Level 60 monks with exceptionally high item AC (Ssra+) weren't hit quite as hard because the uncapping of item AC gave them more returns on AC over the class cap. The median level 60 changes looked like this (evasion, of course, remained the same):<br />
<br />
Class  War  Pal  Mnk <br />
Avg Hit  106  108.9  121.3 <br />
% Hits for Max  9.8%  11.2%  18.4% <br />
Avg Dmg  86.4  90.9  91.9 <br />
DPS  50.2  52.8  53.4 <br />
<br />
<br />
Several months into PoP, the nerf was partially repealed and the monk AC cap was raised to the same level as druids and beastlords. Their return on AC over the cap was left at the same level. The reasoning at the time was based on a number of factors: the percentage of hits for max made taking damage even more unpredictable and raised the likelihood of one-round deaths more than we wanted, median AC increased for nearly all levels 51+ due to the new armor in PoP and trickle-down of old armor into the economy, and other issues were brought up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Addendum:<br />
<br />
Why were monks below 1160 AC affected?<br />
<br />
The AC number you see is a composite of mitigation and avoidance. Defense skill increases both mitigation and avoidance, so gaining skill levels 50+ makes both numbers go up. At level 51, before the mitigation changes, a monk with no buffs, 150 agi, and 163 raw item AC was at the original AC cap with a displayed AC of 985. The nerf made it so that same monk with 118 AC, or 914 displayed, was now at the soft cap. Any level 51 monk with more than that would've experienced the nerf to varying degrees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally don't believe there is a soft cap anymore. My understanding is for each mob you are fighting it is different. Once your AC is higher than a mobs attack, the results of any more AC are diminished.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, but that is how I view AC today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Read Wyun's post, there's all the info you can get on AC softcaps(that we know). <br />

<br />
lol, ok ... will send the AC2000 WAR in to tank Txevu next time round and tell him he will be fine when compared to AC2800 WARs :P<br />
<br />
Quote Rytan all you like, because at this point in time, it seems to me that he has NO CLUE on mechanics and workings (re: the current Panther debarcle) ...<br />
<br />
I have given my experience after many years of parses and many tests on all sorts of mobs from different expansions ... my comments can be found in numerous &quot;AC&quot; threads ... It's really up to the Reader to decide on what they base their decision ....<br />
<br />
If you read the above from Rytan, there is no explanation of the mobs &quot;attack&quot; values, and its painfully clear that tougher mobs hit harder more consistently ... and from my experimentation, you CAN find a &quot;SWEET SPOT&quot; for most mobs .... for example, fighting in MPG ... with an AC of 1600 you are nailed fast and hard on every mob, but bump your AC to 2200 and more then 50% of the mobs swings miss you ....<br />
<br />
Anyway, believe what you want, but based on my experience, I will continue to work on my AC :P<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bengali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol, ok ... will send the AC2000 WAR in to tank Txevu next time round and tell him he will be fine when compared to AC2800 WARs :P<br />
<br />
A soft cap just means that after a certain point, you start to get diminishing returns.  If the warrior softcap is at 2000, then it just means that they will notice more of an effect going from 1200 AC to 2000 (800 point difference) than they will from going from 2000 to 2800 (also an 800 point difference).  But because it's a &quot;soft&quot; cap, and not a &quot;hard&quot; cap, they will still notice a difference when gaining more AC.  This is true of all classes, which is why continuing to work on your AC is a perfectly valid thing to do.<br />
<br />
Also, that wasn't Rytan who posted that info about AC, it was Kavhok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">... and from my experimentation, you CAN find a &quot;SWEET SPOT&quot; for most mobs .... for example, fighting in MPG ... with an AC of 1600 you are nailed fast and hard on every mob, but bump your AC to 2200 and more then 50% of the mobs swings miss you ....<br />
<br />
<br />
You do realize that unless you are increasing your avoidance AC in this process, you won't be any harder to hit? AC listed on items does in no way modify your avoidance, just your mitigation(or imagination in this case).<br />
<br />
If the softcap for Shamans was 1600, it still wouldn't mean that having 2200 didn't yield any further benefit. All it means is that those 2200 AC are probably only 1750 REAL AC and 1750 is &gt; 1600 where I live. The displayed AC doesn't show the diminishing returns for the AC past your soft cap, that's all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">lol, ok ... will send the AC2000 WAR in to tank Txevu next time round and tell him he will be fine when compared to AC2800 WARs :P<br />
<br />
That will tell you nothing because the AC2800 warrior would have a such a big advantage from other things derived from gear, such as resists, hp, shielding, spellshielding, dotshielding, avoidance and all the other effects that it wouldnt even be funny. Yella is normally just under 2500 AC buffed, and she tanks in Txevu just fine ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, and Giac is correct. Changing AC doesnt affect the chances of being hit, it affects the distribution of those hits between min and max.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are talking of two different soft caps here. The one is the &quot;soft cap&quot; for mob's ATK, the other one is the natural soft cap for AC of the individual.<br />
Going to Sebilis with 1800 AC and 2500 AC prolly makes little difference, since the mob's ATK is pretty low(you may call it ATK soft cap), but 2500 AC are no real 2500 AC due to the &quot;AC soft cap&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In short, Flameshield Stone &gt; Coals.<br />
<br />
I am not so sure about that. It's hard to say. All I know is that HPs are never mitigated and give *almost* the same returns to everyone(tanks being the exception due to AAs). AC augs are going to add less AC to me than they will add to a Cleric or Rogue, thus I have my doubts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">AC augs also don't help against 5k AEs.  Added hp sure does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What muddies this issue even more is the way the actual damage calculations seem to work. When you a particular MOB and you have a very very low AC compared to it's attack rating raising your AC will do next to nothing until you come close to this attack rating. Then AC will help quite a bit, until you are way over the MOB's attack rating and then again raising AC even more does nothing.<br />
<br />
So you may indeed notice a big difference in your ability to tank, going from say, 1800 to 2200 AC, even though you might only have gained 50 &quot;real&quot; AC. But that is not because there is not a softcap, it is because you are in that spot for this particular MOB where AC helps a lot. But you will never again see the enormous difference that many of us saw when they went from 600 to 800 AC back in Kunark and Velious just by gaining AC. You might come close by getting defensive AAs however, as these give you uncapped AC.<br />
<br />
Now, how much worse our post-cap AC is is hard to tell, as we are not exactly in a position to parse hard-hitting MOBs for hours. And of course, the worse the return is, the harder it will be to parse it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">AC augs also don't help against 5k AEs.  Added hp sure does.<br />
<br />
Considering I could cap all my resists with psalm and no resist buffs, I don't think that's an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lol, because 5k AEs come without resist mods, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If it's HPs vs AC argument and you are talking about a 5k AE. Lets say ss gets you 1k, so 4k AE.<br />
<br />
if you got 11khps, you can eat 2 AEs. You got 12Khps you can eat 2 AE's. You got 13-14k hps you can semi-comfortably eat 3 AE's.<br />
<br />
Now if you have like 500 hps less than 12khps. that 50 hps aug is not going to make much of a difference.<br />
<br />
That 25AC aug tho will. That's the point these people are trying to make. Unless the hps gives you significant advantage vs something, it doesn't make much difference.<br />
<br />
Since most of you guys are around 11k hps, and less than 1800 AC, AC will show you a great deal of improvement vs the hps.<br />
<br />
as an aside:<br />
Resists are a different story. But the truth is, this is a game, and who gives a **** what your resists are. I rather be 16k hps and 100 to all resists. What are you going to say &quot;I have 300 to all resists and 11k&quot; I'll be like I own you I don't give a **** about your 300 resists! See how pointless it is bringing resists into the equation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As opposed to the 1250 to 1300 AC change when I wind up tanking a RS mob - how effective is that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That 25AC aug tho will.<br />
That 50 HP augment on a 12K HPs character is going to increase your tanking ability by about 0.5%. Granted that is not much, but this is fact, it always works and as a bonus it also helps against AEs.<br />
<br />
AC is harder to quantify. If we accept that the shaman softcap on AC is at about 1000 AC with a shield, with about half of that being avoidance AC from defense skill and agi and that we get 1 AC for every 40 beyond that as Wyun claims ....<br />
Then this 25 AC augment (40 AC equipped) corresponds to 1 real AC gained. On 1800 AC character that amounts to a tiny raise in total AC. We have 500 AC we can discount, 500 real AC and 800 post-cap AC, which amounts to 20 real AC. So we are raising our real AC of 520 to 521 - that is a 0.2% raise in AC. How much of a raise in tanking ability this corresponds to depends on what you are tanking though. Also keep in mind that AC does not help against AEs.<br />
<br />
Now, I have no clue as to whether this 1:40 ratio is correct, and if it is, whether it applies to shaman as well. I do know that, valuing defense against spells and attacks equally, any ratio worse then 1:10 will amount to the AC augment being strictly worse then the HP augment as far as percentual increases in AC and HPs are concerned. I can further tell you that HPs will always work and that AC gains depend largely on being able to get close to the attack rating of whatever you are fighting and that you get bigger returns once you are at this point.<br />
<br />
And from that we can conclude that going halfway as far as AC is concerned is a bad idea. If you go AC, go as far as you can without seriously compromising your HPs. Ih, and we can also tell that mitigation AAs are much much much better then gaining item AC, but I think everyone already knew that.<br />
<br />

From my own tests I can say that the Shaman softcap for mitigation AC is around 1800 with all defensive AAs.<br />
<br />
There're are other ways to gain significant mitigation through gear that have little to do with the AC value displayed on them and that's the route I'd go past 1800 in order to tank better.</div></div><hr />

How did you test this?<br />
<br />
Not that I doubt you - this fits in nicely with pretty much everything I have seen parsed about how AC works. I had not seen anyone find out where the shaman softcap is until now though. Do you have any data on how much less you gain for AC past the softcap?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friend of mine, Enchanter, and me tested this back in september, I believe, when we found out about Shield AC working for casters as well. <br />
The soft-cap thing we knew of, but I had assumed the Shield feature would not be applying to any class but tanks back then, so this was kind of an incentive to run some tests(he wanted to know what his AC softcap was at, as he had been a strong supporter of AC for Enchanters).<br />
<br />
We knew our softcap, albeit not the same, had to be lower than 2k, as Kahvok had posted that the softcap for Warriors back in GoD was below that of the average Warrior. Knowing that it was lower than 2k, even with Omens AAs, I didn't bother to get any AC buffs. <br />
This allowed me to avoid the issue with buffs counting towards the soft cap or not, as I had my doubts about that back then.<br />
<br />
I decided the best place to test would be Solusek Ro's Tower. Mobs at the entrance are level 65 and are pretty straight forward. I assumed from experience I had with Warriors tanking these when guilds would first break in, that these could have an adequate ATK for a level 70 Shaman.<br />
As I said the main reason I went there was to test how big of an impact shield AC had, so my first test was to use the same AC values for two different runs. One with a shield(105 AC shield), the other without a shield. <br />
My AC was around 1850 for both tests. We both parsed for an hour and the result was that I was taking roughly 10% more damage without the 105 AC shield. I assumed that a ~9% damage reduction could only mean that I was right in the sweet spot ATK &lt;&gt; AC wise, as 166 &quot;real&quot; AC were having a tremendous effect.<br />
<br />
Then I proceeded trying different AC levels in intervals of 50(just seemed the right thing to do at that time) starting with 1950. I was seeing no difference from 1750 to 1950 that could not be explained with standard variance(20 minute parses), but the average DI seemed to be increasing when I dropped down to 1700 and even more when I dropped down to 1600. I think the average DI was a total point higher at 1600 than it was for 1750. That was the biggest jump basically, but I seem to recall a smaller jump when I went from 1800 to 1750 as well, hence why I said &quot;around 1800&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do not have the data anymore unfortunately, as I have never saved a back up for EQ, but I'll see if my friend's got his parses still(he was parsing me as well) and send you a PM with it, if I can get ahold of it.<br />

To determine this it would take a HUGE amount of work. You pretty much need to nail down exactly how much damage you mitigate per point of AC in the &quot;sweet spot&quot; and within the AC softcap and then go from there.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't see a 1:40 for any class, though, honestly. If I had to guess, I'd say it's like 1:4 for chain classes, maybe 1:5 for leather, 1:6 for silk and 1:3 for plate. But I am totally speculating, but if it was something along the lines of 1:40, they'd never bother to put AC augs in considering the AC softcap for Warriors is around that of an average equipped one.</div></div><hr />
