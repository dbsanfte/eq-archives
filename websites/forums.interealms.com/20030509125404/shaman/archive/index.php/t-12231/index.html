<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the spirit of April 1st, I just wanted to hear peoples favorite pranks that they've seen/heard/done over the years.<br />
<br />
My favorite one was done by 1 of our 2 rivialing enchanters.  <br />
<br />
Enchanter_01 ran from zone to zone spaming:<br />
<br />
/ooc Enchanter_02 is casting MGB C3 at the nexus in 30 minutes !   He's trying to set a record for the most people MGB'd at once.  Send him a tell so that he can get a good head count.<br />
<br />
For the next hour, Enchanter_02 is spaming guildchat with &quot;***&quot;.  &quot;why do all these noobs keep sending me tells?&quot; and finally &quot;I hate you&quot; to Enchanter_01.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone got any good stories?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">good ole one to n00bs.<br />
N00b_01: Can i have some money please?<br />
Me:no<br />
N00b_01: please<br />
Me:no<br />
N00b_01:your so tight<br />
Me: ok, go into /d for donate mode please<br />
N00b_01 has challenged you to a duel to the death!<br />
<br />
Results in dead n00b.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like scaring a cleric with Cann 5. Hit cann 5 in middle of fight and say something like ack! get it off me! Cleric freaks and you get a lot of heals. Only works a couple times though, maybe more if they are a little slow.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My fave is still the oldie but goodie:<br />
<br />
/emote steals 1 platinum piece from YOU!<br />
<br />
I had a guy REALLY mad at me in Oasis at level 15.  I mean, this guy petitioned and everything.<br />
<br />
And then there's always the &quot;quest log&quot; - just hit /quest.  Somebody in guild chat mentioned that one time as a joke, figuring everyone knew it, and sure enough, we had 2-3 LDs right afterwards...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">im on FV, not sure if this was in other servers as well, but last night in pok just about everyone was given gnoll form! kinda funny seeing all these gnolls running around NOT trying to kill me hehe. I'm new here wasn't around last April 1, so maybe this is a thing they do every year, whatever the case is, it was something different!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The two jokes that I have heard of that have been my favorite are:<br />
<br />
1.  The guy who made a newbie Barbarian with the name of the guy who drops the fishbone earing and made a quest script for people to follow.<br />
<br />
2.  There was a Barbarian shaman that went to KC and pretended to be a rogue in a group.  Got so bad he pulled out his epic and was casting while the group still thought he was a rogue.  <br />
<br />
Those had me rolling with laughter after I read them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The hadden joke never gets old, its like the poor mans version logging on your robed wizard namned Zordiak Ragefyre (or something close enough) and watching the clerics camping their epic enjoy a heartattack when you &quot;despawn&quot;. Good fun before the changes to the cleric epic :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">eq_newb , you get any screenshots you can post? =P  On Stormhammer gm turned all the traders in the bazaar into frogloks, and I ended up like this (see attachment) i'm normally a barb male  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We have a Cleric in our guild who is one of the nicest people I have ever met. So one day a guildy stayed up almost 24 hours camping the AC to get the ring for Jboots.<br />
<br />
We flagged down Bootstrutter and told the cleric we needed a rez in RM. He came no questions asked (as he always does) and we surprised him with a MQ for the Jboots.<br />
<br />
Not really an April Fools prank, but was great fun while we were telling him to hurry because the rez timer was almost up hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A friend of ours let my hubby use her Narandi Lance for a couple of fights while we were out xping.  Well while the cleric was medding, my hubby (obnoxious practical joker tank that he is) did an emote &quot;Mahalito has gone linkdead.&quot; and dropped himself out of the group at the same time.  Now he let the cleric know what was going on and those two were having a hard time keeping a straight face.  Needless to say said kind hearted pally freaked completely out of her blonde head for about 3 solid minutes.  That was when it dawned on her that the emote for LD was supposed to be in yellow...<br />
<br />
hehehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Speaking of color-coordinated jokes, every couple of months I'll do<br />
<br />
/shout LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
Unless you've frelled with your colors, this shows up in red text - just<br />
like when you die. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i like to pull loot messages at raids :D get someone to link something like a chestpeice when in hot and &quot;loot&quot; two or three of them right in a row.. the officers usually catch on quick and will /rs give tells to loptar for mq of blah blah blah :D fun to watch the reactions :D the pickpocketing one is fun, get extra use out of it in duels, as it's a common misconception that you can pp while in pvp :D works also for looting! duckdown like you are looting and then show off your &quot;new&quot; item :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A while back someone said that torpor and malo actually dropped in this game  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My favorite thing to do to newbs was with my enchanter. I would drop a weapon on the ground, then cast minor illusion and I would then become that item, pick up dropped item and watch all the newbs try to pick me up... it also was great before they nerfed the ability to drop coin. same thing drop 1 plat cast minor illusion pick up coin and sit back and laugh....<br />
<br />
another thing that was fun is create a newb crit shout dropping PoD come watch.. when all the little newb's gathered attack the PoD.. he casts a nice AOE spell and kills everyone in AOE range....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A while back someone said that torpor and malo actually dropped in this game  :D<br />
<br />
Lol, and that one is NOT really funny!!!<br />
<br />
My favorite joke still is (being simple folk) Minor Illusion. When EQ first came out, there wasn't any limitations on the object you could become. Ppl would cast minor illusion outside Felwithe and become the city gates, I mean the entire  marble structure. Noobs would come up and try to enter Felwithe but it would turn or run away haha. It was fricken huge.<br />
<br />
One enchanter was able to become some object in kelethin that made ppl think the path was one way but in fact wasn't and they would fall to their deaths... but I don't think that is 'funny'...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This requires a chanter and a mage to pull off. Mage waits in arena, chanter offers free kei. Mage coth's lowbies into arena and pet eats em =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Greater bear form in Nexus. /Shout NOT casting KEI for donations, hail the big bear!<br />
<br />
1) How many enchanters do you know that have Greater Bear Form?<br />
2) How many of them show up on /who as a 55 Luminary?<br />
3) How many fools do you think skimped out of donating for my not KEIing them? I mean, really, how simple is that, I'm accepting donations for not casting a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok, I did this a long time ago...back before bazaar, when east commons was terris thule's trade zone.<br />
<br />
/ooc FREE FBSS to the 4th person to send a /tell with a bible quote to (insert friend's name here)<br />
<br />
Got a friend of mine with like 20 tells.  He was freaked out, thought some bible-thumping cult or something was after him, until I explained it.   :p   Then he swore at me and laughed.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Another good one that a friend of mine does who's obsessed with crushbone... He'll go Charm Emp Crush, Give him rune and SoV and train him to zone.   He's got petitioned 3-4 times now =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing that's good fun, is take off all your visible armor, cast bear form, put all your clothes back on, and click off illusion.....  Running around naked is fun, especially as a Barbarian female! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Back in the days always used to shout random guild members were selling random thing when passing through EC or DL, that was always good entertainment  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/say invites you to join a group, click ACCEPT to accept, or DECLINE to decline.<br />
hmm, that's not the exact line, but you get the idea. <br />
Best enjoyed in a chaotic raid situation while groups are beeing formed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Phleggma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My favorite has always pretty much been when Im pulling corpses for someone.<br />
<br />
You run out, grab their corpse, bring it back, and they get rezzed.<br />
<br />
Then when they go to loot, you drag it outta range.<br />
<br />
They move to corpse again, and start looting, and you drag it outta range again.<br />
<br />
Some people never wise up to the fact that they can remove that permission.  Never fails to crack me up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">/say &amp;lt;SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE&amp;gt; Lead_GM_Tyranadin: Greetins Norrathians!

<br />
..Or insert whatever zone it is. Most people freak out ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: The systemwide message wasn't showing, fixed the &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Daksa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Back in the old days before the new models were out and plat was harder to come buy I had a guild mate who played a troll warrior.  Back then you could also drop coin on the ground.  My husband and I decided to play a little joke on him.  We would drop some coin in a cornor and he would go pick it up. We kept doing this makeing sure we were putting the coin further away each time.  When he got to the last coin we dropped we had spelled out is name in Plat!  It was a a nice ending for him but it had our entire guild laughing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">http://www.evguild.org/screenshots/haddon.txt<br />
<br />
Yep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nermerl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Grizlor-<br />
Haha we had someone do that on a Tunare raid, we had cleared the whole plane and were about to engage Tunare when he did it and the leader and officer started to freak out.  They guildremoved him for doing it. :p  But he did get his tag back after a little while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">/d for donation to annoying beggars.. one time I did this, the kid's brother sent me an angry tell and when I didn't apologize his dad got on and started yelling at me... Bad parenting first-hand...  Would have been funny, but its just kind of depressing that I have to share the planet with people like that :(<br />
<br />
I had to 3box one time on a PoH raid - my ranger friend was leading it in hopes of getting the piece for his mainhand epic (he got it :)) but rather than play his character he played a friend's - while I played him and another friend of ours who wasn't online.  Kept making passes at guys on the raid with their characters, was great<br />
<br />
A 'misplaced tell' is always a fun way to give someone the 'cyber finger'... basically say in auction /t Person_I_Don't_Like_01 hey man still got that fungi for 25?  will you take 22, its all i got man.  The channel usually goes completely silent for a moment as everyone and their brother sends the guy a tell for the 25k fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">On a gutwrenching raid I usualy say:<br />
<br />
(SYSTEM_WIDE MESSAGE)GM_Brenlo: All everquest servers are being brought down in 10 minutes for a short update. Please head to a safe spot and log out. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br />
<br />
I usually get guildremoved for that. ;)<br />
And of course the multitude of F..K VI! spam in guildchat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">There are so many good ones.  One was something like a beggar was being rude when the guy told him no so finally the bard said ok join my group so I can lev us to the bank and I'll give you some plat.  So he got up pretty high, hit disband and the beggar went splat.<br />
<br />
Maybe not so much a prank but it always makes me laugh.  The story of the shaman in FG or something who got KSed so he logged his friends mana burn wizard on to get some revenge.  Walked up to the KSer and said something along the lines of &quot;I'll teach you to KS me&quot; and then promptly Mana Burned himself.  I can't even imagine how dumb I would feel after that.<br />
<br />
I also like the old Burning Woods has moved story. The loot emo with the link is also one of my favorites but doesn't work as well as it once did.  /emo regards you indifferently, etc one is good once in a while too.  Another one of my favorites is when in a group and everyone is talking really bad about someone and then telling them he is your real life brother.  It's fun watching them squirm for a while and then saying nah, I'm just kiddin ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yes Burning Woods has moved.  LOL still funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">My pranks revolve mostly around beggars. I depsise people waiting around the nexus stone in PoK just to ask for money. As you can probably tell this is going to verge on being cruel, but the truly deserving of charity are generally not the sort to sit there and harass other people.<br />
<br />
Whenever I am back in PoK selling up my loot and restocking for the next day before I log out, invariably I get begged. At which point I will tell them, &quot;Sure! I'll go get you 100pp, it's just loose change to me. If I have any more around I might give you a bit more too. Just wait here for 5 min till I get my character with the money&quot;. At that point I obviously camp for the night. <br />
<br />
If they asked me for money with &quot;plz&quot;,&quot;thx&quot; or anything that does not resemble normal english, I will string them along about how I have a cool weapon too that they could have and maybe go find something in the bazaar to link to them.<br />
<br />
Baaloo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Not sure if this still works, but was wonderful in its day.<br />
<br />
Young druid charms a bat.  Sends bat to fight the GFay PoD.  PoD kills bat.  Neighboring guard sees PoD killl player pet and gets very very mad at PoD.  What ensues is a WONDERFUL fight between guards and PoD.<br />
<br />
LOL lasts about 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Was told this has been &quot;fixed&quot;.  Sigh was fun and funny.<br />
<br />
=Pibly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Load root, load a decent dot.  <br />
<br />
Go to the arena in EFP drop 5 silver on the ground.<br />
<br />
Shout &quot;5 plat in the middle of the arena!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait for the hordes to come running ... then do some dot'n'rot.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Go to Rathe mountains with a druid friend.<br />
<br />
The basilisks in Rathe spawn the hill giants for those of you that don't know, so leave dru in some secluded corner of Hill Giant valley, so that no one can see them, then go out and pull as many basilisks as you can. Don't hit them as you don't want them to die. Then run them back to the druid and get him to root them. Go out and get more basilisks until there are no hill giants spawning at all. Keep on rooting the basilisks in one spot, but don't harm them at all. <br />
<br />
Then watch everyone go all weird thinking that the zones bugged, because there isn't any Hill Giants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Obsi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">When a person begs, take him a lil away from everything, along the sides of the Nexus work great. Tell him to wait there for you and you will bring him 100p. Cast SoW, go get 10000cp, and hand it to him. Enjoy yourself as the annoying beggar finds out he can't move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Go to Everfrost, cast greater bear form, shrink down twice, go anon, and walk very slowly along with the mobs of polar bear cubs and spiders and gnolls.  Noobs will come up and try to kill you lol.  <br />
<br />
A good one that works lately is a loot message.  Works best if you are hunting someplace a nice item can drop and have that nice item or a link to the item on you.  <br />
/em has looted a Fungus Patch Tunic <br />
with the item linked. <br />
<br />
causes them to go ***.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">With the addition of racial illusions, whole new venues for practical jokes have arrived!<br />
<br />
         Did this april fools day. Turned myself into a dwarf, equipped a hammer and sarnak battle sheild and went anon. My armor is dyed etherel mist purple. ( gotta give props to my first class, was the pope fer 4yrs before I saw the light and went shaman ) Summoned a pet until I got one named Xartik and sat down in the center of everfrost n00b area having a one sided conversation with my * druid * friend. Noob_01 asks druid for sow and me for a heal. ( I'm a cleric at this point as far as they can tell from looks alone) <br />
<br />
     When the duid doesn't answer and I keep talking to him the n00b gets a lill irked, thats when I tell them they must be bugged if they aren't showing a &quot; Xartic &quot; on /who all and cant send<br />
him a tell too. <br />
<br />
   Second favorite involves the help of an evil minded enchanter, charm and buff bats in a lowbie area. Nothing like a level one bat with celerity /kraggs/IoS/RH/DN.Regrow too if you feel particularly evil, or see alot of low level paladins around who need a reality check../grin</div></div><hr />

Cast SoW, Focus, Regen, SEE INVIS (This is key), Haste, Etc. on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Most fun I've had in a long time like this was in oasis, back around the release of Velious or just afterwards.<br />
<br />
It took 3 of us: 60 necro, 60 cleric, 60 shaman (my original shaman :( )<br />
<br />
Necro charmed one of the spectres.<br />
We gave spectre 2 SSoYs and an FBSS.<br />
Cleric hit it with aegolism, I hit it with focus, haste, sow, MR, FR, CR, PR, DR, RH, and regrowth.<br />
<br />
Cleric and I camped then came right back.  Necro went anon and went screaming towards the beach, then dropped charm and FD.<br />
<br />
&quot;Timmy the Superspectre&quot; was born.<br />
<br />
It was SOOO funny to see folks screaming about a rogue spectre along the docks and all those lvl 42ish druids screaming right back, &quot;I've got him.  Inbound.&quot;, then realizing that, Nope.  They didn't have him either as Timmy tore through 'em like nothing.<br />
<br />
That was great fun.  I think Timmy eventually wiped out everyone on the beach, and docks before 4 or 5 folks managed to group up take him down.<br />
<br />
Cleric had click-stick and rezzed everyone and the winners got to keep the FBSS and SSoYs.  It was sort of like a little mini-GM event using just the resources we had available as players.  Before it started we /shout 'ed there was a bad spectre loose in the zone tonight, etc., but nobody believed us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>harowen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I used to love doing the 25k copper to the newb who's begging for a handout routine.  <br />

Another fun one is the mage's who summon monster and get a Sand Giant in Oasis, then run to docks screaming Giant to dox!<br />
<br />
Then there's the instigation game (my favorite).  /gu /t innocent_bystander_01 'Nope, I'm gonna have to disagree with you there, I think guild_main_tank_01 did a wonderful job tanking last raid'   <br />

K so the way it would look to people in my group was:<br />
<br />
Nykor says, &quot;Heh&quot;<br />
Gorgos says, &quot;I never thought I'd feel that way about a man&quot;<br />
<br />
Nykor says, &quot;Heh&quot;<br />
Gorgos says, &quot;I shouldn't be saying this but I'm touching myself now&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">something we did a looooong time ago, like before kunark, back when they had the player numbers on the servers even, there were about 4 or so servers that were crashing as a result of so many people playing at the same time, ours was one of them, so a group of us decided to get onto one of the other servers that had over 3000 people on it, it was finnen ro (this is a small number by todays standards I am sure, but back then, think about the size of the zones if you didn't play back then), anyway, we all made chars called crash finnen ro, or finnen ro crash, or population. and we did duels (this was back when the duel messages were server wide). so they were getting spammed with population has defeated fennen ro in a duel to the death!<br />
<br />
it was funny, one of my friends got banned for a month though, which was repealed like 20 minutes later when we asked nicely to have it reinstated.<br />
<br />
it was more malicious than a prank, but the chars per server were rediculous back in those days 130+ in SK, a lvl 1 could walk from hallas to sol b and hail nagafen without dying, if naggy was up...</div></div><hr />

would die in a newbie zone ( qeynos for example ) ; put sow on , and invis on , then i'd single a newbie a little aside from the others and would spam him with hits  (as i follow him dragging my corpse) and watch the shouts in zone ( Help ! %t's corpse is attacking me ! bug !) <br />
that was the day of having fun with newbies ^-^ .<br />
side note , when i first started eq , a lvl 20 rogue initiated me with a nasty prank , i was asking for help about qeynos ( my initial char was a paladin . heh ) and the guy came and asked me if i would like 100pp ( i was like lvl 4 but i allready knew that was alot of money ) so i said ' Yes sure ! ' and the guy to tell me : ' there is a secret passage that leads under the town , in the sewers , inside there is a long hall and inside that chest is 100pp to help newbies , you can only do that quest once per character , so i can't do it again ,but i will show you where it is ! ' <br />
so we went in the qeynos aqueducs , and i was closelly following the rogue ... who led me through a litteral maze , i was so lost but as well so impressed with the secret passages and feeling so lucky that i was beeing helped by such a nice guy .... he was ahead of me in the hall and i saw him jumping , i didn't understood and followed ... and fell through the ground , landed in a shark pool W/ a hungry shark ... <br />
that brought me back to reality.  the rogue then apologized and killed me a second time  ( i was dumb enough to refollow him ) and at his third attempt to get me killed i went on ranting about him in ooc ... good ol times !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Uggums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">((dang, there are some really creative ideas in this thread!  Personally, I always enjoyed playing tricks with my bard.  <br />
<br />
Using DE illusion + Umayma's nightie +Shainai's Walking stick = Enchanter!  had fun with a group in DL for over an hour that way.<br />
<br />
and beggar victimization with a bard was always fun:<br />
<br />
/d for donate, charm them and send them at a guard<br />
<br />
But my personal favourite was always this:<br />
<br />
1) tell them you have a bunch of equipment that they can have, but its in the bank.  <br />
2) get them to group so that they can /follow you to the &quot;bank&quot;.  <br />
3) start of Selos Song of Travel (runspeed, invis and LEVITATE!!).  <br />
4) find a really big drop (gorge in EK, west end of DL, etc.)<br />
5) run them a few thousand feet in the air<br />
6) /disband<br />
7) smile to yourself as beggar_3748294732 plummets for 10k damage<br />
<br />
Only did that one twice.  and only because they were stupid enough to fall for it.  If someone tells you to bugger off for 20 minutes while you try to beg from them, and then suddenly changes their tune completely and offers to help you and it doesn't occur to you that something is up, then you deserve what you get.   ;)      ))</div></div><hr />

(Thuuga Dengible, drops changeling essence) he casts a goblin illusion on you when you fight him and is conveniently placed on a hill quite near the giant fort.... <br />
<br />
-When a 65th goblin shaman runs into the fort, people tend to get nervous and shout GM EVENT ! :).  <br />
<br />
-Also had fun pretending there was a new goblin mask in game ... some bards and rogues are probably still trying to find out where to get it.<br />
<br />
-Technically not a prank but the first time I went there with a monk to kill him for my cudgel, the Monk got eaten up.... (bad luck on slows and fd's) but it was pretty funny trying to get a rez for  him afterwards.... &quot;uhmmm can you rez this goblin for me plz ? I need to kill him again...&quot;  and  &quot;Sure, you can drag the corpses of the mobs you kill now... didn't you see the last patch message ?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
a couple of the nastier pranks I've heard of but wouldn't do are ...<br />
<br />
- Before they fixed this someone I know once generously gave one of the more annoying beggars an ulthork tunic.... has neg hp on it. I believe he died 4 times before realising what was wrong. In the same vein I saw a mage that handed out mod rods as newbie weapons, saying specifically &quot;Whatever you do, don't activate the effect&quot; and taking bets on which newbies would actually listen... you'd be surprised how many did it anyways.<br />
<br />
- Don't know if this still works but I remember someone telling me about playing bugzapper at various spires to see how many he'd catch. consists of throwing a dagger or other melee attack directed at a nexus scion while out of melee range and sitting down to wait for spires. (apparently the scions will aggro but won't summon you unless you cast). After that, anyone broadcasting an ae spell effect or song comes into range.... Zap !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I once saw some one charm a snake and cast level 60 buffs on it and give it weps. He then took it next to the nearest concentration to newbies and went invis.<br />

<br />
I've seen a lot of good pranks.  One was on a website I used to frequent where this guy (back when you could drop money) made a trail of gold leading into the middle of no where in Greater Fay.  He'd sit there and just watch the newbie while invis and follow it around as it tried to figure out where the trail lead.<br />
<br />
Another good one was when a rogue friend in my guild got the item from ssra that summons throwable fangs and was announcing in WFP /shout FREE SSRA FANGS IN THE ARENA.  <br />
<br />
The final one I'm posting is back when Ragefire was spawnable we were holding the camp at the same time a rival guild was.  The rival guild wasn't exactly the smartest group of people on earth so a human in my guild would at random intervals put on a red robe, invis and appear on the spot.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Recently, a lvl 65 monk in my guild (Nameless Order, Prexus) asked me to play him for some Sol Ro mini's flagging.<br />
<br />
Of course, I happily got him the flags!  What are friends for?<br />
<br />
Then I bagged all of his gear and banked it, with the 5 gold he was carrying.  After clicking off all of his buffs (so he would think he had died) I ran him to Blackburrow (human, so he was blind!) and camped him out. tee hee.<br />
<br />
A friend suggested I should have ran him out to OOT, the middle of the ocean, camped at the bottom and clicked off EB at 5 seconds.... Even I'm not THAT mean though!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Platinu Kismet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">This prank is funny but has limited range.  2 friends of mine who play are always pulling tricks on each other and using each other's accounts to PL themselves when the other's away.<br />
<br />
Well, one's main is a monk and the other's an enchanter.  Using his friend's computer, he made the monk's hotkeys all messed up.  Instead of 'sense heading' for one, he made a hotkey of something like <br />
<br />
'doability 3<br />
/shout I'm looking for some same-sex lovin'!'<br />
<br />
To make it worse, he set the keyboard options so that every right turn would trigger that button position.<br />
<br />
He told me later he almost turned off 'shouts' to make the gag go longer, but wanted his friend to see himself shouting that to the zone.<br />
<br />
He had several other hotkeys messed up like that, but that's the only one I recall.</div></div><hr />
