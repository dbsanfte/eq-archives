<br />
<br />
We tried it for the first time last night only 24 or so though. Mostly VT geared with OOW stuff also. <br />
<br />
Seems there are two types of feran adds <br />
<br />
A snarling Feran and a raging feran. <br />
<br />
My guild has been farming NC named for Greater ruins extensively so our Chanters have the newer Mezzes and they said mezz stuck on the Snarling ferans but not the raging ferans. <br />
<br />
<br />
took us about 45 seconds to 1 Minute to kill one cyrstal Potal. <br />
<br />
It seems the adds come about ever 30 seconds. If we can handle them that seems like we would have about 8 adds by the time we finished the last portal. I would imagine 4 of those would be snarling that we could mezz and 4 raging which would be offtanked or rooted. <br />
<br />
1) Can the middle portal be destroyed after handing in the Icy Crystals and spawning Tarn ? <br />
<br />
2) and do the adds keep spawning after all four cystal portals are dead or does killing them only stop Tarns uba regen but still keeps spawning adds ? <br />
<br />
<br />
Since we are only 24 I realize it is going to be tough controling the non mezable adds and have enough dps to kill the crystal portals fast enough. <br />
<br />
3) Any ideas here to help us ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have to divide your raid force into 2 parts, 1st part kills portals and Tarn after that, the 2nd part takes over adds that spawns every minute. <br />
<br />
Middle portal cannot be destroyed and continues to spawn adds untill Tarn is dead even after portals are destroyed. <br />
<br />
Mezzing/rooting is a no go as there are too many of em in the end and they don't despawn after Tarn is dead anyway. <br />
<br />
We had 35-40 EP equiped and did it with quite an ease. Quite a fun script.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>djrhoads</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Adds spawn every Minute or every 30 seconds ?<br />
<br />
<br />
So your basically relying on Uba dps to kill the portals and then Tarn ASAP ?    <br />
<br />
I Was thinking of using three chanters to cast the level 69 spell<br />
 Wake of Felicity  Targeted AE Mez,  One chanter casting  Targeted AE TAsh,  and a couple of druids castting TArgeted AE Root and Snare.<br />
<br />
A Pally or to corraling any loose mobs.<br />
<br />
MA and two or three healers on Tarn. <br />
<br />
The rest of the raid would be killing the portals all out dps, Disc ect.<br />
<br />
Then Tarn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We always set up the ranged DPS on the portals (wiz, ranger, mage, necro, druids that werent healing, and the shaman if we had more than 1 or 2) do burn them down as fast as possible. We usually have 2 groups on them, and can usually get portals down in about 90 secs   Add tanks handle the mobs as they spawn.  When Tarn becomes targetabe the MT team and DPS switch to Tarn and AT's and chanters continue to deal with the adds.  We do it with 24-32 (depending on turnout) Time/Ikkinz geared. <br />
<br />
It is a fun script; the Pyrique script is fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's how we do it with excellent success:<br />
<br />
Upon spawning, MT group snags Tarn &amp; drags him to one of the cubbies where there is NOT a portal &amp; tanks him. His aoe isn't bad, BUT will signifigantly lower melee dps on the rest of the raid. Get him away. This MT group will consist of well, your MT, a RT, &amp; usually a shaman, cleric, druid &amp; necro. Shaman debuffs &amp; spot heals, cleric chain CH's MT, druid looks after RT &amp; spot heals, &amp; necro feels neclected. Tarn ramps &amp; quads for 900, ergo the need for an RT.<br />
<br />
2 feran groups, well balanced for the adds.<br />
<br />
Everybody else on the portals.<br />
<br />
Here's a few tips: <br />
<br />
Our feran groups drop their targets fast enough so the dps'ers in them can help take the portals down between spawns.<br />
<br />
When Tarn spawns he'll fire an aoe in the middle almost immediately. Pet discipline is required for this. If a pet gets in the RT spot &amp; goes down at any time during the event, the cleric or the shaman in the MT group ends up RT. Not good. Pets must be suspended or held before this event starts, no exeptions.<br />
<br />
After the portals are down, those groups assist the MT &amp; take him out.. Feran groups stay on the ferans.<br />
<br />
Tarn is an excellent target for any elemental-ish guild. Always drops 2 69+ runes, 1 piece of decent loot &amp; usually the oow tier 1 armor legs quest piece.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting.</div></div><hr />
