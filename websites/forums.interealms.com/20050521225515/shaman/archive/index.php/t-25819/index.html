<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hunday L90D+ w/ 8 ms nominal refresh time<br />
if you can find one, they are THE hot item right now, the first true no ghosting gaming LCD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have 2 LCD 17&quot; monitors. Envision 7100 which is fantastic monitor. Just bought a Viewsonic VP171B-2, 8ms refresh and in review very very highly rated, from what i saw when finished building new pc last it really is awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you get one make sure it has a 16ms response time or lower.<br />
<br />
The one Jeis describes looks good from the response time (not refresh time btw).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I've got a dell 2001 fp. A nice 20 inc 1600x1200 16 ms lcd monitor. Only problem I had was I needed to upgrade my fairly ancient althon 1700+ to be able to run games well at 1600x1200.</div></div><hr />

I also have the 2005FPW, wide aspect. No complaints there either. It's definitely different playing in wide aspect though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xelnag Ashenpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you get one make sure it has a 16ms response time or lower.<br />
<br />
Response time is subjective. Most people are perfectly happy with 25ms panels, especially with a graphically slow game like EQ. I've got a pair of Philips 190B5CS panels(S-IPS 25ms) and I have zero ghosting problems even when playing something like UT. It probably doesn't help that the response time quoted is fairly misleading as TN+Film matrices(what most 17&quot; gaming panels are based on) just happen to be *really* fast as switching from black to white. Switching from black to grey(which is largely considered a better measurement of panel performance) isn't that much faster than S-IPS.<br />
<br />
Also, depending on your needs outside of EQ, the sub-16ms panels might not be suitable as they are invariably 18 bit colour panels, not true 24 bit colour, that use dithering to achieve the rest of the colour range. The 18 bit panels are usually fine for games, but suck for any kind of graphical work. And depending on the quality of the panel electronics DVD playback can also suffer(the dithering shows up as weird &quot;sparkly&quot; effects).<br />
<br />
Basically the panel market breaks down into something like this:<br />
<br />
TN+Matrix - Fast response time, very cheap. ****ty colours, not suitable for professional graphics work.<br />
<br />
S-IPS - Clean, bright colours, true 24 bit. Expensive(partly because you can generally only find them in 19&quot;+ panels) and slower than TN.<br />
<br />
MVA/PVA - Older technologies that most consider on the way out. Both vary a fair bit with quality although I think MVA is still considered the best for high end graphical work as the colour reproduction and contrast ratios are still the best. Both are much slower than S-IPS and TN, with response times in the 30+ms range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Using a Viewsonic V912 19&quot; here with 12 mSec response time - absolutely fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As far as the difference between the different technologies, I know nothing about that, but you can't play EQ in 24bit to my knowledge, it's either 16bit or 32bit.<br />
<br />
So, if you play EQ in 16bit, one of the sub 16ms TN+Matrix LCD's should be fine if you don't plan on doing professional graphics work. Although I'd have to check out what you mean by ****ty colors before I bought one of them. I suspect it isn't as bad for gaming as this implies.<br />
<br />
Spending more on an S-IPS for 24bit color is wasted money if you only plan on playing games in 16bit color, and does nothing for you if you want to play games in true 32bit color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xelnag Ashenpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">24 bit and 32 bit are effectively the same, the latter just has 8 bits of colour assigned to the alpha channel(which isn't used when displaying an image on the screen, only for internal rendering operations).<br />
<br />
The ****ty colours is in comparison to S-IPS and most good CRT's, but like the response time, is somewhat subjective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>butuglia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only problem I see with a flatscreen monitor is the inability to use odd resolutions. For most people this is a non issue but for some gamers like myself it makes some games unplayable. I am specifically talking about Mame or other arcade emulations. They use bizarre resolutions that a flat screen can not reproduce. Remember a flatscreen has a set number of pixels. You get no more or no less. Resolutions are decided by how many of those pixels you use whereas a crt has virtually (I know this is exactly true) unlimited pixels up to the maximum. <br />
<br />
I always tell people about this one caveat because it can sneak up on you and ruin your gaming experience. Other than that flat screens are very nice for most people.<br />

PS couldnt find spell check sorry if I missed a few</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GuzumElfmolestor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For gaming, the LCD's cannot beat CRT performance or price...but they are damn pretty to look at outside of gaming heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I absolutely love my Samsung 191t</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">got a 19&quot; LG flatron L1915S since Xmas, it has a 12ms delay, native res 1280*1024, same matrix as the philips 19&quot; one.<br />
<br />
have no trouble playing any kind of game nor watching movies on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">any chance of some prices on some of these LCD and good deals (web or major stores)?<br />
<br />
I have a whine coming out of one of my DELL monitors (I bang it to make it go away) and thinking it's almost time to replace before smoke starts coming out.<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yikes, a monitor making noise is not a good thing. definitely replace it before it gets too bad.<br />
<br />
as far as pricing, there are several computer stores and directories online that provide plenty of great deals.<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pricewatch.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pricewatch&lt;/a&gt; is a great reference for pretty much all of my computer part needs.<br />
<br />
some prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NewEgg.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tigerdirect.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TigerDirect.com&lt;/a&gt;, but each has their strong points.<br />
<br />
but if I'm looking to get a completely new system, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibuypower.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IBuyPower&lt;/a&gt; gives some of the best prices I've seen on complete systems and towers. (I'd tend to build my own system, but if I were strapped for time/cash and needed a new system, I'd probably stop here)<br />
<br />
Good Luck on finding what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A little OT, but a whining monitor that stops squeaking after you bang on it is a loose flyback transformer. Very easy to re-mount &amp; repair. Have a pro or some knowledgeable person do it. Neophytes tend to electrocute themselves :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've got a 17&quot; NU monitor.  Has the same stats as a sony but sells for $250.  Bought it off of new egg and have been so pleased with it I may buy a second.<br />

has been reviewed to be one of the best they've seen (Cnet/THG, etc)<br />
<br />
same as the home model but with a smaller frame (bezel)</div></div><hr />

THG just did a review of it and gave it their editor's choice award in case anyone's interested.<br />
