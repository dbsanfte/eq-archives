<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>emiral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All I have to say is ... Get your tree-hugging buns to kael. Drop rates have significantly increased since PoP.<br />
<br />
We were doing arena and riff this past summer, and some days we'd leave without anything dropping. But lately, as we help fellow guildmates on faction, corroded armor has been dropping off of every third or fourth mob.<br />
<br />
We did ramp tonight, and had one plate bp, two chain leggings, three leather items and a pair of silk boots drop for us.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the drop rate has increased in Halls of Testing too. I'll let you know after this weekend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Armor seems to drop fairly often when were clearing to kill Vindi/statue/AoW. Drops most often from the Veterans, Vindi guards, and Armor from what I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah ive notice quite an increase. We went for an 8 hour stay a few weeks back and got over 20 armour drops in arena. The bad thing was we got 15 silk drops 3 plate and 2 chain gaunts (which suck and I cant even give em away). Ive heard more chain drops in the manor then in arena but we went there for the last hour or so and only got a plate and a silk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Damaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I lucked out the other day while hanging out with a group of guildies mooching faction off another guild, and scored a chain BP drop in the arena off a mob that spawned on top of my group :)<br />
<br />
Now to get those accursed gems.  Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">4 hours in the arena, 5 silk drops, 2 chain drops.  No plate or leather drops.  I think they may have adjusted the rate of silk drops, but the rate of other drops doesn't seem to have increased.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kleth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild goes there regualrly to farm drops for MQ, usually in a 4hour camp of right side of arena we get<br />
1-2 Plate drops<br />
2-4 Silk drops<br />
1-2 Leather drops<br />
1-2 Chain drops<br />
<br />
In 5 visits had 2 Bp drops, 1 Silk and 1 plate and 1 chain leggings. So usually we average at about a drop and hour 2 if lucky, don't know if this is better than pre PoP or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lauralei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild has been gearing up some members lately in Kael and we've noticed an increase as well.  Had 3 plate legs drop a week ago within an hour, and have gotten tons of lesser silk, chain and plate pieces.  Leather seems to be pretty rare, as does the better chain pieces (never seen chain legs or BP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2 hours at right arena, one chain arms, one chain boots, no other drops. Worse than usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd be more than happy to camp the arena, just group wih me. <br />
<br />
Yes, I'm still slightly sore over my weekend wait at the zone line for a group in Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kelniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hehe, went on an arena raid the other day, got 3 silk pieces (cant remember which, crud like bracers and boots though, no BPs or anything), a chain BP (raid was NBG, i lost the roll to a shaman with an emerald dragonscale tunic!!!!! saw that shaman a week or so after the raid, still wearing the emerald dragonscale, now to find out where hes hiding the corroded chain.. /rant off), and some chain boots which nobody wanted, lol. we were there for 3 hours or so.  i was the MA on a 3 group raid, lol, but nobody complained, in fact i got several compliments.</div></div><hr />
