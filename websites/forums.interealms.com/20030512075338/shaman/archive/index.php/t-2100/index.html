<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raketh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realy need to get these. I already have the gems and i was wondering wha mobs in what camps droped them for you? Also i think it would be a good idea to list all the pieces and drops of the kael armor.<br />
<br />
Thanks buddys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to either west wing or north ToV.  Kill stuff there, it can drop off of pretty much any mob except the named ones in those areas.  Oh and you will need a few high level (ie. level 60 or real close) groups who know what they are doing to have a chance.<br />
<br />
Gud luk, you'll need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you say Kael armor, do you mean the Thurg quest armor that drops in Kael or the Kael quest armor that drops in ToV?<br />
<br />
If you aren't in a powerful raiding guild or raid alliance, the stuff that drops in Kael is your best best.   In a previous thread, it was determined that there aren't any places in Kael that specifically drop chain, but it is most commonly found in the Arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do not go to north ToV for the armor drops.  The mobs in NToV are MUCH harder than in WToV.  Of course, if your guild is NToV capable, you probably won't need to do west for armor drops!<br />
<br />
I'd say west is a bit harder than the halls of testing, and north is a good bit harder than west.  Keep in mind, I'm talking about the yard trash and statics, not the named.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ooooh.  Good catch, Glor.  Raketh, there are 3 sets of velious armor.  <br />
<br />
Thurg quest armor takes the armor that you get off giants in Kael.  One decent group can kill giants in the arena in Kael (best place for chain drops I've seen--though it's still pretty uncommon)<br />
<br />
Skyshrine quest armor takes the armor that drops off mobs in the halls of testing in ToV (east ToV, usually called HoT).  HoT can be done with 1-2 groups if they are GOOD (read all 60s and very well equipped).  Level 55-60 guilds should probably get at least 4 groups and be prepared for a wipe or 2.<br />
<br />
Kael quest armor requires the armor that drops off mobs in north and west ToV.  The armor is an uncommon drop off mobs in north, and the mbos in north are MUCH harder than the mobs in west.  West is where you should go to farm armor for the kael quests.  I would say that WToV might take 1 more group than the HoT force.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.  Short answer, Kael and skyshrine quest armor will probably need raid forces for the most part.  Thurg quest armor is much more easily obtainable.<br />
