<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Venture</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For a player-made crafted, tradeable bow, that's exceptional.  .892 ratio, primal is .942.  That's not counting the arrow, but since the Driftwood is faster it will benefit more anyway.<br />
<br />
Remember, in a few months this bow will be as common in your Bazaar as the Nightmarewood is now.  If it were post-primal you'd all be screaming that it was too easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The +stats seem to be nice for range item equippable, though you could get a way better ratio bow just by doing that quest in PoN for the Wormwood bow.  And you could probably get way better +stat range items and +ac off just about any Luclin boss mob.<br />
<br />
Non-Ranger bait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, this bow will not be that common in the Bazaar unless the *handful* of guilds who are in the Elemental Planes decide to make it common. You do not understand what it takes to get into them - yes, people will get there eventually, but with the difficulty of the encounter that grants you access (unless the encounter is toned down) I'd say only handful will be in for a long time - think VT, it wasn't that populated until near PoP release.<br />
<br />
This bow is a joke and an insult to the ONE GUILD who has beaten Rallos Zek (You can't get into PoF anymore through Solusek directly, long story).<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek is a massive ****block to new content, a far bigger one than Emperor was to VT. Before you say this bow is good for a Tradeskill bow, you need to understand this. Also, you obviously haven't seen the 160 hp elemental helm that was made from tradeskill items have you?</div></div><hr />

At least it doesn't cost you mana to use.  My Thunder of Karana spell is a 100 mana sieve that takes 75 mana to cast and is resisted on fulled debuffed mobs about 9 out of 10 times.  I'd take a free 50pt mana sieve over that anyday ;)</div></div><hr />

...A rather random question but while we're on the subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lithledana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At this stage, 100hp range items are common, and in fact 100hp items will not be the standard.  They will be sub standard.  Sean is correct, the odds of this bow being found in the bazaar, regardless of there being only 1 (unless mippo has made one), is very slim.  Especially if the armor that can be made with the SAME materials has some decent stats.  If that is the case, the &quot;ore&quot; won't be used/wasted on this bow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lithledana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And at level 61 it has reduced stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way the bow is currently, it will flood the bazaar, especially with the new need for funding due to the recent changes to the price of recharging certain items. It is way too common and the stats don't exactly appeal to the players able to obtain the bow.</div></div><hr />

Assuming fire damage passes:<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lithledana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Crydee raises the most pertinent point, Primal isn't the bow to compare against at the level.  The guilds that will be getting the materials will have killed Seru many times in addition to Tallon, Mith Marr and Agnarr.  Unless a ranger is new to a guild, the odds of them using a primal as main damage dealing bow is slim.<br />
<br />
At the rate that bow parts drop, namely the stave, it really couldn't be made much better.  It has decent stats and good range.  But it is too common to make it comparable to the other bows I listed.</div></div><hr />

  A 28dmg 25dly bow would be better than the ratio of bow of storms.  It may be hard to get and make but now all the warriors/pallies/SK  cant complain when they want a super good range item, and a decent bow.  Now all the really good bows can go to rangers that can far outperform any one with a bow, and the tanks have the option to make this in place.<br />

P.S.  Not only rangers get the fletching skill, this is a good range item alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Pbmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Oh yea one more thing to consider when shooting a bow is that u must have MAXIMUM dexterity. that will almost double the dmg output of bow if u are trying to shoot say with 180 dex.  That is why primal is so good it gives 100 dex.  If u already have max dex then yea go ahead and use a 36dmg 33dly bow.  Attack rating has nothing to do with bow dmg just incase someone thinks that.</div></div><hr />

that's totaly wrong, atk has a huge effect on archery damage, though the atk rating you see isn't 100% acurate to archery atk rating since that's the raiting for your main hand and archery works slightly different , it's still most definatly effects archery damage, I can notice a large boost in archery damage while guardian of the forest is up, and that is only atk, no dex.</div></div><hr />

It will serve its purpose in the tradeskill sense. I would imagine that bow would buy a lot of peridots for the guild farming the parts. Unless some quest involving combining all the elemental plane bows to one super mega amazing bow comes along I wouldn't expect much else out of it. There are 900 new bows already with pop. Ones with good ratios, ones with lots of hp, ones with procs, etc. Not like people dont have options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Jaggezin, people who make comments like you just did have absolutely no clue the ammount of effort it takes to get into the Elemental Planes. It trumps everything else done so far without question. Everything else so far out of the Elemental Planes is pretty much what they should be, some fairly amazing stuff. The bows are a joke and a &quot;slap in the face&quot;  (I really hate using that phrase, but it's warrented this time) to the two guilds who have the ability to kill Rallos Zek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Paluwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Not to beat a dead horse...well not to beat it too much anyhow because clearly it's already pulped. <br />
<br />
    There aren't any players making these new bows who don't have access to every other bow available in EQ, that's the point. If you're going to make a tradeskill item available only in zones that are extremely difficult to access and will most likely be entered only by the aforementioned players for the forseeable future then why make them so far down the chain. The Rallos encounter, as it stands, is so difficult that there can't possibly be more then 3-4 guilds in the elemental planes for quite some time. So, if you could choose any bow in EQ would you choose that one? It's not even a cool graphic, I can see no reason to use it at all and I find it highly unlikely anyone is going to go to the hassle of making them to sell.<br />
<br />
    I can only speak for myself, but I personally have probably 4-5 bows in the bank, all of which I attained as raid loot. Taking those bows because they were upgrades of whatever I currently had. So, I've taken less of other gear in order to have the best bow I could and was looking forward to being able to tradeskill a bow instead of waiting for one to drop &amp; then taking it over other items. It was also a good idea to have mobs able to drop more items for all players -vs- a bow taking up a loot slot. Sadly, VI was not thinking along the same lines. Maybe they'lll move these bows down to tier 2 planes, that's where they belong so the average player has access to a tradeskill item that could be an upgrade.<br />
<br />
    I suppose we can hope there are significantly better bows waiting in PoFire or PoTime, but it seems pretty unlikely. Well, it was a nice dream while it lasted i guess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Pbmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Wow i got 2 responses saying that attack rating effects your bow dmg. It does not. Who ever says it does problay has a sucky bow and will do anything to trick themselves they are improving bow dmg.  DEXTERITY alone effects ranged attack dmg output and archery skill. You can shoot your bow with no problems without wielding swords. Take off your swords and attack will be around 700 or so.  Then shoot there will be no difference.  Dazed and confused you are to think attack rating makes u shoot harder.  You probaly still dont believe me. Do your homework.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Eonowyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">You are mistaken Pbmax - Dexterity is not the sole factor - Attack does in fact increase your overall archery damage. <br />
<br />
VISIBLE attack gained by melee weapons may not do anything at all for archery and most feel it does not (your skill in the weapon will translate into a VISIBLE attack number listed).<br />
<br />
However,  having more attack itself (whether its from Swiftwind effect, Spirit of Predator, Guardian of the Forest, Savagery) DOES in fact have an effect on archery. <br />
<br />
I don't know what level you are, but try some parsing with Spirit of Predator and Strength of Tunare. My bow DPS is significantly higher having both of those buffs up when soloing in POP with my bow VS not having them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Pbmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Take off your  swords people and shoot for a day without them.  your attack rating  will be crappy as ever but you will still do good archery damage.  The guy above me you again are clueless. <br />
We could go on all day arguing with clueless people, step up to the pro's  in archery and stop shooting at rooted mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">This is an amazing bow.<br />
Its dropable/sellable/tradeable.<br />
Its not loot. you dont have to kill anything to own one and enjoy one of the best damage bows in the game.<br />
This bow is not MEANT for the uber guilds who are in the elemental planes. All their bow users have primal/shadows/etc...<br />
This bow is MADE off of the JUNK that hte YARD TRASH drops that often gets SOLD TO VENDORS! ARGH!<br />
Do you know HOW MANY Nightmarewood bows ive made from DUMPSTER DIVING?!?<br />
Ive made so much excellent stuff for me and my guildies from stuff people basically THREW AWAY.<br />
Im not uber. It will be a LONG time before i ever see any of the elemental planes. I would LOVE to have this bow.<br />
I swear, if its not got  +800 STA/WIS/INT/DEX/AGI/STR 450AC and more hp and mana then Kerfyrm, you just arent freekin happy are you?<br />
If it were a dropped bow, yes id be disappointed. <br />
Its not. Its FLETCHED from VENDOR FODDER.<br />
Its the BEST fletched bow in the GAME. A lvl 1 with 10 hours played can make it if someone hands/sells them the junk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Mortok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Personally I just think they put these bows in for the top end ranger to be able to fletch these and sell them for some good plat.  I am sure the big bad bows will drop off the named mobs in the zones so even if these did have good ratios you are going to bag them in the near future anyways.  <br />
<br />
Atleast it is tradeable so you can sell it to recoup some of that lost plat on building up fletching.  Think about all the amazing items you have banked and how much they would go for if you could sell them.  Don't look at this as a bad thing but look at it as a good thing since you can sell these atleast.<br />
<br />
I do see where all of you (top end rangers) are coming from in that you think these should be amazing damage/delay with great stats but since they are fletched (tradeable) it can't be that good or everyone and their mom will have one.  Look at the Windblade for instance.  This is an amazing damage delay ratio that drops fairly common and flooded the market.  This is no different than if these elemental bows ended up having amazing damage/delay ratios with great stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">If Attack doesn't effect Archery explain why I went from 180 dps to 212 dps simply by raising my Atk from 1750ish to 1884? No explaination oh ignorant one? Yeah, I thought so. Atk certainly freaking effects Archery.<br />
<br />
As for the bows again, I hate to say this, but multiple people were told these would be the best in the game - they certainly are not. I'm just a little disappointed. So instead of scouring PoF for the 2 parts we still haven't found for the PoF bow, I think I'll go bottom-feed on Agnarr to get the best one so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">As I understand it Pbmax, the attack rating you see listed on your screen is the effective attack of your mainhand only, but each weapons slot works off its own attack rating calculated independantly.<br />
<br />
So yes, you could remove your mainhand weapon and make your listed attack rating show down in the 500-700s while still shooting for roughly the same amount of damage.  But thats because your Archery Attack rating hasnt changed.... you still have the same Archery Skill, roughly the same Dex (barring whatever you lose from your weapons) and roughly the same attack (barring the strenght lost for weapon stats and/or attack from Swiftwind).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Pbmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Thats right landas , the attack you see is your attack rating for your melee weapons. You cannot see your attack for your bow. What i said was excatly right. Your attack rating for your weapons doesnt effect bow dmg.  <br />
Eagle eye is the only archery buff.  Im not talking about  archery attack rating  becuase u cannot see that, what u see is melee attack rating.    <br />
 <br />
I dont care if u have 2000 attack rating that is attack rating for your melee weapons.  That is why when u take off melee weapons  and u see attack drop it doesnt affect bow dmg at all. Archery attack is something u cannont see. Im surprised even Sean had something so  ignorant to say. O umm i know u turned on guardian of the forest to achieve that attack, and remember that exceeds the haste cap by 15 percent at lvl 3.</div></div><hr />

I do have a pretty good idea as to what it takes. The point im trying to make is this. I have no problem with having an uber elemental plane bow. But I don't see why it needs to be fletched and be made off the yard trash dropped items. Like I said in my previous post I see the tradeskill made bows being a reagent source and nothing more. Just because something comes from an elemental plane doesnt necessarily mean it has to blow everything previous to it away. Especially if it's droppable. This bow would be inline to be the best *player made* bow to date. I don't see how that is a bad thing.  If you kill Rathe, or Fennin, or an uber mob along those lines and it dropped this, then yes, I would raise a stink too. However, if the jewelers make a 125 hp earring from plane trash or the smiths make 125 hp bps or something along those lines than yes it should be balanced along with the other trade skills.</div></div><hr />

In short...<br />
<br />
1) The listed Attack on your character screen is a composite number based on your Skill with the weapon in the mainhand, your Offense, your Strength, and any attack buffs you have.<br />
<br />
2) Attack buffs apply equally to all your forms of attack (1HS, 2HB, Archery, Throwing, Kick, etc)<br />

How the hell did I end up on your stupid list, you troll?  I never said a single thing about damage tables for archery BUT I will say I totally agree with Sean and Ladas.  Your &quot;theory&quot; on DEX providing the only thing that determines dps for archery is laughable.  DEX has a factor in determining archery dps but as Ladas stated there are other things that are factored in.  I have done parses as well as many other highly respected rangers in this community.  Until you provide an ounce of data your &quot;theories&quot; will be questioned in this community.  Put up or shut up. <br />

Do not use guardian of the forest becuase that increases haste, of course that will improve dps.<br />
 You dont have to be in a super good guild to figure this one out.  I know full well what i am talking about. It is funny to see all these rangers arguing with me tho. i thought i would be giving advice to the  lvl 45 ranger but looks like sean doesnt know either.<br />
<br />
 dexterity and archery skill, and as many AA to increase critical hits. get as many archery modifers as u can. Having 1800 attack is good for melee dps remember that, does nothing for archery.<br />
i know im taking a beating but thats what it takes to prove something.<br />
I think the makers of the game know what they are talking about. lets all go back to the EQ manual on what stats do: <br />
<br />
Dexterity : Coordination; affects how much  damage you deliver with bow/thrown weapon, time between attacks~~and how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark.</div></div><hr />

Sir I appreciate your posting on this topic, however, as stated before an increase of 134 ATK translated to a 42 pt increase in DPS with a bow. Now before you continue further with this post, get off the message boards and purchase some AoB/Vengeance items with your DKP, obtain Swiftwind if you have not already and then simply parse your damage with all these +ATK items and then remove them and reparse. Send me a PM when you have done this and I will remove you from ignore.<br />
Have a great day :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Pbmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">You weigh the number of posts someone has made to determine if he is right or wrong?  Melee attack rating , ill say it for the 10th time has no effect on archery damage. Thats why when u take off your swords attack rating drops bout 500. ARCHERY ATTACK RATING you cannot see. Before you post here read the posts though and through and dont blow crap out of your ears and noses and make yourselfs look like foaming drooling idiots. <br />
<br />
Oh yea about  that 42 dps increase sean was talking about , that can vary  very much from every bow encounter, a max critical one time can easily make up the difference you see. and you know good and well it can. One more snippet of info for sean , that attack u see of 1800 is your 1hs or 1hb or 2hander info  and is not archery attack rating</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Althalonas Cazicbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Consider this Pbmax you say that that your proof that +ATK buffs do not affect archery by saying that if you take off you weapons archery is still the same now thats a poor bit of proof seeing as the amount of atk you gain on your archery skill from your main and off hand weapons is depandant only on the stats of your weapons. If you have lame weapons of course your archery will stay the same.<br />
<br />
You say that Archery ATK is not displayed and I think everyone here would agree with that we know that the displayed atk is dependant on your main hand weapon. If anyone disagrees try taking your bow off and seeing the effect. However where we differ is that buffs don't affect the archery atk rating, Sean has numbers to back up his argument but where are yours? You cannot come into a discussion like this without some attempt at proof. If you hadn't acted like such a troll and provided some proof maybe people would bother listening to you. <br />
<br />
We don't judge people by their post counts here we judge them by the information we have about them. Sean is an officer of Fires of Heaven arguably the top guild on any server and provides solid numbers to back up his arguments (and always does). You however we know nothing about what guild are you in, what gear are you using in your so called tests and where are your numbers to back up your argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 You are mistaken  about saying 5k dmg is not 42 more dps, the difference in 5k damage over 2minuts of trueshot is 41.6 increase in dps , that could well be 2 good crits and a extra hit. Archery is so random every time its hard to show increase unless u parse 1000 times same mob and show proof.</div></div><hr />

You are in the minority on this one (when I say minority, that is me being polite in saying &quot;the only one&quot;). Since ATK does play a factor, and is a widely accepted fact, don't you think that you need to prove us wrong?</div></div><hr />

You archery has an ATK rating associated to it and your ATK influences the amount of damage you in any given fight.  It is the core of the combat engine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one here is disputing that there are separate attack rating for each of your methods of attack, and that the attack rating you see listed only applies to the weapon type in your mainhand, which is based on your Offensive skill, Weapon Skill, Buffs and Level (for rangers who get innate attack boosts with level).<br />
<br />
So stop arguing that point... we already know and agree on that.<br />
<br />
This issues over which people keep telling you that you are misinformed are these:<br />
<br />
1) &quot;when shooting a bow is that u must have MAXIMUM dexterity. that will almost double the dmg output of bow if u are trying to shoot say with 180 dex&quot;<br />
<br />
Please provide the proof to back up that claim., because, its,absolutely absurd.  If that is the only change, going from 180 to 305 dexterity will not come close to doubling your damage from archery.  It will provide a higher DPS, due to the increased crit rate, etc.... but it will hardly be double.<br />
<br />
2) &quot;That is why primal is so good it gives 100 dex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'm crying... tears of sympathy for you.  Primal is so good because of the +133 attack it grants (modified).  I routinely have max dexterity with out avatar, but when my bow procs, there is a noticable difference in my damage.<br />
<br />
3) &quot;DEXTERITY alone effects ranged attack dmg output and archery skill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah... and Agility helps you Dodge and Parry more and run faster.<br />
<br />
4) &quot;What i dont need is someone telling me my posts arent needed when obviously we can see not many rangers know that str of tunare and spirit of predator will not improve dps of archery.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the main point that everyone is disagree with you, and asking you to post proof, since those of us that parse our fights have already seen the proof that attack buffs do affect archery.<br />
<br />
5) &quot;Dexterity : Coordination; affects how much damage you deliver with bow/thrown weapon, time between attacks~~and how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Please tell this isn'a quote from one of those &quot;Official&quot; guides to Everquest.... Dexterity affects your attack delay?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Pbmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">That does indead show the archery attack rating right there, (who said there wasnt a attack rating beats me). But i know from experience that attack buffs, even if they do some , they do very little difference in archery output compared to the difference dexterity makes.  We are arguing over the smallest factor in archery there could possibly be.  Why do you think verant came out with falcon eye, eagle eye? because they wanted to introduce a few archery buffs that werent in the game before. With those buffs dps greatly increases because u miss less often.   <br />
<br />
I am a very experienced ranger and have seen the difference with and without attack buffs and there are virtually no differences. You people have seen the same but u make it out like i have no clue what im talking about. which   really blows my mind coming from a ranger web page.  I am telling you this and sharing my experiences with you, many many experiences and expirements. And whoever disagree's at this point i wont know what to think whether they are agreeing with the crowd or just inexperienced.   Yep that quote came straight out of PoP handbook on explanation of STATS. take a look u might learn a few things u have forgotten.<br />
<br />
ladas without max dex and around 180 you will get more hits in the range of 250 instead of 536 or 600+ . I sit and bow shoot at more mobs than you think , at every raid in every exp group. You are trying to argue with experience beyond your even your imagination i think.  I said Almost double your output not  complete double. i have not parsed to show your number loving mind excact figures but dps is greatly increased with 305dex compared to 180.    i have had attack above 1700 and saw no great boost in archery out put yet.</div></div><hr />

If you are going to sit there and tell us that the only major factor in determining archery DPS is DEX then explain why people at max DEX see noticeable differences in DPS when their ATK rating goes up?  I sure would like to hear your answer.<br />
<br />
The nice thing about high end rangers parsing their fights is that you get to see what factors in.  If you are maximum on a stat (such as DEX) you can parse and see what increases while some stats stay the same.<br />

Damn Pbmax, you're the biggest fool i've ever seen on the Glade. Citing the EQ guide as your only source of information is completely laughable.</div></div><hr />

Too ****ing funny.  And to think, all this time I could have had a snowcone in my main hand and a shield in my offhand since the atk from swiftswind is useless in archery....now where did i put those black pearl rings??????</div></div><hr />

this is not a battle here, should be a place to learn things you didnt know b4, if you think you know something we don't know you have to explain it in a civil manner and if ppl don't like it...tough<br />

I noticed that sean's attack move up 134ish from his post, the same amount as Guardian of the Forest gives when you enable it.  This effect also moves your haste up 15 % up (over haste cap if need be).  His dps increased from 180 to 212, if you factor in the 15% haste it comes out to a avg increase in dps of 27, pretty close to the 32 dps increase. btw who said it was a 42 dps increase? 212-180=32 c'mon guys.<br />
The question is did you use GotF to attain that attk sean?<br />
<br />
PBmax, what they have been saying is that attack buffs/items increase the shown attack rating (which doesnt effect archery) and the unshown archery attack rating (which would effect, if the buffs do in fact change it).  before you start arguing be sure you understand what the opposing person is saying.  basically this whole thread has been a back and forth blah with no proof or support whatsoever.  taking off your weaps proves nothing, because again the shown attack rating doesnt effect it.  I could explain each detail which only a young child would need to understand, how did you not get the pt. the first time?<br />
<br />
Also some of the other people were saying when they put on attack buffs they see a noticiable increase in dps, but the 'random' system archery uses isnt very reliable for a constant dps, ive seen ppl get several massive crits in a row, and later get no crits and smaller hits; same mob same buffs.<br />

cant we all just get along</div></div><hr />
