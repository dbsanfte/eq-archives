<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used to have this problem. I used to have a dial up modem, and have since upgraded to DSL. SOE Tech Support took six tries to fix the problem, after I had updated my drivers and such. If you are running Windows XP (that's what I run, and being a non-software expert I don't know if other Windows versions support this or have this) then you have something called a QOS Packet Scheduler. This program apparently dictates the size and timing between packets of data received and processed by your modem and CPU. Turn this feature off -- I believe you can access it through Network Connections in the Control Panel. Once I did that, my modem's LD problems were solved. You might also take a look at the datarate.txt file in your EQ Directory. Change the number from 5 to 3, and save it. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Has I recall on the DataRate it's..<br />
1-4 dial up<br />
5-9 Cable DSL ect..<br />
But do not go over 9. I would start at 9 then you can bump it down to 7 if probllems persist. Then 5 and so on. In my findings 7-9 has always worked well. Has is I run 2 comps throug a router to a cable modum and I have NP's with a 9 DataRate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Noxin! I didn't even know about that <br />
search. The solution was to rename the folder <br />
titled &quot;userdata&quot;. Zoned a bunch of times to confirm<br />
it worked, and nothing else seemed broke as a<br />
result. However I didn't have time to play, so <br />
time will tell.</div></div><hr />
