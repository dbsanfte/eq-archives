<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">logged on this morning put up the lfg tag and started soloing while waiting for a group in pov, and guess what. Verant ninja nerfed PoV : ( all the frogs/larvae/skeletons are now unsnareable, the guards are still snareable however now the summon. This is pretty lame if you ask me. Its all to force people to group and also to stop quading with huge XP gains. I can understand wantign to nerf the quading so people cant make 1aa a hour like many i know have been. Problem is now people like me who just solo to pass time while lfg are the ones who get screwed. its nothign to sit lfg in pov for 2 hours, its basically only accessable by the higher lvl guild and players atm. So when a person leaves a group they are generally replaced by a guildmate lfg rather than a random person whos lfg in the zone. I am in a euro guild and most dont have pop atm so i hardly ever have guildmates here. Making mobs unsnareable or making them summon is the cheap easy way out if you ask me. Why did they give us snare spells if the only use is on green mobs that we wouldnt have to kite anyway. Its really sad how one class ruins it for the rest and instead of comeing up with a viable solution verant just goes the easy way out and makes mobs summon and unsnareable. I think they need to look to other alternatives to fix the problem they have with the amount of XP a wiz can get quading since that seems to be what they are allways after which in turn screwes the peopel over who just single kite mobs <br />

Skeletons level range can vary so once in a while you get a high level one that is quite resistant but you can stick snare and root still if you keep casting it.  The skeletons and larvae didnt summon me either, as some people feared would happen before the patch.</div></div><hr />

No one should be able to solo in zones designed for the post-60 crowd. I've been trained countless times in PoN by people who lose control of their quads. These mobs SHOULD be the hardest to kill. I hate sitting LFG but if I could solo it would feel way wrong. It would feel too easy.<br />
<br />
Making mobs summon isn't a cheap and easy way out. Powerful mobs summon all the time. PoP mobs should be powerful. Nuff said.<br />
<br />
I may be a bit cynical but I don't have sympathy for anyone (whether druid/wizzy quadders or soloing rangers/necros/etc) who gripes about not being able to solo in the new Planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Foxfyre</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And just why should our ability to CC with snare and root suffer? VI shouldn't have bothered implementing roots that were &lt;i&gt;specifically designed for PoP planar mobs&lt;/i&gt; (go see Lucy) and then an AA skill, viscid root, to further enhance the Luclin AA skill. This isn't just about soloing. Anyone who has ever used root for crowd control or maintaining aggro on an MT due to root's proximity aggro should be slightly concerned with the implications of this nerf. Again, it's not &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; what happens to soloers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes peoples trains get out of control. But this isnt just quaders  causing this problem. i see full groups of people training all the time. The whole summon thing has allways bothered me. When was the last time you were able to summon a mob? &lt;mages CoH doesnt count since its not a mob and is a PC&gt; you cant. yet all kinds of mobs can summon even though the are straight melee mobs, maybe a caster i could understand having summon ability but a gaurd shoudlnt have, nor other misc melee type mobs. I know its a fantasy game but its just completely unrealistic, they only reason in my eyes it was implemented was to prevent people form soloing super powerfull mobs that they shouldnt be able to solo anyway ie:named mobs. Im sorry but a mob that cons blue to me shouldnt be unsoloable. And now that they are implementing this i am definatly not goign to spend 4aa on a skill for mana free snare when its utterly useless seeing as how the only real places to XP now are in pop. And my guess is all the druid who get improved root spells wont be takign those skills either. just seems really short sighted to me to give PCs AA skills for snare and root and then make almost all mobs unsnareble and unrootable. And this doesnt just affect soloing. i played CC in pov in a few groups before nerf, 2 mobs inc, i snare one and then root park it away, guess now we stuck with 2 mobs even further decreasing my viability for a group. like i said i think this is the cheap and easy way out. i stand by what i said. i may not have the answer but doesnt seem like verant is working on one either which is why i said its cheap and easy way out. <br />
    btw soloing in pov was no easy task anyhow. frequent mob warps, landing on you or back and spawn point bringing friends back with it, not to mention after warps most of the time mobs would gain 20-40% of its HP back. And its not fun having a mob warp on top of you when they hit for 400-500s. yes i soloed in pov but i didnt do it full time. it was to pass time while lfg waiting for a group, it wasnt even close to the XP i got in a good group not to mention after 2 mobs my wrist was ready to fall off due to tons of HP on mobs and the fact we have no auto attack for archery. anyway no soloing for me or grouping for a while : ( got to get working on KT and giant faction &lt;sigh&gt; /auction WTB lots and lots and lots of dwarf heads<br />

i have EQ , AM3  33/35 bow 11dmg arrows, self 61 haste and 1551 attack , even with KEI and sticking winged death and nuking with calefacation every time it refreshed and shooting arrows non stop at a frog it would still take almost 10 minutes to kill it. you call that easy? i hate to see what you called a hard solo mob. the terain is hilly and half your arrows *poof* the mobs warp frequently and gain lots of their HP back when they do. they hit for 400s and even kiting you do get hit often due to the trees and rocks around you get stuck on alot. Please dont say you would feel wrong about soloing a mob when you have never even had the opportunity to know whats involved in it. yes these are planar mobs and should be hard, but keep in mind these mobs were put there to XP off of and every single XP encounter in pop shouldnt take a full group to kill.<br />

In the last 2 days, I've only seen 1 train personally and have had no guildies die to trains. Before the change we had people calling for a res every 30 minutes because some soloer got the group killed. It was a good change.<br />
<br />
Non-Mez crowd control. If we don't have a mezer we off tank. For the past two days shaman and rangers have been doing well at this. This isn't FG. It isn't Velks. It isn't even CT, PoD, PoI, PoJ, or PoN we're talking about. This is a zone hard enough that it requires successfull completion of a separate and fairly difficult event to gain entrance to. Yes I call the event fairly difficult, a lot of the people I know have tried it more then 20 times. Surely, I first expected PoV to be more difficult then it is even after the change. I expected nothing short of the minimum group I could hunt there in would be one which could do execution. The reward for hunting here is very good, and the difficulty is more in line with that rewrd after the change. It was a good change.<br />
<br />
You complain about lfg time, a lot of my friends did too. The change had an interesting side effect though. Without quaders this zone supports more groups. Without the legions sticking to solo exp, there are more people with whom to group with. I see people who were constantly complaining about lack of groups before the change talking about how much fun they are having in this or that great exp group. It was a good change.<br />
<br />
Every single XP encounter shouldn't require a full group to kill? Well, they don't. I've used panic animal to solo rats in PoD to good effect. I've done a good amount of effective duo'ing, trio'ing in PoD, PoI, PoJ, and PoN. I'm also fairly sure I could solo in other first tier planes if I wanted to.<br />

I dont know how many times quadders lost their mobs on other people due to aggro issues and the xp is awesome there especially if you could solo.  The difficulty and risk should be inline with the xp.  Its much safer now in the zone without the quadders running all over the place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So to solove it, I usually ask a friend or two in zone to keep an eye out for groups looking for a melee and head to PoN or PoD to solo.<br />
<br />
Werewolves in PoN and Rats in PoD are flagged animals, hello fear kiting.<br />
<br />
Not my favorite method of hunting, but I can almost match the exp rate of a decent PoV group if my camps are free and I have KEI.<br />

Need to make it so a class can solo. Quad kiting is lame in the extreme, though those that do it will defend it with every ounce of energy they have. I say nerf the quadders, not flag the mobs immune. <br />
<br />
They nerfed Harmony to remove the immune flag. Same thing here. Just make the Quad snare suck. Or make our snares different. We get an AA snare, for crying out loud. What is the point?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malevant Faeshadow</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is, Quadding is based off two things.  Snares and non-summoning mobs.  Any way of nerfing quadding is going to affect one of those, unless they nerf nukes, which I really don't see happening (nor should it).<br />
<br />
Quadding sucks, but anytime that they do something to change it, it will effect one of those two things, and Rangers will feel the bite as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jennalynn Rubyblade</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, now that they've made some mobs snareable and some immune, it seems to have caused even more trains in the zone.<br />
<br />
For those of you trying to cast snare on a mob and then finding it immune, what do the soloers do?  You guessed it, they run for ZO and train!<br />
<br />
The skellies aren't too bad for training since most camps are not in the middle of the forest, but for those that are looking to solo in the wasteland/desert a train of Golems, Spiders, and Crawlers, gets ugly really fast since people camp in and around the bridge castle and the Trained MOBs path through there.<br />
<br />
I say, they just make the mobs all be able to summon, but only if it gets damaged.  Slowers and Healers will still be relatively safe since they won't get summoned right off the bat.  Golems, Spider, and Crawlers are all 61-63, they need to be taken out by groups if you ask me.<br />
<br />
If you want to make em snareable, then possibly up their MR to the point where they need to be tashed or malo'd first.  Don't know if wizzies have debuffers like this and well, at least the soloers may have a better time finding a partner to duo with instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was in PoV on Saturday morning when they repoped it and made alot of the mobs immune to snare/root. <br />
<br />
I am sorry they don't want people to solo.  Quading is wrong though when a druid/wizard can get 8% in regular exp and do this two or three times an hour.  <br />
<br />
Even still, some people love to group and have the personality that suits that style of play.  Others do not.  I don't see anything wrong with some form of soloign which they seem to have preserved in PoV.  <br />
<br />
I solo'd for awhile on Saturday in PoV for ok exp after the change.  Exping in a group later was much more productive, but at least I didn't have to sit for 3 hours waiting for a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viken</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nerfing quadding can be done by increasing the regen rate on the mobs. This forces you to increase your dps to counter the regen rate which can only be done by adding more damage dealers (ie: grouping).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">updating my thoughts : )<br />
<br />
they dont want peopel quading and thats very obvious, i couldnt think of a solution before but i did bleive that the no snare and summon thing is BS and needs to be taken out entirely. Anyway after much thought about this i think i have come up with a way to stop quading that was goign on there. really simple and realistic solution if you ask me and it woudl be this<br />
<br />
everytime a mob is nuked it has a chance to break snare just like it does root. <br />
<br />
makes sense doesnt it? i mean when you cast a big ball of flames at a bunch of mobs makes sense the shackles or snare thats on them might get burnt up. it happens for root why not apply it to all forms of snare? it woudl still make quading possible but very very tough at the same time. the only people quading these mbos in pov were wizzys anyhow, druids didnt have the dmg/mana ratio workign for them. so basically mobs could still be soloed but quading would be very diffacult as a wizards snare only lasts 2 minutes, as soon as a snare breaks from a nuke he woudl have to resnare the mbos and group them up again for a nuke. it woudl make it so much hassle it woudlnt be worth it. thats my 2 cents on a solution to stop quading but not penalize others, what do you guys think?<br />

<br />
When was the last time that you picked a wizard into your group when a 2nd/3rd meele was availeable LFG also, or a Bard to go with your enchanter?<br />
<br />
I used to never invite wizards myself, I mean, they can burn, but how long that last? Then I made good friends with one, and started groupping together trough KC, Seb, Chardok, Velks, DN etc day in and day out.<br />
<br />
Sadly it seems the populace of norrath would choose ANYTHING over a wizard to join their group unless they are heading to a spot which requires evac to get out..<br />
<br />
Well guess what? In the light of this fact, wizards deserve exp too.<br />
<br />
So next time you bitch @ wizards quadding also consider this: For majority of them, its the only way they can get experience/aa points.</div></div><hr />

Also includeing everyone in this post that has complained about quadding in your sentance there is probably takeing your mouth a bit full since you dont know them or who they group with at all.<br />
One reason you dont see druids and wizards in groups much might be that some actually PREFER (gasp) the better XP of quadding to the worse when grouped.<br />

A wizard can make 3 blues in 64 an hour SOLOING or duoing in PoV (could? havent been there since this adjustment) how much could you do in a group ?</div></div><hr />

Not all the time, but definitly more than 70% of the fights and easily in the long run with non-stop pulling.  We got into a contest and by the time Mr. Wizard landed a spell, I was able to get 3-4 shots in.  At the start of keeping Damage score, Mr. Wizard was in the lead, but then started to fade away in damage because of mana restraints and he had to hope for a crit blast on every nuke.<br />
<br />
Only problem with this contest?  Yup, over nuking of Mr. Wizard and the group got pissed at em, especially Cleric/MA! :D <br />
<br />
Chanter in group had Tranquility &gt; KEI, and after 3 fights, Mr. Wizard was OOM.  Ranger still going strong landing crits upto 974 dam.  The Rogue in the group was also shocked to see the frequency of crits I was landing (Not even 1 lvl of FotA AA yet).</div></div><hr />
