Those two links should have some pretty good information in them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only dragon I've heard of any shaman soloing is Yeldema in Western Wastes, though I suppose some other WW dragons might be doable.  The last time I checked it was a &quot;Hey I just solo'd a dragon&quot; thing and not a ub3r ph4t l3wts plzkthxla thing. <br />
<br />
As Potens already said, you want to be super cool like your local burn team and get rich off of dragons, find 5 friends and start your wizard.<br />
<br />
P.S. Don't actually try trakanon without a necro and cleric at zone in.</div></div><hr />

most dragons in WW are soloable i believe<br />
<br />
I think its asheron(i spelled that wrong, i know) whos been going around nettin 40k a day there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Note:  NONE of the dragons in WW are soloable unless you're well used to the pathing and patrolling in the zone.  There's no perfectly safe spot to pull a dragon, but there are several spots that are very safe as long as you know when the wanderers are coming through.  Go there witha group to learn the patterns before trying it yourself, or you'll be having a long day of being naked.  And BTW, every solo you do is going to be a close fight, get ready for some adrenaline-pumping action!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can solo most any dragon in ww with 2 big exceptions, no g fluxers and no silencers.  Have insta clicks or your torp will be dispelled, and fight in scars.  Loot really isnt that great usualy though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Takes me roughly 25 minutes to take out a typical ww aoer which has a ~50% chance of dropping a set piece of armor (with a fairly random grade).  Add that to the fact that only 3 pieces of armor that are obtainable solo are in any demand (mantles/cloaks/bracers), and all 3 are a pig to get compared to say, boots or legs (mantle/cloak = 1 easy static source, bracer = 1 easy rare wandering source, there are other droppers, but they are not imho soloable).<br />
<br />
There are far better (and safer/easier) cash farming spots than ww dragons.<br />
<br />
I hope that was informative enough? =)</div></div><hr />
