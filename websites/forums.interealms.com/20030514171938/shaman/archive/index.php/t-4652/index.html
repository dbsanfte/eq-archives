<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellow Shaman!<br />
<br />
I just recently gained a second box which gives me the ability to 2 box.  I was hoping to create a caster since it is the only class type I have yet to play e xtensively. <br />
<br />
1st Account<br />
55 Cleric<br />
42 Warrior<br />
<br />
2nd Account<br />
41 Shaman<br />
<br />
I was hoping to find any info I could get on leveling a wizard.  I assume the shaman's slow would be better use here.  Then again, I don't know if there is an &quot;easy&quot; way to PL a caster.  Would 2-boxing a wiz and another class from the start be easier?  Any advice you could give would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wish there was an easy way to PL a wizard, but I sure can't think of a way. I think I'd be better off using my 36 enchanter to do it than my 55 shaman. I think a shaman could pl a necro or mage (and maybe an enchanter) pretty easily by just turbo-buffing and healing their pets, but I don't know how you'd PL a wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would recommend putting the wiz on the shaman's account and PLing with the cleric.<br />
<br />
invite the wiz, drop an HB and the best Symbol and direct-ac buff you can (naltron and AoF i think) on him. disband, pull a blue or white con, fight with the wiz until mob is just under half health, then finish it off with the cleric. if you are staying in the old world (no reason not to), get a manastone for him if you can, as i'm sure your biggest (smallest?) bottleneck will be mana.<br />
<br />
it's not the fastest PLing there is but it will cut your kill time in half and with a 55 cleric at his side your wiz need never die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another wy to PL a  char with a cleric would be to have the cleric take the mob down to under 1 bub of health, root it and atone (mem wipe) then let the other char finish it to get the exp.<br />
<br />
I dual box, and tried to do 2 caster types and frankly it didnt work for me. If a pull goes bad or you get adds it almost certainly means one of the chars is going to die (or it did for me). I think you'll find that most people who dual-box run a caster type with a melee type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well i would personally go with the shaman to PL...  My gf started a wiz and i PL'd her a little i just got os both a C3 went to nro (she only was 8) i'd pull dervs with malo (malosi same thing) then root em her nukes land for full and with C3 she never go's oom  i suspect it would work the same at higher lvls very little down tiem but i havent got that far yet<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutalliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I PLed an enchanter by grouping enchanter with a melee (monk).<br />
<br />
I used a druid to PL them together. Melee along with enchanter with a PLeller in the back would work well.<br />
<br />
While the melee kicks them down you can focus on training skills which sometimes will be neglected.<br />
<br />
All in all, there is no easy way to PL casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hate playing characters that can't bind anywhere or gate, so I've decided to try a necro as my second char on my two-box setup. That (or a mage) seems like the closest I can come to a melee character that can bind/gate. I figure I can buff up their pet and have them main tank while my pet adds output. EBolts from both necro and shaman will stack now, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, thats not the strategy I've been using.  I realize you didn't list a druid as one of your toons, but I've been having so much fun doing this, I'm going to post it anyways.  Yes, I am a druid, deal. :p<br />
<br />
First, get your wizzy to 18 or so, grab a kei and run over to paludral w/ either your cleric or shammy.  Now find a high level druid who likes to ae or ask a friend if you can use their druid.  I'm level 60 with mostly HoT gear.   Head to sol A, put on whatever hp gear you have, buff up (THORNS) and get ready to hit mid 30's.  Have the druid pull trains, and let the wizzy toss a couple pbae's (if the wizzy getes too much aggro, a heal should get most things back on the druid).  Thorns will make short work of the goblins and the druid shouldn't have much problem tanking.  In about 4 hours, I took a friends wizzy from 18 to 29 and the goblins are good until 34-35.  Next stage, we're going to try kodiaks in GD. :)  <br />
<br />
I realize this might not be the right solution for you, but perhaps you can think of other ways to incorporate ae'ing into your plevelling?  Wizards have 2 major strengths for exp, pbae, dd.  DD+kei is good and pbae owns.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">it may sound trite but the best way to powerlevel a wizzy is to <br />
send out shouts looking for a ranger, pally, rogue or beast lord and offer to powerlevel their brains out, so long as the wizzy can sit and mouch exp. these classes often have trouble getting groups and seem to jump at chance to get PL'ed.<br />
<br />
they will still get mad exp and wizzy can toss nukes at will to keep skills up.  Both will do really well, and it is much much easier to focus on a melee class than the wizzy. Key is agro control. So have a melee class do that for your wizzy.  <br />
<br />
Wizzy pets=rangers, monks, warriors, beastlords, sk, shaman, necro's, pally's etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>anonomus_x</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">for the early lvls u can use your shaman. get a tola robe, some decent melee weapon such as a shadded dagger, and then get as much HP gear u can buy. the 36% haste with the nice ratio of the shadded dagger will make kills very fast at the lower lvls. you can prolly do this untill level 20 if u play right. after that...well i dont know how to do it after that =/. just my 2cp<br />
<br />
edit: also try to get a decent damage shield form a druid or mage (31 preferably) with chloro and hp buffs. then run around the zone making a big train, stop in front of your shaman and start healing. the DS will kill all the mobs in your train and the heals should keep u alve if u have good hp. using this method, 1-15 can happen in 2 hours tops.<br />
<br />
try these!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I PL ed my brothers wizzy was rilly fun got him from lvl 10 - lvl 35 in one day<br />
heres how to do it.<br />
<br />
ferst go to the bazzar and pay for a KEI :) then go to a place with lots of mob's like LOIO or OOM and let him tank the mobs tell his def is maxed (helps lots. ) second go and get about 20 lvl 10 mobs pake them tite and let the wizzy AOE them at this lvl you dont even need to slow them or even heal your self and the wizzy can genaraly kill them all in just 2 or 3 AOE spells<br />
we dinged him 2 lvl's with the ferst pull :) did this in OOM when he dinged 20 we went to LOIO and did the same thing didnt need to slow here ether need to watch the wizzy's HP in LOIO thay hit a bit harder did this tell lvl 30 and just let him tank a few inbetween big pulls to keep his def maxed then we went to TO and did that the rest of the night had to slow these you get 9 or 10 on you and thay can hit a bit harder EXP started slowing down about that time as well. I think the TO rilly sux next time were gona to DSP and kill the cave men insted there seems to be more mobs there.<br />
<br />
This was all done buy a lvl 58 SHM. in OOM i jst ran up and hit them to get agro  most didnt live long enuf to hit him, in LOIO i puled with the lvl 19 spell Infectous Cloud you know the only AOE DOT we get :) worked good kepped agro most of the time Whal not out dmging the wizzy.  in OT i eather used the lvl 51 slow or the lvl 58 AOE slow both kepped agro on me pritty well. but dont see whay you cant go all the way to TO with only being lvl 41</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wizard is the easiest character I've ever PL'd.  Made it to 35 the first weekend and 50 by the next, with EVO, ALT, and DEF maxed.  KEI is the key.  With KEI he was level 30 before I was ever able to use a full bar of mana.  <br />
<br />
I use a 52 Druid and 53 Shaman to PL, but never at the same time.  Up to 30 I just use the standard DS/Healing from the Druid, with the Wiz chain casting his 2 lowest PBAoEs.  That way I always had 4 on the Druid and 4 on the Wiz with the AoEs hitting all 8.  With the right kind of positioning, I can even hit the ones standing nearby waiting to hit on us.<br />
<br />
After 30 it's more efficient to use the Shaman.  Shaman pulls as many as he can handle tanking with Tugur's, so he gets a good aggro going.  And Wiz stands next to him and PBAoE's everything down, while the Shaman is spot nuking with JBB.<br />
<br />
The only thing you need for this tactic is KEI and go heavy on the AC and HP and you can play Tank Mage for quite a while.</div></div><hr />
