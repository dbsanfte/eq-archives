<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
A friend of mine has an account with a port whore (29 druid) and a 28 paladin (his first character). He stopped playing the pally not long after he started, to make a warrior. Since he doesnt play his paladin anymore he offered to let me use him, for a mule or whatnot. I was thinking maybe I could fit him out with some decent armor for his level and duo, 28 Pally with my 26 Shaman. or should I just make a monk and conform :-P  Any thoughts? Comments? Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My first inclination would be to duo with the Pally - why level up a monk when you've got a nice character ready to go?  :)<br />
<br />
The paladin should be great for keeping aggro, stuns, LoH, even limited self-heals.  In other words, defense is covered.   Great now, and better in a few levels when you won't have to worry about your pet getting beat up.  At 45, he can start using a deepwater helm to self-heal or heal you as you chain-cann- nice!<br />
<br />
I'd concentrate on bringing the offense up to snuff-  meaning concentrate any money you're going to spend on gearing him up to high-ratio weapons and haste... mediocre armor is fine.<br />
<br />
Just perusing the pally spell list- wow, they get some nice stuff!  <br />
<br />
Your team is also great against undead, you have limited single-pulling ability (lull/soothe line), and as you get a little higher, you've also got invis vs undead and emergency ressurections covered.  And you're not conforming.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What biggruss said. Pallys bring other stuff to the table and if you can upgrade his damage output. I'd suggest at least giving it a fair try. I dont know how soon their spells start getting good ive never gotten past 13th lvl with a pally but should be a good duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the input guys :) <br />
For a little more info, I logged him on today, he had a Ghoulbane 3 cp and a helm of ro, other than that he was butt nekkid. Guess I got some work to do with him :) sell a few more forest loops and i should be ok though... thanks again!</div></div><hr />
