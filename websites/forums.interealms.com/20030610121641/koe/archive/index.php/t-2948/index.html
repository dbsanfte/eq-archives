<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With 59 just around the corner (2 1/2 blues to go), I'll be spending time when not on epic raids or other KOE raids trying to farm some gems.  I'd like to get your opinions on where would be the best places to farm velious quest gems without screwing the COV or Thurg factions.<br />
I know that Velks, SG, and the Sirens in CS are good sources.  <br />
Geonids and DN are other places but per kill I don't know how they compare.<br />
<br />
I think the only soloable places would be the Sirens, some parts of SG, and maybe geonids, so groups would be required elsewhere.  I'd like to try soloing in the Velks pit sometime, but only with a rezzer standing by :)<br />
<br />
What's the place to be?  (I know Velks is the &quot;in&quot; place but its so camped lately it's frustrating unless you have a pit or village group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly? Iwas astounded by the nnumber of gems we got in a couple hours of playing around in SG prior to Dar's Faydedar Hunt. Some rare ones, some BP ones and a bunch of others. This place screams &quot;hunt here&quot; to me, for some exp groups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well.. add Icewell Keep to the list of gem sources. <br />
<br />
Good for a change of pace and is usually open, but the mobs are tough for what you get. <br />
<br />
You can indeed solo against the Geos or small groups are effective as well. <br />
<br />
Drop rates seem to change with every patch. Geos at one time dropped them like crazy, but it has changed. <br />
<br />
DN can be a good spot.. particularly for a high level group or 2 groups running together and is generally empty for the most part.</div></div><hr />
