<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am what many of you would call an old school shaman.  At least my old shaman was.  I was about level 29 when alchemy was first actually put in the game as a tradeskill, and had throughout his shaman career invested over 10k into the skill while seeing very little returns.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to the present.  I have restarted my shaman, gotten him decently equipped and leveling fast.  Once again my thoughts are turning to alchemy.  Is it actually worth investing now, and if so how much of a platinum drain will it be to raise the skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iceborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How much plat will it drain?<br />
<br />
All</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no, still worthless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll come down on the other side of the coin.<br />
<br />
It isn't worthless, by any means, but it is prohibitively expensive. <br />
<br />
Will you make money in bazaar selling potions?  No, not likely.  Why bother?  The potions, expensive as they are, provide some utility that is quite nice.  <br />
<br />
There are potions to raise resistances, potions to gate people to their bind points, potions to shrink groups of people, potions to allow an MT to spam-heal himself in an emergency, and more.  While all of these potions are expensive, they serve a useful purpose and when you are looking at it from a raiding point of view, spending 400p on potions to shrink people is an insignificant expenditure in the grand scheme of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But we have group shrink spell so thats kind of useless now. The only good potions that I can think of are the DS and the heal potions for MTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not worth it.  While SOE has made the potions actually nice, the cost to get your skill up isn't worth it.  There are better tradeskills that you can make money are easier and faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You only need about 8k total to get to 180 skill.. 12k total to get to 195ish with a high wisdom.<br />

I have used Wood Elf potions multiple times to get my Wood Elf Crown.<br />
<br />
I plan on using Iksar potions to do the iksar cudgel quests.<br />
<br />
I have made kilva skin of flame potions to use on myself to plev other people with (i.e. i take agro and deal damage with the shields, and plevelee does at least 1 dmg and gets all the xp) or just give a damage shield for droga aoe factioning.<br />
<br />
My brother, a bard, sometimes gets in trouble and to escape he deftdances and uses a thurg potion .. but now I can make him gate potions for 252pp-- expensive, but very convenient.<br />
<br />
Just last night, we had a group in CT and a ranger had to leave... he invissed but was discovered and so he died.  He was dragged back to the camp to get rezzed but that didn't help him get out of the zone and he really needed to log.. so I asked him where he wanted to go-- Field of Bone or Everfrost Peaks?  Everyone /boggled wondering how I could teleport.. I whipped out my handy folded medicine bag, combined a heliotrope and a sandalwood, and gave him his escape.<br />
<br />
Teleport potions are great if you have a melee who needs to leave and you have no teleporter-- if you don't have the components, you can bind, spiritstone to your hometown, make the gate/teleport potions, and gate back to give to the melee...<br />
<br />
Stinging Wort potions are potentially very helpful insta-300 hp heals.. I've never really put these to good use but I'd imagine they could help a lot.<br />
<br />
You can even use some potions to raise your stamina for extra hitpoints..  or potions for resists...<br />
<br />
Of course, you can figure out other ways to do these things, but the issue is that you add another ability to your character that wasn't there before... who needs to ask a project illusion enchanter to turn you into a certain form when you can do it yourself?  Sure you can buy it in the bazaar but there's a sense of pride for being totally self-sufficient...</div></div><hr />

I still have two accounts of mules chock full of toes when I get back to playing again, another account that belonged to a friend was chock full of toes too.<br />
<br />
Those potions helped us get our first vindi and velk kills with 19 ghetto characters (pre-pop).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iceborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm, I didn't say it wasn't worth it. In fact I made my Alchemy GM trophy 2 nights ago. It is however, ungodly expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Potions are great for helping folks out. Giving guildies DS potions or gate potions in situations can really help them out.<br />
<br />
However as far as being lucrative, look far far elsewhere. The cost of potions is still insanely high and most of the time they cannot be sold for more than half the making cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Fun.  Useful.  Self-sufficient.<br />
<br />
Nothing about alchemy is lucrative, easy, or inexpensive.  But I'm starting it up again for those first three reasons.  And hell, someone actually bought a 10 shot potion of heat off my bazaar mule last nite.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It was actually very very lucrative for me the first week or so that LoY was out.  I was making 20-30 illusion potions each night and they would be gone with in hours.  That lasted for about a week and a half and I haven't sold any since that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you're looking for a return on your investment, <br />
forget alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sepends on your definition of &quot;worth&quot;. Alchemy never has and probly never will be a lucrative skill to get into pruely for monitary gains, however, i do find it to be useful greatly. From making DS potions and SoW potions to making Illusion potions and Resist/stat potions, i tend to use it nowmore then i ever did, when i have the money. Frankly my whole goal in getting to 180 alchemy was merely to be proficient in one of the many talents a shaman  has. It drained my bank account horribly , but i have no regrets. It was worth it for illusion halfling alone. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like alchemy for these reasons:<br />
<br />
1) keeps alts sowed<br />
2) Keeps alts shrunk<br />
3) resists<br />
<br />
I make no profit at all through alchemy, and people sell potions so close to cost now adays it would be hard to make alot of proffit off it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Worth it for making money? No. Worth it for fun? Imo yes.<br />
<br />
PS. Alchemy will cost you alOT more than 8k to get to 180. Try at least twice that. If wis is max it'll help but not that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've gotten to 170 skill in alchemy and have never once sold a potion to a vender.  I'm nearly certain I've either broken even or made money.  SoW potions sell for above cost.  As do shrink potions.  As do ITU potions. As do DS potions.  I even managed to sell a bunch of stat/resist potions (though those did sit on my bazaar mule for months before they all sold).  Someone is even buying Titan potions now and then (those I'm selling at cost due to low demand).<br />
<br />
If you are extremely patient and choose your skill-up potions carefully, you should be able to get to 170 or so essentially for break-even.  If you power level the skill and sell the results to venders, it's gonna cost you an arm and a leg and I doubt you'll make the money back very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I got real sick of alchemy after spending a K or so just raising skills to sow/shrink potion standards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree with Kazim. If you have Luclin, alchemy can be a consistent money maker. Spend 30 mins making 10 stacks of sow (or whatever), set up as bazaar trader and sell at 30-40pp over cost.  Earn money while you sleep.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I love it, but then I've always regarded alchemy as an extension of our spell books.  Ungodly expensive, but many of them are worth it.<br />
<br />
I think the top-end potions should cost about the same (or up to 10p more) per dose as Kilva's Skin of Flame does.  Useful potion, fairly expensive (30p/dose), but still affordable.<br />
<br />
Even our gate potions would be best balanced at around 100p per dose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Exactly shandy , it gives us the ability to do tings that other classes can do , when you sit back and look at it, it pretty powerful to have as a skill which probly explains why it was never made in a way that we could make cash off it. Just a lil bit of tweaking and we could get seriously rich from them. I guess the draw backs and downsides are meant to balance them, cause you know for sure if they werent there and we could get rich from them, every class in the game would whine so loud and so long we would either get nerfed or it would be taken away all together.</div></div><hr />
