<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">when i logged on last night, i was trial 5 from being Kod'Taz flagged. sooo, guildies being as awesome as they are, some decided to surprise me and form up a vxed group to get some xp and flag me so i can join in the fun. this made me ridiculously happy, since i've been getting repeated invites from some of the ubers in the guild who didnt' realize i hadn't finished kod'taz flag yet. wheee!<br />
<br />
wasn't sure entirely what to expect. have had a couple vxed xp groups before, as well as some farming runs, but never tried for the win, and always used the enchanter charm method before, where my mob was mainly to keep up pet hps, refresh buffs, and malosinia when charm broke.<br />
<br />
well...this time, the enchanter we brought stepped up and said he preferred we do it w/o charm. <br />
<br />
no druids, i was 2nd heal, and slower. chanty was there entirely for cc and did some nuking. zero charms the entire time.<br />
<br />
i had no problems whatsoever 2nd healing and slowing on the trial. healing adept 1, healing gift 2, improved healing 4, 5k even mana pool, no GoD spells yet--using Q and Tnarg's only.<br />
<br />
on inc call, hit MT with Q, then switch targets to mob inc, pause briefly to let MT get aggro, slow, switch back, splash heal. mostly chaining Q, starting Tnarg's over and over and hitting /stopcast when the complete heal beat my splash heal and it wasn't needed. <br />
<br />
start to finish, didn't do the 'mad dash' way...we cleared right up to the last room then levi'd and hugged the right wall to get around the mobs in the last room. <br />
<br />
only time i died the entire run was when a repop happened right on top of me. we stopped to med twice for the cleric, but had a bard there to play mana song.<br />
<br />
<br />
20% regular xp from 66 towards 67. WHEEEE!!!<br />
<br />
kod'taz, here i come!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats! Kod Taz is endless fun and pretty sharp experience. Got both my heal spells there within 4 days of being flagged off the Howling Hynid.  Get yourself a Glyphed Prayer Ring (Ikkinz 2, I believe) and perhaps a Glowing Bone Ring from Yxtta, and just farm named for augs. I got an FT3 aug there a couple days ago, I just need the ring to be able to use it lol. Trash mobs in KT can drop some very nice things, so keep an eye out. Enjoy!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They nerfed the drop rate on KT / Yxxta random drops significantly. Before in a 6 hour session you would get 1-2. Now guild groups are there 12 hours a day, high dps boxing a few toons outside the group.. multiple guild groups.. rarely see one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kod'Taz is an awesome zone. Its great experience and I think its pretty fun too. The Glyphed Prayer Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68796) actually drops in all 3 of the ikkinz trials, but you have to complete 1 before you can trigger 2, then complete 2 before you can trigger 3. Ikkinz 2 also drops a Carved Vrex Totem (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68768) which is a dang nice &quot;free&quot; item for us. The trials are very challenging, but a fun thing to do with 1 group.<br />
<br />
Also, the random drops from KT are Guise of Seething Satisfaction (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68702) and Reflective Orb of Energy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68701). Honestly I have grouped here for a few months now and have seen 1 of the range items drop ever, and none of the masks. I think I just have bad luck because other guildies average 1 or so a day there. The named also drop lots of good stuff including spells, a ft3 aug, and a few hp augs. Its a great zone for everyone =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've killed thousands of mobs in KT in the last month and have not seen a single mask or orb.  We used to get one every couple days clearing from zone in to Ikkinz (when animals were agro) and thats when I got mine.</div></div><hr />
