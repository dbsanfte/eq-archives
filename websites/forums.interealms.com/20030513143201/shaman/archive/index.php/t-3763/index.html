<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fentrap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
Due to a younger brother and a crappy computer my corpse rotted while in CoM, i was able to keep my book for the journals, but i lost my boots and shield.... can i just go kill the two RM guys and get my shield back and kill BD and get my boots back, or do i need to start over..... also, will doing this screw up my True spirit faction in terms of completing the rest of the spear.... or will it help and be enough faction to skip the hole portion?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can get your shield back just by asking (repeat the quest text) .. no killing needed.<br />
<br />
If your Truespirit faction is the same (or higher) than when you originally did the BLack Dire turn in, you can get another pelt, and turn in again for the boots.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heck of a good question.  Black Dire can be done a second time, and has been since the change.  The 2 gents in RM can be done a 2nd time, and a 3rd, and a 4th, and you get the shield each time, but if I recall correctly, you have to ask for it.<br />
<br />
Might try finding the Wandering Spirit with a tracker and just ask &quot;what shield of falsehood&quot; first.  It may save you from having to harvest the fools.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell from posts here and from acquaintances, the only portion that seems capped at &quot;too high&quot; a faction is Ghiosk's books. <br />
<br />
Anybody else know of another portion that is?<br />
<br />
FYI, I had to redo BD cuz I got offed by the damn tigers in EJ just as I turned in the pelt.  Got the boots, but then he wouldn't talk to me when I came back, and had to redo pelt to prove I was the same person to him... but this was pre-patch.</div></div><hr />
