<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what people thought about this spell and others in the line.  I see that it gives you good regen ac and stats but you loose mana.  Is this spell worth using.  I will usually melle mobs with the pet if that would make a difference.  I was just wondering since i have not used this line of spells really.  I want to know if I have been missing out and should be.  I usually fight with KEI as well if that would make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Uh, actually its just a straight up melee stat/ac buff. There is no regen or mana loss, besides the initial spell cost of course. I actually like to keep Voice of Berserker up while soloing, the ac alone helps and its a low mana cost. It's also great for procing weapons or gaining melee skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fayclopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the very beginning, the fury/rage line of spells would drain mana to provide the enhanced stats, but they haven't for a long time (Ever since I had them, and I've been playing for over 3 years..of course, I was a noob for a LONG time). Castersrealm kept the old info on their site for a long time so that's probably where you saw it.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question, they are worth using, and they don't drain any mana other than the spell's mana cost. They don't last very long (maybe 10min), so I don't always have it on me. But if I'm pulling something tough I'll use it. They give nice AC having both an AGI component and direct AC. The only thing they don't stack with is avatar, at least of the spells I own. I'm not sure whether they stack with primal essence because I don't have the spell yet, but I'm thinking it doesn't stack. For a shaman with primal essence, I would say keep PE on over the rage buff, just to avoid the annoyance of having to cast it so often.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nice.  thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One more warning on it though.  The rage line is a fizzlefest even with good abjuration skill.  Don't count on casting it the first time.  My current fizzle record is 24 in a row done with Rage on a 51 Shaman with maxxed abjuration skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">VoTB fizzles much less.  At 235 Abjuration, I encounter no more fizzles than I usually do with any other spell.<br />
<br />
It costs 1 mana, gives 24 ac, 74 agi, 84 str, 74 dex, and lasts 20.5 minutes at level 65.  While PE does last longer, it also provides much less in the way of benefits.</div></div><hr />
