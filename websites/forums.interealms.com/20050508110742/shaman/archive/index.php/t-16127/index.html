<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, looking for advice here, had a really poor experience this weekend that has left me thinking I will never help another person out again in game (outside my guild).<br />
<br />
I went to COM to see if I could solo reavers (62 shaman). I made my way to the bridge outside the castle and was clearing it (I had heard a rumor that some mobs now drop a key to the castle and just wanted to check it out). I get a tell from a guy saying that he had died and his corpse was in the castle. I told him what I was doing and he kind of sat behind me. He got whacked by a mob so I healed him. Next thing he sends me an invite. I accept and we continue talking about keys being dropped. He tells me to kill a Mighty Golem, a named I guess although the name didn't trigger anything to me. I just assumed that he thought it would drop the key so I could let him in to recover his corpse. I must have killed 10 mobs with him just sitting behind me doing nothing, and I looted them all. It never crossed my mind that anything was amiss. (I just continued to think he was looking for safety).<br />
<br />
I am taking on the golem and he tells me to pull it back to us. I did. As it dropped I noticed him kneeling. I tried to loot the corpse and it was locked. I asked him w.t.f he was doing and he said checking it. I assumed he was checking for the key and asked him to step back from the corpse. Next thing I know he has looted a face item that would be an upgrade for me. I ask him to hand it over. He then stunned me by saying that we never agreed looting rights before we grouped and it was his. I could not believe it. Then he disbands from the group and goes back to the castle. He keeps trying to retrieve his corpse while I am peeved and asking him in /tell to hand the item over. He offers to /ran it saying it would be fair. I had already petitioned by this time but stupidly /ran and lose. He laughs at me, then has the gall to ask for a heal. I told him to die. he said whatever, &quot;I have regen&quot;.  He manages to retrieve his corpse through the wall and then sends me a /tell saying &quot;see, I told you I was on a CR&quot;.<br />
<br />
A guide comes on and tells me that as we were grouped I have no comeback even though I was helping him.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if we can name character names on this board but I swear to god, I wanted to train him so badly it was not funny. I have never in my time on EQ been treated so poorly and it made me wonder what some people play for.<br />
<br />
As of now, I will no longer return tells, or requests for assistance from anyone other than a friend or guildmate. Half my enjoyment was helping others, but this trash took that fun away.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">please man, i hate it when people like this get away with **** like that. Train him or something, dispell his mobs if hes a snare kiter, something, PLEASE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't train him, don't ever heal him, don't ever group with him.<br />
<br />
DO post his or her name and any screen shots. DO let your guild know.<br />
<br />
DO NOT let the c0ckroaches of EQ get away with this. <br />
<br />
And don't let the a-holes get you down. Remember, in the end it is all pixels (or a pointer to a database). You are, in essence, giving yourself high blood pressure over a series of 1's and 0's.<br />
<br />
(and yeah it sucks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that sucks<br />
<br />
btw did u solo the reavers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks guys, I was pretty peeved and have let my guild know. The person is unguilded which is a shame as it would have been nice to let his GL know.<br />
<br />
Tiorr - unfortunately I didn't get a chance to solo them as another group arrived looking for them. I was only there to scout and didn't want them to miss an opportunity so I stepped aside. My good intentions certainly worked out nicely though because we got talking and I grouped with them for a while. In this time we killed a few reavers before popping Ghiosk. After killing him I got the books which was my next step in the epic quest. :)</div></div><hr />

Nice guys always finish first.  *******s get to the finish line and then all of the people they stepped on along the way fill em full of lead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry I didn't have a chance yet to read all the previous posts, and I'm by no means an expert at this, but here are a few ideas:<br />
<br />
1. Shrink to the smallest size, w/o bearform, which makes it much harder for people to see you.<br />
2. Keep up SoW and levitate.<br />
3. Go /anon, partially for the obvious guildtag reasons but also to minimize the amount of text that someone might manage to read over your head.<br />
4. Con the corpse from a distance to be sure of when it's opened up for general looting.<br />
5. Use skeleton form if possible, as it's difficult to see and target.<br />
6. Go invisible. A lot of people have see invisible items/spells on, but some don't.<br />
7. Create a diversion, such as a train.<br />
8. Leave the zone ASAP so that a /who won't show your name. Don't gate near the raid as this will show up in the chat window and logs.<br />
9. If the item is rare and droppable, wait a week or so before putting it up for sale in the bazaar.<br />
10. Deny everything. Don't say &quot;Oh yeah I was watching you guys kill AoW and yeah I checked the corpse to see what he'd dropped but I didn't take anything&quot;; instead say &quot;Huh? *** are you talking about? I've been farming shards for the past two hours.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Listen to the above poster, it's the best way to get yourself banned.  (GMs most definitely look at logs to see who looted what)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe if you hadn't helped the guy, you wouldn't have been there for when that other group arrived, and you wouldn't have gotten to know some good people and gotten your epic book drops (congrats, btw).  Maybe...<br />
<br />
<br />
Bad things aren't always so bad.  Karma rules the world.  Don't give up on being nice.  Jerks get theirs, if only in that they live in small, cruel little worlds and don't know much true happiness and joy in helping out others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">House, next time you think about posting read the thread first. There are only 7 posts in it prior to yours. My post was complaining about ******s like you. You are the bottom dwelling kind of ****** that I wish could be instabanned for ninja-looting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks Borgax, you make a good point. I was going to gate after it happened but was sitting there while I was in /tell with the guide. If it hadn't been for that I probably would have missed the opportunity.</div></div><hr />

That's weird.  Why is &quot;O u t w a r&quot; flagged as offensive?</div></div><hr />

****** is an online spamming game... have you ever been to a thread online where someone says to &quot;check out this site&quot; or something of that nature and when you get there it states something like &quot;You have been recruited to join the war&quot; or something of that nature.  Anyways you get tards that like to spam thier character links across the net in hopes of recruiting people to make them stronger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Perhaps instead of typing an 'r' you accidentally hit one of the characters right next to it on the keyboard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...and O u t w a r is offensive thanks to all the morons who spammed links to that site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hmmm, Kamidari, maybe it was meant as a tongue in cheek post..... which would mean I &quot;slightly overreacted&quot; to it. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, it was my thread, and if I want to overreact I will damn it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WittlesVaseel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Karshak, if you're not going to name names, don't bother posting it. What he did was cheap, but it wasn't a ninja.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It was most definitely ninja looting.  While the GM may have been happy to sit around with his thumb in his rear about it, that doesn't mean players have to.<br />
<br />
Remember, get your revenge when the guy least expects it.  One day you will be in a position to squish him like a bug.<br />
<br />
There is a jerkoff on my server that thinks I don't remember the time he ripped me off on a trade.  Stuff happens to him from time to time and he has no idea why (No, I'm not talking about training. Training doesn't do anything anymore, there are much worse things that don't violate the EULA that you can do to a person in this game).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The only way to ninja loot is to ninja loot from RL friends. That way you can keep the loot AND get a black eye.</div></div><hr />

new uber loots in COM?  :eek: <br />
<br />
what where the big changes there?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Lol Bazoom.<br />
<br />
Slicker, I wouldn't call it an uber loot, I am not geared as I would like to be. The mob was called &quot;A Mighty Golem&quot; and is not listed on Allakhazam yet. The drop was this:<br />
<br />
Iron mask of the wise <br />
face <br />
ac+5 str+3 cha+2 wis+10 hp+25 mana+20 SVM+5 <br />
reccomended lv of 40 <br />
clr dru shm <br />
all <br />
<br />
Not bad, the wis was a bonus, and it would have been a slight upgrade to my current enshrouded veil... yes, at 62 I need to work on my gear, but damn those spells are expensive.<br />
<br />
As far as if it was Ninja Looting or not. I don't know how the term is globally defined, I think anyone who loots without agreement from a mob they had no input in killing while sitting on their ass being protected from harm is a Ninja Looter. Only loot what you help kill, that is what I feel. Unless, someone offers you a piece.<br />
<br />
Making pp isn't hard, but it can be time consuming, and I just don't see why my efforts, and assistance should have been thrown back in my face by some idiot (Called MikeHardy btw WittlesVaseel - you can calm down now, sigh, all that anger with a mighty 11 post count).<br />
<br />
Bazoom, is it possible for my sarcasm skill to go negative?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You guys weren't &quot;grouping&quot; - you were helping him out of charity.  In the course of helping people retrieve their corpses, I've never expected to split loot with them for the privilege of being able to help them out.<br />
<br />
Definitely still do what you think is right and offer help to folks - your reputation will help you in ways and at times that you'll never even know about.  But sadly, now you've learned some caution, and you won't group with them during the process.  Sorry to hear you were taken advantage of like this.  At least it was a minor upgrade instead of something really heartbreaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Do NOT stop helping people.<br />
<br />
There is a conning system for players as well as PCs, just about the same, going from KOS to indifferent to Ally, it just doesn't show when you click on them.  It's all word of mouth.  Nice people get remembered just like jerks.  &quot;So-and-so is lfg.  Take him or do without?&quot;  Do you want the reply to be &quot;He's a good guy.  Would have got my butt handed to me if he hadn't come along and healed me&quot;  or &quot;He's a jerk.  I was one heal away from killing XXX and he stood by and let me die, and then he killed and looted it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Besides, I help out for a purely selfish reason:  pure satisfaction.  Doing &quot;Random Acts of Kindness&quot; makes ME happy.  If you're the same way, don't let one bad experience let someone else take away something that makes the game pleasurable for you.<br />
<br />
As for getting revenge....  If he is the same level as you, he is going to be in the same zones LFG.  YOU'RE the one who will get to say &quot;You take xxx and I leave.  That bastard ninja looted when I was trying to help him out with a CR.&quot;</div></div><hr />
