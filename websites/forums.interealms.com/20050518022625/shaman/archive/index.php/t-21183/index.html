<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many of us left?  Don't mean shaman now playing other classes as mains, or someone who made a shaman in velious and are now a main over thier original....  I mean the ones of us who've been a shaman from the get go and never looked back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda curious too see who is, what server they're on, and what they're up to.<br />
<br />
I'm on bristlebane, in an end game raiding guild, and still enjoying the game (yes, even uqua).<br />
<br />
<br />
I know the man of love, hugs, and happiness (aka - Jenamdar) is alive and kicking on Mith Marr.  So... who else is out there!?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I was too cheap to play EQ when it was released. Couldn't imagine playing 50 bucks for a game AND 12 bucks for a monthly fee! I looked at the box a lot in stores, but never bought it.<br />
<br />
I got EQ for my birthday in Aug of 99. First &quot;real&quot; character was a bard, purely for the corpse locator song (was so tired of losing my body under kelethin).<br />
<br />
Played the bard until 20 or so, realized that my boyfriend and I were going to need two accounts.<br />
<br />
Gloriana was created Thanksgiving weekend 99, I created a high elf cleric and a barb shaman the same day. I played both back and forth until they were both level 21. <br />
<br />
I then decided to stick with the shaman. The shaman is now level 65, time flagged with 302 AAs. The bard hasn't been touched (except as a thurg mule) and is still level 21. I got the cleric up to 28 during some burnout in the 50s.<br />
<br />
I have a handful of nicely dressed twinks, none above level 10.<br />
<br />
Shaman is my only character :)</div></div><hr />

Was a Beta 3 player, but as a paladin (also the first 2 weeks of release as a pally as well).  missed beta 4 because i was in military at the time and PCS'ing (that means moving for those who arent military associated).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Started early 99 with a wood elf warrior named Landiena on Mith Marr. <br />
<br />
As an aside, I always wanted to do this ...<br />
<br />
One day Landiena was in Greater Fey, waiting for a friend.  She was lvl 25.  All of a sudden, my trade window opened and someone was handing me a complete window of bags.  Before I hit trade, I asked &quot;what is this&quot;?  Got a tell back that this warrior was restarting a character and needed to give away her loot.<br />
<br />
I thanked her profusely and hit trade.  Much to my surprize, I ended up with a complete set of crafted armor, an executioner's axe, a rough oak recurve bow, a fishbone earring (so rare at the time it wasn't funny), hero bracers, complete jewelry, sewn evil-eye bag and boots of brawn. Plus so much more I just cannot remember.<br />
<br />
I always wanted to publicly thank this person.  I think she successfully made me one of the first twinked warriors on Mith Marr.  Also to let her know I still have the boots.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I got Landi to 40's, then server split and lost lots of friends.  Made a shaman because I was tired of paying 5pp for a sow (and I refused to make a druid).  This was around July 99.<br />
<br />
Loved playing Lori and took her to 65 ... and I am still on Mith Marr.<br />

<br />
What's going on Kilher? You old geezer.<br />
<br />
Decided to pop by here after almost a year after my retirement from eq and saw this thread.<br />
<br />
I started Eq in beta 4 and played up until a year ago. I just got bored and had to move on with my life. I started jogging and lost about 20 lbs (down from 202lbs). I quit and I haven't looked back, though I mainly miss some of the people that I used to talk to, I don't really miss the game and the bs that went on.<br />
<br />
All that said, I'm looking forward to trying out EQ2. I'm hoping it's going to be pretty good, but I dont know. It's got amazing graphics regardless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm in an elemental raiding guild that is falling apart due to guild wars/low raid attendance/inability to focus on raids.<br />
<br />
For a long time, I was a PKer(from mid 40s to late 50s) so I really lost a lot of time I could have been seriously progressing. I believe if I hadn't gone PK that I would be finished with Time and would be raiding GoD right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Started a ranger, which split off Tunare to Drinal, then started a Shaman. Tried a Tunare enchanter up to about 40 because the Drinal server was down every other day. The rest of my alts are under 20. Left for DAOC fopr a few months. I had given all tradeable enchanter equipment to guild, and was unable to retrieve any equipment because the guild members who knew me had quit. <br />

I logged back to shaman and have never looked back, until I pressed End Billing last month over the Vision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Had a couple of other characters that I lost before I figured out I needed to select the same server to see the same characters.  <br />
<br />
I inherited a 55 warrior who is now 56, but I have never really leveled twinks, except a warrior to 21 and a paladin to 10.  Alts bore me.  <br />
<br />
Now Gart bores me.  I log in very rarely now, some related to EQ burnout and some related to general life business.  <br />
<br />
But I'm sure I'll be back in the saddle again.  EQ remains a very deep and flexible game.  It's just got some serious problems - and shaman class balance is not the most significant of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I don't know if this counts.  I made a shaman in September of 1999, played him to 14, then deleted him.  I recreated him on E Marr in January of 2000.<br />

I'd never even heard of EQ until shortly after the Velious expansion which is when Donar was born. I've played him faithfully since as I have no alt over level 13.

Got tired of looking for sow at Oasis dock and elsewhere (usually with no luck) so in Aug 1999 made this shaman. My guild (Talons) on CT server is raiding Time now. The only mob we haven't killed yet is Quarm (soon I think). I love playing the shaman and it is all I play now. I have done a bit of Gates and have noticed that in most non-boss fights our usefulness is limited but I still enjoy my role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Didn't play the game at release, I didn't want to pay full retail price for a game and pay a monthly fee. I broke down and bought it in August of 1999 when I actually saw friends playing it. I created Thyrm when I asked my friends what they needed in their group. I re-rolled him in November of 1999 since coming from D&amp;D I tried balancing his stats and just kept running out of mana being the only healer in my group. Wow, that was a long time ago...ugh.<br />
<br />
Quit for almost a year, came back with Luclin. Got tired of the cesspool they call Rodcet Nife and started on Firiona Vie last year. Grumk is the 3rd re-rolled shaman I've had there, but won't re-roll again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Bubkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Made Bubkuk June 17th 1999, been playing him ever since. He's my only character. I like to think I know how to play a shaman very well, as I've done so for nearly 5 years now. :D</div></div><hr />
