<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i did look over threads and did not see this.<br />
<br />
i do not use a screen saver, but apparently some sort of power management tool.<br />
<br />
in trader mode, when my screen shuts off for the night, when i bring it back up by moving the mouse or shift key (whatever); the eq window comes up, but the screen stays black and never comes up.<br />
<br />
i have been able to /camp, and move to the next screen.  but the color does not come back on.  the screen stays black.  i then have to control alt delete out of EQ.<br />
<br />
the times i cannot camp, i control alt delete out and then get the 1018 error message that i have a character on that server.<br />
<br />
i can alt/shift R and the rest of the computer works fine.  all the desktop in color ect.<br />
<br />
any idea what i need to do so that the EQ screen comes back and does not turn black and stay that way??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nope, tried it.<br />
<br />
i minimized EQ and when i pop it back up, still black.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boilerterry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmmmm Check your power management settings, the monitor turning off should have no effect on EQ, but HD going into sleep mode, or processor (heck even NiC) would......the Power seetings can be found in your control panels.</div></div><hr />
