<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe this is just one of the sublime differences between grouping with guildies and pickups...last night I was in PoD LCY/castle with a pickup group. Me, cleric, ranger, 2 warriors, monk. One warrior had his epics. Every time I landed slow on a mob, it'd aggro me and stay there. Of course I don't run so as to allow the warriors to taunt the mob off, but it wasn't happening. I had to root the mob to get it off me. I died once when slow didn't land and the mob tore me a new one while the cleric cast a HEAL OVER TIME spell on me. Arrrrrrgh<br />
<br />
Contrast this to grouping with guildies...the main SK has got aggro management down to a science. He tells me to go ahead and slow the mob BEFORE it gets in melee range. Pallys can hold aggro too with their stuns. I've equipped some of the warriors in my guild with Honed Blades of the Ykesha, 12/21 weapons that proc stun, and they hold aggro with no problem. But 2 warriors, one with epic, could not. They said they were taunting...I dunno, the whole group was acting kind of skittish. The monk had the WE illusion, and he was the most insecure kung fuer I've ever grouped with. &quot;Oh, I didn't do that split right, I'm gonna DB cuz I suck.&quot; Maybe the WE illusion just made everybody in that party gimpier. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If they have problem holding aggro then by all means use root to help them. Trusting anyone in a pickup group is very much playing russian roulette.<br />

You should have made the ranger pull though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">and warrior epic aint to much aggro afaik either. Even a willsapper would be better. But ofcourse, the taunt is broken and should be fixed somehow anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
me and the monk tanked from then on =P don't think the warrior even noticed.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
<br />
Guild groups&gt;&gt;&gt;pick-up groups.<br />
Paladin/SK&gt;&gt;95% Warriors in exp sessions.<br />
<br />
If you are used to grouping w/ an SK MA who knows his class you will need to make adjustments when you group with just about any warrior.<br />
<br />
Slowing on incoming, when you DoT, nuke, or rain...have to change the timing on doing these almost every time or take the aggro time and time again.  Even with warriors who have decent weapons &amp; class skills still can rarely compare to a similarly skilled Pally/SK.  Though even a Warrior without uber weapons should be able to get aggro better than your experience the other day.<br />
<br />
It is just a fact of life that 95% of the Warriors you will be grouping with will NOT have the uber EB proc weapons that will keep aggro squarely on them.  Taunt sometimes works well (w/ a trained Warrior), but it is nothing compared to the aggro a Paladin or SK can generate quickly.<br />
<br />
The wood-elf monk sounds like he had condifence issues with hiss pulling, irrespective of his appearance.  Clerics casting HoT's on me is one of my biggest aggravations in pick-up groups.  I have 70% extended Torpors!!!<br />
<br />
Sounds like you just had a bad pick-up group overall.  Get out of Tier1 as fast as you can.  It gets better (somewhat) in Tier2, though the twinkies and clueless powerlevelers are getting flagged &amp; LFG in Tier2 now too.  I have to get my dang Tier3 flags/keys!!!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can't slow on inc with a warrior, unless you deal with a mob in your lap (i.e. root) - they have no way to generate aggro before getting into melee range and taking a few swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Use root... especially if the warrior is lower lvl than the mobs, they will have one heck of a time getting aggro away from you.<br />
<br />
Inform the warrior that you're using root (odds are, since its a pickup group, you will hafta spend 45 minutes explaining to this warrior that when a mob is rooted, the closest person gets aggro - during which time you will lose the 3 rogue's that all came to group with you and couldn't bs because they always ended up tanking)<br />
<br />
Anyway... warriors have a tough time getting aggro quickly. Thats the price they pay for defensive... I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Perhaps I'm the only one who does this, or maybe I'm a snob now 'cause I have torpor...but in pickup groups I've been torporing on the pull slowing on INC. and taking the aggro until the MT can pull em off me.<br />
<br />
This may not work in tier 2 with mobs quadding for 400 of course, but until I ding 61 I don't think I'll be seeing tier 2 anyway..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i wonder which epic he was using , from what im told &quot;red&quot; is a good aggro generator and &quot;blue&quot; does not , so having something semi-easy to get like the hammer the PoI dragon drops and have the red epic in the offhand is supposed to be quite good and quite a fairly easy combo to obtain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can't say i disagree.<br />
<br />
95% of my groups has either a SK or paladin tank.<br />
<br />
so far grouping from 60 to 64 on countless pickup groups i have only seen one warrior that could actually hold aggro decently and he had a Bloodfrenzy which is a really high aggro weapon. <br />
<br />
I love it when SK and Pallys just cast as soon as a mob is in aggro range, so i can slow and still have to mobs running after them.<br />
<br />
with warriors what i usually have to do is i malo, just to make sure it doesnt resist slow because if it does ill have a slowed mob on my ass. then wait a little less then 10 seconds and slow.. most warriors can still hold aggro with that, if not then it the mob will get one round on me and it will turn back to the warrior.<br />
<br />
the only exp group that i prefer a warrior is if we are planning on taking on any tough named mobs.. defensive helps with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OK, here's a philosophical question.<br />
<br />
I agree that guild groups &gt;&gt;&gt; pickup groups, just like pretty much everyone else who posts here.<br />
<br />
But all those folks in the pickup group are in SOMEBODY'S guild.  And the people that post here are from all guilds, all servers.  So logically that means that that person who sucks in your group does well in his own guild group, and you would logically suck in their group.<br />
<br />
So what causes this?  Is it all psychological - not understanding how that other guild works, or not trusting the people, or remembering all their screwups and belittling their strengths?  Is it that the real lamers just don't post here so the sample population is skewed?  What?<br />
<br />
For those of you who have changed guilds (I have never) is there a strong &quot;guild culture&quot; in most guilds that has to be learned before you are comfortable, or is it just a matter of knowing and being familiar with the people in the guild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Redblade and fleshgrinder is an awesome agro combo.  But still your waiting on procs and damage, taunt is straight up broken.<br />
<br />
I slow on Inc no matter who we have as a tank normally, lots of times before I can see the mob....which is pretty risky.  But it does work out well, and a warrior DW'ing can normally snag agro off me before the mob is down even one bub.  teir 1 btw, doubt if I'll be doing that kind of stuff in teir 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>touk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I  have found a good way to not get beaten to a bloody mass when slowing on a incoming pull(note guild group)  <br />
1.Stand next to your warrior.<br />
2. when mob is close to tank send in alpha dogdog this will hold argo long enough for you to slow.<br />
3. SLow mob ( you now have agro but thats ok you have stocism or torpor on you from when the puller got back to camp)<br />
4. On your slow message the warrior starts to shield you.<br />
5 stand there untill warior get agro from hits and shield.<br />
6.This works very very well if you have a warrior that has a clue.(most do)<br />
This will work even when you only have 1 tank.<br />
and if you tank just cant get agro root asap then slow and back off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it's all about how they use the taunt skill .. if they mash the button .. you're in for a long night .. if they use taunt selectively .. you'll be more than fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, as someone who's been playing a warrior most of the last few months (52 now), I have to disagree somewhat with a number of the previous posts.<br />
<br />
Agro management is the responsibility of the entire group.  If the actions you are taking are getting you agro and the tank can't get agro back, discuss it with the tank and find a solution.  90% of the time agro control is no problem for my warrior, but every now and then I group with some caster that thinks it's cool to nuke (or worse, dot) the crap outta everything, then they wonder why I can't maintain agro and they keep dying.  I've got all this plate and hp's and you've got squat, but you're out damaging me by 3x so they run kill you before worrying about me...go figure.  Believe me, most casting classes can take agro away from a warrior (especially early in a fight) if they aren't careful.  Note:  I'm assuming the warrior doesn't have expensive agro gear like Blade of Carnage, etc.<br />
<br />
I agree that there are warriors that don't know their role is agro management and therefore suck at it, but for the most part if there are agro management problems it's a breakdown in the whole group and everyone needs to revisit what they are doing.  <br />
<br />
If you're getting beat on and the tank can't get agro back, look at what you're doing and discuss it with the tank.  If the tank doesn't understand their role is to maintain agro, remove them from the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One saving grace of warriors is that they can take the hits from an unslowed mob better than most SKs and Pallies.<br />
<br />
I always use malo first when a warrior is tanking. This gives the warrior time to engage before slow lands, and means slow is very unlikely to be resisted. If you still have problems then wait a moment and slow a bit later - most warriors can take it and its better that the cleric heals a bit more than the whole group waits for you to get a rezz and be rebuffed.<br />
<br />
I have to agree though, I'll chose a SK/Pally over a warrior in almost any XP group. Heck, our 65 warrior with great gear can't taunt as well as our 60 Pally with Thurgadin kit and a windblade. Warriors need some type of boost to their taunting ability, other than uber weapons that only 10% of warriors will ever see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Red epic is great aggro - I unbag mine when I'm supposed to be getting hit - but it's a proc.  So if it's being finicky about proccing, it's got all the aggro of a 24 delay weapon...<br />
<br />
...which ain't much.<br />
<br />
Best option in your case would have been to stand next to the warrior if you were going to slow early, so the mob wouldn't peel off anywhere - or wait a few more seconds before you slowed.  You could even wait for the epic proc message to go off.<br />
<br />
Getting aggro as a warrior just hurts - it's a combination of weapons, procs, proximity, knowing when to taunt, and then even once you've got your end covered, pretty much ANY class can take aggro from you if they're in a mood to showboat.<br />
<br />
end of rant.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When I group with a warrior, I always follow the same procedure:<br />
<br />
1) stand just behind the warrior<br />
2) malo<br />
3) let the warrior fight the mob unslowed while malo finishes casting and my spell gems repop<br />
4) slow<br />
<br />
By that time, the warrior has sufficient agro to either keep the agro from the mob, or get it back within one or two swings.  Obviously the warrior takes more damage during the slowing, but what does that really mean?  He gets his CH 5 seconds earlier than normal.<br />
<br />
When I have a paladin tanking, all bets are off.  I'll slow when the mob enters casting range, if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">One of my friends i group with is a warrior.  I slow EVERY mob as fast as i can land it.  It charges me, he hits taunt, I back up... problem solved.<br />
<br />
Anyone who cant hold agro, even without spells just doesnt know what they are doing.  I am certain I could toss a quick poison dot and pull it back off of him... but unless I want to hold agro there is no reason he cant get agro off of me.<br />
<br />
I prefer my SK friend as a tank... the mobs never even look at me.  He drops a quick snare on them (massive agro even if they are immune), and I could slow, dot, nuke, canni to a bubble of health... no response from the mob.  Our Bard can hold agro on exp mobs if he wants to.  Its a matter of knowing what to do, vs pretending to be helpless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Virulent Paralysis is GREAT for this.  It's also a very cheap skill to buy, which is nice.  I slow, then hit VP after the mob smacks me once, and VP hits and the mob gets THRUST backwards into the melees again.  It's like PUSHING the mob off me and back where it should be.  I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks for the suggestions. Couple more things to add:<br />
<br />
Don't have malo (yet), but I was starting to cast malosini prior to slow, and got complaints from the jittery WE monk. Sheesh, how'd you get to 61 without a backbone?<br />
<br />
I got a drogmar, and I'm too spoiled by the standing med. It's cost me maneuverability in combat situations. I might have to start dismounting before slowing.<br />
<br />
As a rule, I wait a few seconds before rooting if the mob stays on me, so that the tanks have a chance to taunt it off and not lose aggro in the event of my rooting it. As it was, the willowy WE monk started whining about getting aggro when I did the root. Just FD ya fool.<br />
<br />
The epic warrior used both red and blue, but occasionally used the 2H version. Can't say that it made any difference.<br />
<br />
Weiss, I'm thinking the other group members who are in different guilds are in pickup groups because their respective guild groups are already full. That group secretly got together ASAP so they wouldn't have to group with their gimpy guildmates. It's the &quot;I don't want to play with my stupid kid brother&quot; syndrome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you get aggro 99 out of 100 times it's YOUR fault. (After the first 2 pulls anyway).. the first 2 you should expect heavy aggro as you adjust to the group.. If he's a button mashing warrior, let the mob go to 97ish before malosining then slowing if then wait until 80 or 70% to cripple. <br />
<br />
Horrible tanks I go 97% malosini, wait for buttons to come up, 1 2 3 turgurs.. I don't know how it's like to have malo or torpor and I'm not sure how that level 59 shaman can give a 1-6 step guild to slowing at level 60+ but I've been playing eq for 5 months and except for the past 3 days I've only played a shaman and mostly in tier 1.. if you get aggro, it's your fault.. I've duoed with a 60 monk dual boxing a 62 cleric outside of gorup when I was level 57 in COD (tier 2) and I didn't get aggro once.. (fty monks can't taunt).. =] <br />
<br />
I don't mean to offend anyone just wish when I started someone gave me a straight answer.. something like pick alternation period. (that took me a while to figure out).. and get a JBB NEVER give it up.. I just gave mine up to get a fungi and I am now in the market to purchase a JBB.. it's GODs (verants) gift to shaman..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i wonder which epic he was using , from what im told &quot;red&quot; is a good aggro generator and &quot;blue&quot; does not ,<br />
the &quot;red&quot; epic? and the &quot;blue&quot; epic.  They are red and blue, no need for quotes, though for once your info is correct.  The red epic has a +hate proc, which is why it taunts well sometimes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It seems fairly obvious at this point SK's are meant to be aggro kings (especially when they have a spell line *devoted* to it).. so I don't see the problem here. Sure warriors aren't 'as' good.. but they still can control aggro if your group has any compitence at all. I could be biased because I duo a 63sk and 62shm (just got canni V tonight whee! I can exp again!) .. but hybrids have to be better at something. Currently you have SK/Pali preferred group tanks, while Warriors are preferred raid tanks. Why should warriors get the best of both worlds?<br />
<br />
If hybrids don't have improved aggro management and utility spells you're back to wondering what the point of having a hybrid in group is again. <br />
<br />
Hybrids save the group mana from superior aggro control, while warriors save the group mana from better damage mitigation/increased HP to make CH's more efficient. It's as simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kelliani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hi, Mesch!!  In order for folks to fully understand the aggro issues, they have to be taught.  In my opinion, the ranger should have been pulling. Snare twice, you slow on the inbound, warrior steps up and taunts off the ranger who then slaps a jolt on it and goes to work.  That's the new style I spent a couple of weeks testing.  It works almost flawlessly.  That's for max group efficiency, though.  <br />
<br />
If pure efficiency is not a huge concern or you don't have a hybrid to pull, I'd recommend holding off the casts a tad.  If the group doesn't really understand how to keep aggro on the warrior and/or the warrior doesn't understand exactly how taunt functions, it's probably your best bet just to hold off a bit.<br />
<br />
The other part is the ranger knowing that as well as doing damage, he's also there to protect the casters and to sacrifice some hit points if necessary to do so.  Being a hybrid, snatching aggro from a shammy isn't that hard.  Just have to be willing to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">if then wait until 80 or 70% to cripple.<br />

<br />
That is a load of crap. Especially in pick up groups. I keep running into warriors with no proccing weapons who can't even keep stuff off rogues who are evading.<br />
<br />
I have to do this nearly every time I'm grouped with a warrior. First Malosi and send pet, then move next to the warrior cause even after you ask they don't pull next to you (and this is a huge pain when I'm on a mount), and then cast slow. By the time thats all done, the cleric has to heal the warrior early, and for the warrior to tank ends up costing more mana then a paladin or SK because slow isn't landed early, and the rest of the classes in the group have to hold back.<br />
<br />
I don't know what the answer is to balance warriors against paladins / SKs without gimping paladins / SKs and raids, but this situation isn't working, and anyone that says otherwise has an invested interest in keeping warriors reps good.</div></div><hr />

Pull for the group. You know if it is slowd on incoming pull or not. And can Drop a nice fast casting root Before it gets to the party To try and reslow. <br />
<br />
Plus with one Successful taunt The warrior now has Aggro over your slow aggro number and Wizards and such have more free reign. <br />
<br />
At least it works for me. Sure I get smacked around sometimes. But chain pulling in PoStorms is a wonderful thing. It causes the clerics to go grey fast. But thats what the hair club for Dorfs is all about.<br />

This item has a delay of 24, so its not all that fast.  This spell can be resisted.  If you are fighting a mob with low fire resists, this is gernally a great tool for gaining aggro.<br />
<br />
Eb is 700hate unresistabale, and generally found of weapons with delay &lt; 24, so this is even better.<br />
<br />
Yeah, its your fault if you get aggro after a couple pulls. However, sometimes you find yourself in a group with a tank that does a worse than normal job holding aggro.  Once you know this, you can controll it, but often times it comes at the price of having to play like a gimp, and unmem all spells other than heal root slow and malx.  <br />
<br />
Yes you can controll the aggro, but you shouldn't have to play below your potential because a warrior can't hold his own.<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for them, rellying on procs to do your job is horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">From playing a warrior for roughly 4 years...it is indeed usually a casters fault when they get aggro. For example - I remember one shaman that cast bane of nife every 10 seconds(no, I am not kidding) on a raid. Finally I stopped taunting,  he got flattened, and he stopped casting stupidly.<br />
<br />
There are stupid warriors out there though, just like any other class. Leave the group if you find them.<br />
<br />
Colal is right about the red epic btw, it is an easily resisted fire based proc, and if it does get resisted it adds no aggro- warrior epic sucks, there are easier  to get, and better, weapons out there for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My main is a warrior, with a shaman alt now(why I am here), so have to say something on this topic.  <br />
<br />
One of my friends i group with is a warrior. I slow EVERY mob as fast as i can land it. It charges me, he hits taunt, I back up... problem solved. <br />
<br />
That is how it is supposed to to work, unfortunatly, taunt is a skill check, and sometimes that skill fails(about 1 in 5 times it fails it seems to me).  Unfortunatly, it seems that the RNG in EQ is really streaky, so if you fail the first one, good chance you will fail the next, and the next...<br />
<br />
What can shaman do to help a warrior tank?  Hopefully, first is to not give up on us.  We can tank and keep the exp flowing in.  Stand next to us when you cast slow, so we can tap taunt and get agro right back.  If you pull the mob away from us, we have to move back to mellee range to taunt, or worse, taunt as the mob moved out of range, meaning 6 seconds before we can taunt again.  If the mob does not turn back to the tank right away, cast root(please call it so we know, most of us do know how root agro works, and try and adjust for it) and back away.  Never, not ever, run if you get agro.  Enchanters love to do this, and it just makes our job harder, and you are more likely to die.<br />
<br />
Last is please, please do not tell us to taunt, or ask us if we are.  Nothing drives us nuts like that.  If a warrior does not know to taunt by the time he or she is in PoP zones, well, they are in trouble.  Most should know to only taunt when they do not have agro, or after they see a cast message for a high agro spell.  Most should have agro proc weapons, tho windblade and other high DPS weapons are coming into favor as good agro with less riposte damage.<br />
<br />
PoP has made the warrior's job harder than it has ever been.  After a good group, I am literally wore out from doing all that needs to be doing.  A second looking away from the screen can be disasterous.  My shaman is now 45, and will hopefully soon be able to do PoP groups, and gripe about warrior tanks.  Should be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Some nice tips here.<br />
<br />
But i am also with the 'no cripple'-crowd here. Maybe if i had one or two spell slots more and some spare mana, i would care for cripple while xping.<br />
<br />
In normal xp situations -talking about PoP here- you shouldn't try<br />
and slow mobs the very first second they come in in my opinion. I got used to maloX them first anyway, that should give enough time for tanks to gain aggro (maybe add a second or two for warriors).<br />
<br />
Remember it's part of the tanks job to get a bit of a beating  ;).<br />
When you get multiple adds and crowd control is lacking, you want to get mobs slowed faster of course. <br />
<br />
For positioning the group on inc:<br />
- slower should be near tank, but that's a two sided issue. In pickup groups i often have the situation, that i have to run literally half a mile to get to tank/puller. Why is it so difficult to pull a mob a bit closer to the bear?<br />
- on a side note, bad pickups drive me crazy, when fighting EVERY single mob at a different spot (grml). For the love of god, everyone find ONE spot, where its ok to sit/med and ONE small area for fighting the mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullcrap, there are to many warriors who have no proccing weapons, and don't understand how taunt even works. Then you add in the ones who do know how it works, and have proccing weapons but fail the skill check and don't end up proccing early on and it is definately more often the warriors fault, and I've been playing for 4 years as well. Just happens that now it actually matters.<br />

Yeah, we all know there aren't any casters out there who overnuke, and no caster out there casts high aggro spells one after the other, ever...right?<br />

<br />
Indeed, that is the lazy route most take for tanking these days, it just goes to show how screwed over warriors have been since late velious. <br />
<br />
I'd ask shammies to step up and support warriors, but numerous classes already have(including shammies)...and frankly the developers could give a **** about warriors - and it shows. They aren't listening to their player base at all on this issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I see alot less crappy casters then I do warriors since PoP, odds are they will die if they pull agro alot of the time so they seem to be learning.<br />

I don't know what more any class could do for warriors. Nearly every class has threads debating the effectiveness of warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Try joining a good guild then and grouping with warriors that you know and can trust.

<br />
There's only 2 or 3 people bitching about warrior taunt here.. the rest seem to offer solutions you could atleast try before more bitching.<br />
<br />
I rarely see this topic come up anywhere but here, by the same people over and over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">You know tappion, if you're running into tons of poor warriors all the time, the problem might not be the tanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">So what causes this? Is it all psychological - not understanding how that other guild works, or not trusting the people, or remembering all their screwups and belittling their strengths?

<br />
Guild groups are generally better because you presumably spend quite a bit of time around them and have learned their strengths/weaknesses/idiosyncracies. That makes it easier to predict what they will be doing so you can adapt to it.<br />
<br />
People who have worked together many times in the past tend to mesh better than random strangers. That is all it really is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">chain cast cripple... slow is overrated when you can break kneecaps!<br />
<br />
Honestly, Warrior taunt is broken.  Plain and Simple.  A good warrior can deal with it and use various tools abilities to still be quite viable but the ability to hold aggro is still highly reliant on the good ol' RNG in many cases.<br />
<br />
In lower tier pop, aggro management should be pretty easy.  Cast malX as soon as incoming mob is within range, slow asap after that and pop a root on it.  Back up and by the time root breaks you should be fine.<br />
<br />
As far as getting around while on a mount.  Strafe.  No accel/decel while strafing. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hi, Mesch!!  In order for folks to fully understand the aggro issues, they have to be taught.  In my opinion, the ranger should have been pulling. Snare twice, you slow on the inbound, warrior steps up and taunts off the ranger who then slaps a jolt on it and goes to work.  That's the new style I spent a couple of weeks testing.  It works almost flawlessly.  That's for max group efficiency, though.  <br />
<br />
If pure efficiency is not a huge concern or you don't have a hybrid to pull, I'd recommend holding off the casts a tad.  If the group doesn't really understand how to keep aggro on the warrior and/or the warrior doesn't understand exactly how taunt functions, it's probably your best bet just to hold off a bit.<br />
<br />
The other part is the ranger knowing that as well as doing damage, he's also there to protect the casters and to sacrifice some hit points if necessary to do so.  Being a hybrid, snatching aggro from a shammy isn't that hard.  Just have to be willing to do it.<br />
<br />
Hehe I'm busted aren't I? I now remember the big long post you put on the guild board about aggro. :-)<br />
<br />
I don't want to embarass the ranger, but he was a fellow FFer.<br />
<br />
btw bud, I know you don't wanna miss the news, but I miss groupin' with ya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You piece of crap, It's definately the tank. First off i'd say 75% of taunt using classes don't know that its top of the hate list + 1. They mash the damn button. Second problem, Lammies/Defiance/Centi Longsword/Argent Protectors/etc. etc. etc. This is the normal warrior on Tarew Marr in PoN. <br />
<br />
Last night I got into a group with a warrior with the Cord Hilted Whatever that procs taunting blow from xanamech when i was lfg in PoN, and I was so amazed I actually made a comment about how nifty it was to see a good warrior in PoN. Ya know what though? Unless it procced within the first 3 seconds of the pull (and i used infusion of spirit + kraggs + dex to give him 100 extra dex) he still wasn't the one keeping mobs off me. It was the paladin. <br />
<br />
So s t f u about me being the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">bit defensive are we?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Hail,<br />
<br />
On normal Tier2 mobs, I'm slowing on incoming (after Malo, so sometimes the mob is already in camp when Turgur's hits) no matter who the tank is.  It is the most efficient method imo.  I feel a 75% slow landing ASAP does more for group mana efficiency than anything else in a grinding session.  It is often the difference between the cleric casting 2-3 Cheals or just one (if any, some tanks will only need one every other mob) on the tank per fight.<br />
<br />
Torpor easily offsets the damage I take during slow aggro periods.  It is just a matter of training the clerics NOT to spam heal me unless I say &quot;resist&quot;.  All the normal mobs will not do enough damage on me in the time it takes any competent tank (class does not matter) to pull the aggro back.  With decent Pally/SK tanks, they never lose the aggro in the first place, so this is a non-issue.  <br />
<br />
As an aside, the only times I want a cleric healing me is when slow resists, and generally that's only after 2 resists.  It is tough to train pick-up clerics to do this sometimes.  SCRM extended Torpor is an extremely powerful spell. :D   Coupled with our mana regen capabilities, it makes more sense for me to cast Torpor 2 or even 3 times (at 600 mana cost) than the cleric to even cast one extra 400 mana Cheal.<br />
<br />
As far as positioning goes, since I'm on the glue-factory pony, it is more convenient for the tank to stand next to me than for me to go to the tank.  But I'm flexible enough to just do the moving myself if they won't listen to reason.  Though I do miss the old &quot;invisible horse&quot; trick to get around the movement handicaps.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Greater Immobilize is a great spell for us to use when grouping with those tanks who are aggro challenged. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Don't see why you'd consider yourself &quot;busted.&quot;  :)  I read here from time to time, wanted to say hi and wanted to share a small amount of what I learned with the shammies.  :)  The basic thing I wanted to share was hybrids are the best pullers for shammies who want to slow on the inbound.<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm trying to get back into the game.  I just keep dozing off after dinner (when you are on).  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I'm betting defensive for a reason..having a problem with 75% of the tanks he comes across does indeed seem to be a personal problem moreso than a tank problem.<br />
<br />
Learn to manage your aggro Tappion, I realize that being a low 50's shaman(you said/implied that in another thread I was reading) you are not used to having that aggro matter so much as in PoP. <br />
<br />
Get a little more experience and you'll soon learn when you can cast what, and all those tanks you have problems with will likely have suprisingly large improvements in doing their job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Here is my take on it. <br />
<br />
I always malos on inc (I just /ass the puller and as soon as it is in range I cast unless they feign then I interrupt, though rarely do feingers even pull). It's not as fast as getting slow on right away sure, but it really doesn't take up too much time. Since most if not all of the 5 seconds are taken up during the inc run, all that I lose are approximately 5 seconds at most for refresh + slow. I very, very rarely get resists this way. This of course changes some on multiple pulls depending on size and group make up and so on.<br />
<br />
If I get beat on, I don't care since the mob is slowed. If it's a SK or a Pally, I don't get aggro and that's fine. If it's a warrior, and a decent one he gets it off relatively fast (and then keeps it for the rest of the fight which is nice). <br />
<br />
I usually go on to cast 1-2 shots of Tears of Saryrn depending on mob health, mana situation and whether or not I have to redo any buffs, usually Ferine Avatar or SLTW. If I have to heal as well then I don't rain as much either, unless the tank is superbly equipped and quiescence keeps up on it's own. The rains rarely if ever give me aggro, regardless of tank.<br />
<br />
The problem I see is slightly different. I have noticed almost no difference at all in pally/sk/warrior tanking. There are bad ones and good ones for each class but on the whole they don't seem much different to me. Now pallies can often stun, and shadowknights tap so this reduces the healing needed for them even more. Most clerics seem to leave themselves room for error (which makes sense, since an unlucky round could result in 1000+ damage taken). This usually means that the HP difference between warriors/sk's/pallies is negated. At least these have been my observations on average. When I heal, I never heal for full HP anyway so the max hp makes little difference.<br />
<br />
Given AA's and nice new 2handers (or nice old 2handers) the damage output of the warriors is approximately equivalent to that of a knight. In some cases shadowknights have a clear advantage with a pet, dots, taps and so on.<br />
<br />
Now given paladins have useful abilities such as stun, group heals, fast heals, and root; sk's have useful abilities such as feign death, group mana/lifetap, snare, and various attack buffs. Warriors have.................<br />
<br />
Unless defensive is needed, or the level of both warrior and mobs that you are fighting allow for a considerable advantage in warrior mitigation (one that is not offset by cautious clerics) then warriors are at a loss even without aggro issues. This is why I don't see why they should have so many problems with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">BTW outside of getting the VT hat, is there any way to increase torpor/quiesence past SCRM levels (50% if I remember correctly)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
Just thought I would share my views on shaman agro management in groups.<br />
<br />
If I have a warrior as the MT in my group I will not slow until after the warrior has engaged the mob. Warriors have superior hitpoints and defensive skills to hybrid tanks so can take the extra unslowed pounding without any trouble. By doing this you give a warrior time to build agro.<br />
<br />
If I have an SK or a Pally as the MT in my group I will slow the mob on incoming as SK's and Pally's have far superior taunting ability to a warrior because of their spells. SK's will snare and Pally's will stun, both which give them instant agro control. Personally in EXP groups I much prefer having a hybrid MT over a warrior.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />
