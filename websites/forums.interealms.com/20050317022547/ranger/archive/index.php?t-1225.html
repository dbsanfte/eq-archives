A diploma is generally considered a bit better than a GED by most employers.</div></div><hr />

Neither business nor collages look at the GED and diploma as being equal. I have seen some businesses require diploma only. Getting your GED wasn't good enough. This in a manufacturing setitng wher you run  a machine 8 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I would have been better off with a GED instead of a diploma.<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
because I was a LAZY biotch in highschool.  I was sharp as a tack, very smart, but LAZY.  That lazyness is reflected in my barely passing every quarter grades.  I passed my freshman english class by ONE point.  And I did that by getting a 99% on the final exam after getting publicly reamed by the teacher who didnt think I had it in me.  I am now in a situation where those grades could put my hopes for a career any time this decade right down the toilet.  If I had maybe , gotten my GED instead of trying to squeak a diploma out with those grades, maybe they would look at it diferently at a colege.  As it is, I think I screwed myself BADLY, check out my good ole RL help thread for details lol :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nearly 1/3 of my graduating class in public scholl already had a record. Yes, some people use the GEDroad to &quot;make points&quot; with their  parole/probation officers. This may be the rule rather than the exception but even if it is, theres alwas exceptions to evry rule.<br />
Some of us here on the Glade are parents and old enough to know  from experience that a diploma, while prestigeous, really doesn't represent anything more than the fact that you completed 12 or more years of compulsitory education. <br />
If the educational system were to actually do its job, then maybe we wouldn't be in the straits we are in now.<br />
Even today, if you are a &quot;jock&quot;, you are passed whether you have earned the grade or not. Its not quite as prevelant today as it was just a few years ago but still, it does go on. This is not an indication of knowledge. How many of us have heard the stories about the basketball/football players that went on to college withoout the proper tools? No reading skills, no mathmatics, nothing. They were just there.<br />
A GED on the other hand means you have garnered at least enough learning to pass the test. What you do woth that knowledge afterwards is up to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tirunedeth</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sad but true story, a company I worked for before took very specific precautions when dealing with people that had a GED.  If the person was 18 or under when they got the GED, they wouldn't get the job. They were seen as someone that was either looking for a shortcut , was a quitter, or  was in some kind of trouble. People that recieved a GED after 25 were generally given a job. They were seen as someone who may had made mistakes when they were young, but they show ambition in overcoming their shortcomings. Anyone in between was handled on an individual basis. One of the worst parts of the job, and the state has a policy that says you don't have to say why you are not hiring someone.</div></div><hr />

I didn’t say that a diploma necessarily demonstrates any knowledge. What I said was, a diploma demonstrates a persons ability to ‘stick with it’. <br />
<br />
I think employers like to hire people they know have some drive. It’s the same thing with a college degree. Lots of people barely use any of the skills they learned in college on their jobs. However, employers hire college grads because they know that these people have what it takes to succeed.</div></div><hr />

He started college before he finished high school and never bothered to finish high school (or get a GED) once the college accepted him.<br />
<br />
For the great majority of the kids around, sticking the course and getting the diploma is the way to go.  You never get called to explain why you chose to get the diploma instead of go for the GED.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, imo the diploma is better.  No it does not guarantee a perfect student or worker but GEDs are a variation from the norm and thus many people (employers) a leary.<br />
<br />
Tymoria, I doubt that a GED would have helped you.  Most likely it would have hurt.  As was stated before, some colleges do not accept GEDs.  Besides it  would not have solved your main problem.  Laziness.  <br />
<br />
I was exactly the same kind of student.  I never did homework or took notes in class.  I could still ace test (except in math were the repitition of homework is required) in most subjects just by picking up what was taught in class.<br />
<br />
Moving on to college with a diploma was not the problem.  Continued bad study habits were.  Unfortunately it carries over into work habits also.  I am a hard worker and very technically proficent in my job but I struggle with the paper work portion. :(<br />
<br />
Opps, my point?  It was better that you stuck with school till you got your diploma.  Its not just a peice of paper but with people like us you have to make yourself work at things or else we get worse.  We need every bit of exposure to working toward a goal besides something we enjoy ( I dont have a problem spending hours on educational things that I find really intresting).<br />
<br />
BTW I consistantly score INTP on personality test.<br />

<br />
66% of Graduating High school students cant even pass that GED test.<br />
<br />
Before I switched to a private school a few months ago, my public school had 3 articles about our schools sport star in the first 4 newspapers.<br />
I had a class with the kid once, he couldn't read for his life.<br />
<br />
I am a high school student on the brink because of medical problems, I just wanna drop out and I absolutely hate high school.  Problem is I get bitched at because I have so much potential bs.  I hate being labeled smart because I have high tests scores and excel if I try, but I just hate school.<br />
<br />
I hate high school aged kids.  The people I tend to befriend have always been older.  When I was 11 at hockey camp I never hung out with my age group during our free time.  I would always be with the 16-18 year olds playing basketball or fishing.  They even introduced me to porn (thanks guys).<br />
<br />
In every high school class I take 90% of the kids are just plan stupid or act stupid.  Few years ago before I kind of dropped out because of depression, I was in a class for 2 weeks and got more work done than any other kid who had been in the class for 6 months, and she only gave me .25 credit instead of the full credit, man was I pissed.<br />

My plan has always been win the lotto and retire at 18.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked, and you can be hired in our office with a high school diploma and no experieince. If you have a GED, our HR department requires 3 years experieince minimum.</div></div><hr />

It should be similar to a GED, but a little tougher.  This would make the Diploma actually mean something again.<br />
<br />
This also goes along with the concept of a College Placement test where a student must pass yet another test to get into college, and the test cannot be how big a check can your parents write.  Of course colleges could get around this by not accepting federal funding.  Yeah, right.<br />
<br />
Of course this would be violating the civil rights of the illiterate and stupid, but I don't really care.  If they can't pass put them to work digging ditches until they get up the smarts to pass the test or the willingness to go to trade school if they have the talent for that career.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, that's kind of an elitest, snobby attitude there.  I've got a friend that I went to HS with and he was just, well slow.  I don't think you could say he had a learning problem, he just didn't get it sometimes.  He works for the city now doing road work and the like and is one of the nicest fellas you will ever meet.  He doesn't make a bunch of money but he takes care of his family better than some people I know that make a good living.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with digging ditches or doing grunt work and it's insulting for you lump people that do that work into the illiterate/stupid group of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, someone has to dig the ditches, clean the toilets, work in the sewar plants, etc. Those are jobs that have to be done, and many of us would not be happy doing them.<br />
<br />
My parents were teachers for 30 years. I remember one time my mom came home talking about a student. She had an IQ of 80, and was struggling with even the most basic concepts. However, on the weekends she went to work with her aunt, who was a cleaning woman at a hotel. She LOVED it, and her number one ambition in life was to get a job cleaning hotels when she reached 16. She's 22 now, and that's what she did. She has worked at the same hotel for 6 years, and she's happy. If the work has to be done, at least it can be done by someone who enjoys it.<br />
<br />
The thing is, if you're not one of the people who can be happy in work like that, then you need a HS diploma. The GED is better than nothing, but hands-down a diploma is more respected than the GED by the majority of employers.</div></div><hr />

Back in the day my dad was in a car accident, a drunk driver nailed his car and it flipped 15 times...<br />
because seat belts sucked ass back them, if he would have had one on it would have severed his stomach, so they cops/ambulance said.<br />

My dad is very smart, so is his offspring, that is why he got in to UofM.  I could probably get a GED and still get into UofM because I can score high on ACT and SAT.</div></div><hr />

Here where I work you are required to pass an entrance exam to college to be hired.  BUT if someone with a &quot;Good Enough Diploma&quot; (GED) wanted a job here I would hire them,  but I would only give them &quot;Good Enough Money&quot; for their wage: Minimum Wage.  I believe if you cannot stick to your schooling to get your Diploma you will be trying to find an easy way out on the job and wont be keeping up with your end of the employment bargain.  I see people that don't get a Diploma as lazy idiots that cannot commit enough energy to studies to even better themselves.  Schooling is not for anyone except YOU,  and you are the major person that will benefit from sticking to regular schooling and getting your Diploma.  There *MAY* be a few instances where something happened to a person in their life that warrants them dropping out of school and trying to get their GED but I think those are extremely few and far between.<br />
Tell anyone that you know that is thinking about going for their GED to put the crack pipe/joint down and get to school and get an education.  Mommy and Daddy wont be able to take care of your lazy butt  forever.<br />

After that I moved from the place I had lived my entire life, lost all my friends and some of my family and was placed in an entirely different state in a new High School and started my Junior year all over again. <br />
<br />
I was not challenged at all in High School. I was not placed in any advanced courses. I was in reading classes with people who could barely read; I had been reading flawlessly since I was 3 years old. I was marked as having a college graduate reading level in the 3rd Grade, yet I somehow was not able to get into advanced classes for reading or other subjects when I came to High School (I still had extremely high reading skills). I was that annoying kid that corrected all the words you couldn't pronounce or read and the same kid that the teacher yelled at for correcting HER.<br />
<br />
So by the time I came to this new crappy High School I began becoming a truant because of my depression and poor attitude toward adapting to this change that was forced upon me. I had no friends anymore, no life, my girlfriend dumped me for moving so far away and basically everything had gone to ****. <br />
To top of it all off I was bored because I was being lumped together with the untalented kids so interest in education had no redeeming factor, because I was being 'taught' things I long since mastered in Elementary school or Junior High. My pet term for 'High School' became 'review'. All Hail the USA. Where you can be all you can be.. as long as you place yourself on the same level as the lowest common denominator.<br />
<br />
I waited it out for 2 months and turned 18 then never returned to that High School again and then sought my GED/HSED.<br />
<br />
To put it in perspective the above happened in the span of about 1 year. That was probably the worst year of my life.<br />
<br />
High School just didn't work for me. I was thought to be lazy, and some may still think I was lazy, but I know the truth.</div></div><hr />

I graduated highschool right when the IB system was coming in.  IB means international (cant spell this next word) bacheloriate (back-a-lore-e-it).  Its like the new AP, classes span 2 years, with an exam that covers both years at the very end, they have all these insane reports etc to do.  When i came to college i met some kids that were entering college as sophomores becuase of their IB diplomas.  Not all highschools are a joke.<br />

Diplomas (whether right or wrong) are looked upon better then GED's.</div></div><hr />

Bingo.  I have had some emotional / medical problems so I wanna drop out too.  I came back to school and they took me out of my AT/AP/Honors classes and what the hell?  Our own superstar athlete, he had 3 articles about him in the school paper in the first 4 editions, CAN NOT READ.  He is mr. popular superstar yet he CAN NOT READ.<br />
<br />
He is getting his high school diploma and HE CAN NOT READ.  Tell me how his diploma is worth more than if I get a GED?</div></div><hr />

Here where I work you are required to pass an entrance exam to college to be hired.  BUT if someone with a &quot;Good Enough Diploma&quot; (GED) wanted a job here I would hire them,  but I would only give them &quot;Good Enough Money&quot; for their wage: Minimum Wage.  I believe if you cannot stick to your schooling to get your Diploma you will be trying to find an easy way out on the job and wont be keeping up with your end of the employment bargain.  I see people that don't get a Diploma as lazy idiots that cannot commit enough energy to studies to even better themselves.  Schooling is not for anyone except YOU,  and you are the major person that will benefit from sticking to regular schooling and getting your Diploma.  There *MAY* be a few instances where something happened to a person in their life that warrants them dropping out of school and trying to get their GED but I think those are extremely few and far between.<br />
Tell anyone that you know that is thinking about going for their GED to put the crack pipe/joint down and get to school and get an education.  Mommy and Daddy wont be able to take care of your lazy butt  forever.<br />

When you say someone who gets their GED is someone who is lazy and cant get a high school degree you are stereotyping.  Not a safe assumption on why someone got their GED.  Dave Thomas got his GED... at the age of like 63, but he was a hard worker and built a huge corporation.</div></div><hr />

pretty damn sure this sentence SHOULD say:<br />

<br />
First of all, due to the fact that I recieved my degree while in the military, the little checkbox on my DD214 (Official Certificate of Discharge) next to High School Graduate is marked YES.  There is no distinction between GED and actual completion of high school as far as the military is concerned.<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that any prospective employer asks to see my DD 214, I am always at liberty to mark high school graduate on any application due to the supporting documentation.<br />
<br />
Also, I think Tamaar is correct.  Most applications ask for highest level of education.  &quot;Some college&quot; is often one of the choices available, use it if it applies.<br />
<br />
Michaell, there is another type person who holds a GED.  One who quit high school because the system fails to challenge them sufficiently to hold their interest.  Often these people continue their educations later in life, after seeing a need for further education or because they desire closure to their educational experience a degree can bring.<br />
<br />
A GED can be an attempt to hide criminal behavior but isn't always.  Yes, the military does note the distinction between GED and diploma upon initial entry.  However, after serving one enlistment, those career fields that were initially unavailable will now open.  <br />
<br />
A person with a GED will not go far without hard work.  They have to prove their abilities and be able to back it with experience.  I gained those abilities and experiences in the Army.  I returned from an overseas tour just as my former classmates were wondering how to spend the summer after graduation from high school.  As they were finishing tech schools or associates degrees, I was using the knowledge I had gained in the military, at a price, to land jobs paying well above what they could get with a wet diploma.<br />
<br />
Now I am in a position in life where I let my certifications, education level, and experience speak for themselves, on my resume.  <br />
<br />
I haven't filled out an application for a job in years. ;)</div></div><hr />

Dave was an old timer and things were WAY different for people in his age group &quot;back in the day&quot;.  Todays youth are not pushed to drop out of school and work on the farm/get a job to help make ends meet for the whole family.  My rant was for todays society,  not the depression era society that Dave grew up in.<br />

<br />
The guy is saying how he is so smart in this IB program and how kids leave it and start as a junior in college.<br />
<br />
Well if he is so smart why can't he write a post using correct grammar and real sentences.<br />
<br />
If you are gonna brag how you are a super genius back it up please.  <br />
<br />
This shows my point lots of people in HS and special HS programs aren't too smart and GED people aren't all criminals.<br />
<br />
I am smart, I can say I am smart, but I prefer to say I am stupid, I act stupid, I don't talk right, write right, or do anything in the proper way.  I openly admit I am lazy as hell and that hurts my intelligence &quot;cause I have so much potential!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kairtane, congratulations, you've obviously done well.  Thanks for the information on military process, and truthfulIy, opening those classifications up after one enlistment makes a lot of sense.  The soldier now has a track record.  <br />
<br />
I didn't say that getting a GED marks you irrevocably as a criminal,  slacker, or idiot.  What I did try to get across is that the general perception of many, including many employers, is that the GED raises questions and shades perceptions in a way that a HS Diploma doesn't.  For that reason alone I favor those still in High School to make the effort to finish and get the Diploma.  You never have to explain to anyone why you chose to get a diploma instead of drop out of high school and get a GED.<br />
<br />
Still, even with your DD214 saying you are a High School Graduate, you could have told the truth on the job applications you did fill in, that you received a GED.  Instead, you marked that you were a high school graduate.  <br />
<br />
Why?</div></div><hr />

My point? This is the internet and you aren't being graded. No one except the meticulous or people writing professional documents bothers to proofread and use perfect punctuation and grammar. Attempts are usually made to spell correctly and use enough grammar to get the point across, but c'mon. It's shown you don't make an extreme effort either. Pick on something else please, you are making a fool of yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amdee</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, in some ways it takes a lot more responsibilty and maturity to take the GED than to follow the flock through high school. Think about a teenager without high school. They are likely overly bright and bored. They are obviously looking for more since they bothered to take the test in the first place, not to mention have the capability of passing it. They will now need to get a job or more education to fill up the time left. That's why they took the darn test, see?<br />
<br />
A lazy and shiftless person wouldn't be particularly motivated to take the GED. They might talk about it, but they won't do it without prompting. Let's face it, there are no educational requirements for being lazy and shiftless.</div></div><hr />

I am not going around claiming to be captain genius and how I am gonna go to college a junior straight out of high school.<br />
<br />
I am a lazy kid who doesnt wanna go to college and doesnt care about trying to act smart, I act dumb because that is how I like to act.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like someone was teased about being smart a few too many times.  That acting dumb stuff may help you get along with the kids you hang around with, but in the long run you're going to end up regretting it.  If you've got the tools upstairs, you'll go crazy not using them.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with a little laziness Slithe, sitting back and looking at a static problem before diving in to tackle it usually pays dividends.  Applied laziness is what leads to a lot of inventions.  That's the &quot;this is too dang much hard work, there has to be a better way to do this&quot; school of invention.<br />
<br />
But if you're convinced at your young age that being dumb and sentencing yourself to a life of assumed failure is better than getting an education and running the risk of succeeding, thats your choice.  Sunmoon was right.</div></div><hr />
