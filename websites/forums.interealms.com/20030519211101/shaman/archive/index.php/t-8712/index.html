<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings Ladies and gents.  My guild went to Fear tonight and I'm now carrying around the Tear.  My question is regarding the new 'dropped faction after turn-in' bit.  Is this only meant to curtail MQing of the Pigsticker, d'ya s'pose, or is it also so you can't just farm Woe/Envy/Marr's Promise your way through it?  Lemme give you some background:<br />
Started the epic at like 26 or so, fully intending to do the thing the whole way through.  However, for the longest time it didn't seem like I was going to be able to get my guild mobilized enough to do the Hole, and not a prayer of getting 'em into Fear.  So, I farmed Ghiosk and the Fools enough times to get Max Ally.  Well, we finally did the Hole, and I got my ring.  We finally did Fear, and I've got my tear.  My question now is:  since I'm at Max Ally now, am I still ok to skip Neh and just hand Rak the tear, in light of the recent faction change?  Does my faction get messed with only when I hand the scale to the dog?  I know many of you will just tell me &quot;you're right there, just do Neh too.&quot;  Will continuing to add to my already maxxed faction make any difference, or (again) is it only screwed with when I hand the dog the scale?  Thank you in advance for any information you can provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The whole point of the faction work-around is to skip Kirn in The Hole. Since you're already at max, you didn't need to kill Kirn, and you don't need to do Neh either.<br />
<br />
You can kill Neh if you want to feel good about completing that step. She drops a no-rent Key of Torsis that works on the elevator in the castle, but your rogue works just as well for that job. She can drop other loot too.<br />
<br />
No you can't add to max faction, because, um, it's maxed?<br />
<br />
The negative faction hit you're talking about happens AFTER you receive your Spear of Fate, and doesn't affect anything except preventing you from hearing the Spirit Sentinel's final speech when you complete your epic.<br />
<br />
Later in the game if you acquire another Child's Tear for MQ, you can easily go and rebuild your Truespirit faction back to max just like before, no problem there.</div></div><hr />
