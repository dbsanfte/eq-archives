<br />
Our level.62 upgrade spell to Strength of Nature, Strength of Tunare(SoT) has some stacking issues with the monk epic effect.   I had casted it on a few monks and they complained about it overwriting their epic effect.   I'm pretty sure this was unintended since the pre-spell to it doesn't have any stacking issues with monks.<br />
<br />
Well it also doesn't stack with BmB, and i haven't test it on it's upgrade but thats no suprise there since SoN never stacked with BmB.<br />
<br />
I just thought I'd bring this up.    Maybe we'd get a fix.</div></div><hr />

I can't use the spell to it's full benefits since it gets overwritten by BMB like 4+ times every raid. To a ranger or another DPS melee SoT is far more better than BMB, hell it's even better to most defensive melee's. 60ATK &gt; 100hp for the most part.<br />
<br />
They should make the spells bounce off each other, if you try to BMB a SoT'd melee he gets did not take hold message and vice versa.<br />
<br />
I'm quite annoyed that Verant pulls this stacking issue crap over Rangers again after have had been plagued by it with WP for over a year.</div></div><hr />

It is the same as SoN, which also did not stack.  I have discussed this with several of our monks and they would take SoT over their epic effect.  In fact one of them commented that the DKP price of Yelies head would probably go up now as they might as well replace their epic with GoDS.  I think the HL monks will be in the same position and probably find a replacement for their epic.</div></div><hr />

So?<br />
<br />
Monks im grouping with have bagged their epics when they are grouped with me.  15/20 and +60atk &gt; 9/16</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruvane Hammerfrost</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoT is an upgrade to SoN....age old stacking issues.  Many times I was asked for SoN from rogues who prefer the ATK increase over the HP increase with BMB.  Also, when a pally isnt around for a group, some warriors asked for this.  Now it is a group spell.  <br />
<br />
The more I play with this one the more I like it.  Yes, uses are limited but where it is useful, it is indeed useful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope Strength of Nature has not ever stacked with Monk epic that I know of.  <br />
<br />
Now SoN does stack with the Robe of Whistling fists or whatever, but CoE doesn't.  So pre-epic monks want SoN but not CoE.  Epic monks want CoE (if they even bother) and not SoN.</div></div><hr />

No stack by design, they're trying to phase out the overpowered monk epic that is still used 99.999999% of the time to this day by all monks who wielded it. <br />
<br />
Please enlighten me why this epic is over powered?<br />
<br />
Only reason why monks still keep their epic is for situational purposes, effect of epic is 40% spell haste and invaluable when solo/group does not have an enc/shm/bard. The attack bonuses are great as well in raids when every little dps helps.<br />
<br />
How many rangers here hit the destroy button on their Earthcaller and/or Dark Cloak of Sky? How many bagged Swiftwind and forgo the attack/haste bonuses even when your guild's capable of Emp/Cursed?<br />
<br />
As for the new SoT, personally I love it...clicking my epic button every 8 seconds blow chunks and is annoying. When my group doesn't have a person casting haste I still use epic effect over SoT just for the haste alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The monk epic is really only useful to soloing monks anyways since it doesn't stack with VoG or GoB/SoV/TheSpellThatCan'tMakeUpIt'sMindOnAName.<br />
<br />
The benefits of SoT are far greater.  <br />
<br />
Actually I have alot of paladins who want the stacking fixed since they prefer SoT and have to get it recast every time they BMB someone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my main concern is the stacking nightmare that PoP will become with group SoT, brells upgrade, and the beastlords upgrade, both of theirs are also group buffs, so whenever one of them decides to cast their it will overwrite ours on us and anyone else who has it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Utendar, I think that comment was half tongue-in-cheek but Verant really does appear to be trying to obsolete many things and move the players in a somewhat different direction than they have been headed in the past.<br />
<br />
And I think the &quot;overpowering&quot; comment applies to Swiftwind somewhat too. Both the monk epic and the ranger offhand weapon are useful far, far past where I think content designers expected them to be useful. Both are useful because they do things that are not replicated except rarely in other quality items for each class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakston</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is he's saying that it's over-powered in the fact that it's one of the few pieces of gear that never gets replaced.  Using that logic though, rangers are in the same boat.  With the gaining of AM3 and EQ, Swiftwind fills much the same role.  The innate ATK bonus and haste make it invaluable to me.  Add the effectiveness of Earthcaller while soloing, and one could make the case that rangers have the most useful and enduring epic in the game.<br />
<br />
By the way, hey Ute!  Tell Lunar I said, /bite! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess I touched a nerve. And to say you only keep a 100hp / stat / resist glove slot item (forgot about that didn't you?) for situational use is a farce.<br />
<br />
Anyway I will not waste anymore of the glade's bandwidth in a debate over monk ****, nostack by design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utendar</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya Dak! Lunar's been teaching the little one how to /bite so watch out, he just got his second tooth last week!<br />
<br />
I guess if by definition that if an item does not have a clear upgrade path, then you can argue that cleric epic is the biggest mistake by Verant. Yet by this junction of the game can you honestly see VI take this item out? Ragebringer, one of the easiest epic to obtain even back in Kunark era is still kept by most rogues today, because despite its inferior ratio, the attack bonuses allows it to compete with Luclin/Velius weapons.<br />
<br />
Yesterday a non tanking Pally asked my wife for SoT rather than keep his Brell on. It almost feel like the pre-Kunark days where it's more desirable to max DPS and kill the mob before it does enough damage to kill you. Anyone else remember the days where STR/DEX/AGI gear were consider the greatest and the best?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dangoon</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You would be surprised how many monks actually think their epic stacks with haste buffs.. they think they are over haste cap with it :)<br />
<br />
I have also seen many think that Monk Epic Haste stacks with Eye Patch of Plunder Buff..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solonaro</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BACK TO THE IMPORTANT POINT  :)<br />
<br />
Brells / SoT / Spiritual Vigor are 3 spells in the same line, you can only have one of them (depending on what combination of atk/hp you want).  They all should bounce off each other, simple as that.<br />
<br />
And when I say Brells, I mean both the level 60 and 65 versions.<br />
<br />
It took almost all of Luclin for them to finally fix Brells overwriting WP.  We all hope it won't take so long this time.  Anyone have any suggestions for the best way to get their attention on this issue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakston</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since they've already put the &quot;bouncing&quot; code in place for multi-stat buffs, I'd imagine the best way to bring it to their attention is using the /feedback command.  I'm sure by now they're aware of the problem and it's just a matter of prioritizing the fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deadman1204</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">would it also help to post on the main page? Considering how many boards verant has to read through, i'd guess they only read the general page versus all the separate columns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajalon</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least SoT is a group buff, which makes re-buffing easy.  Still, I agree with Solonaro, all 3 should bounce off of each other.</div></div><hr />
