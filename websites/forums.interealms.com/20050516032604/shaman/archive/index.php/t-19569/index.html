Kind of strange to do this now.. Hopefully these damage ones are made fast and cheap or have some other type of damage properties.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only one I see that might be useful from your list is the Ensnaring Concoction III.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">90% of alchemy is a joke. At first when I learnt about it, 4 years ago, I thought &quot;Wow, cool, potions..&quot;. Then when I actually was able to use Alchemy, I found out what a crap it is. And it still is. There are only few of potions which are really worth something, rest is just a waste. I'm getting the feeling that SOE has pretty clueless and fantasy poor people working there as content creators...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They could turn it into a debuff that makes units take extra damage from the potions for the duration they are on the mob for. Lets say you throw fire on it,  all fire nukes this this % percent more damage, same with ice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And no doubt they will cost 100pp to make  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi all :)<br />
Looks like rogue poisons to me &quot;subject is covered in a thick caustic fluid&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm willing to bet large sums of money these are rogue potions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Considering the fact that Rogues have throwing crits (deadly strikes) then the odds are high that they will be rogue usable. Rogue poisons btw are even more useless atm than alchemy products.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think they are a for the new class, its in line with what they said on the talk about GoD the other day.<br />
so just you dont have to make anymore strupid potions :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ensnaring potion ???<br />
<br />
Alchemy made ???<br />
<br />
No way it's possible or it's a dream :p<br />
<br />
My tought on this...<br />
<br />
1. It's some new poison for rogues<br />
2. It's some throwing weaps for BER/ROG/BRD<br />
3. It won't go live<br />
4. It's alchemy made but usable only by melee classes<br />
5. It's alchemy made but cost 1kpp a shot or use some supra rare dropped reagents.<br />
<br />
6. I'm an eternal pessimist and it's Alchemy made, usable by all and cost mostly nothing :p</div></div><hr />
