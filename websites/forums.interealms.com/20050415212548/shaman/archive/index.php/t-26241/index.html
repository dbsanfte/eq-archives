<br />
At least all but the roamer did not see invis =] so what if there are FD seeing mobs x5 that rush you as you zone in and are immune to shaman PBAE slow. Can't even cast it for the rune since the new awesome spell checks to to make sure they are slowable.</div></div><hr />

Try to target a mob(or hit ESC to clear your target box)?  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ancestral Aid shouldnt have broken FD either.  Direct heals do but HoTs dont.<br />
<br />
Perhaps mobs see through FD?  (Only King and Queen in RS do that I know of).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Perhaps mobs see through FD?  (Only King and Queen in RS do that I know of).<br />
<br />
RS King and Queen do not &quot;see through&quot; FD. I've done it myself on my monk. They do both see through SoS and see past sneak.<br />
<br />
However, the bombs are still triggered if your FD in the room.<br />
<br />
The only things I know of that ignore FD are the &quot;Death Touch&quot; chasers in Inku'Ta during Cursecallers and Noq events.<br />
<br />
A PC casting on an FD'er does not break FD either, ever. A player casting AoE on an FD'er does not break FD. <br />
<br />
A mob casting AoE's on a player will break FD (unless it's a monk with Stonewall, and they pass the stonewall check).<br />
<br />
[BTW, I play a 70 monk, 70 cleric, 66 shaman..]</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.<br />
<br />
You can cast any benificial spell on an FD'd person be it heal, heal-over-time, a buff, and that person will stay FD.<br />
<br />
You can cast it on them before they FD, and if they FD whilst the spell is still active, FD is not broken.<br />
<br />
This is exactly how I play my own monk/cleric in high end raids. monk pulls, FD's, someone tags, I heal whilst FD'd.. or.. cast HoT, monk pulls (and runs back being beated on), FD's to heal up a little with the HoT, then gets up and continues.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think is that the spiders cast an AoE that broke the FD.</div></div><hr />

Try it and tell me if you guys get the message. I didn't expect sympathy, now either I'm doing something wrong, or you guys don't know how the spell works...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, no PC spell breaks FD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You were targetting yourself when you cast Vindictive Spirit.<br />
<br />
And I don't know why you guys are arguing about FD. You're all saying the same thing.</div></div><hr />
