<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When soloing with a pet, I think you only get 25% of the exp if pet does all the damage.<br />
<br />
So do DoTs count as damage needed to get the 100% of exp? Sometimes that's all the damage I do. Or do I need to make sure to land a successful spear poke or nuke in addition to the DoTs in order to receive 100% exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have any scientific proof of this, but DoTs must count towards your damage. If not, it would be almost impossible for a mage to get any lvls. Just speculating(sp?)....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm pretty sure it's any damage. Even Clinging Darkness seems to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep.  Any damage.  Pre-newUI I tested this on rock hoppers, using AAXP so it would show more.  15 hoppers (slowed) with only Goner tearing them up was noticably less than 15 hoppers with me poking them once with my spear.<br />
<br />
Looked like I got about 1/3 the xp, but it could be 1/4.  I'd imagine some variance for different cons; I didn't go into that much detail, just went to satisfy that wonder.<br />
<br />
One-spear-poke hoppers seemed to give the same xp as the hoppers I just click the epic on and let Goner chew up.</div></div><hr />
