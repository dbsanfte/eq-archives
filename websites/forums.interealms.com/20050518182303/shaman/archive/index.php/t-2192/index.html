Hi,<br />
<br />
I wanted to take a minute to let you know about some pet upgrades that we've just completed. The changes are fairly significant, and we think they address a lot of concerns that have been brought up by players.<br />
<br />
Here are the changes we've made -<br />
<br />
Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures<br />
All pets now think of mesmerized creatures as being dead. Pets will not break mez, will not attack mesmerized creatures, and will forget any hate they had towards a mesmerized creature.<br />
<br />
In short, if a monster gets mesmerized, your pet will forget about it and stop attacking it. This is good for all pet classes, and especially handy for Enchanters, who can now trust their pets to not break every mez as soon as it lands.<br />
<br />
Pets are neutral to monsters<br />
<br />
Monsters will not attack your pet first. All monsters see your pet as a neutral creature, and will leave it alone unless your pet attacks something. This means if your pet wanders off, it won't bring a train of monsters back with it. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind, if your pet chases a fleeing monster, other monsters may still attack it. Your pet is only treated as neutral while it is not acting in a hostile manner.<br />
<br />
Pets no longer take experience in most situations<br />
<br />
In the past, pets would take a full share of experience if they did the most damage to a creature. We've changed this rule as follows -<br />
<br />
* Pets take ZERO experience from a creature, unless no player does damage to that creature. <br />
<br />
* Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature - if no player does damage to that creature. <br />
<br />
This means that your pet takes no experience from you or your group unless your pet kills a monster with no help from players. As long as you or your groupmates do damage to a monster, your pet will take ZERO experience.<br />
<br />
Due to the high potential power of dire charmed pets, they will continue to take a share of the experience. In the worst case, dire charmed pets will take a full share of experience - this is the same as it's always been. <br />
<br />
The amount of experience taken by a dire charmed pet scales based on how much damage the pet does. If the dire charmed pet is doing the majority of the damage, it's experience share gets larger. If you or your group are doing reasonable damage to a monster, a dire charmed pet will not take much experience. The more damage you do, the less experience a dire charmed pet will take. In most situations, dire charmed pets will take less experience than they did previously.<br />
<br />
As with all pets, if a dire charmed pet does the majority of damage, and no player does any damage, the dire charmed pet will take 75% of the experience from the kill. <br />
<br />
Overall, these changes are a significant boost to pet classes. The dev team has been hard at work on finding and implementing the right solutions, and we hope you'll enjoy these changes. Thanks for your patience as caster balancing continues, and thanks for playing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pet AA is now completely 100% useless, hopefully they will give the people who spent points on this skill theyre points back.  But regardless, it sure helps the rest of us, might hafta start that mage twink ive been thinking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, doesn't the AA skill just make it so your pet will not attack if you get attacked? That is still above and beyond the new pet changes. (Not that I feel the AA is worth it =\)</div></div><hr />
