<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zeludrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A couple nights ago I was in ToFS with a full group and getting above average exp (compared to what I'd be gettign with the same group in KC, DL or SOLB) so I'm thinking this dungeon probably has a pretty good zone exp modifier, but I havnt seen much conversation about it.  The problem is that many of the group I was with died a lot getting out (we didnt have an evacer so we had to get the meles out the hard way) and have no desire to return to this place. <br />
<br />
Since the exp seemed good, and I have an abundance of ITU potions I skilled up on that are simply not selling in the bazaar, I am thinking of attempting to solo ToFS, but if anyone else has done so, I'd appreciate some of your oppinions and experiences with it.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fozzi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes the ToFS is soloable, you just have to be careful.  There are several good guides out there about obtaining keys etc, so I'll just mention which mobs to look for.<br />
<br />
My personal favorite floor is the 5th floor. With the 6th floor being a close second.  Why you might ask.  No adds.<br />
<br />
To get to the fifth floor (assuming you have all the keys )<br />
  ITU through floors one and two, Before you click up to the 3rd floor, cast invis on yourself. Invis will get you buy all the mobs on 3, and most of the mobs on 4.  There is an &quot;ancient mummy&quot; on 4 that can see through invis.  Just con the mummies as you see them and you can easily avoid him.  Once on 5 your set.<br />
<br />
When you hit 5, look right.  This is the mirror our of the zone.  Looking straight ahead you see a bunch of ushers (about 10) and a wedding party.  I don't think you can single pull the ushers at 45, with careful rooting, you can take two out.  <br />
<br />
Once through the ushers, loot at the wedding party.  They will be a mixture of blue and light blue.  Pull them with care, and into the hall a little.  Pulling them into the hall will let you avoid the priest healing them.  Nosja and Daman are the only two mobs here the drop anything worth while.  (unless you want velium)  Each of their rings are lore, and the 5 wis one sells for up to 2k on Quellious.<br />
<br />
6 is a bunch of easy pulls if you stick to the dogs til about 50.  I won't say much about it.. fairly straight forward.  <br />
<br />
I suspect you died a lot on 4 ( as it is the hardest floor in there).<br />
<br />
Just avoid the relative and you'll have a blast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I talked to an epic mage who had Tsserina charm his pet.  As far as I know she still has it.  Just an FYI ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hippiefrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fozzi forgot to add that there are like eight Golems in between the spot you enter the 5th floor and the wedding party. Those can be single pulled just park your pet close to mirror and slow pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On the fifth floor, be careful about two &quot;odd&quot; things.  The first is if you click ANYWHERE NEAR the mirror near the &quot;zone in point&quot; it will zone you out of the tower.  Stay well away from it unless you intend to use it.  second, any of the golems and wedding party members can &quot;death spawn&quot; the enraged relative.  He is much harder than other normal spawns on the fifth floor, IMO.  Personally, for xp purposes, just move on to the sixth and have fun there.  So nice and quiet there.</div></div><hr />
