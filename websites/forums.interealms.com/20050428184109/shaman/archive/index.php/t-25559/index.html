Holy crap, it really looks like they are getting creative with this battleground system in Alterac Valley.  Who else is crapping their pants in anticipation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best part that i was really looking forward to is the last paragraph when they talked about the honour system. FINALLY something to stop red cloud mesa bloodhoof and senjin from being raided by level 55+ paladins.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I'm kinda disapointed that it is taking so long for the honor system to be put in.  Battlegrounds are going to be savage but I still want a reward for PvP outside of them.<br />
<br />
Last night, as I was roaming through the desert in Tanaris, I ran into a lvl 48 alliance warrior killing a ogre.  Feeling the urge for PvP, I helped him finish off the ogre, gave him a few seconds to heal up, gave him a few emotes indicating I was going to attack him, and started casting a lightning bolt.  He just stood there, so I fired off a frost shock.  He just gives up, and it's at that moment I kinda realized how pointless my actions were.  He'd rather take the death and run back 30 seconds later, than use up time fighting me.   So I just gave up, got back on my kodo, waved, and left him at half health.</div></div><hr />

If you play an outnumbered faction (like i do with the Horde on Elune) you can see that this will be one big zerg fest for the other faction.<br />
<br />
After the first win they keep control of all the important stuff (graveyards, towers, etc) so you start outnumbered and the other side has all the benefits (airstrikes, roaming giant, beefed up guards)</div></div><hr />

bingo!!<br />
<br />
Untill blizzard does something to even up the factions power and numbers, pvp in general is going to be heavily, heavily dominated by the alliance, their main class is too easy to play and too powerful, there is too many of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, it sounds completely stupid, sounds like there will only be one instance? Queue times?<br />
<br />
Prediction, within a few hours, 90% of the servers horde base will be in flames.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was under the impression it would be like other instances, a raid group sized force per instance, but if just one then forget even goddamned getting in, the unemployed l33t guilds once again win, man that pisses me off.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i have noticed that it takes far less horde players to kill the alliance invasions. About 60% i would say. They are more but horde is more skilled. They actually had to PLAY and WORK for their rewards not be handed xp just like that. And we don't have any class that is as easy to play and as overpowered as the paladin. Shamans are powerful yeah but they don't come close to what a paladin can do. <br />

<br />
It sounds like Blizzard is addressing the numbers issue:  <br />
So we do have a cap on the number of people on each side that can enter a Battleground. Rest assured we want the two sides to be fairly matched.   <br />
<br />
As to the rest...how would you like to see it work?  <br />
<br />
Also, I wouldn't draw too many conclusions about the details yet, and I'm sure they will tweak the system as needed once it's implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How it should work is, multiple instances, so groups of friends can go in together, some of the guilds at least on my server are huge, and they have been in BRS and strath and such for weeks now farming uber gear. They are always on, assuming unemployed or college, they will likely be kicking ass in the battlegrounds, getting even better loot, repeat.<br />
<br />
Then it will be FoH type guilds vs the working man all over again. Sorry, I will not stand a chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the highly coordinated/geared guilds are all on one side, I agree...so, the question is, are there enough elite guilds on the Horde side to make this system workable?  Keep in mind that the npc's will help balance things out.<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm not saying the proposed system is perfect...all I'm saying is Battlegrounds sounds like it could be great if implemented properly...and I personally have confidence in Blizzards ability to implement quality content based on what I've seen of the game so far (up to 39 now.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The quest with the most powerful reward, though, requires you to gather the blood of fallen enemy players for your side's chief spellcaster. On the Horde side, as revealed a few weeks ago, the ranking shaman asks you to bring back the blood of Alliance players. The quest actually needs to be performed by dozens of players, as the shaman requires hundreds of blood samples to be brought before him. When enough is returned to him, he summons an Ice Lord Elemental, which then begins a rampage of the enemy base.<br />
<br />
<br />
ok this sounds bad ass.</div></div><hr />

it aint even happened and your crying about the impending end of the world. This aint sony. I reckon you should give it a chance before slamming it. <br />
<br />
Also you are right it does seem to be aimed at PVE servers to give them an opportunity to explore PVP more. And they had good reasons for reassessing the honor system. e.g. high level players unable to defend themselves from low levels without being penalised. I imagine they are working on an appropriate solution.<br />
<br />
I for one can't wait to get in the battlegrounds =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
might want to think for yourself a little there man. Never said the end of the world, I am dissapointed, because I know how game companies work, we all do.<br />
<br />
As to high level players being unable o defend themselves, do you honestly think it is a tough thing to code that if a lower level player attacks you, lower levels are flagged as fair game? not at all man.<br />
<br />
My biggest beef by far is the goddamned queue system, who do you think is going to be able to get in? The wroking guy getting home at 5:00, or the college kid who has been playing all day with 150 of his guildmates? not gonna go home and wait many hours, to even have a chance at getting in, waste of time.<br />
<br />
You say this ain't Sony? I see them doing the exact same things, overpowered classes, holy trinities and uber guilds needed for higher end content,not listening to customers, doing the same thing as DAOC as well, Alliance = Albion. PvP base is a huge section of their community and they are dumping on us.<br />

<br />
I know how it works, and it is still stupid, to have to wait in a queue, regardless. Also, it is not impossible, it is quite easy to have multiple isntances, filling up as the other ones get full, no worse of an imbalance there than if the original is one sided.<br />
<br />
So wait a few hours, to possibly get to try the battlegrounds, while the normal pvp system has been scrapped, ya, that's not anything like Sony eh?<br />
<br />
Carebear Cappi? Can you imagine the utter carnage and lag that is going to happen in the zone in for battlegrounds on pvp servers? hehe. Will be interesting. No good being able to enter if you have to run a gauntlet of 400 Alliance or Horde denying entry, and this will be standard practice. Entrance to this zone is the one in Alterac Mountains by the way, in the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You're doing the crazy dance again where you change positions all the time. To answer your question, no I play on a pvp server, yes I know where the entrance is, and no, I doubt anyone will take over the tunnel. It's guarded by fast spawning 55 elites making it not worth the effort. You know, the kind that respawn in greater numbers each time?<br />
<br />
But yea, one thing I do agree on are that queues suck. Still I can't think of a better way to ensure the zerg doesn't win every time. Besides its going to screw the alliance way more than me since they will be the ones waiting in the endless queue due to their higher population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Change positions all the time? Hardly. Tunnel I am talking about has nothing in it, nothing at all, either I am wrong or we are talking about a different tunnel.<br />
<br />
The zerg will win everytime, you know that as well as I, and I think the Alliance will have a much easier time, take out enemy boss forts? Easy, 25 paladins go in, immune when they need, no one dies.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds should have been raid type zones with maybe 50 people tops in each side for each instance, where you can go whenever you want.<br />
<br />
When I get home from work usually, is like 40-75 level 60's, alot of which are from the same guilds, in BRD, BRS, Strath, they will be in the battlegrounds now. Unless the cap for it is like 500 people each side, it is gonna be ugly.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think you're unclear on the purpose of the queue. It limits the number of players per side that can enter. Meaning there can be no zerg. Both sides will have the same max number of people in the zone. <br />
<br />
The tunnel entrance is off the road leading from Tarren Mill up to Alterac. There is a guard outpost directly in front of it. Worst case you might have some rogues and druids sneaking by, but I doubt it will be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I know it limits the size, doesn't matter which side doing it, it will be zerg. 100 people assaulting a fort? That is zerg.<br />
<br />
I thought it would be lke 50 people tops a side, able to communicate, etc, that is more fun, you play DAOC? IF you did you know what I mean about too many people screwing up the meatloaf.<br />
<br />
Just pissed really regular pvp is out the window.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am getting too worked up, between the lag and broken promises I get EQ and DAOC flashbacks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&quot;We definitely are aware that the experience can start to degrade if the Battleground is completely packed with several hundreds of players; the sides begin to lose cohesion, individuals feel less able to contribute to the whole cause, and the potential evolves for a lop-sided affair. So we do have a cap on the number of people on each side that can enter a Battleground. Rest assured we want the two sides to be fairly matched. However, if you have to wait for your turn to enter the Battleground, you can still adventure in the rest of the game world before you are summoned to fight. Our goal has always been to create the optimum experience, and so we will continue to tweak the numbers till we feel we've got an epic, yet manageable, conflict that is fair to both Horde and Alliance players. &quot;<br />
<br />
is direct from the site. I guess I'm confused why you think there will be any kind of zerging going on. As long as one side just decides not to show up I can't see how it would be unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Cappi, listen very carefully what I mean. I do not mean zerging as in 500 people on a side, I mean the simple fact the way the game works, zerging, even 50-100 people on a side, will prevail.<br />
<br />
It will not be small group tactics when you go to take a fort, GY, etc, it will be &quot;rally the 100 people in the zone, charge, let lag sort em out&quot;<br />
<br />
Understand where I am coming from now? You are on a pvp server, are 50 vs 50 fights fun?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">is direct from the site. I guess I'm confused why you think there will be any kind of zerging going on. As long as one side just decides not to show up I can't see how it would be unbalanced.<br />
Like Mill said, you limit both sides to 100 and one side just mindlessly throws itself against the other instead of completeing the content in the zone ... this is still zerging.  Not debating who is right here, but you two have different definitions and fears of zerging.<br />
<br />
That said, I think that Mill is wrong on the zerg bit.  Eventually, one side will say ... change of plans ... we use 80% of our guys on such and such a defence and send 20% out to complete the following quests ... It takes less guys to fight a holding action than it does to zerg a base.  Eventually the side that gathers the most NPC avatar support (ie: the elemental/ancient tree, airstrikes, shreders, goblins, ...), or strengthen's their NPCs the most with the supply runs are going to win assuming all other things are equal.<br />
<br />
This is what nails me ...<br />
&quot;Enemy players might choose to resurrect in the tunnels leading into Alterac Valley and harass your side's players, but as the entire zone will be firmly in your control, it will be difficult for any opposing players to mount any sort of effective counterattack. Instead, they will have to wait for their base to rebuild itself.&quot;<br />
... which suggests to me that the only way to really win back after you've had your virtual ass handed to you is to hide out in the ent and gank/camp reinforcements/replacements.  Personally, I'd rather dig the navel lint out of my hairy navel than corpse camp after the main fight has been lost.  A win this way would sort of feel like the reigning track and field world record holder getting gold at a high school track meet.  I might be reading this all wrong, but that's how it sounds to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The base regenerates over time - so even if you get beat down you can still hang out raiding camps, and I would assume grabbing supplies in order to speed up recovery. <br />
<br />
As for the zerg thing, its addressed right under the paragraph  I quoted. A ton of mid 50's elites, plus a commander, plus two towers filled with archers that have crazy range. I think they have the zerg well in hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Cappi,<br />
<br />
come on, for real, how do you think those towers and elites will be killed? Mid 50 elites are candy.<br />
<br />
Zerg. gather your 25, 50, 100, whatever, and DAOC style charge. Or do you think somehow small groups will take out those towers and commanders?<br />
<br />
I was hoping for smaller group tactics.<br />
<br />
And yes, actually encouraging instance camping is just stupid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I do think there is plenty of room for small group tactics. Through the side quests and graveyard charges. From the description the archers will outdistance everyone on the field with their range weakening the approaching army. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it does sound like fun.</div></div><hr />
