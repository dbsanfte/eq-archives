<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've looked through a lot of the posts here and I just can't find anything really good to solo, so I'm asking for some suggestions.<br />
<br />
I've soloed a Cliff Golem, a Guardian Wurm, Sol Ro Protectors, WW Dragons, Droga named, and some other smaller things.<br />
<br />
I would have had Zelnithak without Alpha Pet, but it just took WAY too long (20 minutes per 8 percent) so I let others help out seeing that I could keep up with his dps, AEs, and keep his hps slowly going down.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for something more challenging.  Loot would be a bonus, but not needed since it's all about the challenge now.<br />
<br />
My magelo is http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=245107.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try Trak and let me know how it goes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">try stuff in GoD my necro friend solo'd a mob in GoD that hit for 1300 and summoned...he he he</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Trak seems like a good idea, but I don't think it's possible with my gear/resists/ac.  I can't put out enough damage to kill him fast enough to avoid respawns, his lifetap (if he still has it), and his AEs.<br />
<br />
I've thought about GoD mobs, but I have heard horror stories about shamans attempting to solo them and it not going good.  A necro soloing a mob is way different than a shaman.  They have more dps, FD, and a pet that can take and deal damage.  I may give it a shot though just to see if I can pull it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">KT+ mobs are soloable as long as they dont summon and are rootable.  Just like any other root park mob.  Not really a challenge.  A challenge would be to solo the ones that are not rootable and/or summons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tried any Kunark dragons besides the aforementioned Trak? Gorenaire, Ragefire, Severilious and the skyfire one would all be challenging, some more so than others. Of course finding one up is also a challenge in itself!<br />
<br />
Not a solo mob per-se, but tried doing PoFear solo? That's good fun, not really all that hard with your gear I'd suspect but its a good blast! Don't think there are any soloable named there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">These days I avoid exp groups like the plague. In my limited playtime I like to go solo mobs or places that were once unthinkable.<br />
<br />
Severilious<br />
Ragefire (when ppl need him dead for twinks)<br />
That dragon outside of Kael<br />
Drusilla Sathir (in HS)<br />
I like to solo in VP. G Wurms are just fun to slaughter.<br />
Enraged Disciple in Cazic. (Mob itself isn't that hard, but breaking the room is a real challenge. Insta click shield from inventory is an awesome loot.)<br />
Green pool in Cazic. I've made 50 AA's alone camping the sorrowsong boots for my twink.<br />
Soloing all the way to the top of the pyramid in Cazic 4 corners area. (This is a lot harder than it sounds.)<br />
<br />
There are probably other mobs or places that I'm forgetting.</div></div><hr />

I been thinking that shield of striding would be awesome for PvP.  I am gonna have to try soloing in CT for it.  Sounds like good fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On the magician site there is a nice list of soloable mob, with tips and listed in charts. <br />
Can be a fun idea to do, divided from pre-ele equip, ele or time equip ...<br />
just my 2 pp</div></div><hr />

although, balance of the nihil made it really trivial.  kinda tricky tho need to hope for a quick tash proc either way and it does take forever.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gorenaire is fun. Do that and you have leet hoss dragon kiting skills. (that was a hint)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You're not soloing Trak hehe. <br />
<br />
One lucky port and you are down in the shrooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wish I could get a shot at Gore or Zland, but they are perma camped I think.<br />
<br />
Thinking about Trak more, if you sit once you are banished you'll be summoned back right away.  The problem I have is that a necro I know attempted to solo Trak and died many times.  It's really not a possible fight for a shaman due to our dps.  If a necro can't kill him in a decent time there's no way we are going to.<br />
<br />
Found out that ToV mobs in HoT can be down with time, but I'm KoS to CoV, so that's not going to be a constant thing.<br />
<br />
Kunark dragons are usually dead too.  The only one that I've seen up is Trak since he's out of the way.<br />
<br />
Still going to look around and hopefully come up with something good to solo.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the suggestions so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Don't rule out Cazic Thule. Its a good place to solo, with some decent droppable gear available there, with the FT3 boots still pretty high up on caster wishlists.<br />
Umbral Plains still has some decent loot up for grabs too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Get 2 other people, preferrably bots, to let you zone into an LDoN.  Attempt to solo the zone and win the adventure.   Ruj is the easiest to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I haven't attemped the spirits in UP, but should be easy to do since I can tank and kill 3 mobs at once there and soloed Zelnithak down to 92% in 20 minutes.  Going at that rate it would've taken over 4 hours to kill him and I wasn't up for killing 1 mob in 4 hours.  Not that I couldn't keep up with it's dps.  I started the fight at full mana, had a bad pull and had to split everything using the zone to get Zelnithak solo which put me at around 50 mana and I was regening more during the fight while keeping myself near 100% hp.<br />
<br />
Doing a solo LDoN in the time limit could be hard with the time limit.  I don't think going in with just shaman buffs I don't think I could put out enough dps to win.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule was easy to solo in although I haven't tried any of the nameds.  I did camp the boots, but gave up after a few hours with no named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">HoT mobs are cake, they take me about 35 percent of my mana...<br />
<br />
It's fun splitting the pit, can get some decent twink gear.  Got a leather bracer and a silk robe last time I was there.  It's just super boring cause of the long respawn time.  Could always wander around a bit, I just hate the wyverns, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Kind of late to these &quot;solo&quot; discussions, but I was looking for advice as to what mobs I could possibly do with my current gear.  I will go through Cliff Golems and Guardian Wurms, but I think that I can do them pretty easy at this point.  What would be the next challenge that I could attempt?<br />
<br />
My magelo is pretty up to date.  Raid buffed I'm right around 5930 hp and I think I have 4400-4500 mana.  I have all spells except for GoD ones.  I have 92 AA's (none of the defensive ones yet).<br />
<br />
Any adive would be appreciated :), looking to test my skills hehe.<br />

<br />
<br />
Think no more! Get a new playerwindow UI from eqinterface.com and see your mana numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I did! Hehe, I downloaded the files that Juujuu posted yesterday and I use the player window he had.  I browsed EQ Interfaces and didn't find any I liked better.  I guess I wasn't sure how exact those numbers were, though, but if they are right, with my best gear on, I was at 4537ish :).<br />
<br />
As an aside, I was horrified to find out that pallies in my guild are 4k+ mana (similar stage of gear as me, low tier PoP, Ssra stuff)... grrrr, figured we had them beat by more than that.  I was embarrassed when I had to admit this when a wizzie told me I should have 2 times the mana pool of a pallie... we don't! <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">paladin mana pools are so close to ours, why else do you think we bitch about them being better healers ...<br />
they come very close to our healing, not HoT but blast and they get group heals .</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah :(<br />
<br />
In fact, as a class leader, I am usually made a group leader in raids.  I always pick a pallie for my group to help heal the nasty AE's we get :).  I often go OOM trying to heal up my whole group during say, The Cursed cycle, in Ssra.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, still looking for specific advice on what mobs people think are doable with my gear right now :).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Did you solo that Protector of Ro completely self buffed?  I have pretty much the same AA's you do per your Megalo if it is updated but like 20 more.  My gear is below yours giving you more like 1k more hp and 200ish AC.  I have never beaten one Using a self buffed dog, one in reserve, unbuffed, fully self buffed only, and spirit call 3,  I can get them down to about 15% or so before I gate out as to not die lol.  I can solo in PoF quite easily all but the not rootable jopal gathers (Mephit looking) things.  Maybe 1k more hp and 200 AC make up that 15% difference.  I prolly could do it but it would be hella close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Lodi in Ice clad is fun, hes easy to do though for us :) since hes slowable but he does summon so thers some challenge in him.<br />
<br />
I wana try and solo me Serv, but hard to find him up and track him with shaman track :/<br />
<br />
The sewers in Ct is an awesome place, i usually cheat and grab a virt before i head down just to make it easier on myself :) i dont like the little mossies though and there damn life taps and resists :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Don't bother with Trak.  You need to be superbly geared to stand any chance.  He does proc a 1500 lifetap quite often.  If your magic resist isn't over 400 self-buffed, you won't resist many.  <br />
<br />
Me and a druid, both Time/GoD geared, tried to duo Sontalak.  He's easy once slowed, but the self annul he does is annoying.  We had to evac after getting him to about 88%.  A group of Time geared people can take down Sont easily.  I've soloed 3 regular (Esopra, Draazak, Derasinal) WW dragons at once.  The ones that are resistant to cold or poison I end up using Illuminated Hammer (Time Lapse proc) on and I just melee them dead.  I think I've soloed everything in WW except Sont and Harla Dar (probably doable now, but I'm scarred from a previous group attempt on her over a year ago).<br />
<br />
Vaniki in DN is a challenge I think.  He's very resistant to magic-based spells and he procs a 500 lifetap like crazy.  I've tried him a few times and had to use instant gate potions to escape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Caghina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Soloed Talendor last nite, using ice nukes and pet, was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Soloing all of the chardok royals is pretty fun. Getting down there is easy; you can invis past the majority of mobs and VP3 a summoning mob past the locked doors.<br />
<br />
Killing the overking + 8 trash mobs at the same time = fun fun :)<br />
<br />
Just remember to bring an insta cast gate potion.</div></div><hr />
