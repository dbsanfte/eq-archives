<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They are little tiny things!   The panda seems to get tired and lay down and catch some zz's if you stop moving for too long.  I saw quite a few snoozing panda's as I was running around last night.  The zerglings and mini-diablos didn't take naps from what I saw.  Of course, the people with those never seemed to sit still....maybe the pet was chasing them :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is it one pet for one character one time or do all your characters created on a CE account get pets?</div></div><hr />

Welcome to two weeks ago? :D<br />
<br />
Barm, each character created on a CE account has a &quot;gift certificate&quot; item in their inventory that has to be turned in. Each character can choose which pet it wants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Valgoth.<br />
<br />
I picked up the CE version last night but the 20meg patch took all night on dialup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was curious if the pets interfere with targetting or are they similar to a Wizzie's familiar in EQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The CE pets DO show up on Hunter tracking (at least the Panda does when Track Beasts is active). Kind of annoying, but not a deal breaker. I suggested on the official forums that they tag CE pets as something other than &quot;beasts&quot;. We'll see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Faern.  I gave in and treated myself to the CE.  You can use TAB to target the nearest enemy and I do not believe that the CE pet interferes with this at all.  However they ARE targettable so if you mouse click to target they could get in the way, though so far I've had no problem as I have not found it getting in front of me, mostly off to the side and behind or under me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So, how useful are the pets ?<br />
<br />
Do they have special talents, e.g. root the mobs, ala mage earth pet in EQ. ?<br />
<br />
Or are they just eye candy ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Basicaly I'm asking, are they worth the extra $ to get the collectors edition ?<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, I'm a euro, so I can't play yet :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Eye candy.<br />
<br />
Personally the biggest selling point of the CE was the artbook as I've always loved the stuff that Metzen and Didier in particular do for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't forget the Cloth map too :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh the only thing that is a little annoying is the size of the zergling :P<br />
Too darn small but he is cute. As is the panda. but the panda sleeps too much. When u stop to do somethign and then turn around you see the zzz's :P<br />
<br />
I never got the Diablo if you ask me it doesn't belong in this game. I mean the Zergling at least LOOKS close to a felstalker. If you ignore the size.<br />
