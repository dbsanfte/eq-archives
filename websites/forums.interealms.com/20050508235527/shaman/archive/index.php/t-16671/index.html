<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Disclaimer: Before anyone says search is your friend (i've noticed it tends to be a common reply) i have and not come up with anything conclusive...maybe i'm typing in the wrong search string but nehoooo if you even thought about typing that you are hereby summaraily slapped ... /slap   :D<br />
<br />
Anyway...level 54 shaman who is starting to pick up pop flags with AA's. Ok i only have 2 AA's atm and runspeed always use to be the 1st thing people said but with the new dungeon sow's  what would people say now.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I still say runspeed 3. I rather have that than mess with the casting of the indoor stuff. PLus other stuff can be dispelled,  Run3 always there.  <br />
<br />
I did regen 3 after that was way before i had torpor and was going mass regen at the time. Still dont know if i would change it. Nothing else grabs me that much in the first 6 points.</div></div><hr />

run3<br />
regen3 or metabolism3<br />
mc3<br />
c5<br />
Get those first in that order.<br />
<br />
Those indoor sow type spells go about as fast as run3.<br />
But they need a buff slot.<br />
And they need mana to cast them.<br />
And you need to keep refreshing them.<br />
It's just a hassle.<br />
They are really only meant for the level 50 and below crowd that can't get run3 yet.</div></div><hr />

Could not agree more...<br />
<br />
And after that just get 1 in each of the archtype AAs, best bang for the buck IMHO. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Totally agree with what has been said above. Shoot for Canni 5 as it really is a huge help. Run 3 is logical for 1st 3 points anyawy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OK, I'll be the dissenter.<br />
<br />
I would go for Run1, Regen3, then spend 2 on STA or something else.  Reason being that Run1 is enough to outrun MOST mobs... and how often do you really run from the mobs anyway?  Add SOW and Shrew to the mix and the odds that Run2/Run3 will actually be useful to you are low.<br />
<br />
After that, MC3-&gt;C5 is your path.  I took time out to get RC1 first because I raid a lot, and I haven't regretted that, so that's up to you.<br />
<br />
After C5 I spent 3 AA's on VP1, which hasn't been as useful as RC1 despite costing more, but it's kind of nice in certain situations.  Now I'm heading for MGB, again because I raid a lot.  SCM/SCRM will be next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">after canny 5<br />
<br />
SCM 3<br />
SCR 3<br />
SCRM<br />
Quick buff 3</div></div><hr />

Spending any aa's on stats at that point is a mistake in IMO especially now. Stats can all be maxed out with gear especially with augments now. Need more wisdom throw some +6 wis augments in a couple peices and add more wis. Need more sta? throw some sta in other peices. Once you can cap stats from gear those points spent on innate stats becomes worthless.<br />
<br />
There are really only 3 things worth spending any aa points on in general initially. Run 3, regen 3 and metabolism 3. I'd probably recommend run 3 and regen 3 especially if the poster doesn't have stoicism yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cheers for your advice....i will go for run3 but i am torn between meta3 and regen3 ......i have stocism and i use stat food when i'm not on my lizzard and non stat food when i am....a few points here or there makes no diff to me... /shrug  i have never found that i am running out of cash cause of the food. Nehooooo thanks again... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My path:<br />
<br />
regen 3<br />
run 3<br />
MC 3<br />
Cannibalization<br />
RC 1<br />
SCR3/M<br />
MGB<br />
QB1<br />
CA3<br />
LR (still working on this one, will go to 5)<br />
<br />
After this, I'm looking at SC1, VP3, bumping RC to 2, ND3, and QB2 in some order or another.  After that, probably some healing-related ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted... but how often are you running somewhere invis with no SOW or Shrew on (assume you get Shrew to make up for only having Run1).  If I knew I was running invis at Run1 speed I'd be sure to put SOW or Shrew on to compensate.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Run3 is more convenient, but you could get something more beneficial if you're willing to put up with casting Shrew.<br />
<br />
Actually I agree with taraddar, though, now that LDON and the augments are out it's not really worth spending AA on stats.  Hadn't considered how easy it is to max stats with augments.</div></div><hr />
