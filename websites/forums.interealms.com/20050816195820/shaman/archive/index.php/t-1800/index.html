<br />
I think I've seen him twice in my 3 year EQ playing time...<br />
dropped his scarab ring: 2ac 2 all svs.. sucks by todays standards, but I remember back in the day when people made a big fuss about it :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hah! I have looked for him a few times for the hell of it. Never found him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Who is that? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He is a really really really really really really really really really rare spawn mummy I have seen him and killed him once in north ro and I think he can spawn in oasis but I am not sure about that. <br />
<br />
Kaid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sordar Spiritrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lol, same thing happened to me, gave his ring to my monk twink, think i sold ring to a merchant in the end or somthing /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I remember doing an allakhazam search for resist gear and lusting over that ring. I even printed out the page for it. ;) Never did go to try to spawn him, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've seen him ONCE, about a year and a half ago.  He was already being attacked, though.  Dropped the sceptre.  A ranger named Zaph on Bristlebane has several of them.  He told me Rahotep always spawns at the beginning of a game year, dunno if it's true or not.<br />
<br />
Speaking of rare spawns in Ro, I killed that named armadillo there about a year ago.  Something or other &quot;Digger (Dune Digger, perhaps?),&quot; I don't feel like looking it up.  He dropped some piece that I assume goes with a quest, but I couldn't find the info on it at the time.  Anyone know what he's for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i know dune digger to drop a 15ac/9sta shield, pretty darn good of a lvl 15 mob.  Hes almost as rare as rahotep though.<br />
<br />
And i do believe it is at the start of a new year in eq that he spawns, and since you have about a window of 3 minutes until hes discovered, hes pretty darn rare.<br />
<br />
i also believe he spawns somewhere between the undead camp and wall-derv camp</div></div><hr />
