<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i did yeldema the other day, and that wasnt even hard at all, and even though i just got the crappy talisman and some crappy spell, i felt really accomplished, and now i'm looking for more cool mobs to solo.  i'm wondering if we might make a list of things to solo in a ranked order of difficulty, something like:<br />
<br />
Yeldema (easy)<br />
Lodizal (medium)<br />
Guardian Wurm (insanely hard)<br />
<br />
just a thought - anyone have some other mobs to add worth soloing for fun?<br />
<br />
Jag, 60 Shaman, SolRo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>haze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would rank Stomples as Medium - Hard on your scale.<br />
<br />
Stomples total dmg output was 11,005 (29.3dps)<br />
Kantik total dmg output was 6,642 (16dps)<br />
Took 701 melee from me<br />
Took 8,272 from JBB + DS potion<br />
Took 5 Bane Of Nifes = 9,885<br />
Took 6 Spear of fates = 7,200<br />
Took 2 Pox of Bertox = 5,010<br />
Total dmg taken by Stomples = 37,710 approximately (70dps)<br />
*assume Spear of Fate is 1200 each<br />
*assume 20% dmg increase for Extended Affliction 3 bracer<br />
*fight time was ~9mins<br />
<br />
