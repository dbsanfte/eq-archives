<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zone is great graphics wise.  Having fun.  Exp sucks worse than an envy thread in here though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll be bored halfway thru the first clearing.  by the 5th clearing you'll wonder if it's possible to be bored to death or if that was just a euphemism?  <br />
<br />
But risk/reward in that zone is the best of any zone outside of elemental planes . . . and VT still is probably equal if you count quantity over quality.  <br />
<br />
My guild is on our 6th clearing, and has racked up over 200 pieces of VT loot so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not bored yet.  Only 2 shaman 1 enchanter on raid.  I'm the only one with Malo although 65 Beastlord is in attendance but doesn't have the 65 slow spell yet.  Ranger said all the yard trash should drop lucinite orbs which had everyone rolling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the VT clears now, especially since they don't take nearly as long.  Before they messed with the boss hp and whatnot was worse, nothing like sitting there for 45+ minutes while people hit the same buttons.<br />
<br />
I love raiding though, and don't really care for exping, so that may have something to do with it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe, VT got to be boring fast, although it is great for loot. But you know that people start falling asleep and just afking along the way when no matter how many people are in attendance, whether it be 45 or 80, it takes you almost 7 hours exactly to do a complete clearing....every single time hehe. Anyhow, soon as we had elemental access, then VT was no longer an option. What really sucked was clearing VT when all those stupid casters cast AE blind (think it was AE, I don't know for sure since I couldn't see any fookin thing to be sure. ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The loot is nice but the endless clearing of trash...ugh<br />
<br />
Breen needs to be shot, drug out and shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Great Maul of Slaughter, Gorget of Superiority, Umbracite Bracer so far.  Working towards 2nd named on 1st floor now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Usually we just coh straight to the blob and work forward from there.  I can't remember the last time we did the first 2 named in the zone.  We've got about 4 full clearings under our belt, but enough loot from about 8-9 full clearings.  We just seem to get server resets and stuff on our first day of raiding each time we go in there.  For example,  a while back, we did coh to blob, and camped out for the next day cuz of patch coming.  We killed blob and about 20 minutes into crawling the zone, we got a SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE of the servers coming down for an update.  Back to blob room to camp out for blob #3 in 2 days.  Weeee.<br />
<br />
Something you'll learn to &quot;love&quot; is orb of sky!  Everyone needs one!  I swear that one mob drops it every kill.  Give us something good for once when we take the time to kill ya.<br />
<br />
What would be really nice though, is a second point in zone that's safe to coh into.  In order to kill AHR, which is the target of every VT raid, you have to clear stuff for about 10? solid hours, and that's not even hitting all the named mobs along the way.  After having been into the deeper sections, a bunch of the stuff off blob is probably going to be rotting soon enough.  The evasion orb last time that dropped went to a random unguilded non-recruit invite.  Being able to skip a few hours of mob clearings would be sooo appreciated for us peeps that didn't get the coh straight to ahr phat lewts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh people who are just getting into VT have it easy ;)  No AE Blind, Tons of HP on trash mobs and even more on boss mobs... but either way, fun zone one of my favorites... especially graphics wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Deacis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On a very good day, I think its possible to solo a few of the mobs in there... Just remember to get the FD ring from PoSky... :p<br />
<br />
/hides... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've specialized in finding out just how many poison dots i can stick on the nameds before i get summoned and squished. The clerics have started taking bets and extra prices goes to whoever tosses me a quick heal so i survive a second longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">lol asta. All the shaman used to race to see who could get aggroed and summoned and killed the fastest...thats how boring VT is hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On the second day in, I've discovered how much Warders suck.<br />
<br />
I don't have time to dot since most of the melees seem to be asking me for Boar/Soul during the encounters.  Only died about 12 times yesterday.  I'm right up there with the pullers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Best spell during boss mobs is Torrent of Poison, or whatever the 64 Rain Ae is(cant remember the name atm) you can really deal some massive damage with those.  Get in a MW group and kei+ you can almost just dd constantly with barely needing to use can5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I made it thru an entire clearing without dying last time.  <br />
I was quite impressed with myself, since I wasn't really trying to avoid death, it just sort of happened.  Specially since I was trying to max DPS on some of those bosses.  Blob is specially good for this cuz you can use rains to your heart's content.  Alternate Torrent and Tears for constant punishment . . . to the blob and to your manapool haha.  Still haven't figured out if that is more DPS than chain nuking with Velium strike and some focus items.  When you figure in the resists, it might be pretty close.  <br />
<br />
Most of the time during clearing tho I'll just be swinging away at the add caster types with my mace, hopin for a proc or three to help drain their mana.  Not a ton of help I guess but I'm ready for adds in that position.  Least I'm not AFK . . . guild had to make new rules about AFK specifically for VT lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For max damage output on fights like Blob, I have Breath, Pox, Blood, and Tears memmed, and use my epic.  I can go about 4 minutes absolute maximum chaining every damage spell I have, and usually get summoned into death at the 3 minute mark.  I'm really getting the feel for what the breaking point is.  Last time we did the sheild diabo, I was in the midst of typing to my group &quot;I'm gonna get summoned soon from my dots&quot; when I got summoned for too many dots.<br />
<br />
The first few times in VT you get chewed up pretty well.  Now when we go in there, we barely ever wipe at all.  Each shaman needs a real healer (dru/cle) in group that's on the ball and can heal him when he's in trouble.  I used to malo everything before slowing to avoid resists, but currently I find the resist rates aren't bad, and don't bother with a malos unless the initial slow is resisted.  I've actually gotten to memming tirgir on our clearings.  Popping off an AE slow on a train of 6+ mobs coming into camp and making it out alive is a nice rush.  It's nice saying &quot;4 mobs slowed&quot; about 5 seconds into the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">VT is soooooo boring...<br />
<br />
We have a little game with the other shaman..<br />
each mob that summon you gives you 2 points per summon.<br />
each time a cleric need to heal you it's 3 points<br />
each time it's a CH, you get 4 points<br />
and all death gives you 5 points<br />
the hard thing is to not be cought by raid leader :p<br />
They always wonder why the 4 shaman are dead during aten goo1 fight =)<br />
<br />
Only during named fights tho..<br />
<br />
There is only 1 pull I like in VT... the last 14 mob before temariel.. We always end up with all mob mezzed/tank mezzed in the room ) this is the only part of VT that is not boring like hell.<br />
<br />
I have way more fun in elementals than in VT atm.<br />
At least you can crawl in plane of water with 1 or 2 groups for fun/xp and some ok loot... you can't do that in VT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">blob room safe spot is nice.  <br />
We have an uber necro now and a killer rogue team.  <br />
On second thought, I'm not continuing this explanation LOL!  It's too good to give away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You mean necro FD to blob room, rogues user supersneak to drag everyone there, necro 93% rez's someone, and you start from there Land?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Theres a much easier way than bothering with that method lol.<br />
<br />
And yes, a single group can kill things in there.  We took a group up to one of the dead Diabo's and was able to kill everything we pulled, with a monk.  The one eom we found was quite a hard fight though, so its not exactly a cake walk.  We didn't try going around further, simply cause one group couldn't kill fast enough for the spawn rate heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We just leave a cleric camped in blob room.<br />
Kill a mage.<br />
Drag the corpse to blob room.<br />

Coh to blob.</div></div><hr />
