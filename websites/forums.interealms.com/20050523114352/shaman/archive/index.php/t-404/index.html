<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is great to hear, I was even stealing agro from my monk (50% of the time) after waiting 5 seconds to let him get agro. <br />
I could wait a general 10 seconds and he always kept agro but I'd end up using more mana to heal em due to the extra damage. <br />
<br />
Be nice to be able to slow the mob before it gets to camp again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail All,<br />
<br />
That's good news!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Excellent, I wonder if they got my letter to them about it?  I only sent it like 2 weeks ago or something . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">woohoo! I thought something was wrong...or I was slackin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok .. so... umm now that you are aware of most shaman deaths because of slow. FIX THE *%^% Channeling skill!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Amen!  Or give me back my alt exp points I wasted in your useless channeling skills.... oh yeah retroactively made useless.  <br />
<br />
  Nothing like wasting 12 alt exp points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Please explain. I was about to burn 4 points into channeling 2.  How is channeling broken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">While they're at it, I'd like them to seriously look at resists.<br />
<br />
Recently, while grouping in both Cazic Thule and Maiden's Eye, I was unable to land slows on mobs that had been both tashed and maloed, while watching the chanter land slows on them even before I'd cast malo. It's exceedingly annoying when this occurs, cos it removes my primary function in a group. It's even worse when the chanter is the type who insists that there's no need for a shaman, cos his slow is only a little less good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gorslam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Glimmer Drakes + ID + POI (with like 29 disease counters now?) = Much pain TT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I bloody well hope they change the agro on slows very soon. I died at least 5 times in HoT because slow didn't stick AFTER maloSINI and tash was in.<br />
Also it struck me when I died because of a resisted slow the Chanter slowed it without worries.<br />
<br />
At least I got my bracer and am now only missing 3 pieces for the full set :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">camping 3rd floor of ssra the other day, clerics finaly gave up on the warriors and made myself the main tank for  the night, was kinda fun not having to worry bout my helath and just standing there doing nothing after slowing each mob</div></div><hr />
