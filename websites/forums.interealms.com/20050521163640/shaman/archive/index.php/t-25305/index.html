<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, its not intended to be an oxymoron, but I have been running into some wierd occurences since I re-activated my account.<br />
<br />
1.  Camping out in Innothule Swamp- coming back 5 mins later and logging in at the Bazaar. (didn't die, was bound in PoTranquility)<br />
<br />
2.  Headed out to Droga.  There are three goblins that con blue to a 65, scowling, can target but can't cast spells, and they don't aggro.<br />
<br />
3.  Logged on my mule to sell and 28k is gone.  Didn't buy anything, didn't transfer any money.....<br />
<br />
1 and 3 sound like someone else was on my account, but (A) no one left has my PW and my account had been deactivated, and (B) there was not enough time to log on my character while I was away.  Is Everquest bugged? or is there some wierd exploitation going on that is screwing with the servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the goblins are probably epic related.<br />
<br />
As far as missing cash, I have a guildie that came back yesterday and was missing items. Nobody has his log in info either.<br />
<br />
Cant say about loggin in at Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Something similar happened to me. I died in WoS near the MPG zone with the rest of my group. I consent the necro that FD'd and sat in the nexus, where im bound, waiting for a drag and rez. I'm waiting for about a minute and i get a rez box. &quot;That was quick&quot; i think. I pop up in WoS at the zone line to NC. A cleric sitting there saw my body pop there. The rest of my group was still dead near the MPG zone. The necro didnt drag, i didnt consent anyone else. It just poped there after i died. Never happened again but it was wierd. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The other day when my group got ported out of the MPG trial we had done, I appeared outside the 'north' LDoN dungeon entrance in Everfrost.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When zoneing out of the sewers from rcod I thought I was going to end up in rcod of course, but nooooo I end up at bind point in halas.  I mean that must be a bug, I had well over 100hps left and only 3 of those stone guys hitting me, hell one of them was even slowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Naw, but I have had quite abit of lag lately and slow zoneing, /shrug perhaps I should just defrag or something though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">About half a year ago, while soloing in droga, I had low life and gated out. Somehow I left XP and gear behind, even though I didn't get the slain message.<br />
Sometimes when I take the mass TL in Ssra I end up at the entrance instead of my bind point. /boggle</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this one is related to having a second TL hit you while the first box is still up (or gating with a TL box up). At least I think that is it, I have had this happen to me a couple of times also (in various zones). Never bothered to test it to make sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's happened many times to many people... when you have low HP's and are about to zone, you can still sustain damage and still die, even without getting a slain message.  It has been this way since I began playing EQ and nothing is likely to change.<br />
<br />
I am however, completely convinced that there are many bugs in EQ that cause plat in the shared bank to &quot;go missing&quot; and items to disappear.  <br />
<br />
SOE has headings that can be reported in the customer service section of a petition covering these specific areas.<br />
<br />
I have had both plat from the shared bank in the past and as of the Dec 15th patch my not so uber range slot item go missing.<br />
<br />
Still nothing back from the folks at SOE though.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shezam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok this is a weird one..<br />
<br />
I was in PoS last night with a group of guildies....BST, CLERIC, 2 X Necros, RANGER and Myself.... we were hunting for the beard to complete the BoT key?<br />
<br />
The Ranger pulls mobs towards us......send in pets....BST is tanking....all of a sudden out of nowhere come the mobs other 4 friends....We were going down fast...BST shouts &quot;Gate&quot; we were being slayed!!! I tried ot gate and mob starts hitting on me, fully buffed i have 4k hp.... Gate fails and i see health going, but slowly.....all of a sudden out of nowhere i FD'd????<br />
The rest of the group died, so how did i survive? I was left with 30% health, watching myself lie down, then i see a msg, &quot;your enemies have forgotten you&quot; When they had walked past me, i stood up and gated....<br />
<br />
Seriously can anyone explain how that worked??? I should have died!!! Not that i am complaining, just curious.....<br />
<br />
Shez<br />
<br />
Edited as i had said PoF instead of PoS dohhh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow.... that sounded cool.<br />
<br />
I have been dropped to purple (negative hit points) and had a heal land from another player and was saved.  The strange part was, I stayed flopped and off of the agro list.  I didn't get a message like you did, but similarily lived through the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gate fails and i see health going, but slowly.....all of a sudden out of nowhere i FD'd????<br />
<br />
This one is actually not a bug, the Sea Giants that drop the Beard have a FD proc, and you just got lucky with the timing. Actually that can be kinda fun, seen warriors pull singles there by (accidentally) FD splitting. :)</div></div><hr />

Did you float and/or had a horse active, when you died?<br />
<br />
Exactly the same happened to me a few weeks ago with levi and horse on and got (probably, not sure) stuck into geometry at south wall, where i died. Corpse popped up at NC zone-in in WoS.<br />
<br />
My guess is there is some scenario, when EQ cannot figure out where you are actually located and drops you at succor spot(?) as last solution.<br />
<br />
After some similar weird experiences i try to keep floaty off, when on horse and vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, that explains what happened to me then. I had horse on, cant remember about levi but its a decent chance that i did have it on. Thanks Sharok  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The gating to the entrance is something that you've been able to do for a while now.<br />
<br />
What you prob did was you got the TL box to leave the place, and then hit your gate spell.  When you do that, it is just like succor, sending you to the entrance of the zone always.</div></div><hr />

now that is funny stuff. you ended up in a totally different era of eq lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Couple months ago I camped myself and my brother out while in VXED.  When logged in the next day I was standing in front of the tomb dungeon entrance of the BB LDON.  My brother was the only one with my info, so I message  him &quot;why am I in Faydark?&quot;  He says &quot;I don't know, but why am I in Everfrost?&quot;<br />
<br />
Best I could figure is the game put us at default LDON spots when we tried to log into an expired instance of Vxed.  Wierd stuff.</div></div><hr />

Hmm this is interesting.<br />
About 9 months ago a few K pp dissapeared from my shared bank account.After petitioning etc i got a response stating that SoE will in no way redeem pp lost from the shared bank account.<br />

that exact thing has happened to me at WOS,,,only me, no one else. if i gotta have  bug i LIKE that one =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sounds like what used to happen, where folks would camp out at one end of SG, and log back in at the other end. Remember that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ya, i remember that Sam. I also remember that i could never get it to work  :mad:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">To get it to work you needed to &quot;ghedo succor&quot; as it was called by those that instructed me on the fine art of doing this.<br />
<br />
SOE changed the way that we log out and return to the play area.  You may notice now that when you log back in from gameplay that you are facing a different direction.  The premis of the &quot;ghedo succor&quot; was to log in and out about 3-6 times, moving slightly ahead each time when you log in, sitting down imeadiately untill you would zone into the game in the wall and then you would be bumped to the succor point.<br />
<br />
There are many bugs still out there, and some of them are even being fixed along the way.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, as an update, My lame range item was refunded tonight about 3 hours after I made a CS Ticket.  Very fast CS these days... perhaps they have some more time on theri hands.  So, that made a very happy Troll.</div></div><hr />
