<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ixiilblat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, my main is a lvl 45 Wiz and I was wondering if anyone could give me suggestions on equipment I might be able to get/quest for a new frog shaman. I am not looking for things to buy but things that I would be able to hunt/quest myself. All replies will be greatly appreciated as I have no experience with any kind of wis caster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know if you could do any of them solo, but if you take a group to Nadox, you can get a few nice pieces (see my profile:  Neck, bracer, shoulders, and coral ring).  Take a group to TT and try camping an Ikky BP.  Could take a group to Dok for some Nathsar gear and/or SBS.  Just off the top of my head...</div></div><hr />

where did the Coral Ring come from?<br />
I did a search, and all I cam up with was one with ery different stats, but it looked like it came from EQOOA ....  ???</div></div><hr />

The only equipment a Froggy shaman needs.<br />

Jumping the shark is the best saying ever.</div></div><hr />

Hey Ragdag, you don't by chance read T-mag do you?  That's the only other place I've seen use the quote &quot;Jumping the sharks&quot;.  It had me rolling there too! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I could be totally off base here, but doesn't &quot;jumping the shark&quot; refer to a way to get more &quot;ratings&quot;. Doesn't it refer to the &quot;Happy Days&quot; episode where they had Fonzie do a motorcycle jump over a pool with a shark in it? A way to get more viewers to tune in, this was when &quot;Happy Days&quot; was on a downward trend. I think it worked for a little while too.<br />
<br />
*edit* I think I am showing my age here....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That's it exactly, but the only other place i've ever heard that saying used was in an online e-zine called T-mag.  Maybe it's a more widely used  saying, and  I live under a rock or something.</div></div><hr />
