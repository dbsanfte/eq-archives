<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>I like shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi new to the Shaman class and fairly new to EQ have a 42nd Warrior main.<br />
<br />
My question is what spells should I load I'm 27 at the moment and cant seem to find a balance between spells and mana or maybe to many spells and not enough slots to use them in at one go<br />
<br />
Favourite trick is to forget to load root....after canni and regen makes for some interesting fights :)<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a nice easy list that I can load and stick to ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here is how I do it, doesnt matter on level, just load your best :)<br />
<br />
Solo:<br />
====<br />
1= Root (always always always root type spell goes here)<br />
2= Slow (always have my slow here, never ever swap this out)<br />
3= Disease Spell  (swap out for buffs)<br />
4= Poison Spell (swap out for buffs)<br />
5= Canni (never swap, I have a hot key for this one)<br />
6= Speed (swappable, may need a debuf here depending on fights)<br />
7= Regen Spell<br />
8= Heal<br />
<br />
That is the same no matter what Level I have been.  1, 2, 5, 8 never get swapped out, and reside on page one of my spell book.<br />
<br />
As you get better ones, simply swap them with the older ones.<br />
<br />
HTH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm, I can't quite remember what I had at level 27, but here's a good rule of thumb:<br />
<br />
1) Heal - never demem<br />
2) Swap spot - regen, nuke, dot, other buffs/debuffs as needed<br />
3) Swap spot - regen, nuke, dot, other buffs/debuffs as needed<br />
4) Swap spot - regen, nuke, dot, other buffs/debuffs as needed<br />
5) Root - never demem<br />
6) Slow - never demem<br />
7) Swap spot - regen, nuke, dot, other buffs/debuffs as needed<br />
8) Cannabalize - swap out with SoW as needed<br />
<br />
For 27, it could look like this:<br />
<br />
1) Healing - never demem<br />
2) Swap spot - Regen (with a 10 minute duration, better to just keep it up)<br />
3) Swap spot - envenomed breath (swap with stat buffs: agi/sta)<br />
4) Swap spot - affliction (swap with stat buffs: str/dex)<br />
5) Root - never demem<br />
6) Slow - never demem<br />
7) Swap spot - frost strike (swap protect and with haste later, if you're not grouped with an enchanter)<br />
8) Cannabalize - swap out with SoW as needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heal<br />
Poison Dot<br />
Disease Dot<br />
Slow<br />
buff slot<br />
root<br />
canni<br />
Spirit of the Cheetah<br />
<br />
SoCheetah saved me many a times when I was young and fighting outdoors, I think a lot of people overlook this spell, it's really quite amazing in outdoor fighting.  I think I kept cheetah up until 40ish when I just found other things more needy of that slot.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, that's what worked for me, good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Laylana Angelhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's my setup..the first two and last two slots i never change. <br />
<br />
1= SoW/Canni<br />
2= Heal (depending on situation)<br />
3= Regin (Pre-Torpor)<br />
4= Buff/DD/DoT/Gate<br />
5= Buff/DD/DoT<br />
6= Debuff/Buff/DD/DoT/Speed/Misc<br />
7= Root<br />
8= Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm I always keep Slow in the #1 spot, root is #2.  This way I never have to go hunting for it in the middle of the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Heals I put in 3 cause it's easy to reach from the directional keys (w-a-d-s).   All others go down from there but my first 3 spots are never swapped out.  I usually have Regen/Canni in the last two spots.</div></div><hr />

If you just leave them in the same spot long enough you can find them no matter where they are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>I like shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for all your replys and advise. Its really nice of you all to take some time to help :)<br />
<br />
Not gonna demem root in future, moved spells around seems much better!</div></div><hr />
