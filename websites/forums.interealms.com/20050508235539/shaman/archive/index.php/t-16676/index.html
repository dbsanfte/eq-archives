<br />
Type /testbuff and be whisked to level 25 and given a bunch of gear.<br />

For shamans.... mostly LEATHER!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grask: All the testbuff armor was modeled after 'Ye Olde Everquest' thinking in terms of stats and gear.  Every single set of armor is nothing at all what people nowadays would pick as their armor set.<br />
<br />
This armor is a flashback to what was good back in the first days of Everquest with a few Kunkark things thrown in here and there.<br />
<br />
Whoever made the armor selections surely didn't really have much of a clue, I grant you that ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are a few classes that get some pretty decent gear for level 25.<br />
<br />
SK's, for example, get a MOSS for their main weapon.<br />
<br />
Shaman gear is about 'average' compared to the other testbuffies from what I've seen.  The worst has to be wizard -- most of their pieces have no stat bonuses.</div></div><hr />

You're given gear... What.. you want it to be the best gear available?  <br />
<br />
Gimme a break.....<br />
<br />
Sorry, but just tired of seeing our server being ran over by a bunch of 12 year olds who don't care about anyone.  I am NOT saying that everyone is like that, as I have met quite a few nice /testbuffers.  But let's face it.. The anonymity given by /testbuff coupled with the fact that these chars are lvl 25 vs. a lvl 1 anon person is quite great.<br />

Yeah you do.  Some days, when you just need a break from your shammy but don't want to make a real alt, you can just /testbuff a whatever up to 25 and play for a few hours.  It's nice :)</div></div><hr />

Consider yourself lucky its only a /testbuff character. If SOE were really serious about testing they'd allow people to move their mains over to the Test server. That's really the most effective way to get more people involved in the testing process......</div></div><hr />

Actually, I disagree with this quite a bit.  While there are certain levels that test is low on, people copying their chars over really wouldn't solve or help anything at the upper levels for testing.  Test has its own raiding organizations that test things.  <br />
<br />
Would you really xp on test and then go back and xp on your normal server with your main character?  What would be the point?  Most people from prods like /testbuff because it lets them play another class without having to do the first 25 levels.  It is almost always a different class than their main for the fact that it is a different experience.. i.e. relaxation, fun, reminiscing.<br />
<br />
Want to know what would happen?  someguild_01 wants to kill ubermob_01, but someguild_02 already killed it (or they themselves did)and they are waiting on the respawn.  someguild_01 has everyone copy their chars over to Test, so they can have a 2nd shot at learning the encounter.  Meanwhile 20 other guilds just did the same thing.<br />
<br />
While in some ways, it sounds like a good idea, their really is a nice percentage of Test players who test stuff.  These people are the staple of test server testing because they are on the server every day and can see when stuff changes.  <br />
<br />
Biggest thing they could do if they wanted more things tested, or tested better, would be to have news or motd to test certain things.  They have them some of the time, but anytime they want something specific looked at, IMO they should have a /motd about it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got news for you... they have moved mains over.<br />
<br />
Entire guilds of them, in fact.  High-end guilds.  To &quot;help with the Testing process.&quot;<br />
<br />
Granted, you and I may not be able to do that.  A few weeks after Kunark came out I retired my 51 cleric and my wife retired her 49 bard (both in mostly full sets of Hate gear) and we started over at Level 1 on Test.  But those 'in the know' have routinely been moved with gear/etc to Test.<br />
<br />
Heck, we recently had a 65 necro with Elemental (including POFire) access get 'moved' to Test -- then when he didn't have any friends to play with and couldn't raid (since only one raiding force has Elemental access) he first farmed a bunch of stuff and tried to sell it, then quit.<br />
<br />
I believe most folks have a distorted view of the 'testing' process, however.  Normal Test server is NOT like the beta servers.  On regular Test server, GM support is minimal at best.  The server drops without warning, we get a patch (that's our sign something changed), we log in and see what happens.  Sometimes you end up naked.  Or level 60 with 0 AA's.  Or you find your shared bank account wiped.  Whatever.  And you start /bugging and /petitioning.  And if you're lucky, someone responds (in all fairness, when the major bugs happen, the dev's do go out of their way to make folks whole again).  If you're really lucky, they actually fix the /bugged NPC/item/whatever.  I once /bugged something every day for a full week before a prod patch, they pushed it to y'all with the prod patch, and the next day it was fixed.  My /bugs obviously hadn't been read, or it'd have been fixed before the prod patch.  (My point is, we normally have no clue what changed -- we find out the hard way.)<br />
<br />
So before you start trying to pull strings to get your main moved to Test, make sure you understand how Test works.  And realize that the population is low enough that a) your rep matters a lot and b) without some friends you won't be grouping.  Don't expect customer support or even a guaranteed server to play on.  Make sure you enjoy server drops without warning (you did force a save recently, right?  if not, there goes a night's worth of exp/loot).  And above all, have a sense of humor -- otherwise spending a good chunk of your play time in the chat room waiting for the server to come back up gets pretty boring. ;)<br />
<br />
And if you're going to play with the /testbuffies, please don't come to Test and expect everyone to hand you stuff.  You already got a free level 25, with decent gear and a full spellbook.  Take an hour to earn some pp in a newbie zone if you need to for spell components or food/drink.  Don't expect the long-time players to give you dragon lewts and such just because you have decided to play on Test... earn some levels and try to fit in first!  (You can easily make 100pp plus an hour at 25... go to any of the zones that have LOY dye droppers and farm them.  My favorite is Steamfont, kill the newbie kobolds, sell the hides and teetch, then sell the steamfont springs for 5-10 pp each in the bazaar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If they want something tested really well, just instance the event, and put it live. Then let everyone have at it. Nothing like having 100 guilds pick your event apart for you.<br />
<br />
The problem is that unless a bug is found that allows players to gain things they shouldnt be able to gain, SoE takes multiple months, or even years, to get around to fixing things. Best example right now is PoEarth. That zone is so screwed up its not even funny. We had 66 Dust Devotees up recently. Rings bug out easily after the first run through after server up, and typically stay bugged until the next patch. Mounts are also bugged so bad there. People leave the zone, and the mount stays. People appear to be walking inside of their mounts when moving. Illusions that work fine in other zones end up showing part of the inside of the face on your screen there. Arbitor pathing in the tunnel is horrid. He goes into walls and nothing seems to be able to get him back out, even though you can seem to hit him there. And the WORST part of PoEarth is that you cannot tell which rings are up and which ones are not without investing at least an hour of your raids time. And to finally get to the end and find out you get a lootless piece of crap place holder is just dirty. No other encounter in the game has this problem. None. Anywhere. But the idiot devs setup 4 of these rings like this in PoEarth. And have failed to fix this in 9 months. Are they incapable of fixing the crappy code they wrote? Or do they just not give a damn?<br />
<br />
And all of this is and has been live for 9 months. They didnt catch it and fix it in the beta, and they havent fixed it on live.<br />
<br />
And so many bugs that are reported on test end up on live.... Its like they dont care what test people tell them. Just shove that damned code on over and let  the 400,000 paying beta testers can have at it.<br />
<br />
However, they have gotten better at fixing broken doors. :cool:</div></div><hr />
