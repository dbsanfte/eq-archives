<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gallaena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've done some searching, and can't find my answer...<br />
<br />
Where is the most effective place to hunt in Fungus Grove? I have epic, fungi, jbb.<br />
<br />
Last night I thought I'd explore a bit, but made the mistake of attacking a Lotus something-or-nother.<br />
<br />
Could someone please give me a loc, or general directions from one of the 2 zone-in spots?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">anywhere where you find flat ground with a lot of room between dog dog and the patch.  My favourite spot is outside the camp where they sell the jum jum for the callers quest.  I park my puppy among the garanga like guards and slow and epic shrooms to it.  When I run out of shrooms on one patch, there is another nearby.  Most people I know prefer going way in the back towards the other zone line  (long day, can't remember which, sorry) so they have multiple patches at their disposal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hunt in the back near the Twilight zone. There are 2 patches there - a 6 patch and a 5 patch. I can do the 6 patch with MC3 and kei, 6 and 5 if I have Spiritual Radiance or PoTG on top. Once I get canni V, I expect to handle both easily.<br />
<br />
Finding a good spot isn't as easy as it sounds. For instance, there is one patch near the right on your way to the back, where if you stand near the wall, the shrooms go back OVER the other way down the hill before coming back. Talk about wierd pathing. <br />
<br />
Avoid the lotuses, and I'm not sure about the mutants or the gorangas. I should try conning them sometime to see how bad it would be.</div></div><hr />
