<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking of where I will be going at 44+.  After getting a JBB and lizard, wouldn't mana regen gear be the top priority?  I read that Flowing Thought gear stacks with each other (up to 15 according to some and no cap according to others).  2 Flowing Thought 2 items would add together and give 4 mana points regen per tick..(?)<br />
<br />
There are 2 obvious ways to get mana with gear.  <br />
<br />
1) Flowing thought gives 1 mana point per tick for each lvl of FT.<br />
2)  Using regen / cann, a 5hp regen per tick is roughly equivelant to a FT2 item; 10hp regen is ~ FT4 item...<br />
<br />
If this is the path I should be taking, which quests can I do to get some FT gear starting at about 40?  <br />
I plan to do the earring of solstice in the bazaar (i am picking up pieces that as they appear at cheaper than normal rates). <br />
I am going to pick up a Cer. Iksar chestplate because it is equivelant to a FT2 item and it is only 4200-ish pp.<br />
<br />
I saw a char profile on magelo that had 13 FT points per tick and 15 hp regen per tick.  He is getting about 20 extra mana points per tick.  That would be very nice... Then add KEI and you are a mana god!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you're correct to put lizard + jbb first.<br />
<br />
I think solstice earring is the only FT item you can reasonably expect to acquire before you become a lot higher level and join a raid guild that goes after relatively uber targets.  I don't think I've ever seen a FT item for sale in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I'd just plan to canni a lot and go for regen gear.  Start with iksar bp, then graduate to a fungi tunic (15pts/tick regen) when you can afford it.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I think that you have another option which is comparable to regaining mana faster, which is to not use as much of it at once.  Get a mana preservation 3 item like an Obulus Death Shroud and an extended enhancement 3 item like an amulet of insight.  Personally, I spend a ton of mana on buffs (especially regen and haste), so both of those focus items end up saving me a huge amount of mana per hour.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way:  <br />
<br />
You can either spend 115 mana every 10 minutes for a buff like alacrity.  Or you can spend 110 mana every 12 minutes (using the 2 focus items i listed).  In the first case, you cast the buff 6 times per hour and use 690 mana.  In the second case you cast it 5 times per hour and use only 550 mana.  You've spent 140 less mana in an hour.  When you add in all the buffs and other spells you cast, the mana savings really starts to add up.  Wouldn't surprise me if appropriate focus items didn't end up being comparable to a lot of flowing thought also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have seen a few FT items for sale in the bazaar.  All at 50k+ pp.  Only low cost FT item I've heard of is the solstice earring.<br />
<br />
You could try to be among the first to complete the Kitty Cloak quests for an FT 5 cloak but it's a huge pain requiring a very uber (and very patient)guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could start working on your shawl quests. You'll need help at your level and lots of patience with trade skills. The 7th shawl is FT1 and 8th shawl is FT3. The only other droppable FT1 item I'm aware of is the clockwork thingy in CT but I've never seen it for sale in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you hunt outdoors, the lizard or horse mount will drastically increase your mana regen, as you med constantly, so long as you aren't attacking or moving. It really does make a huge difference, whether you use mana-consuming spells or clicky items (jbb/epic/etc). :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would totally forget FT for the most part (though everyone should get a solstice earring for the great stats and the fact most guilds have some tradeskillers able to make the parts cheap).<br />
<br />
As a shaman, you ARE mana-regen personified. Well ok, once you get the higher-level cana spells (and eventually of couse, cana 5!).<br />
<br />
I have about effective FT12 all up if u include clickable mana regen effects and Mental Clarity(3). That's nothing compared to gaining 78-ish mana each time I press cana 4.<br />
And then another 1000-ish mana every 3 mins when cana 5 pops.<br />
<br />
So yes, go for JBB and then Horse/Lizzie. Then get a Solstice Earring.<br />
<br />
Having said all this, to help you level faster, don't be afraid to buy a KEI/C3!! :)<br />
<br />
Also dont forget that if you buy an Iksar Regen BP, that +5hp/tick is equivalent to FT2.5-ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just an FYI about FT items.<br />
<br />
Do the soltice earring.  And if you want more, buy something droppable.  Because unless it's an elemental armor item (SHM, RNG, ROG usable) that has FT on it, you will probably never see it, no matter how much you raid or how good your guild is.  <br />
<br />
Virtually all FT items will go first to clerics, and OCCASIONALLY next to druids.  Shamans are considered, I think, able to regen our own mana much better than the other two priest classes.  <br />
<br />
And to be honest, we have a much lesser need for FT items, even at the high end of the game.  Just get a horse/leezard and use it when you can.  And also of course, cann :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I changed some of my gear out and did the earring of the solstice quest.  I also got a drogmar!  I am looking for a reasonably priced JBB, but I have 8 more lvls till I can use it, so I am not in too much of a hurry.  I added a Cerimonial Iksar Chestplate and some new legs, boots and gauntlets (for more AC).  My regen is great now.  I am soloing with KEI and AEGO and my mana and hps are staying up while killing dark blues, whites and yellows.  <br />
<br />
I started my epic quest.  I just finished killing Tabien and Glaron in RM.  I didn't research Tabien and I thought he was a warrior when I started fighting him.  We where both low on hps, then he healed himself up and I had to run.  I medded up and barely took him out the second time around.  I am not tough enough to take the 45 SK wolf, so I am going to wait until I have help before I finish the quest up to the SOW boots.  I want the SOW boots bad now....  I had sow as my first buff and KEI as my second when I was jumped by a froglok shaman.  He debuffed my sow and then my KEI.  I was very irritated.  I could have saved the KEI if I would have had the sow boots already : ).<br />
<br />
I also started the shawl quests.  I just need the Griffon eggs to get my 3rd shawl.  I will have to dust the cob webs off my druid to try to track them down and kill them.  They are hard to find without tracking.  I got my baking to 143 (starting at 0) in less than 45 minutes for about 40pp doing the bear meat steaks.  I plan to master pottery within the next few days.  I figure that the 8th shawl would be selling for a fortune if it where droppable.  If I put 10k into getting it, I will have got a great deal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I forgot to ask.  Cattywumpus mentioned the kitty cloak quests.  I can't find the quests.  Where can I find info on them?  A FT5 item would be much better than the FT3 8th Shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I forgot to ask.  Cattywumpus mentioned the kitty cloak quests.  I can't find the quests.  Where can I find info on them?  A FT5 item would be much better than the FT3 8th Shawl.<br />
<br />
The 8th Shawl also extends your buffs by 20%.... this is pretty handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The cloak quest is a contiuation of the Sonic Wolfbane weapon quest that all Vah Shir start right after their citizenship quest.  The cloak you are given with your citizenship is upgraded with each step of the quest .  The weapon is crap and not worth doing but is a necessary step in reaching the better cloaks.  Most kitties give up on the quest long before the cloaks get impressive enough to make them want to continue.<br />
<br />
The cloak in my magelo is achievable solo in the 30s and has two more upgrades.  The Dar Khura Generals Cape has some very nice stats and +50hp and +50 mana and requires a small raid of about 2 dozen level 50s.  The Cloak of the Dar Khura Hero has even better stats +100hp +100 mana and FT 5.  The final cloak requires a several hours long raid requiring 60+ level 60 players (at least, you basically have to overrun Grimling Forest and hold it until a rare spawn shows up).  I have yet to meet anyione who actually has finished this quest.<br />
