<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if this is sold or dropped? I checked in FV and the vendors there didnt have it unless I somehow missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been a while, but I believe it's vendor sold.  Check in the tunnel in East Commons.  I believe one of the vendors in the big open area in the tunnels sells spells.  One of them is chloroblast.  Another good one to get is summon companion.<br />
<br />
I think the vendor was Ruska?  Rushka?  Something like that.  Sorry if I can't remember, but it's been like 8 months.  :(<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I just bought it recently from the vendor in the East Commonlands tunnel, and as I recall it wasn't too cheap either. And what a pain to have to get to that zone :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the vendor is by shady. its is rushka something or other he also sells summon companion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes its quite expensive for a vendor spell, around 140pp if im not mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's also available in FV in the barbarian hut on the docks.<br />
<br />
I didn't think it was very expensive, I wonder if you bought a copy that a player had sold to the vendor?</div></div><hr />
