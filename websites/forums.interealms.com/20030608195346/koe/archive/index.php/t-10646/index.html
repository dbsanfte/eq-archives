Me, Kagic, and Rooknight were porting to IC when it crashed. I think it's all my fault.  SOB!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye there was a server crash today</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the server Plopped (heheh)  I had been with corps in a nasty part of Kael.  when i logged back in i immediately started casting gate only to find that i was at the evacc spot near the EW zone.  Does this happen for everyone now upon server crash or was i just an extremely lucky little wizz?<br />

Looked to me as if they had done a rollback and reset all charaters to the zone areas.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I sure as heck wasn't anywhere near the zone when my last save occured.<br />
<br />
Pretty smart if you think about it.  Probably saved the GM's hours of rez tells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I logged in, I was at the portal in IceClad, of course as I stated above, when I crashed I was in the middle of a port to iceclad. Was glad too, didn't loose any thing or loose xp, it's as if I got disconnected durring a port and just re-logged in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sorry about not logging back on later sori.  was a little frustrated with my grouping attempts last night so instead of waiting for the servers to be unlocke I kinda laid down.  only to wake up at like 4 in the morning.  hadn't expected to be that long</div></div><hr />
