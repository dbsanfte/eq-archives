<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, let me introduce myself. I've long been a lurker of the boards, first time posting, take that as you will. I play a 65 shaman and a 64 Beastlord on Saryrn, so I'll take it you understand I have a fair idea that I know what I'm talking about. Or maybe you won't, because as I see it I'm about to disagree with the majority of you...<br />
<br />
<br />
Frankly, I find it greatly disturbing that when I come here nowadays I start to check links, thinking I went to Monkly Business by mistake. The amount of steady bitching and whining here is spiraling out of control, when in reality nothing's really changed. However, in game perception of shamans is going the way of the druid and monk, not because of our failings, but because of the incessant whining being cross posted to every server and class board on the net. <br />
<br />
I understand that we, as a class, want more, and that we are long overdue. I'm inclined to agree with this, and I've seen some damn good ideas posted to that effect. I've also seen some over the top **** posted in all seriousness by high end shamans that makes want to laugh and cry all in the same breath. Ridiculous. One poster advised you all to stop thinking so big, and she got flamed for it. The response was 'the class that whines the loudest gets the most in return'. Get that crap out of your head and off of the forums. We are not monks, and that is not the way to handle the situation.<br />
I despise monks for this very reason.<br />
<br />
When you all complain about beastlords and enchanters bringing more to the table than us, you have to make the comparison of two classes versus one. I don't now, nor have I *ever* had any problems getting a group, even pickup groups amongst people I don't know. <br />
Since I play both classes, and currently can't afford the 50k pp it costs to get the 65% slow for Beastlords at level 65, the last level of the game, I don't subscribe to theory that Beastlords slow as well as Shaman. Especially since I've had 75% slow since level 51 with my shaman. That I paid less than 30pp for from a vendor.<br />
<br />
My god, what the hell does a Necromancer bring to a group, any group? You complain about DoTs, when that's all he has to work with. His nukes are only slightly better than ours (very situational-undead) so his sole dps output resides on his pet and his high cost mana taps. Before you whine about what classes can do what better than us, look at all classes by comparison.  ( I also play a 57 necromancer on Saryrn)<br />
<br />
Shaman's still kick ass, whether you want to accept it or not. YES, we can use some tweaking, but please don't go down the same path as the druids and the monks. Beastlords fill their role, as well as enchanters, and, guess what...so do Shaman. <br />
<br />
Someday, with a little constructive criticism on the part of the Shaman community, changes will happen, for the better. Take that however you will, and I'm sure the flames are sure to follow, but some of you have gotten out of hand with your ranting and class envy crap.<br />

See we are a very fine class till you leave LDoN normal or PoP tier 3.<br />
And i really think that unless you actually encountered the problem and have had that feeling of being useless (I am doing the raid a bigger favor by turning on my BBB program and getting that to buff those who send tells then by actually trying to do stuff like debuffing) to your raid/group you can not really understand the frustrations.</div></div><hr />

Nothing changing is why &quot;the whining is spiraling out of control&quot;. Brenlo or developers actually talking to us apart from &quot;everything is fine&quot; would go a long way towards making most of these posts disappear.<br />
<br />
However, in game perception of shamans is going the way of the druid and monk, not because of our failings, but because of the incessant whining being cross posted to every server and class board on the net. <br />
Or in other words, the general population is finally noticing shaman have issues, possibly in part because of numerous rants. We do have issues and it is no coincidence that people start noticing them at this time - GoD is where we have the most problems.<br />
<br />

I despise monks for this very reason.<br />
Being quiet for 5 expansions got us here. Being supportive of the developers and calmly presenting our issues brought us here. As sad as it is, whining and bitching is the only way to get us changed.<br />
<br />
When you all complain about beastlords and enchanters bringing more to the table than us, you have to make the comparison of two classes versus one.<br />
In GoD either of those classes brings more to the table then us. So do clerics and druids. And why would I have to compare myself to two classes?<br />
<br />
I don't now, nor have I *ever* had any problems getting a group, even pickup groups amongst people I don't know. <br />
Hmm, and a couple of sentences prior to this you are telling us that our in-game reputation as a class is dropping.<br />
<br />
Since I play both classes, and currently can't afford the 50k pp it costs to get the 65% slow for Beastlords at level 65, the last level of the game, I don't subscribe to theory that Beastlords slow as well as Shaman. Especially since I've had 75% slow since level 51 with my shaman. That I paid less than 30pp for from a vendor.<br />
So you are telling me that your shaman with a complete spellbook is balanced vs a beastlord with an incomplete one? That is not an argument for our superior capabilities . . . <br />
<br />
My god, what the hell does a Necromancer bring to a group, any group? You complain about DoTs, when that's all he has to work with. His nukes are only slightly better than ours (very situational-undead) so his sole dps output resides on his pet and his high cost mana taps.<br />
Neurotoxin<br />
Decrease Hitpoints by 1260 (L61) to 1300 (L65)<br />
Casting Time: 6<br />
Recast Time: 4<br />
<br />

<br />
Velium Strike<br />
Decrease Hitpoints by 925<br />
Casting Time: 7.8<br />
Recast Time: 2.25<br />
<br />
The necromancer lifetap is better DPS then our nuke. Necromancers, apart from easily outdamaging us can also manatap, FD, rez, snare and in the right zones they can mez, slow and charm. Oh, and their mana regeneration is better then our's.<br />
<br />
Before you whine about what classes can do what better than us, look at all classes by comparison.  ( I also play a 57 necromancer on Saryrn)<br />
Maybe you should play a 65 necromancer instead then if you insist on comparing him to your 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
Someday, with a little constructive criticism on the part of the Shaman community, changes will happen, for the better. Take that however you will, and I'm sure the flames are sure to follow, but some of you have gotten out of hand with your ranting and class envy crap.<br />
We have tried that for quite a while now. It did not work.<br />
<br />
By the way - in what area of the game are you playing in (zones/AAs/gear/raiding or exping)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My god, what the hell does a Necromancer bring to a group, any group?

<br />
Necros dont only have dots. They have a pet far better than ours in dps, a 1300 DD that is NOT undead-only (Neurotoxin), Wake the Dead for more dps every so often, and mana regen nearly equal to ours (probably greater in some cases depending on AA and equipment comparisons). And, then of course, they have a specialty opponent which we dont have - undead. Against undead they can mez, charm, Dire Charm, nuke for even more, and slow 70% (by 39th level, I think it is).<br />
<br />
As a shaman, when I'm looking for dps classes to round out a group, necro is not at the top of the list, but they are on the list most definitely. Shaman is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Basically, I think you're agreeing with the majority, so thanks for your support. <br />
<br />
I do support, and I am agreeing, I guess I'm just not agreeing with the way its being handled. I dunno.<br />
<br />
Hmmm. Just to check, 'someday' would be when, Deceidon? Going on 4 years here, haven't noticed much attention to shaman yet. I'm not real excited about waiting 4 more years for nothing to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
While I can see your point about the Shaman class remaining relatively unchanged for the last 4+ years, I believe its because up until GoD came along we were just fine. Other than the occasional rant about Beastlords getting an uber rare ungodly expensive 65% slow at level 65, you didn't see many complaints.<br />
<br />
Or in other words, the general population is finally noticing shaman have issues, possibly in part because of numerous rants. We do have issues and it is no coincidence that people start noticing them at this time - GoD is where we have the most problems.<br />
<br />
No, the general population is starting to label us as whiners. *Every* class has problems, not just us. Every class has had their day in the sun, and every class, at one point or another, has fallen by the wayside. For four years we had no problems, but now, we do..not as bad as some make them out to be, but we could use some tweaking, definitely.<br />
<br />
In GoD either of those classes brings more to the table then us. So do clerics and druids. And why would I have to compare myself to two classes?<br />
<br />
I'm not asking you why you have to, I'm asking why you are. Enchanter dps is negligible, when they're doing their job, and DC pets get eaten by higher end mobs, because of level restrictions. Beastlords come in  under shaman in the utility and slow department, but add a great deal of dps, its their balancing factor. Its not a mystery to me, don't see why it is to you.<br />
<br />
So you are telling me that your shaman with a complete spellbook is balanced vs a beastlord with an incomplete one? That is not an argument for our superior capabilities . . . <br />
<br />
No, I'm telling you that I don't have any trouble getting groups with my shaman. Or my Beastlord. If you'll go back and read what I wrote again, you'll see that I'm telling you Sha's Revenge, due to its attainable level and rarity, is not as unbalancing as everyone makes it out to be.<br />

<br />
You also failed to mention that Velium Strike costs 300 mana while Neurotoxin costs 465 mana. These are not one sided arguments. We do less damage for less mana cost.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should play a 65 necromancer instead then if you insist on comparing him to your 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
I think you misunderstood. Someone mentioned that necro's can mez, slow, etc, but its like the difference in costs on the nukes...Necro mez gets more and more resisted as time goes on, and that starts at level 24. Necro slows stop being useful  after LDoN (where you say we still shine) becuase of the lack of high end undead zones. Necro mana regen is better than ours, but its also better than an enchanters. Go figure.<br />
<br />
Wake the Dead for more dps every so often,<br />
<br />
Yea well we get Spirit Call.. Bash it if you want, but I like it and I use it. If that doesn't count as extra dps to you, then yes, you're just complaining. Sure, it may not equal up to Necro dps in WTD, but its for that very reason that we bring utility and a necro does not.<br />
<br />
Once again, I'm not debating that we need attention, but I'm also not convinced that we suck as bad as some of you would have others believe.<br />

<br />
First off, not &quot;*Every*&quot; class have problems, especially at the state we are now.  Secondly, the issues aren't something that just sprang out from nowhere in the last few weeks.  We've had issues since Luclin, albeit small ones, but as time grew, it's gotten to the point of where we need bypass surgery, not &quot;some tweaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can give a rat's butt what the &quot;general population&quot; labels us as.  They are clueless.  And some of those people are the same ones that &quot;whined&quot; for their own class to have fixes.  There has been more changes for melees than any other category of class in EQ history.  And guess what?  They got by &quot;whining.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The fundamental problem is that for challenging content, a group needs a healer, a back up healer, a warrior, and dps. The best dps is an enchanter. The fact that Paladins and Shadowknights cannot really tank for single groups in new content is another fundamental game flaw. If a slower is desired, there are 4 better classes than shaman. <br />
<br />
There are still encounters where 5% slow makes a huge difference. If I recall correctly, the ring of slime has a few hitpoints. These are rare and trivial old content. The new game design means that Shaman bring very littl eto the table in the new content. As for old content, shaman are still versatile and powerful. The can fill many roles, and even be main healer in many groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Enchanter dps is negligible, when they're doing their job...<br />
<br />
That's funny.  Deceidon, you have yet to say where you normally play?  If it's anywhere outside of LDoN hard, Elementals, and specifically GoD then I don't think many Shaman here would be surprised at this:<br />
<br />
Once again, I'm not debating that we need attention, but I'm also not convinced that we suck as bad as some of you would have others believe.<br />
<br />
Assuming you haven't followed many of the posts, examples, and reasoning on this board to your contrary, then your position is completely understandable since Shaman really are pretty well off outside of the above mentioned arenas.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I would like to emphasize how funny the enchanter comment is and also to note the original theme's irony: it's another whiny post about whiny posts. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;Whining&quot;<br />
<br />
You put it in quotes like that's not what you're doing. Look, I agree with you that Shaman's need a buff to deal with new content. I wholeheartedly agree. I don't agree with the context in which the debate is presented. Its not a request or a discussion, its more like one sided demands delivered with loads of falsehoods. <br />
<br />
I don't agree that the class is currently undesirable. I will agree that GoD has reintroduced the Holy Trinity, much to many players' dismay, but that puts every other class in our position, not just us. I don't think groups will go out of their way to look for a beastlord or an enchanter over a shaman, because I don't do it, and I don't seem to suffer from it either. Maybe I'm wrong, but I call it as I see it.<br />
<br />
I guess we can agree to disagree :) As far as Shaman's needing 'surgery' vs a 'tweaking', that's a little overboard in my opinion, but despite all that's said and done, if there are any positive changes made to the Shaman I will benefit just like everyone else. I guess what it comes down to is it sickened me to listen to the monks whine about beastlords and bards, and it sickens me to see the Shaman whine about the beastlords and the enchanters.<br />

<br />
You . . . gotta . . . be . . . KIDDING ME!! MANA? Who CARES!! Half the problem in the game today is that MANA is rarely even an issue anymore, hence out extra mana-regenning capabilities being made less and less of a factor. Its all about DPS when you talk nukes man, not MANA. SHEESH. A Necro can hit a mob with 2 of those taps in the time it takes to cast VS. <br />
<br />
Get a clue man. Seriously.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sorry, but Dec, I'm with you.  I too am very tired of the endless rants that use one sided arguments to make a point.  Many folks on this board now routinely trivialize shaman strengths while exaggerating our weaknesses in an attempt to make a point.  No the grass is not always greener for the other class.  Every other class is also complaining.  Go to the chanter boards and BST boards, hell, try the rogues, magicians, paladins, SK, and druids while you are at it.  They all have their complaints and wants.  Hell, on this very board, there was a post about the number of questions and requests by chanters at Fan Fair, sounds like they are being very vocal about their needs and shortcomings, like having their dps cut to just about nil in Gates with the deletion of charmable mobs.  <br />
<br />
Dec, again, I agree, shaman need to be tweeked, but some of the folks on this board have decided it is the end of the world.  So be it, I'll get a lot more invites to groups, room on raids, and uber loot without them.  The rest of Norath still appreciates a well played shaman, even if some have decided they are useless.<br />

<br />
WTD is more dps than spirit call. Necro pet is way more dps than our pet. Nuerotoxin is more dps than Velium Strike. What the **** is your point? Necros are worse than shamans? Give me a break. <br />
<br />
Take snare away from necros and they still get groups and contribute considerable dps. Hell, take snare and their undead slow and there still isnt any change in their dps. Take slow away from enchanters and they still get groups because of crowd control and charm dps. Beastlords would still be heavy dps with their warder and melee, plus nice buffs. <br />
<br />
Take slow away from shamans and you have a class so pathetically underpowered and useless that nobody would ever group with one. They'd just beg us for focus on their way to their real group...because they still havent realized just how ****ty focus is compared to the other priest buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Enchanter dps is negligible, <br />

Here's a quarter - go buy a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">While I can see your point about the Shaman class remaining relatively unchanged for the last 4+ years, I believe its because up until GoD came along we were just fine. Other than the occasional rant about Beastlords getting an uber rare ungodly expensive 65% slow at level 65, you didn't see many complaints.<br />
We were fine in Luclin. We started to have small issues at the start of PoP - anyone remember the PoJustice trials? At the end of PoP we had some bigger issues but hey, the next expansion is around the door, surely we will get fixed.<br />
<br />
Well, in LDoN shaman actually had huge issues but LDoN normals are so easy noone cares and not many did LDoN hards for quite a while. Besides it was not a serious expansion anyways - surely the next real expansion will fix us!<br />
<br />
Around comes GoD - SOE had tons of feedback on these boards and from the beta telling them how inadequate the shaman spells are - for the 6th expansion straight. You seem surprised by the complaints and the rants and the whining - I am surprised it took so long.<br />
<br />
And if we got no upgrades for years because we were doing fine - how come clerics got two new spell lines in LDoN? Did clerics suffer so much in PoP that they needed more unique spell lines?<br />
<br />
Enchanter dps is negligible, when they're doing their job, and DC pets get eaten by higher end mobs, because of level restrictions. <br />
Noone is talking about dire charm - we are talking about charming things that do 1000+ DPS. In a lot of GoD zones enchanters literally outdamage the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
Beastlords come in  under shaman in the utility and slow department, but add a great deal of dps, its their balancing factor. Its not a mystery to me, don't see why it is to you.<br />
Because slow is close to useless in GoD. Beastlords have just as much utility as us and are a serious DPS class. We are not a serious healer. Also a lot of people are bitter about beastlords being better buffers then shaman - that used to be one of the things we did well.<br />
<br />
No, I'm telling you that I don't have any trouble getting groups with my shaman. Or my Beastlord. If you'll go back and read what I wrote again, you'll see that I'm telling you Sha's Revenge, due to its attainable level and rarity, is not as unbalancing as everyone makes it out to be.<br />
Rarity does not balance classes. If I gave every 10th or 50th or 100th berserker deathtouch those few berserkers would be overpowered. Besides that beastlord slow is not harder to get then any other spell of that level.<br />
<br />
You also failed to mention that Velium Strike costs 300 mana while Neurotoxin costs 465 mana. These are not one sided arguments. We do less damage for less mana cost.<br />
I cannot remember the last time when mana restricted anyone from nuking, least of all a necromancer. You said we outnuke necromancers - I showed you we do not. Now you say necromancer nukes are less mana effective. They might be, but it will not matter because noone runs out of mana and certainly not the necromancer or shaman.<br />
<br />
I think you misunderstood. Someone mentioned that necro's can mez, slow, etc, but its like the difference in costs on the nukes...Necro mez gets more and more resisted as time goes on, and that starts at level 24. Necro slows stop being useful  after LDoN (where you say we still shine) becuase of the lack of high end undead zones.<br />
I have had necromancers mez in Kod'taz . . it is situational but it works great when you can find undead. GoD sure has their share of them.<br />
<br />
Yea well we get Spirit Call.. Bash it if you want, but I like it and I use it. If that doesn't count as extra dps to you, then yes, you're just complaining. Sure, it may not equal up to Necro dps in WTD, but its for that very reason that we bring utility and a necro does not.<br />
What utility do we bring over a necromancer?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;&quot;I don't agree that the class is currently undesirable. I will agree that GoD has reintroduced the Holy Trinity, much to many players' dismay, but that puts every other class in our position, not just us.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Which &quot;other classes&quot; are you referring to?  If slow is not useful to an encounter, and the melee have maxed physical traits... why choose a shaman for a fast paced group where mana regen for the real healers.. and or dps is whats needed?  Thats the issue.  For endgame players, fighting mobs that can't be slowed, its much smarter to either go for high dps + mana for clerics (enc), or medium dps and mana for clerics (bst), or group mana taps and better nukes + better pet (necro), or better healing + better nukes (druid).  <br />
<br />
Even if the mob can be slowed.. wouldn't you rather have a slower+mana regen+higher dps?<br />
<br />
There are literally ZERO situations where endgame encounters either A) require a shaman or B) are best suited to a shaman or C) are even remotely helped by a shaman.  Sure.. mediocre dps and mediocre heals doesn't hurt a group.. but that GoD group could do far better bringing a bst, enc, dru, ranger, extra tank, practically any other class but a shaman along.<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;I don't think groups will go out of their way to look for a beastlord or an enchanter over a shaman, because I don't do it, and I don't seem to suffer from it either. Maybe I'm wrong, but I call it as I see it.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Man, I wish that were the case with my experiences.  Sure, in BoT or Ldon's, I can find a group with average players that don't know what a real group can do....  But just last night, my guild was dinking around in BoT.. you want to know what the group was?<br />
<br />
Enc, Enc, Mage, Cleric, Tank, Beast.<br />
<br />
That equals:<br />
Enc1 = Charm pet 1<br />
Enc2 = Charm pet 2<br />
Mage = Charm pet 3 + nukes<br />
Cleric = Healer<br />
Tank = Aggro holder<br />
Beast = mana regen+slow+higher than shaman dps.<br />
<br />
To be honest, if they could have gotten another mage or enc, they would have dropped the bst, but he was useful for offtanking the pets when charm broke.<br />
<br />
The mobs dropped in 10 seconds or so.  Now sure.. you could bring a shaman along.. but why?  <br />
540 hp from focus?  Na. Thats like one BoT swing.<br />
Stat buffs?  Na.  The one tank was maxed.<br />
Haste?  Chanters is better.<br />
Nukes, dots?  10 seconds.. why bother.<br />
<br />
Now.. thats in BoT, where the situation is still slightly ok for shaman.  Now, muliply the need for group dps, multiply the need for high hps, make the mobs unslowable, make the fights short even without 3 charmed pets...  And the situation grows worse.<br />
<br />
While I agree with you that constant &quot;whining&quot; is annoying to look at everyday.. what else can we do?  /petition?  Debating the issues, and perhaps coming up with a constant flow of consistent requests here and on other boards, is one way to get SOE's attention.  We know the devs read here and on SOE's site from time to time... to remain quiet certainly wouldn't get any changes made.<br />
<br />
Myself and others have concluded that the devs either don't think the problem is that big, or don't know about it, or don't think its a priority in their workday to address.<br />
<br />
If enough of them constantly see threads, by paying customers, who are concerned with various issues, they just might take the time to investigate them further.  Or if they are fully aware of them, the devs might bump the issue up their work ladder if what we debate sinks home with them.<br />
<br />
Really, I understand you being annoyed by &quot;whining&quot; (althought I think its debate more than anything), but whats the alternative?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wumadce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My Shaman was my first toon, and he's still played to this day.  People say that we should get a better heal, we should get better nukes, we should do more dps...<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't feel that there needs to be any major change to the Shaman class.  A good shaman is one of the most skilled players in EQ, in my opinion.  Slow, DoT, nuke, root, heal, buff, pet, melee, tank, off-tank... We can do it all, and if we can't, then we can adept and better ourselves to do it.<br />
<br />
I play healer in PoP (including Ele's), and LDoN Normal's with ease.   I haven't tried a hard yet, and I won't try it either.  Yes, it's hard to do healing in ele planes, but it's fun.. It's damn fun.<br />
<br />
Every problem that people have with the class can be overcome by bettering yourself and your skills as a shaman.  I thought I needed a better &quot;ch&quot; at one point, but then I realized, &quot;Hey, with AHA3 and AHG3, I'll make a pretty decent cleric.&quot;  I'm not up to AHA3/AHG3 yet, and I know a lot of people that would rather have me cleric for them then clerics.<br />
<br />
If people say we need to do more DPS:  Bane + BoS + BoU = 871 damage per tick, not including Burning Affliction 4.  871 damage a tick is 145 damage per second.  Throw in epic, throw in crit affliction, throw in ba4 and you'll be doing much better.<br />
<br />
If we need to do better nukes:  Velium Strike sucks, there's no way around that.  SoT is decent with ornate/ele gloves, and casting haste.  Use rain spells, too.<br />
<br />
If we need to do crit slows:  No.  Just no.<br />
<br />
The point for this post, besides confusing everyone with too many paragraphs, elipses, and ranting:  There's no need to complain about the class.  If you really want a better heal, go play a cleric or a druid.  If you want crowd control, play an enchanter or bard.  If you want to be able to do a little bit of everything, play a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Am I going to get flamed for this?  Probably.  Is it going to effect me?  I doubt it.  I know that I play a Shaman, I play a class that can do whatever needs to be done.<br />

I thought at first to give you an &quot;indepth&quot; reply, but then figured that I wont bother myself with it. You bring examples about the classes, of what you have no clue. Necro offers to the group much more then we do, any time. Shamans don't frankly offer anything nowadays, only thing we really have is the slow, which we YET do somewhat better then other classes. Ah yes, not to mention that these other classes offer much more utility to the raid AND the group. On the raids we still have a role, something what the warriors had for years, where they were useful ONLY on the raid, but in everyday grouping situations, just like warriors were, we've been replaced now with other classes. The slight slow difference is matched by other benefits these classes give to the group, which are by far better then we have to offer. You know, if I would be any other class then a shaman, and would head out to hard LDoN or GoD area or whatever, I would simply buy a buff from the shaman (say, 7th) and then get the chanter or BST instead and move on. Because these two offer MUCH more to the group, then the &quot;best slow&quot; (5% better, superior indeed) what the shaman does.<br />
<br />
So, move along, your point is well missed and serves no purpose. Of course, our posts serve no purpose either, because SOE just doesn't give a damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Sorry, but I need to reply to you ... some parts of your post made me laugh:<br />
<br />
Yes, it's hard to do healing in ele planes, but it's fun.. It's damn fun.<br />
<br />
Especially gets real fun after 1 bounced slow (after Malos). At that time I usually have to go to chain Tnarg the tank and hope for a crit heal here and there. After such a fight I am near OOM usually. So yes, we can heal in EPs, but why should we (except if your real desperate and no other real healer is around)?<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought I needed a better &quot;ch&quot; at one point, but then I realized, &quot;Hey, with AHA3 and AHG3, I'll make a pretty decent cleric.&quot;  I'm not up to AHA3/AHG3 yet, and I know a lot of people that would rather have me cleric for them then clerics.<br />
<br />
Interesting. I have AHA3/AHG3 plus Marrs Gift, Tnargs heals for 1800s maximum .. now tell me what that does versus an unslowed mob in EPs. Exactly, it heals 1 round of melee (maybe a bit more with a decent tank). While clerics heal for near 4k with fast heals. Don't start me rambling about Kraggs.<br />
<br />
<br />
If people say we need to do more DPS:  Bane + BoS + BoU = 871 damage per tick, not including Burning Affliction 4.  871 damage a tick is 145 damage per second.  Throw in epic, throw in crit affliction, throw in ba4 and you'll be doing much better.<br />
<br />
Dude, where are you playing? You stick 3 dots on a mob (and you mention epic dot). Please .. I beg you, enlighten me in which groups you play. Either mob is dead before Bane ran out, or you are in a no DPS group (5 clerics and you or such) and you will tank the mob after sticking 2 dots. Dots is for soloing (and maybe the occasional VT named run for fun) .. and soloing sucks (not only for me, I know many shaman who feel that way).<br />
<br />
<br />
If we need to do better nukes:  Velium Strike sucks, there's no way around that.  SoT is decent with ornate/ele gloves, and casting haste.  Use rain spells, too.<br />
<br />
Velium Strike is the best damage/mana ratio we got (if you take into account that rain spells are resisted more often than normal nukes). The fact is, that even clerics outnuke us. But most shamans don't even want to have more nuking power. If I wanted to be a nuker I would have startet a wizard. BUT: If they take away most of my regular jobs (slowing, debuffing, healing), I want something else to do or I can log off right away.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point for this post, besides confusing everyone with too many paragraphs, elipses, and ranting:  There's no need to complain about the class.  If you really want a better heal, go play a cleric or a druid.  If you want crowd control, play an enchanter or bard.  If you want to be able to do a little bit of everything, play a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Too funny .... reality check here: Most shamans want to play a shaman, we just cannot do our jobs anymore. I don't want to be a one-trick-pony like the cleric. I chose the shaman for his versality. But my versality has gone away with the latest expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I going to get flamed for this?  Probably.<br />
<br />
You sure as hell will be .. and you earned it.<br />

And that slow can be used where exactly? Enlighten me at which encounter in PoP Tier 4 and higher I must use disease based slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I too am very tired of the endless rants that use one sided arguments to make a point.  Many folks on this board now routinely trivialize shaman strengths while exaggerating our weaknesses in an attempt to make a point.  <br />
Thunderwolf<br />
<br />
You seem like you might have a clue Thunder, so let me address your point here in hopes of enlightening you. <br />
<br />
We are ALL Shaman. We know our strengths. We know our capabilities. We know we can easily be sole healer in LDoN Normal or a BoT XP group. Some of us can even be sole healer in EP XP groups, I have done it in Castle 1 in PoFire a couple times, not hard because I can Malos on inc, Slow when it gets there, and Quies-Tnargs-Quies the tank (who is always a guildie and has 9500+ hps) and even sneak in a Bane now and then. <br />
<br />
We know we are the envy of Wizards and Necros and Druids at the Tables in Fire, where one kill = 14% of an AA solo. We get to sit on our mounts and use VP and DOTs to our hearts content, laying out well over 200 dps. Those other classes have to run around in circles endlessly while we chuckle from the backs of our Lizards, canning our mana back near full after every mob. <br />
<br />
However, the writing is on the wall. The game is changing. EQ has become less about fight strategy and more about &quot;how fast can you kill&quot;. It has become less about STAT buffs and more about MANA buffs. It has been gradually turning into a game where the Shaman is relatively worthless as a member of ANY group. <br />
<br />
Of course we are still great in LDoN. Of course we can still get EP XP groups. Of course we can Solo the Ghoul Lord. These things are all great and wonderful. Ever been the 3rd Shaman on a big raid? Ever even TRIED to get Pick-up groups for Gates? How many times do you get asked &quot;Wanna do LDoN Hard as our PRIEST&quot;. I will tell you how many times, NEVER. <br />
<br />
Gonna go through the checklist one more time, for those of you who do not seem to be seeing the big picture here:<br />
<br />
1. Slow has been trivialized by mitigation and immunity. Add to that the fact that 3 other classes have a viable slow, and that the difference withours is a drop in the bucket in a 20-30 second fight, and we have a problem with our &quot;Defining Ability&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Stat buffs have been made worthless by caps and mudflation. Heck, every Tom, Dick and Harry Warrior playing has a few +STR and +STA common-drop augs. NO ONE NEEDS THESE SPELLS!! We may as well delete them completely, not kidding. Oh wait, CHA is still good for selling stuff to vendors, cause I am an ugly Troll. That leaves us with 2 respectable buffs. Focus (for the HPs, which is sucky compared to some others) and FA (for the +attack, which doesnt help casters much, eh?)<br />
<br />
3. Our healing is pathetic. Even if we manage to get copies of the new heal, its STILL so far below the other Priest classes that we may as well bring Paladins along if you need a back-up healer, cause they have BETTER buffs, and a sweet group heal, etc etc). In the words of Giac, &quot;Grats for being good at healing in trivial content&quot; or something. He may be abrasive, but hes right on the money. <br />
<br />
4. DPS is the king of all &quot;utility&quot; now. You need a Tank. You need a Healer. Then, you NEED DPS. Lets examine our DPS options. A really slow nuke (VS). A small fast nuke (SoT). A decent DOT that cannot be re-cast if resisted that mob, and STILL rarely runs its full course sespite being the shortest term of all DOTs (Bane). A Hasted, Rabid Beared, Sharkspine wielding, FoM3, FAed, Ranger Buffed Troll with a lot of Moxxy (me, well, I dont have RB). I SWEAR I do more damage with melee (and Sharkspine procs) than I can with ANY combo of the others. Our DPS is truly pathetic, and if you wish to even BEGIN to deny this, its time to start looking at buying those bridges in Brooklyn I keep hearing are for sale. <br />
<br />
What is a Shamans function? For myself, I see it as many things. Buffs, Debuffs, Heals and some DPS. Hybrids out-buff us across the board. Debuffing is a joke, with the mitigation of slow. Healing . . . well lets not even go there. We are great &quot;in between fight&quot; healers, eh. DPS? Yeah, I especially like dropping an SoT on a mob and not seeing his hps drop a BUDGE. <br />
<br />
Its been noted many times. We were AWESOME in Kunark and Velious. We were ROCK SOLID in Luclin. We started to feel a pinch in PoP, but were still valuable. LDoN Normal is trivial content (similar to Guk, honestly) and we arent so hot in LDoN Hard, but can still contribute. And now, Gates is here, and where are we. Even farther behind, with no upgrades in sight. Speed, DPS, and Mana. Thats the game today. Show me where we excell in ANY of those areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">. . . <br />

If people say we need to do more DPS:  Bane + BoS + BoU = 871 damage per tick, not including Burning Affliction 4.  871 damage a tick is 145 damage per second.  Throw in epic, throw in crit affliction, throw in ba4 and you'll be doing much better.<br />
<br />

<br />
/rant off.<br />
<br />
I have to ask a couple things Wumadance.  I think I need a hand doing everything that needs to be done, and could use soem advice.<br />
<br />
First, when you talk about stacking 3 dots on a mob, how are you doing it?   Are you soloing when you do it, with a group of clerics that have no dps, or have you found an uber spell haste aug I don't know about?  I have to admit you must be a better shaman than I am, because I regularly do not have the time to have anathma run its course after slowing, let alone have BU or BoS run its course.  I could use a hand on how to have the time to stack 3 dots on a mob, when most of the time groups have a mob half dead by the time I slow it.<br />
<br />
Secondly how do you figure that SoT is good dps?  I supose its better dps than our dots, as they so rarely run their course on a mob, so maybe its good dps for a shaman.  I do not have ornate gloves yet, do they increase the damage of SoT?  I thought he gloves just lowered manna cost of that one spell.  What is your trick for rains?  I was excited when I fist got tears, until I noticed the waves were regularly resited.  I'm not in the Elemental planes yet, but struggling with hard Ldons, is there an aug in Ele planes that you have that makes the waves land that I do not have?<br />
<br />
Finnaly I have to ask what your trick is for &quot;doing what ever needs to be done&quot;.  I'm having a hard time slowing with mobs that consitenly mitigate, and are half dead by the time I get turgurs to stick after malos (assuming that turgurs does not bounce).  What is your trick?  I hope this does not sound like a flame, but I took a long brake from EQ to play DAOC and Shadowbane, and after I came back, I noticed that my shaman Tormac does not seem to be up to snuff, so to speak.  Help me out with some hints if you would.<br />
<br />

1.SHAMAN ARE OK IN LDON EASY AND MOST ELE PLANES.<br />
2.SHAMAN CANNOT &quot;GET THE JOB DONE&quot; IN GoD WHERE MOBS MITIGATE SLOW, HIT FOR 1000 DPS, AND DIE IN 30 SECONDS.<br />
Have you got it yet?<br />
What uber skills do you suppose that we should use when SOE have dumbed down the 1 group trial boss encounters to such an extreme that they are pure dps vs hps. There is no  &quot;trick&quot; that you can pull out from under your kilt for these encounters. You either spam heal the mt or the mt dies.<br />
Shaman do not get asked to help others do Kod Taz trials, we buff other groups, then get dragged through when the guild decides it needs to progress to the next zone.<br />
<br />
Since to only thing shaman have thats better than other slowers is our heals, we should to be able to function as an adequate backup healer in GoD.<br />
<br />
How does daludas (extra 40/50 hp/s) even bring us close against such mobs as I have described?<br />

<br />
This is exactly the problem. Druids do not have better buffs, and shaman DO continually do more dps over a long time. The biggest complaint here is you people whining that in GoD fights don't last long enough for your dps to make a difference! The only #$@!%!# thing that's changed is the mobs hit harder and fell quicker. That's it. You people are bitching because you don't have massive nukes to contribute to the 15 second fights. <br />
The only legitimate ****ing complaint here is that our heals are not up to par with the damage output of GoD mobs. <br />
<br />
For christ's sake, stop spamming your incredible class envy crap. Half of its not even true, such as the above post. You will have your strengths and you will have your weaknesses, its the way EQ works. NO, every class is not balanced and never will be, its a pipe dream. But you have to decide where to draw the line when you cry about what seven other classes can do compared to what your one class can do.</div></div><hr />

Ever even TRIED to get Pick-up groups for Gates? How many times do you get asked &quot;Wanna do LDoN Hard as our PRIEST&quot;. I will tell you how many times, NEVER. <br />
<br />
Gonna go through the checklist one more time, for those of you who do not seem to be seeing the big picture here:<br />
<br />
1. Slow has been trivialized by mitigation and immunity. Add to that the fact that 3 other classes have a viable slow, and that the difference withours is a drop in the bucket in a 20-30 second fight, and we have a problem with our &quot;Defining Ability&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Stat buffs have been made worthless by caps and mudflation. Heck, every Tom, Dick and Harry Warrior playing has a few +STR and +STA common-drop augs. NO ONE NEEDS THESE SPELLS!! We may as well delete them completely, not kidding. Oh wait, CHA is still good for selling stuff to vendors, cause I am an ugly Troll. That leaves us with 2 respectable buffs. Focus (for the HPs, which is sucky compared to some others) and FA (for the +attack, which doesnt help casters much, eh?)<br />
<br />
3. Our healing is pathetic. Even if we manage to get copies of the new heal, its STILL so far below the other Priest classes that we may as well bring Paladins along if you need a back-up healer, cause they have BETTER buffs, and a sweet group heal, etc etc). In the words of Giac, &quot;Grats for being good at healing in trivial content&quot; or something. He may be abrasive, but hes right on the money. <br />
<br />
4. DPS is the king of all &quot;utility&quot; now. You need a Tank. You need a Healer. Then, you NEED DPS. Lets examine our DPS options. A really slow nuke (VS). A small fast nuke (SoT). A decent DOT that cannot be re-cast if resisted that mob, and STILL rarely runs its full course sespite being the shortest term of all DOTs (Bane). A Hasted, Rabid Beared, Sharkspine wielding, FoM3, FAed, Ranger Buffed Troll with a lot of Moxxy (me, well, I dont have RB). I SWEAR I do more damage with melee (and Sharkspine procs) than I can with ANY combo of the others. Our DPS is truly pathetic, and if you wish to even BEGIN to deny this, its time to start looking at buying those bridges in Brooklyn I keep hearing are for sale. <br />
<br />
What is a Shamans function? For myself, I see it as many things. Buffs, Debuffs, Heals and some DPS. Hybrids out-buff us across the board. Debuffing is a joke, with the mitigation of slow. Healing . . . well lets not even go there. We are great &quot;in between fight&quot; healers, eh. DPS? Yeah, I especially like dropping an SoT on a mob and not seeing his hps drop a BUDGE. <br />
<br />
Its been noted many times. We were AWESOME in Kunark and Velious. We were ROCK SOLID in Luclin. We started to feel a pinch in PoP, but were still valuable. LDoN Normal is trivial content (similar to Guk, honestly) and we arent so hot in LDoN Hard, but can still contribute. And now, Gates is here, and where are we. Even farther behind, with no upgrades in sight. Speed, DPS, and Mana. Thats the game today. Show me where we excell in ANY of those areas.<br />
<br />
Blazz, I appreciate your attempt at enlightening me.  And yes, although I have only been playing for about a year, and am not in the Plane of Time, I do think I have a clue.  <br />
<br />
You give some nice examples of areas and content where we shine.  You also give a fairly accurate account of why we feel much less useful in Gates.  As I have posted previously, I believe the answer is to address the game's content rather than continue to tweek each and every class in a random order.  This just leads to more and more frustration, as each class gets further behind and gets tired of waiting their turn.  Melee's had their turn, but monks are still upset.  Magicians recently got some love, but again, they are not completely satisfied either.  Shaman, Rangers, and Berzerkers are now waiting their turn.  This is an endless, no-win process.<br />
<br />
If SOE really wants to &quot;fix&quot; the game so that it is enjoyable by all, then they need to provide content that is fun and challenging in all expansions, to all.  Granted, there are some exceptions, such as PoP and Gates which are designed for high level characters and therefore have level requirements for entry.  However, the primary problem is that the Gates design continues to make the game a console-like, fast twitch, fast kill, experience.  Most players I know are not really looking for that type of game, unfortunately, SOE feels that is what is going to attract new teenage players.  <br />
<br />
Let's face it, SOE wants to make a buck, or as many as possible, so going after the console crowd only makes sense.  I wish they would do so with another game developed specifically for that audience, but that would take too long to develop and launch.  It is much easier to take the existing game with a half million player base, and modify it to appeal to this crowd.  True, you will alienate and lose some of your existing customers, but in the long run you will probably gain player and make more money.  That is the goal.<br />
<br />
So yes, shaman are less then necessary in much of Gates.  However, I'd prefer that they adjust the content in Gates to make shaman more useful, rather than continue on the class balancing &quot;hamster wheel&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, while they are at it, they should fix the 2hb animation (drives me nuts to poke a mob with a corpsegrinder, looks really retarded), and other know bugs.  How about they delay the next expansion and focus on content balancing and bug fixes over the next few months.  OK, wishful thinking on my part.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, when they complete their transformation of the game to a tactical one vs. the strategic one I decided to play a year ago, then I will stop playing.  I don't want to play a &quot;dps&quot; class and kill stuff in 30 secs, I want to play a caster that kills stuff with tactics, skill and daring.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Well its unfortunate that I'm already labelled a troll, and told to get a clue, etc, but my point of view is my point of view. Shared by some, stomped all over by others :) doesn't bother me. <br />
<br />
I agree with Thunder that the norm now is to trivialize our strengths and exaggerate our weaknesses, and the simple fact that some of you have resorted to name calling and bashing just to get your point across sort of proves that. <br />
<br />
<br />
 I hope I don't sound contentious Deceidon, I don't mean to be.   I respect your point of view, and understand your call for civility in posts to SOE, and across boards.  But I have to ask if it is shamans that are trivializing our strengths, or is it the upper end content that consists of slow mitigating, high dps, low hp mobs that is trivializing our strengths?<br />
<br />
I would like a better slow or cripple personally, but I'm pretty sure that is out of the question.  That being the case, I see that shamans need something to make up for the mitigation of slow.  Heals seem like a traditional shaman skill set, so it makes sense to me that if my heals were balanced around my 75% slow, but routinely mobs no longer slow for 75%, my heal should be &quot;rebalanced&quot;.  The little boost that we got in form of the new heal is nice, but not inline with the trivialization of slow.  If shamans having respectable healing is out of the question because it would encroach on druids and cleric too much, then how about more dps?  Shamans need one or the other.  Thats really all most people are asking for. I do feel shamans have had to sacrifice our heal strength because of turgurs, but then the usefulness of turgurs has been yanked out from underneath us.<br />
<br />
Sure many shamans are getting frustrated, and exaggerating to make a point, but at the same time I think most of this frustration is a reaction to SOE representative like Brenlo seemingly ignoring the shamans problems.  SOE does not seem to realize that they implemented slow mitigation on almost every encounter that is particularly worthwhile for me.  Ill admit I feel like being sarcastic and cranky in response to comments like whats a shaman.  The level of complaining has changed on this board, and maybe its not as pleasant as it could be.  At the same time Im pretty confident that we would still have the disease dot, and no healing increase at all if it was not for the public complaining that some of our outspoken shamans have done.<br />
<br />
I do not expect to nuke like a wizard, or even heal as strongly as a druid, but I do expect that SOE recognize how their design of the new content changes the balance of my character, and offer him a skill set to balance him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">This is exactly the problem. Druids do not have better buffs, and shaman DO continually do more dps over a long time. The biggest complaint here is you people whining that in GoD fights don't last long enough for your dps to make a difference! The only #$@!%!# thing that's changed is the mobs hit harder and fell quicker. That's it. You people are bitching because you don't have massive nukes to contribute to the 15 second fights. <br />
The only legitimate ****ing complaint here is that our heals are not up to par with the damage output of GoD mobs. <br />
<br />
For christ's sake, stop spamming your incredible class envy crap. Half of its not even true, such as the above post. You will have your strengths and you will have your weaknesses, its the way EQ works. NO, every class is not balanced and never will be, its a pipe dream. But you have to decide where to draw the line when you cry about what seven other classes can do compared to what your one class can do.<br />
<br />
Funny enough druids do have better buffs. Well actually they have a better BUFF (9 vs fo7).<br />
<br />
On to point 2. Feel free to show me how i can do my more dps over time if the battle is over before I even start to cast my second DoT.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should explain in what land of milk and honey (or maybe what land of phat xp and sweet l33t) you play because I NOT only see low hp/high DPS mobs i also see them mitigate slow.<br />
<br />
Class Envy? I have no envy, i do not want anything any other class has or want anything nerfed all i want is a little bit better fast heal and a little bit more dps.<br />
<br />
I would be happy to settle for an 1800 HP fast heal and a 1K fast nuke but i will not get those.<br />
<br />
And the bad part is that i do not get those upgrade because SoE (to use the words of our big buddy Brenlo) uses the views people like you present to deny us these upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">And the bad part is that i do not get those upgrade because SoE (to use the words of our big buddy Brenlo) uses the views people like you present to deny us these upgrades.<br />
<br />
People like me ask people like you to stop bitching. I want upgrades too, as I've stated over and over and over in this post. Read before you hop on the bandwagon. I don't like to see falsehoods spread around about the shaman class, which people like you tend to do.<br />
<br />
The problem with GoD is that it pushes every melee class into the position of having to be more like a warrior or not being worth taking. On the caster side, it pushes every caster into having to be more like a cleric or not worth taking. No one's argued that point. These are fast fights with high damage output mobs.<br />
<br />
Yes, I agree that we need either a higher damage heal/nuke or a faster casting one. The heal moreso than the nuke, in my opinion. <br />
Have I made that clear enough?<br />
<br />
What I don't agree with, as I've stated many times over..is the fact that many of you present us absolutely worthless, not just in GoD, but outside of it as well. Nor do I like the tactic of whining that 'so and so can do this and we can't. <br />
<br />
Blah blah, yadda yadda, something what Dec wrote here... <br />
Precisely why people don't want to help you with your problems. If I were a developer, and be glad I'm not, reading this kind of crap (especially if I were a developer that played a shaman) I'd know that most of you are whining just to whine.</div></div><hr />

First, thanks for being the first person to actually comprehend the post. Second, I think it is correct that GoD has had a hand in trivializing class abilities as they stand, but not just for shaman. Third, I believe the biggest problem lies in the fact that if they up abilities to a point where GoD isn't a challenge to classes, then they trivialize the vast majority of the content outside of GoD. That goes for Shaman, clerics, druids, and everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, O wise one, The question where you actually play still stands.<br />
<br />
But let me add another question.<br />
What part of the current high end game does not take place in GoD?<br />
<br />
See every vocal shaman who spoke out in favor of upgrades stated that this was all about the high end game, NOT about BoT, NOT about LDoN normal and NOT even about the EP's.<br />
<br />
All you have done sofar is posted some stuff you knew upfront would get you flamed for. yet you claim that you want a constructive discussion, a mature post.............Well I was under the impression glori did a very fine job on that and she got ignored by SoE.<br />
it was not until the agressive tactics got to the SoE boards that Brenlo actually repsonded.<br />
<br />
Posting who you are and where you play could give your vision some credit (like Valsuvious for example who has a complete different vision from mine but i know he plays in KoD and Ikkinz so I also know he does face the problems we talk about) but for now I just asume you are A) A-Turtle-fool-02, B.) A troll (and I am not aiming at the green type here) or C) a Misguided BoT bot who felt the need to talk about stuff way over his head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">And yes, although I have only been playing for about a year, and am not in the Plane of Time, I do think I have a clue.<br />
<br />
I agree. I fully understand with your whole approach about this topic. Personally, I am trying very very hard to post calmly and NOT spew and rant about how bad we suck, because I do not think we suck, I think we merely need a tweak in a couple areas we are behind in. I love my class, I love my character, and I hate to see him made obsolete. <br />
<br />
As I have posted previously, I believe the answer is to address the game's content rather than continue to tweek each and every class in a random order.  This just leads to more and more frustration, as each class gets further behind and gets tired of waiting their turn.  Melee's had their turn, but monks are still upset.  Magicians recently got some love, but again, they are not completely satisfied either.  Shaman, Rangers, and Berzerkers are now waiting their turn.  This is an endless, no-win process.<br />
<br />
I couldn't agree more man, but lets face the reality of this situation. The basic content is NOT going to be changed. Classes will always be adjusted to content, not vice-versa. I agree its a classic &quot;Too much salt in the soup, so you add water, now it has no flavor, so you add salt&quot; type of scenario, but its what we have, and we need to make our case within the system that is in place. They may adjust content in some ways when its needed, but that mostly applies to raid-level. The basic premise that Gates has introduced, one of &quot;Speed is IN, Slow is OUT&quot; isn't going to change. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, when they complete their transformation of the game to a tactical one vs. the strategic one I decided to play a year ago, then I will stop playing.  I don't want to play a &quot;dps&quot; class and kill stuff in 30 secs, I want to play a caster that kills stuff with tactics, skill and daring.<br />

<br />
I am with you. What I think people like you and Deceidon don't understand is that overall, you actually AGREE with us. I am very very hopeful that we will see an upgrade to LDoN (or something similar) soon, one that focuses on SKILL rather than speed. Gates is High-End Raider content, so the casual people are screaming as well. Maybe they can kill 2 birds with one stone, and introduce some content that we are more effective in that the casual and raider player alike can enjoy. But until then, I am gonna continue to comment about our CURRENT situation, and what I think it will take to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Blazz, we are in violent agreement.  Thanks for your comments, you are one of the few who's posts I still read.<br />
<br />
Dec, I will also repeat myself and say that I believe you are closer to the mark on this than most. <br />
<br />
We ALL AGREE, the shaman need some tweeks.  However, some of the chicken littles around here would make you believe that shaman are completely worthless, either in the high end game or even in many other zones.<br />
<br />
And for those complaining about Gates, lets not forget that it is not friendly to MANY classes.  So what is a ranger's role in Gates if a rogue or wiz is available?  Sure, you need dps, but any will do, so folks will look for the highest dps classes and leave the others LFG.  You need 1 8k hp warrior, 1-2 clerics, maybe a slower, and the rest is composed of the best dps you can find.  So yeah, the content in some Gates zones and trials sux, period.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, many have taken this to indicate that shaman sux as a class.  We do not.  But when you make these exaggerated claims of inadequacy and ask for unrealistic enhancements, then all you do is lose credibility.  No, Brenlo, Ryltan, or any of the developers will take us seriously if we continue to rant.  Our previous proposal was well done and resulted in some minor, yet appreciated, upgrades to our healing.  Maybe not enough, but better than nothing.<br />
<br />
Yes, lets continue to petition for other needed enhancements, and modifications to game content, so that we always have a role to play in any and all zones/trials.  But please don't bitch just to see your own words on these boards.<br />
<br />
OK, and yeah, PoT9 makes Druids better buffers than Shaman.  Please, pull your head out.  Last time I checked, although we can not buff mana for 8/tick (not significant when I can buy KEI anytime of the day or night) we can buff all stats (except int/wis), atk, hp, haste, hp regen and resists.  But I guess without mana regen we can't claim to be buffers.  Retarded, and goes to my point, we lose credibility with these ridiculous statements.<br />
<br />
Thunderwolf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Deceidon, I think the reason you're encountering such hostility is that you post statements that are either blatant lies, or displaying a casual lack of knowledge about the game, and other classes.<br />
<br />
Chanters have bad DPS?  You're joking, right?<br />
Shamans can buff better than druids?  What part of mana regen buff don't you understand?<br />
Necros useless.... I don't think EQ is actually the game you've been playing.  Here's a hint for you.  Go to http://lucy.allakhazam.com/ and read up on necro spells, because you obviously never have.<br />
<br />
It's possible that the most offensive part of your posting is your stance of &quot;I'm doing fine in my tier 1 and 2 groups, and LDoN - you're all a pack of pathetic whiners for not being satisfied in all other parts of the game&quot;.  It's this kind of &quot;stop rocking my apple cart&quot; mentality that basically demonstrates to the community that you really don't care about the state of the game for others - you simply want your own personal status quo preserved.<br />
<br />
You may possibly want to consider the idea that you MIGHT actually get past tier 2 someday, and enter zones for which your class is woefully unprepared.  Because, fellow shaman, the game really DOES change at that point.  And the 5% difference in slow doesn't MATTER when the entire zone mitigates to slightly slowed.  And you're basically a beastlord with crappy DPS.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and please stop harping about the oh-so-high price of the level 65 bst slow.  Once you hit EP's, not only are runes relatively easy for an exp group to get, but you can't BUY upgrades in the bazaar anymore, so ending up with 200kp in the bank is pretty easy to do.  Cost of spells doesn't really factor in.<br />
<br />
This isn't a EP's shaman vs. other shaman issue.  If you're not in EP's or farther, then you're fine, and play your happy EQ.  But don't turn your uneducated condescending gaze to the rest of the shamans and attempt to offer your &quot;advice&quot; - because you basically come off a troll with no idea what it is you're talking about.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have to say I'd trade my buffs for the druid buffs in a heart beat, and just don't see how you figure that shamans do continually more dps that druids.  Folks just do not run out of manna often.  Even in my small family guild, where everyone does not have tons of FT items, once you stack KEI and PoT9's on, folks just hardly ever run out of manna.  In fact in Ldons, I'm usually the one asking for a 30 second brake from pulling so I can hit canni iv a couple times and then Q myself.  The cleric yaulps and melees, while the druid and mage have crit nuking contests.<br />
<br />
You are right though, in the sense that 15 seconds fights are the cause of bitching.  They are becoming the norm, and they make Tormac's slows ineffective, and his DoT's ineffective, leaving me with dogdog, SoT, and tnargs as my prime skill set.  It is not fair to claim that the shaman complaints are just &quot;class envy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Seriously with &quot;15 second fights&quot; and chain pulling becoming the norm and manna regen trivial for all classes, how do shamans out dps druids?  I regularly have no dps at all on a mob except for dogdog, as I have no time to land a nuke and canni.  Our guild druid usually gets 2 four-figure nukes in on a mob before it goes down.  In these fast paced fights, how do shamans out damage druids over time?  Thats the dps of dogdog over 15 seconds versus 3-5k worth of druid nuking.  Even with mage weapons, haste, and FA I can't see dogdog outdoing the druid's nukes.  I want you to explain it to me, because I must be doing something wrong.  I expect in old world content, when fights lasted longer and I had time to add a dot or two I do out damage druids over a long time (maybe although druids lure dots are not bad either), but ussualy farm droga solo anyways, the guild druid is happier quading in PoP than joining me in Kunark.  Even if I did not bother to debuff a mob, and instead chained Velium Stike and or SoT me and dogdog are not out dpsing druids.<br />
<br />
Oh I do agree with you that our heals are not up to snuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Yes, thank you thunderwolf, for reminding us all that shamans can buff charisma!!  Almost as useful as str/dex buffs (that everyone has maxed without buffs by EP's)... I don't blame you for not understanding the high end game.

You know, I dont see a lot of people here with the attitude that we &quot;totally suck&quot; as you claim to see. I see a WHOLE lot saying &quot;minor tweaks is all we are asking&quot;, though, same as you. The vast majority of people posting on this topic have EXACTLY the same opinion. We need &quot;tweaking&quot;. Please link some posts to support your &quot;Everyone is saying Shaman Suck&quot; theory please. <br />
<br />
No one is saying we want Gates content trivialized. In fact, what I see is people saying that they want us ADJUSTED to CONTRIBUTE, not trivialize. Heck, half the stuff most are suggesting won't even AFFECT previous content, with the possible exception of a larger fast heal. A 1K nuke isnt gonna make anyone choose us over wizards, or make it any easier for us to solo dragons. Yeah, a better buff and debuff would be great overall, but its not a game-breaker, seriously. <br />
<br />
Stop picking out 1 or 2 guys, and claiming we are ALL frothing. We arent. Go read some threads. What I see is a whole lot of calm-yet-firm requests for the developers to do SOMETHING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Well, someone is not having a good time.  LW, your personal attacks are clearly the response of a small mind, so I will not bother to even address your rantings.  <br />
<br />
However, I have been reading these boards for over a year.  And yes, I have read, and understood, many differing opinions.  However, if you are trying to convince me that shaman are totally useless in the high-end game, which I am not in, then I will tell you that you are full of ****.  We may not be the best choice in a given situation or environment, but we can still contribute to the group in most.  Maybe not as a primary healer, maybe not as a high dps class, maybe not even with our buffing, debuffing and slowing.  But taken as a whole, we can still contribute, if even in a small way, in many areas.  That has always been a Shaman's strength.  You forfeit exceptional power in any given area for substantial power in many.  We may not always get a group in Gates, some folks will only go with a warrior, clerics and rogues/wizards.  But that does not make us useless, just not essential.  <br />
<br />
I can guarantee you that I will always contribute to any group I am in.  That makes me far from useless.  Others may be able to contribute more, that is a different issue, but a well played shaman is never useless.<br />
<br />
So just don't waste your time on me.<br />

Hey Deceidon, you have said we are all name calling and all frothing and some other untrue statements, why don't you scroll up to the last Murtak post and respond to that instead?  Yeah, the factual one that directly addresses your arguments, which you chose to ignore.</div></div><hr />

Hmm Thunder, you do realize that stat buffs are mostly worthless past a certain gear lvl don't you?  Now druids don't have haste, that is a weakness of theirs, but do have DS, better AC, better hp, hp regen, SOE, and every &quot;utility&quot; buff that shamans have.  There is a gap in credibility statements like this, but I can only assume that gap is created by a playing style gap.  There was a time when every class needed lots of stat buffs, but that day is long gone.  Buff slots are almost always full up, no one wants to waste a slot on a worthless stat buff if it means they do not get a heal over time, or a attack buff.  I'm not a &quot;end game shaman&quot; but even in my little guild, coming up against hard Ldons or GoD I can understand what the end gamers are complaining about. <br />
<br />
If PoT9 and Focus did not stack, I sure know which one I would pick.  If I had to pick between PoT9 and focus and every stat buff I have, Id still be asking for a 9.  Sure green twinks seem to love Hos and my stat buffs.  They regularly ask for them while Im in PoK auctioning for a KEI.  Sometimes, when they corner me and I stack Hos, Sta, Agil, Rgen, and Bhili on them they even give me 5 or 10 plat.  I've never had a white con player ask me for sevens and Sta, Agil, and bhili though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Wondering if you could link me a couple of the posts in which people are so adamant that we are lacking outside of GoD.   I have read most all the posts put up lately and haven't really seen this from anyone.  I coulda just missed or skimmed them though I s'pose.<br />
<br />
  Personally, my big problem with the game right now is that for a general exp group in the newest expansion, youa re tied down so heavily in what you can use.  Pet groups are pretty much impossible, kite groups not really a possibility, AE groups... maybe they'd work, never seen one in action ever before.  It's tank or die really.<br />
<br />
  For a while, we've had 3 options for an exp group tank.  3 options for an exp group slower, 3 options for healers, dozen options for DPS, and half a dozen snare options.   Now, the differences in quality of the snares, tanking, slows and DPS weren't dramatic, while the heals were rather noticeably on the short end with 1 of the 3 healers (us).  But it didn't matter that we blew all our mana healing for each mob, cause we were full mana again before the next arrived.<br />
<br />
  Now however, the options for tanking are limited a bit more.  The fact that SKs and Pallies can bring utilities such as snap aggro and FD pulling, or backup heals and stuns aren't as important as the fact that they don't have defensive for the final boss of a dungeon.<br />
<br />
  The options for healing are COMPLETELY limited.  Not even a druid can really function in the role that well.  They are where we used to be, just without the mana regen.  They go through quite a bit of blue bar just to keep a tank up, then have to take a break for a few.  Shaman simply can't heal at all for the GoD stuff, so now we are down to 2 classes healing.<br />
<br />
  Slows, DPS and snare are pretty much unchanged for the expansion except that slows and snare aren't really all that needed with how fast the fights are.<br />
<br />
  So really, I just fail to see how it is a problem to allow healing to have the same class distributions that tanking and slowing do.   For each there should be 1 person who is THE best at the RAW ability (warrior, cleric, shaman).   But the gap between the best and the other 2 should be one that is QUESTIONABLE.  For some encounters people perfer NOT to have a warrior because of aggro issues.  For slowing, unless you are limited on how many people you bring along, there is no reason to prefer 1 of the 3 over the others.  And for healing... nobody would prefer anyone over a cleric unless they knew that there was no threat of death at all.<br />
<br />
  Now, since in those 3 important areas, shaman used to be the only class on 2 lists.   But lately pallies match us on the healing, even though technically neither of us are on the list anymore.  So now it's more of a 3 tanks, 3 slowers and 2 and 2 halves healing classes.<br />
<br />
  Since slow is now quite heavily mitigated, and not always something that groups look toward, it was the hope of many shaman that our position on the OTHER list (healing) would be returned to us.   Since it has not, we've been simply searching for what else it is we are supposed to be doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">... OK, and yeah, PoT9 makes Druids better buffers than Shaman.  Please, pull your head out.

But I guess without mana regen we can't claim to be buffers.  Retarded, and goes to my point, we lose credibility with these ridiculous statements.<br />
<br />
Hm, let's look at those points real quick ...<br />
<br />
1. So you take the 14 mana/tick buff anytime day or night, but the 8 mana/tick is 'not significant'? /boggle<br />
<br />
2. We can buff all stats - yay us ultimate melee buffers. Unfortunately stats buffs are CAPPED. So we get only a very limited part of the intended buff benefits for every halfway decent geared melee (not including that stats over the soft cap give reduced benefits at top of that). For high-end melees the effect is zero.<br />
<br />
3. atk with FA i assume? Three of the four effects are stat buffs (see 2.), the 140  atk-buff is nice, granted but nicely offset by the ****ty 10 min duration (mind you with full AA buff extension). Contrary to that rangers get 70 atk-buffs, that last 1h 20 min... Call it class envy, but those are simple facts according to lucy.<br />
<br />
4. HP? Last i checked Bo9 grants more HPs than Fo7. Can be offset with an additional STA-buff though.<br />
<br />
5. haste - OK, you got me there - we got haste  ;) <br />
<br />
6. hp regen - hm, i thought druids share that spell line - not that it's extremely useful at the high-end to begin with.<br />
<br />
7. resists - druids resist spells are superior in effect and largely superior in duration.<br />
<br />
While the original statement was certainly a bit exaggerated, it was not 'retarded'.<br />
<br />
Considering that shaman are sold as one of the top buffing classes and THE top melee buffer, the gap here is quite small. Not that druids buffs are too good for actual content, no. Shaman buffs are not good/effective enough - especially the melee enhancing parts.<br />
<br />
Edit: I type too slow, much too slow - sigh. Some points already made by others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Well, someone is not having a good time.  LW, your personal attacks are clearly the response of a small mind, so I will not bother to even address your rantings.  <br />
<br />
However, I have been reading these boards for over a year.  And yes, I have read, and understood, many differing opinions.  However, if you are trying to convince me that shaman are totally useless in the high-end game, which I am not in, then I will tell you that you are full of ****.  We may not be the best choice in a given situation or environment, but we can still contribute to the group in most.  Maybe not as a primary healer, maybe not as a high dps class, maybe not even with our buffing, debuffing and slowing.  But taken as a whole, we can still contribute, if even in a small way, in many areas.  That has always been a Shaman's strength.  You forfeit exceptional power in any given area for substantial power in many.  We may not always get a group in Gates, some folks will only go with a warrior, clerics and rogues/wizards.  But that does not make us useless, just not essential.  <br />
<br />
I can guarantee you that I will always contribute to any group I am in.  That makes me far from useless.  Others may be able to contribute more, that is a different issue, but a well played shaman is never useless.<br />
<br />
So just don't waste your time on me.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I agree with you Thunder in the sense that shamans are not absolutely worthless.  Sure even mitigated, slow does something.  Even if we have a serious problem patch healing, Q will heal damage after a fight.  Focus, even if it is not excellent, does something positive (al least as long as it stacks with other players buffs).  But once you get to a point where the shaman's slow is not effective, the group would be better off with a different class taking up that slot. <br />
<br />
 A shaman is not as useful as other classes.  If you have a limited number of slots open, why pick the less useful people, unless you are trying to make the adventure artificially hard.  The upper content exaggerates shaman weaknesses, and minimizes shaman strengths.  Since many people want to &quot;win&quot; these encounters, and since these encounters are rather difficult, who is going to be the last person picked for one of the 6 slots in a group?  <br />
<br />
When you say &quot;we can contribute in many small ways&quot; realize many classes have these small ways in redundancy.  Many classes can root park, invis, heal during downtime, or cast these little utility spells.  There is no such thing as real utility outside of tanking, dps, and hps.  No one will pick a shaman thinking &quot;hmm I know shamans are good root parkers&quot; or &quot;now I just need a shaman to cast bhili&quot;.  The bottom line is we have no skill set that will make a loosing situation a win, that is not redundantly present in most all classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Thunderwolfjr, that's exactly the problem.  We can't contribute in a MEANINGFUL fashion in GoD.  I hate to keep saying that you're not there yet, so you don't know . . . but you don't!  I am so not kidding when I tell you that you have to form a certain type of group to progress, one that effectively carries a shaman's dead weight.<br />
<br />
Trials 7-9 in particular are brutal for a group with a shaman.  It's a horse race to see if you can do enough dps before the healers (almost certainly NOT a shaman) run out of mana.  You have typically less than 2 minutes before your cleric (almost chain casting holy light) is OOM.  Your second healer, either another cleric or a druid, does nothing but heal either.  That leave 4 slots.  One needs to be an enchanter.  One has to be a warrior/heavy tank (and it's hard w/o a warrior!).  That means that the shaman has to be a DPS class.  Our forte is NOT fast damage, and we have massive agro problems.<br />
<br />
People are NOT talking out of the butts on GoD.  It really IS that bad.  There is a reason so many of the high end shaman are quitting.  They are dead weight, and some of their guilds aren't even trying to carry them through.  Not cool, but there you have it.<br />
<br />
I am fortunate in that I have a very nice guild.  I had to put 5 groups together to get trial 7 alone done.  One of my shaman is at try number 14 and still not past it.  We are all heavily elemental/time geared.<br />
<br />
Please think about that.<br />

Thunder, I understand where you are and where you are coming from, but the point here is that you are only half correct. Stat buffs? Seriously man. Other than STA, which even most Bazaar Tanks have near max, our stat buffs are relatively useless. Druid hp buff is better than ours (if character is within 20 of max STA cap, in which case we need 2 slots), and Druids have the same regen buff we do. DS kinda offsets our haste. Our only superior resist buff is ToT, which is situational at best, whereas Seasons buffs are almost universally good (Fire and Cold are MUCH more common than Poison and Disease). Basically that leaves us with +9 mana regen vs the +attack of FA (since we have already establised that the stat portion of FA is relatively worthless). Please, which would you rather have? Which would ALL classes but 3 rather have (I do not count Zerkers yet, even SOE'sjury is still out on them). Which benefits the group more overall. Factor in that the druid heals SO much better, and/or can do SO much more DPS, and bring Snare, which is pretty good. OK, they cant slow. Er, thats why we brought the guy with that Pooka calling him Master along, or that other guy with the HUGE Tiger following him. I think its obvious where we stand in this debate. <br />
<br />
I agree that there are a few people here who are problably having to keep a box of Windex Wipes by their machines to wipe the spittle off the screen, but I also think that these guys are a minority. I see MOST of the more calm, intelligent posters here saying the same exact thing. Small tweaks in a few areas to re-establish our class as &quot;Jack of All&quot;. We need to fill roles. We need to be &quot;decent&quot; at a number of things. Hell, I dont even give a shizz if we have a &quot;Class Defining Ability&quot;. I dont care whether or not we are the &quot;Master of Anything&quot;. I KNOW I dont want to be a full-time healer man, but I think that I should be able to be a Back Up healer, and I also think that 2 Shaman, or a Druid Shaman combo in a group should be adequate ANYWHERE. As it is, in SOME (granted a small %, and I have had this arguement, and will provie links if you wish) we cannot even be adequate back-up healers to a CLERIC, much less a Druid. Are we Priests? Is a Nuke that doesnt take HALF the fight to cast too much to ask, since our DOTs have been so trivialized? Is it SO HARD to understand that the province we once OWNED, Buffing, has been so watered down with mudflation that even our own best HP buff is something like 5th on the list (Yeah, Clerics SHOULD be a lot better, Druids SHOULD be slightly better, but even Paladins, Rangers and BLs are better buffers than us, thats NOT right).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">We ALL AGREE, the shaman need some tweeks.  However, some of the chicken littles around here would make you believe that shaman are completely worthless, either in the high end game or even in many other zones.<br />
Well, completely worthless implies that not having a shaman along is better then having him and that is not the case, obviously. However I can not think of a single group combination in GoD where you would want to have a shaman along if you could freely choose classes.<br />
<br />
And for those complaining about Gates, lets not forget that it is not friendly to MANY classes.  So what is a ranger's role in Gates if a rogue or wiz is available?<br />
Weaponshield. Rangers can hold aggro on the boss for enough time for your charm pet to kill him. Snare for charm pets is also nice, as is harmonry for pulling. Oh and nice ATK buffs that you do not have to recast every 6 minutes.<br />
I will agree though that other classes do have problems in GoD too. That does not mean shaman do not need fixes. Both in GoD and elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, many have taken this to indicate that shaman sux as a class.  We do not.  But when you make these exaggerated claims of inadequacy and ask for unrealistic enhancements, then all you do is lose credibility.<br />
Regardless of content we have huge glaring issues. The kind of encounter that favors shaman is obviously going away for good and we need adjustments for that. But apart from that we have fallen so far behind other classes that even on perfect(for us) content we can not match other classes.<br />
- Beastlords outbuff us.<br />
- Paladins heal on par with us.<br />
- Rangers outnuke us.<br />
- Druids outdebuff us resists-wise.<br />
- The only way to outdamage druids, even over long periods of time is by using DoTs on MOBs where the druids superior debuffing and resist modifiers do not matter. Chainnuking for literally hours does not put us ahead of druids.<br />
- Even factoring in slow we do not outheal clerics. Shorter fights and slow mitigation make it obvious but even on half hour fights cleric outheal us.<br />
Other classes have been tuned to match us on slow paced content, then all content was made fast paced and then everyone received larger improvements then us. Yes, we do worse then everyone else in GoD or even LDoN hards. Yes, we are adequate in PoValor and the like. What I ask is, where do we do better then other classes? I can not tihnk of any place.<br />
<br />
No, Brenlo, Ryltan, or any of the developers will take us seriously if we continue to rant.  Our previous proposal was well done and resulted in some minor, yet appreciated, upgrades to our healing.  Maybe not enough, but better than nothing.<br />
Sadly our proposal did nothing. It was our, or more specifically Chutoi's ranting that worked. If rational arguments worked for getting upgrades we would have been fixed at the very least 6 months ago. And that proposal was the product of ranting, of whining and of analysis - thats where our arguments came from.<br />
<br />
OK, and yeah, PoT9 makes Druids better buffers than Shaman.  Please, pull your head out.  Last time I checked, although we can not buff mana for 8/tick (not significant when I can buy KEI anytime of the day or night) we can buff all stats (except int/wis), atk, hp, haste, hp regen and resists.<br />
8 mana per tick is insignificant? :rolleyes: Oh, and you missed damage shields there. And regeneration.<br />
Stats - useless. We are talking about GoD here. I have trouble finding anyone to slap charisma on on raids. Everything else is maxed for sure.<br />
ATK - You call 8 mana per tick insignificant? It is more useful then FA and moreover the druid does not have to recast it every 6 minutes. AAnd the spell the druid has to recast often,  the DS, is cheap.<br />
HP regen - worse then druid regeneration spells.<br />
Resists - same as druids, arguably worse.<br />
Haste - this is the one thing we do better then druids. And yes, haste is good.<br />
Overall we do outbuff druids when talking about what matters to melees. Druids outbuff us when buffing casters. I do not know who said we outbuff druids. In my opinion we are on par. But we certainly do not outbuff druids, and that &quot;8 mana per tick is insignificant&quot; bit is pretty ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">This is exactly the problem. Druids do not have better buffs, and shaman DO continually do more dps over a long time.<br />
Where? Anywhere my DoTs do not run for full druids outdamage me over any period of time. I have trouble having Bane run fully in groups without charm pets.<br />
<br />
The biggest complaint here is you people whining that in GoD fights don't last long enough for your dps to make a difference! The only #$@!%!# thing that's changed is the mobs hit harder and fell quicker. That's it. <br />
Let me explain that bit to you. MOBs hitting harder means our heal over time spells - the only heals which come close to what other healers can do - have less impact.<br />
Shorter fight times mean that my DoTs do not run for even close to their full duration.<br />
Shorter fight times mean that the MOB spends less time slowed but still spends the same time unslowed, thus reducing the value of slow.<br />
<br />
Thus short fights are detrimental to slows, debuffs in general, and DoTs. Massive damage is detrimental to heal over time spells.<br />
<br />
If you take away a shaman's DoTs, HoTs and debuffs what do you have?<br />
<br />
For christ's sake, stop spamming your incredible class envy crap. Half of its not even true, such as the above post. You will have your strengths and you will have your weaknesses, its the way EQ works. <br />
What strengths do shaman have in GoD?<br />
<br />
Oh, and you still have not told us what content your experiences are based upon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">First, thanks for being the first person to actually comprehend the post. Second, I think it is correct that GoD has had a hand in trivializing class abilities as they stand, but not just for shaman. Third, I believe the biggest problem lies in the fact that if they up abilities to a point where GoD isn't a challenge to classes, then they trivialize the vast majority of the content outside of GoD. That goes for Shaman, clerics, druids, and everyone else.<br />
<br />
Well I can understand your concerns if you view this as a desire to make God trivial Deceidon.  I don't see the concerns of shamans as the desire to remove all the challenge from GoD.  It seems to me though that the current design content directly nerfs shamans (constant slow mitigation) and indirectly nerfs shamans (quick paced fights) in particular, while requiring certain classes (the rise of the trinity again).  The issue is not that God is difficult, I think God should be difficult.  I applaud SOE for making it difficult.  The issue is that shamans in particular are becoming useless in the new style of content that SOE is producing.  <br />
<br />
Shaman's heals were balanced around Turgurs.  Now Turgurs is innefective.  This requires a new balanceing of shamans.  BLs DPS was not balanced around their slow.  Enchanters CC was not balanced around their slow.  The trivialization of slow effects shamans disproportionately to the other classes.  This is compounded by the fast pace of the game that hurts our other defining strength, manna regen, along with the trivialization of regen for other classes  <br />
<br />
The idea that shamans cannot be balanced because then they could easily heal in place of clerics and druids in trivial content holds no water in my opinion.  I've been in Bot a group where a high-end cleric out tanked the groups SK, and the group decided that the cleric should pull and tank instead of the SK. Dose this mean that the clerics need their stuns and plate taken away from them?  No I think, its just that the nature of the game is that old content becomes trivial by itself.  I've been in PoD groups where an elemental geared rogue out tanked a bazaar-geared warrior, and the group decided that the rogue should be main tank.  The vast majority of older content is already trivial.  The notions that shamans can not be balanced even though all our skills have been undercut by the newly designed content, is paramount to saying don't bother to take your shaman out of Kunark and Velious, he's really good there anyways, be happy slumming, and maybe you're guilds enchanter will link you some of the uber loot he's getting in God while you solo Droga.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you realise that druid dots are nearly our equal, and some say better too? and although minor that can buff strength too:) but a druid just nuking as they will unlikely run out of mana for a long time will out damage us easy, it not easiy to fix though as fast fights need fast dps.<br />
i myslef think it should be 2 ways a better dd (druids get 1800, why can we have a 1300 or so maybe more?) and and increase to mellee dps through buffs so a group witha  shaman will do noticeable more damage?<br />
thats not the case now, our buffs dont add that much to mellee dps. our lower quick damage was ofset but the buffs we gave group increasing their dps well.<br />
<br />
i quite happy to be a backup healer and have weakest heals but we need to bring something (and not just slow/debuff) to group that increase group dps, note group dps not shaman. (although a increase to our direct damaage spells is needed too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Look, I guess I need to be a little more clear, because I'm not getting my point across I think. I never intended to compare us to enchanters and necros, and I don't see why I'm being jumped on for that perception, because the majority of the bitching is people comparing Shaman's to other classes. Nevertheless, not my intent.<br />
<br />
I agree shaman's need something new. I'm not averse to a new nuke that's faster casting, or a better heal. However, I feel that asking for those things directly won't do any good, because actually getting those things will make a shaman more like the druid and the cleric, which I'm sure the devs will try to avoid. Druids bring very little utility to a group in comparison to shaman, no matter how much you all scream otherwise.<br />
Don't bother telling me that druids can dot almost as well as we can when I've already been told repeatedly that dot's no longer matter because of the new content, since the dps is too low. Don't tell me how the druid hp buff brings extra mana regen when its already been pounded into my head by my peers here on the Crucible that mana regen no longer matters. <br />
Bottom line is, druids nuke better than us. Druids have *always* nuked better than us. So why are you crying about what druids can do? Heals? Hell yes, we need a better heal to bring us more in line with the content, not the other classes.<br />
<br />
Last time I'll bother bringing it up, and I'm sorry to have offended anyone with this whole debate, but I really think our position on this issue as a whole is not the face you want to present to the devs. Remember, I'm not disagreeing with you about needing more. I just think there are other ways to go about it, and I do not agree that we're as broken as some say we are.<br />

<br />
Hell yes you should only look at the content. Stop bitching about what druids and enchanters and beastlords can do. We aren't nukers, never were. I said I wouldn't mind having a better nuke, but i doubt that we'd get one. Hell, i wouldn't mind having a spell called Armageddon that flattened every mob in a five zone radius and gave me xp for it. But I'm trying to be realistic here. <br />
<br />
Content does not dictate that we should have more burst dps, because were never a burst dps class. Again, we are not nukers. From the beginning of EQ we've relied heavily on the lasting power of our DoTs. New content dictates that our dots aren't as effective due to the shortened combat encounters, but asking to become nukers goes against what the shaman brings to the table, and has always brought to the table. As I said before, which I'm sure you failed to read, we do need better healing to bring us more in line with the content not the other classes. <br />
<br />
We have always been a DoT dmg utility priest class. Always. You're asking for that to change and it won't. What we need is more freakin utility. Lots of shaman here have made some outstanding suggestions to that effect, and you're more likely to see any of that happen than us getting bigger and better nukes. Go for the heal, because we deserve it, and its part of what we do, and what we bring to any encounter, GoD or otherwise. Go for the group effect utilities, because that is what we are. Don't bitch about druids and wizards outnuking us, because that's what they do.<br />
<br />
You want to be desired in new content encounters. Utility and better healing power are the keys there, not upgrades in offensive dps, becuase the odds of shaman getting that are nil. Shamans were not designed to be fast killing machines, bottom line. You can bitch and scream all you want, but if you don't ask for the right things, you're never gonna get them. Not that bitching and screaming is the right tactic, which is what this post was about to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I've read that you say we need more healing, but you've also said that we shouldn't get it because it'll bring us closer to clerics, and you've also said that we shouldn't look at other classes when balancing, so excuse me if I'm confused on exactly which statement takes precedence.<br />
<br />
I referred to nuking and healing because those were your examples in the post I was replying to.  I'd be fine with other utility that makes us desirable in the new fast-paced world as well.<br />
<br />
I think we're generally on the same page on the fact that shamans need... something.  You just seem to think that merely asking for changes that might make us relevant in the new high-end content is bitching, whereas I think it's necessary to have any chance of seeing anything come to fruition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">No, I said that bitching about what druids can do and then whining about what we can't do is the wrong way to go about it. I said that we need a new heal, but that giving us anything more than what druids already have puts us in the precarious position of being too close to clerics, not to mention you'll have the druids in an uproar, no doubt. You have to understand the position of the devs in this, as well. They bump us, odds are they'll have to bump someone else to make them happy. Will they? Who knows. I think if they eased us into a new heal and some sort of new utility, we'd be fine, and it wouldn't step on anyone else's toes, but that's my opinion, which is worth squat around here ;) <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm all for an upgrade that doesn't put us in the position of calling attention from the other classes. Be careful what you ask for. And for the sake of the community, be careful how you ask for it. You may not mind being percieved as a whiner, but I don't wanna be lumped in there with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">But what sort of healing upgrade could possibly balance the scales and make us wanted for Ikky raids and groups?  I have yet to find a mob that wasn't either immune or that slowed better than &quot;slightly&quot;.  Every time we'd get multiple mobs on a pull I'd try to use root CC and found that they're immune to that too.  Take away shaman slows entirely and you're left with a 4th rate healer and quite probably the worst DPS class in the game.  Unless the zone changes, shaman would have to get heals BETTER than a cleric in order to justify their existance in the zone, which obviously isn't going to happen.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I think SOE has painted themselves into a corner with this expansion.  They've decided that quick twitch fights are the way they want to work and shaman in particular do not adapt well to this sort of fight.  Either they'll have to adapt the shaman class to their new environment or they'll have to adapt the environment to fit the shaman skill set better.  At present, there's a large balance issue between the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Look, I guess I need to be a little more clear, because I'm not getting my point across I think. I never intended to compare us to enchanters and necros, and I don't see why I'm being jumped on for that perception, because the majority of the bitching is people comparing Shaman's to other classes. Nevertheless, not my intent.<br />
<br />
I agree shaman's need something new. I'm not averse to a new nuke that's faster casting, or a better heal. However, I feel that asking for those things directly won't do any good, because actually getting those things will make a shaman more like the druid and the cleric, which I'm sure the devs will try to avoid. Druids bring very little utility to a group in comparison to shaman, no matter how much you all scream otherwise.<br />
Don't bother telling me that druids can dot almost as well as we can when I've already been told repeatedly that dot's no longer matter because of the new content, since the dps is too low. Don't tell me how the druid hp buff brings extra mana regen when its already been pounded into my head by my peers here on the Crucible that mana regen no longer matters. <br />
Bottom line is, druids nuke better than us. Druids have *always* nuked better than us. So why are you crying about what druids can do? Heals? Hell yes, we need a better heal to bring us more in line with the content, not the other classes.<br />
<br />
Last time I'll bother bringing it up, and I'm sorry to have offended anyone with this whole debate, but I really think our position on this issue as a whole is not the face you want to present to the devs. Remember, I'm not disagreeing with you about needing more. I just think there are other ways to go about it, and I do not agree that we're as broken as some say we are.<br />
<br />
Dec<br />
<br />
I'm sorry Deceidon, but I dont understanding what you're getting at.<br />
<br />
I'm not worried that Druids nuke harder than I do.  However there was a point made that shamans have better dps than druids, and I wanted to give examples of why that is not true. I am not complaining about Druids being able to out nuke me, I'm concerned about people who post that shamans out damage druids when it is clear that druid's dps is better.<br />
<br />
When people say manna regen no longer matters it is exactly because of KEI and PoT9.  The fact that everyone has easy access to high manna regen of enchanters and druids is the reason why it does not matter.<br />
<br />
I've read that druids bring very little to the table before, but Ive yet to see any evidence of that.  Buffs versus buffs druids and shamans seem about equal, with the nod going to druids imho.  Nukes clearly go to druids.  Healing clearly goes to druids.  Slowing clearly goes to us.  Dots are close, with the nod going to shamans.  Druids have snare, evac, tracking, harmony, and ports.  Dogdog is clearly superior to cubby.  All the little utility spells that shamans have druids also have.  <br />
<br />
When you say &quot;Druids bring very little utility to a group in comparison to shaman, no matter how much you all scream otherwise.&quot; I'm at a loss. What is the uber power that shamans have?  I need some advice, because I do nto see it in Tormac. Besides not having slow what do I have that druids do not.  Dogdog is better than cubby, yes, but I'd trade the old mut for nukes that make mages complain or heals that make clerics nervous any day of the week.  The only thing that shamans are clearly better than druids at is slowing, and the power of slow has been undone by mitigation and fast fights.<br />
<br />
The problem with the call for a higher level of civility is that it does not seem to work.  Sure I think that any post to SOE should be polite and literate, but the only time Ive seen us get any kind or attention is after some of the outspoken shamans complained loudly.<br />
<br />
edited-because well I should proof read these things</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Actually, the comment about shaman and druid dps was a long term comparison. No one said that shaman out dps druids, especially in quick combat content. <br />
<br />
Ports, snares, harmony has no bearing on GoD level encounters. So many classes can snare, and harmony is damn near useless there. Ports are a big whoopie since the release of PoP, which leaves dots (encounters are too short) nukes (something they've always done better than us) heals (we should be on par) and buffs (one buff with less hp and mana regen that doesnt' stack with any cleric buff other than kazaad...you tell me how that's so all encompassing of a buff that it destroys shaman buffing utility). <br />
<br />
So..what's your point? I'm happy for druids, they perform their role. What's our role? Buff..we all agreed that we could use some better utility buffs becuase of stat cap limitations on the usefulness of stat buffs. I'd go so far as to say we could use a much better hp buff than what we currently have. But I like some of the ideas that have been tossed around on the crucible, namely group effect buffs like damage out put, etc. <br />
<br />
Slow..agreed that the fights are fast and the difference in slows isn't that big a deal (although that's another discussion by itself) so our defining ability to slow is in less demand than it is outside GoD. Not gonna get a better slow, I think that's already been decided. I think we should get an AA insta cast slow or soemthing to that effect. <br />
<br />
DPS - We never were a dps class. Want better nukes?Then you'll probably have to play a druid or a wizard. That's what they do, not us. When I crit for 2k with VS i get all giddy..sure wizards smirk at me and shake their heads, but I'm not a wizard, and when I hit for that kind of damage I like it. Why? Because I'm not a nuker, its nice to be able to get that occasional crit and see a damage spike. I still manage to get a VS or two off in a fight, and aggro isn't as bad as what's on a dot, so I do alright by that. I'd like a faster casting version, but then again, I've accepted the fact that I'm not a nuker. Maybe we could get some AA that raise our pets offensive capabilites, or something. <br />
<br />
Heals - Bring it on. There's a thousand different ways you can raise healing potential via spells and AA's that I don't see any reason why they couldn't improve a shaman's healing capability. <br />
<br />
I still think some of you want more than know you need or will ever get. And I really don't think getting loud about it gets attention. Only attention i see is negative attention. You get enough people going in the right direction, though, and you can see results.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well so and so wrote a nice letter to SoE and got ignored, now the seven of us are going to bitch hysterically until we get our way&quot;. That is not the answer. Apply a little tact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">You have to compare a class to other classes to have a discussion about balance.

So, you subscribe to thott's old graph I take it?  Here's a clue for you: in the long term of short battles, shaman do the least DPS of every single class in the game that does damage (yes even clerics can contribute more)<br />
<br />
Ports, snares, harmony has no bearing on GoD level encounters. So many classes can snare, and harmony is damn near useless there. Ports are a big whoopie since the release of PoP, which leaves dots (encounters are too short) nukes (something they've always done better than us) heals (we should be on par) and buffs (one buff with less hp and mana regen that doesnt' stack with any cleric buff other than kazaad...you tell me how that's so all encompassing of a buff that it destroys shaman buffing utility). <br />
<br />
1. harmony: most GOD zones are outdoor, no?  Tell me how harmony is useless for pulling singles.<br />
2. Ports: agreed, useless for the most part since POP<br />
3. buffs: Po9+ cleric symbol = more hp than virtue and the 8 mana regen; this is a downfall to druids how?  Shaman buff is less HP (frankly this is fine by me, but you asked how we buff less so I am showing you) and it has some stats that are useless for a lot of people in the high end.<br />
<br />
So..what's your point? I'm happy for druids, they perform their role. What's our role? Buff..we all agreed that we could use some better utility buffs becuase of stat cap limitations on the usefulness of stat buffs. I'd go so far as to say we could use a much better hp buff than what we currently have. But I like some of the ideas that have been tossed around on the crucible, namely group effect buffs like damage out put, etc. <br />
<br />
Finally you hint at what you think our strength is.  Sadly, buffing is not a shaman strength any longer.  Stat buffs are useless, our resist buff is situationally useful, avatar's usefullness is behind beastlord ferocity (ferocity is more atk and adds resists)--granted that they do stack, but in an age of too many buffs and too few buffslots, people are clicking off avatar for ferocity if they have to choose.  The only shaman buff then is focus, for the HP component and not much else.<br />
<br />
DPS - We never were a dps class. Want better nukes?Then you'll probably have to play a druid or a wizard. That's what they do, not us. When I crit for 2k with VS i get all giddy..sure wizards smirk at me and shake their heads, but I'm not a wizard, and when I hit for that kind of damage I like it. Why?

<br />
No one wants to be like a wizard.  Stop trying to make it seem like this (this goes for you and everyone else who thinks its a fun argument).  We were slated to get some pet enhancing AA's but those were dropped at some point.  Also, we aren't a DPS class (this should be obvious to everyone), but we aren't a healer and we aren't utility, so what exactly are we?<br />
<br />
I still think some of you want more than...you need or will ever get. And I really don't think getting loud about it gets attention. Only attention i see is negative attention. You get enough people going in the right direction, though, and you can see results.<br />

Squeaky wheel gets the grease.  If you say nothing you get nothing because everyone assumes you are doing okay.  The shaman class is not doing okay in the areas the game is going in; I'm sorry if you dont see that.  Easy LDON and tier3 and lower aside, shaman have some serious issues in group desireability.</div></div><hr />

All you do is say we bring &quot;more utility&quot; to a group. What utility? Seriously, list it. We do not bring more utility to a group then a druid or even a cleric. Less if anything. Shaman utility is a myth.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, druids nuke better than us. Druids have *always* nuked better than us. So why are you crying about what druids can do? Heals? Hell yes, we need a better heal to bring us more in line with the content, not the other classes.<br />
If we were balanced to content we would have a HoT doing 5K per tick and a CH that casts instantly by now. The nuking classes wouzld actually have their damage downgraded. Balancing the classes is the only thing that makes sense.<br />
<br />
Content does not dictate that we should have more burst dps, because were never a burst dps class. Again, we are not nukers. From the beginning of EQ we've relied heavily on the lasting power of our DoTs.<br />
Clerics outnuke us.<br />
Rangers outnuke us.<br />
Are those nuking classes? Have those classes always been outnuking us?<br />
<br />
New content dictates that our dots aren't as effective due to the shortened combat encounters, but asking to become nukers goes against what the shaman brings to the table, and has always brought to the table.<br />
So if we loose some of our major strengths we should just suck it up and get nothing in return? We did that for quite a few expansions now. It is time we got some of what everyone else got.<br />
<br />
We have always been a DoT dmg utility priest class. Always. You're asking for that to change and it won't. What we need is more freakin utility.<br />
You mean like druids? Oh, I forgot, shaman already bring more utility to groups then druids :p <br />
<br />
Go for the heal, because we deserve it, and its part of what we do, and what we bring to any encounter, GoD or otherwise. Go for the group effect utilities, because that is what we are. Don't bitch about druids and wizards outnuking us, because that's what they do.<br />
Here is what happened. For the last couple of expansions we had fewer nuke upgrades then every single other class. We are asking for a part of what those other classes got. If we actually got nukes like &quot;we always did&quot; we would have the same nukes as clerics except without the recast times.<br />
<br />
No, I said that bitching about what druids can do and then whining about what we can't do is the wrong way to go about it. I said that we need a new heal, but that giving us anything more than what druids already have puts us in the precarious position of being too close to clerics, not to mention you'll have the druids in an uproar, no doubt.<br />
We are asking for LESS of a heal then druids have now.<br />
<br />
Actually, the comment about shaman and druid dps was a long term comparison. No one said that shaman out dps druids, especially in quick combat content. <br />
Or in the long term. Druids put out more DPS then us, period.<br />
<br />
Ports, snares, harmony has no bearing on GoD level encounters.<br />
 :eek: <br />
<br />
So many classes can snare, and harmony is damn near useless there. <br />
Especially with a snare that lasts as long as charm, eh? Only two classes can do that. Oh, and surely pulling singles is useless. But tell me, what utility do shaman bring to a group?<br />
<br />
Ports are a big whoopie since the release of PoP,<br />
Not ports - in zone evacs. One of the sewers for example requires either this or a lot more DPS to complete.<br />
<br />
which leaves dots (encounters are too short) nukes (something they've always done better than us) heals (we should be on par)<br />
How are we on par with druid heals?<br />
<br />
and buffs (one buff with less hp and mana regen that doesnt' stack with any cleric buff other than kazaad...you tell me how that's so all encompassing of a buff that it destroys shaman buffing utility). <br />
And charm. And damage shields. And stuns.<br />
<br />
DPS - We never were a dps class. Want better nukes?Then you'll probably have to play a druid or a wizard.<br />
We are asking for less upgrades, percentage-wise, then the other classes got. How is that asking for something we never did?<br />

Please excuse me if I misunderstood.  I basically read you as saying that SoE should adjust the content so as to make the shaman class useful, rather than adjusting the shaman to fit the content.<br />
<br />
While I understand the thought, the application is . . . problematical.  Changing content like that requires a fundamental rewrite of the entire expansion.  It's not going to happen.  Further, I think it's fairly obvious that the intent of SoE is to move to a faster, more dynamic game.  Your suggested change (as I understand it) merely exacerbates the problem.<br />
<br />
Given the direction SoE has gone in GoD, and seems to want to continue to go, the shaman as a current concept is outdated.  It's a lot easier to adjust the shaman than to adjust an entire expansion.<br />

<br />
the incessant whining being cross posted to every server and class board on the net <br />

You're no doubt wishing you could take back one of these statements, as they're completely contradictory.<br />

Third, I believe the biggest problem lies in the fact that if they up abilities to a point where GoD isn't a challenge to classes, then they trivialize the vast majority of the content outside of GoD.<br />
<br />
How many times does this argument have to be refuted?  People have routinely two-boxed Vox.  Virtually every class has soloed the Kunark dragons.  How much more trivialized do you think this content can get?  People with access to no-drop spells from GoD aren't interested in mowing through Karnor's.  And if they are, they already can.  Get over it.  Even normal LDoNs are already trivialized, and that's only a second-generation expansion. <br />

So..what's your point? I'm happy for druids, they perform their role. What's our role? Buff..we all agreed that we could use some better utility buffs becuase of stat cap limitations on the usefulness of stat buffs. I'd go so far as to say we could use a much better hp buff than what we currently have. But I like some of the ideas that have been tossed around on the crucible, namely group effect buffs like damage out put, etc. <br />
<br />
Slow..agreed that the fights are fast and the difference in slows isn't that big a deal (although that's another discussion by itself) so our defining ability to slow is in less demand than it is outside GoD. Not gonna get a better slow, I think that's already been decided. I think we should get an AA insta cast slow or soemthing to that effect. <br />
<br />
DPS - We never were a dps class. Want better nukes?Then you'll probably have to play a druid or a wizard. That's what they do, not us. When I crit for 2k with VS i get all giddy..sure wizards smirk at me and shake their heads, but I'm not a wizard, and when I hit for that kind of damage I like it. Why? Because I'm not a nuker, its nice to be able to get that occasional crit and see a damage spike. I still manage to get a VS or two off in a fight, and aggro isn't as bad as what's on a dot, so I do alright by that. I'd like a faster casting version, but then again, I've accepted the fact that I'm not a nuker. Maybe we could get some AA that raise our pets offensive capabilites, or something. <br />
<br />
Heals - Bring it on. There's a thousand different ways you can raise healing potential via spells and AA's that I don't see any reason why they couldn't improve a shaman's healing capability. <br />
<br />
I still think some of you want more than know you need or will ever get. And I really don't think getting loud about it gets attention. Only attention i see is negative attention. You get enough people going in the right direction, though, and you can see results.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well so and so wrote a nice letter to SoE and got ignored, now the seven of us are going to bitch hysterically until we get our way&quot;. That is not the answer. Apply a little tact.<br />
<br />
My point is we have no extra utility over Druids Deceidon.  You said that &quot;Druids bring very little utility to a group in comparison to shaman, no matter how much you all scream otherwise.&quot; but have yet to show what this utility is.  I listed many &quot;utility&quot; skills that Druids get that shamans do not.  When you said utility you could not have ment dps or healing, since druids are clearly better than us at both of those.  <br />
<br />
I know that you mentioned DPS long term, but the thing is the environment that people are complaining about consists of many short-term fights.  &quot;Long term&quot; is a series of small fast paced battles where druid's nukes offer considerable dps, and shamans offer inferior dps.  I agree that we were never a dps class, but when you claim that we can out dps druids, I explained why you are wrong.  I never said I wanted better nukes, I said druids nuke for more dps than shamans.  Maybe you envision that druids run out of manna after nuking twice, and need to med while shamans remain ever full.  That is certainly not the case with the druids in my guild, sure they can not chain nuke continously, but they can easily snare mobs, and maintain more steady dps that shamans.<br />
<br />
I have to ask if you can see the pattern of the discussion Deceidon.  You claim that shamans can out dps druids.  Specific examples are given that show why in the new fast paced content shamans can not out dps druids, then you complain that now we want better nukes so we can out nuke druids.<br />
<br />
You call others whiners, and yet you curse, ignore people's arguments, and use statements out of context to try to show conclusions that are roughly 180 degrees form the points being made.<br />
<br />
The confusing thing is I think you and I actually agree; shamans need upgraded heals to make up for constant slow mitigation, our buffs are weak, and shamans need some rebalancing.<br />
<br />
You make statements about druids having no utility, and after I list druid vs shaman utility you claim that utility has no importance in GoD anyways.  You complain about people are &quot;name calling and bashing just to get your point across&quot;, and yet it feels like you are trying to start arguments with me over points that you and I seem to agree with me on.<br />
<br />
Why are you complaining so much Deceidon?  You end up saying the exact same thing that those who you are complaining about are saying.</div></div><hr />

Couple of things real quick..Murtak, you do a good job of quoting and answering, but you're apparently not even reading the quotes you're responding to. When i say we bring more utility, I mean that's our function, and if you'll notice, you even quoted me saying that we need more to add to our existing function. As far as all of the druid utility you claim they bring, I still disagree. Our current utility, that being buffs, needs some work and I've admitted as much.  No need to beat on me there. But the real discussion isn't about utility, from what I read. Its about dps, and it always keeps coming back to that.<br />
<br />
If we were balanced to content we would have a HoT doing 5K per tick and a CH that casts instantly by now.<br />
<br />
You're absolutely right. I even told you that to be more in line with content we would need a heal upgrade. So we agree?<br />
<br />
How do you figure clerics outnuke us? A seven second casting 1100 pt nuke with a seven second recast time? How does that figure into your argument about the length of a fight and our dps being useless. What about that recast time makes you think their nuking capability is any better than ours? This is the point where I start to condemn you as bitching to be bitching, in my mind, because that's exactly what you're doing. Rangers? They don't outnuke us. Sure, their nukes are fairly powerful, and back when the hybrid mana pool actually showed a deficit, that would be more in line, but the only thing they have goin for them there is a faster casting time, for less damage.<br />

So if we loose some of our major strengths we should just suck it up and get nothing in return? We did that for quite a few expansions now. It is time we got some of what everyone else got.<br />
<br />
No, and now I feel as if i'm talking to a child. Read it, and try to comprehend it. I said if you're asking for nukes, you're not gonna get it. Ask for contributions that are more in line with what a shaman is. What about that comment you quoted led you to believe I said you should shut up and suck it up?<br />
<br />
How are we on par with druid heals?<br />

Take a closer look. I said we *should* be on par, I didn't say that we were. <br />
<br />
Do you see the enormous stickied thread at the top of the forums? Is that &quot;a nice letter&quot;? <br />
<br />
If you'll go back through the thread (you did read it, right?) you'll see numerous times that people told me the only way to get any attention was to cry and cry loud. <br />
<br />
Other than the insults about me being a BoT bot and other derogatory comments from those that don't have anything more constructive to add, I'm just beginning to expand into GoD, but I did spend the entire weekend there last weekend getting my ass kicked. I'm not gonna lie, I had fun. I felt it some too, so I do relate. But I'm not broken. Far from it. Help me out with my utility and some heals and I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

These can be chain cast in sucession without recast ever coming into play.  Its not really possible to compare our rains to cleric nukes for single target situations, due to the fact that foci do not affect rains and resist rate for rains are higher then normal nukes.  For single target situations clerics very much do outnuke us, thou it does take them 2 spell spots to do so.<br />
<br />
For many target situtations they have PB aes, we have rains that hit only 4 targets, so they also out nuke us in these situations.<br />
<br />
When there are 2 to 4 mobs that do not need to be mezzed we can outnuke them with rains.<br />

Not in the slightest. We need to be balanced against the other classes, within the context of the current content. How you can even propose to balance us without looking at, detracting from, or catching up to other classes is beyond me.<br />

By using two of their nearly identical nukes.<br />

No, and now I feel as if i'm talking to a child. Read it, and try to comprehend it. I said if you're asking for nukes, you're not gonna get it. Ask for contributions that are more in line with what a shaman is.<br />
So we should get more useless disease DoTs and more stat buffs? We used to nuke just as well as clerics. Is it now to much to ask to nuke slightly below them?<br />

How are we on par with druid heals?<br />
Take a closer look. I said we *should* be on par, I didn't say that we were. <br />

not that your not doing a great job already but i feel compelled to also point out that beast and ranger both have several (epecialy with god) high nukes that they can load at the same time and nuke, negating the 30 recast on the ones that do, and they can use lower version of our and druid nukes. and they have the spell slots to do this easily. (ranger even better as have cold and fire nukes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">For four years we had no problems?<br />
<br />
I found it 10x easier to get malos UNGUILDED than I got malo guilded, and ditto for quiessence versus torpor -- make that 20 or 30x.  Getting spells now is CAKE compared to what it used to be.  <br />
<br />
And our healing has in the last couple years been &quot;fixed&quot; not once but TWICE, each time after acrimonious battles.  Clerics were spamming every board possible that they were going on strike or quitting when we got CHLOROBLAST for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
I have NO idea why you chose to bring your complaints about your 57 necro into this discussion.  It lends absolutely nothing of relevance.<br />
<br />
If you knew more about necros yourself, you'd realize how strong they were too, by the way.<br />
<br />
And regarding BL's extra DPS being balanced against us by virtue of their having a lesser slow -- you don't seem to be aware that having a better slow counts for nothing against UNSLOWABLE MOBS, and that when slows are mitigated, the difference between a 65% and a 75% slow becomes trivial -- especially against mobs that die in 30 seconds.  The extra damage done by a mob slowed 10% more, when slow only lands 10 seconds into the mob's life and it dies in 30 seconds, is just not something that matters.<br />
<br />
As to the &quot;uber&quot; rarity of a BL's slow -- please don't ever compare the problems someone can have getting a PoP spell in the bazaar or off a rune with what shamans have to put up with.  First of all, rune spells are something anyone can get.  Second, they sell in the bazaar for a lot less than the 100k that torpor/malo used to go for.  Third, they're far, far less rare.  You know what?  A lot of people bought torpor or malos for 100k or thereabouts -- when it was available on the market every six months.  And when making money was MUCH harder in the old game.  To all the people who REALLY know the history of the cost and availability of spells in this game, crying over a BL's having to spend 30k to buy a spell really is just not going to be happening.  And if you're too cheap to buy or can't find the spell in the bazaar on one particular day, runes drop like water these days.  Go get one!  Try BOT towers, for instance, or Sol Ro.  You can do those mobs with two good groups, and some do them with less -- and they drop runes and are up a lot.<br />
<br />
Enchanters low DPS?  Farmed Vxed the other day with one using a pet.  The rest of us might as well have not been there except to resnare the pet when charm broke.  In and out, boom boom boom.  Mobs died in what, 15 seconds? 10?  Yeah, chanters are low DPS and can't replace us...okay.<br />
<br />
If you and/or Thunderwolf are still thrilled at getting what he calls &quot;uber loots&quot; is it?, then great.  The problem is, other people besides shamans are finally realizing in critical numbers what some shamans themselves don't realize or are trying to not think about, perhaps because it's too shocking or depressing to think so.  <br />
<br />
GoD has I think encouraged all classes to evaluate very tightly exactly what it is they do and do not need in groups, and the requirements can be pretty strict.  Once they learn they can get by in tight groups going through GoD without a shaman's much-vaunted slows, there is nothing to stop that insight from permeating the rest of their game.  They're not fools.<br />
<br />
I used to get LDON invites all the time before GoD; now they are very rare to the point of being almost non-existent.  PoP zone invites are still there, but also far rarer.  As people understand that you can get substantially what a shaman brings by inviting a chanter or a beastlord, and more besides, like better healing and DPS by inviting more classes that really heal or DPS well if you need it, the practice of making shamans what you get when you can't get anything better is becoming commonplace among people who know the game well and fairly common among people who are just catching on.  GoD has pointed out our limitations, and those limitations are based on our class, not just on GoD itself.  <br />
<br />
Perception matters.  And people have now been educated in no uncertain terms to perceive shamans as distinctly behind the power and utility curve when they put together groups everywhere, not just in GoD, because GoD highlights our weaknesses so thoroughly and definitively.  And the idea that shamans are far behind the power curve, all rah-rah cheerleading aside, is not just an idea without a basis in reality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Finally, Deceidon, you seem to simply blow off all people's comments on your assertions with some sort of &quot;I'm happy being me, tra~la, tra~la!&quot; thing.  That's swell that you love yourself.  Never hurts in life.  But celebrating and reiterating your obliviousness is something out of place on a message board.  You wrote something, people replied, and you happily sing back that you're ignoring their responses -- and top it off with a &quot;let them be druids!&quot;  <br />

If you didn't really want to have an interaction with people, just blow of steam or say how much you love yourself, or that everyone should just play a druid if they didn't agree with your really not very well made points -- why did you post here at all?  You could have sung the same song to your teddy bear in bed, and faster, and gotten about the same interaction it seems you might have been looking for, and the same snuggly, low-expectation wonderfulness.<br />
<br />
At any rate, speaking as though you're trying to lead or contribute to a good discussion while repeatedly telling people who disagree with you that they're &quot;whining&quot; and &quot;whiners,&quot; that they are &quot;bitching&quot;, that they have no reading comprehension, etc., is certainly going to bring you the flames you would expect. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I agree with everything said about the ineffectiveness of shamans in higher end content. I agree new heals or DPS is needed to help us in those areas. But my question is what about the other areas? Sure, there are a ton of people 65 and in the game's high end content, but there are a whole lot more people 65 and still in BoT. Since there is no way to distinguish these two crowds, I would not hold your breath, as giving shaman new heals would make other classes not as effective as us, and those classes would then turn around and use the same arguments back on us. Sorry, but in my opinion, there won't be any changes to shaman JUST to please the folks in GoD. Class balance is just that.....ALL around balance, not just in the high end.

Murtak, I'm gonna start over, and lay it out as simply as I can in the hopes that you won't keep taking it out of context and completely missing the point.<br />
<br />
Firstly, don't cry about other classes, because it makes us all look bad. <br />
<br />
Second, don't ask for things you know you won't get. Especially while crying about other classes.<br />
<br />
Third, we need healing capability that can bring us in line with the content, not the druids. I don't care how much a damn druid can heal for, as long as I can heal well enough to be desirable as a group member in high end content. This should never be about us versus them.<br />
<br />
Fourth, utility is/was a shaman's biggest asset. We need a return to that, by further enhancing the utility we bring to the group. <br />
<br />
I'm not goin to argue the capabilities of the druid with you, because they are not the golden children of EQ you seem to think they are. Nor am I going to debate with you about how useless shaman are, becuase while I agree on some points, I do not feel that we are utterly broken.<br />
<br />
That was all.  Shred that as you like, but it doesn't get any simpler than that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">First, anyone discussing &quot;utility&quot; as a shaman class feature either needs to define it better, or admit that they are still playing 3 expansions ago.  Back in the Luclin-and-earlier days, there were utility classes and utility effects - things that could be done other than raw tanking, raw healing, and raw dps.  The number of these that have remained useful has shrunk as the difficulty curve of mobs has pushed against the upper end of several class's models.  Regeneration was important in the days of the Fungi Tunic; now it is a wasted buff slot (anyone arguing that 25 hp/tick matters, at all, anymore, needs to come back to this discussion after sitting down to understand the game's math).  Stat buffing has become irrelevant as gear has pushed most - if not all - stats first near, then to, and now far far beyond their hard caps.  Movement speed enhancement has been rendered obsolete by IRS/SJ.  And, most importantly for shaman, slow is being phased out of &quot;utility&quot; because of a two-pronged changed to the game; mitigation makes it less effective in general, and low hp, high resist mobs simply die too quickly for slow to have an effect (if the mob only would have 3 rounds of combat after slow lands, then its effect is essentially trivial).  There *are* still &quot;utility&quot; effects that are useful in the new model of EQ.  Damage shields used to be considered utility - now, an argument can be made that they are a factor in raw DPS (and another fact that works counter to slow, I might add).  Evacs (NOT ports) are a death-management effect, and in some cases (Trial 2) are an integral part of the content.  Charms have gone from being a risk to the party to being the only way to kill the new content in sane amouns of time.  Snare is useful anywhere that mobs can run, and anywhere where pets might be charmed (between the 2 of those, that's everywhere).  But none of these useful &quot;utility&quot; features are the domain of shaman.<br />
<br />
Seriously ... what 60+ shaman spells are &quot;utility&quot; spells, anyway?  Roots are just a poor man's mez.  Slows, as I mentioned are waning (if needs be, i can prove their lack of value mathmatically - I'd prefer to save the board the numbers if they aren't needed).  And ... that's it.  There ARE NO utility spells (if someone says Tiny Terror, they need to be laughed off to DAOC or something).  And so, there is no &quot;shaman utility&quot;.<br />
<br />
So ... that means we must do one of 3 things (or a combination of them, to a lesser degree).  We must either do raw tanking, raw healing, or raw DPS.  We are not a melee class; soloing SoV-era mobs aside, we do not tank.  Our healing is ... below subpar.  We cast spell that heal the amount of damage a single round of combat deals (maybe!), but do so slower than those single rounds of combat occur.  Even chaining Daluda's, we cannot keep up.  So ... we must, by lack of another role, be intended to be a DPS class.  Indeed, we have always been a *damage* class (although not a DPS class).  Shaman's were (yes, I know about necros...but, bear with me...) the class who contributes mana-efficient, long-term damage.  Mana efficiency is meaningless.  When this board talks that mana regen is useless ... it is not because it is useless (quite the opposite for most classes), but that it is so prevalent that small changes in it are lost against the bigger whole.  VoQ + 9 + SD + FT15 + MC3 + horse (in outdoor areas) is such as phenomenal amount of mana regen that efficiency is irrelevant (and note that no shaman is needed to contribute to that arrangement).  Long-term damage is meaningless.  There are no long-term combats; mobs die in 30 seconds.  This is the world where rangers CAN tank area bosses, not because they have any real ability to survive damage, but because /disc weaponshield buys the group 15 seconds ... and that's all it takes.<br />
<br />
If we are to be a viable class, and the things we HAVE done in the past are no longer useful in their current state, there are two options.  Either the designers can make such changes to our current features - healing, perhaps nukes, perhaps rains, perhaps (somehow, although I do not know how) dots - such that they ARE useful again, OR they can give us something new to use as a strength.  Many people in these discussions do not have the advantage of having seen both the current high-end game and the very beginning of EQ ... but I'm sure some of the start of it all is still archived on the web, somewhere.  Long ago, Enchanters didn't do ... well, ANY of things we thing of enchanters as doing now.  They were a bad wizard, with a few extra spells that no one wanted them to cast.  Usenet posts even encouraged enchanters to get groups by going /anon and advertising themselves as a wizard (note: enc nukes *before* Insanity in PoP really were worse than ours).  This is rapidly becoming the state we are finding ourselves in at the high-end game.  We will never have trouble finding groups for XP grinding ... the classes who can currently replace our functionality, WHILE adding features of their own that we cannot match are, traditionally, rare.  Enchanters are always a fickle sort, and beastlords, being an expansion class, simply do not exist in large numbers.  In their absence, and in the absence of mobs with GoD-style combat profiles, shaman perform well.  It is when those precepts break down that we fail - when 1-group chokepoints like Ikkinz force guilds to consider a shaman's role, and recognize that they are the poor sisters of chanters and beastlords.  Many guilds will allow shaman to bear the ignominy of being pushed through, like some disadvantaged student being socially promoted into classes he cannpt understand.  Some, seeing that the lands on the far side of Ikkinz offer shaman nothing better, will begin to allow our class to be left behind.  Many EQ players are materialistic; my skimming of this thread even came across someone who didn't care about our state - he could still get XP groups, and still get &quot;uber loot&quot; from his guild.  Eventually, though, that will stop.  When guilds realize that the only thing gained by pushing a shaman through Ikkinz is the disbersement of loot to characters who in no way help the guild continue to progress, we will find ourselves cut off and abandoned.  One shamanbot is enough to buff ... why waste time, energy, effort, and loot on a character who is as much deadweight in the fronteirs of GoD as paladins were in the fronteirs of Kunark?<br />
<br />
Its not that bad ... yet.  Most guilds still believe in the idea of &quot;guilds&quot;, and so shaman are being drug, limply, along with the other classes (for what its worth : so are SKs).  But these trials are taxing in a way that content never was.  If a guild has to choose between tearing itself apart or jettisoning the shaman as &quot;necessary casualties&quot; or &quot;acceptable losses&quot; along the way, then we will find ourselves sitting outside the Ikkinz trials, looking yearningly at a zoneline we cannot employ, barred access by a series of mobs we cannot effect.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter HOW they change this class.  If anything, that's why we can't agree on a single solution.  Real heals would at least give us a foot in the door.  Some form of DPS that is competative and useful would work as well.  I could contrive a hundred spells that would put us back into the game, even ones that play off our previous strengths (by example: a ~50% slow with a neg 100-150 resist modifier and a cast time like Tash, even though it would be mitigated, would still be valuable because it would land *before the need for slow had passed* ... except on immune mobs, which, imo need to go - but that's a seperate issue).  Some people look at our lists of hopeful requests and think we want it all.  We do not - we just want all the suggestions heard, in the vain hope that someone will recognize that we are unhappy, and take up at least one of the ideas as a reality.  Many of us are perhaps masochists, and would be satisfied by mediocrity.  We do not want to shoot for the moon ... we'd just like to make it down the street.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Hey Deciedon, here is what I want.<br />
<br />
First, I want a SOLID buff I can put on the tanks AND the casters in my group that makes a real differnce. Something with the amount of HPs and other useful attributes that Shaman have always been famous for (when some stat buffs actually mattered somewhat)<br />
<br />
Second I want to be able to drop a debuff on the mob when it comes that actually matters. I dont want to have to take 2 spells to do it, if the fights are going to be shorter and shorter. Balance isnt cutting it. How about something that actually de-buffs the mobs output, a -attack thing. <br />
<br />
Third, I want to cast a fast heal on the tank so that the cleric or druid main-healer can get caught up, and I want that heal to be USEFUL. 1800 seems a decent number. Still under the &quot;Big 2&quot; healers. <br />
<br />
And Finally, I want to be able to do SOMETHING useful in that last 8 seconds of the fight, and since my 675 pt nuke ain't it, then give me another that is. How about a Disease nuke? 1100 in 6.5 seconds, 4 second re-cast. <br />
<br />
Is this too hard for you to understand man? WHY do you keep fighting AGAINST us here? Your logic is so flawed its not even funny. You make statements, then don't back them up with any real facts. You seem to be making stuff up as you go along. <br />
<br />
I agree with your idea that we need to be balanced against the content itself more so than the other classes doing what we do. However, lets remember that EQ is about what class can do what each brings to a group. If the other classes are constantly bringing more of OUR stuff to the group, then OUR stuff needs adjusting. <br />
<br />
I dont want to be a druid, or a wizard, or a cleric, or a BL or Ranger or etc etc etc. Stop saying that is what I want (note, I mean the collective &quot;I&quot;). What I want is to be a Shaman. Right now, I dont feel like one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">How about I make a simple point.<br />
<br />
A shamans place has been labeled <br />
Best Slows.<br />
Crappy healing<br />
Weak pet that doesnt even freaking dual wield unless given weapons.<br />
<br />
Funny Our best benefit is mitigated.Slows<br />
Our buffs dont affect stats caps.<br />
And our third skill healing doesnt keep up with mob damage.<br />
So we have a pet to provide.<br />
<br />
Want to compare.<br />
Chanters bring a slow<br />
Best Speed<br />
Charm.<br />
Mana Regen<br />
Yes they also get mitigated on slows. And some mobs cannot be mezzed but dam least they have 4 shots at being effective. And the DPS of a charmed mob I mean seriously why bother comparing.<br />
<br />
Druids.<br />
Ok they have better DD.<br />
They have buffs.<br />
They have CH<br />
They have Dots<br />
they have the utility aspect inclufding evac.<br />
<br />
No matter what nothing mitigates a CH. Always have something to fall back on<br />
<br />
Beastlords.<br />
Have DPS<br />
Have Slow<br />
Have beasty crack<br />
Have Buffs.<br />
<br />
With their lower buffs they hit stat caps. They also mitigate slow but always have DPS and mana Hp regen to fall back on.<br />
<br />
Necros since brought up.<br />
Insane Pet Dps<br />
DD better than shammies.<br />
Dots.<br />
Mez<br />
<br />
They always have at least one thing to offer in every situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you see the main problem is we dont have anything given to the shaman class that is Special or always useful. <br />
Go look at the slowability chart. that will be a RUDE awakening to see how many new mobs are simply not affected by slow. And if they arent then were nothing more then a buff bot for people with bad gear<br />
<br />
When our heals provide one round of damage from a mob they are simply not effective. A level 65 shaman with Q and patch healing is semi effective but no where NEAR the healing ability of a cler or druid.<br />
<br />
We dont need stats buffs that arent used.<br />
We dont need another slow when all the new content either mitigates are dies to fast to be slowed.<br />
We need to have something that makes us usefull no matter what the situation and currently we dont have that. I mean I cant even match the healing for a single round of new mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">So what you are telling me is that if a shaman isn't in Ele planes/Time/high end GoD, then we aren't entitled to an opinion nor are we a true shaman?  I also have to ask if shaman are truly useless in those zones, then why are the guild on Tarew Marr who are in those zones begging for shaman?  Do you really think they would be offering to backflag a 65/200 shaman if they weren't needed?  I mean that's an awful lot of work just to keep with the tradition of having all classes represented.<br />
<br />
I will admit that the biggest thing I have done is BoT tower bosses.  But I have had plenty of offers to do bigger things... if I joined one of the raiding guilds.  That isn't what I want to do with my &quot;free time.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I think the point Deciedon was trying to make was that not every shaman in game who comes to these boards is Ele/Time equipped.  Not everyone wants to be in a raiding guild and spend the majority of our time grinding through a raid hoping to get some pixels that make everyone else drool.  The rest of us adapt and have fun playing a game we enjoy.  And yes, that's all it is... a game.<br />
<br />
Now flame away if you want because it's clear that I'm in a minority.  However I won't see it because this is my last visit to these boards.  Real life has enough whining and bitching in it without reading it about a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I read through all these posts. I'm not an Elemental-Time-GOD shaman by any means ... yet. My guild is a raiding guild, but we're not hardcore and we're not grinders. We will not be. Whether or not that matters, I don't honestly know or care. We will reach our goals -- perhaps a touch slower than the grinders, but we will get there.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen anywhere in this thread (and perhaps I missed it) where anyone implied those of us who have not reached Elemental-Time-GOD has said we're not &quot;true shaman&quot; ... nor have I seen where someone has said we do not have the right to an opinion. We do have a right to an opinion, and we're all shaman here. <br />
<br />
But consider ... a shaman's role in our world (BOT raids, etc.) is ENTIRELY and COMPLETELY different than a shaman's role in the end-game. Their world is entirely different from ours. Their problems are different. Their needs are different. Their issues with the game are, in most respects, completely separate from ours.<br />
<br />
I do not mean to turn this into an us-them type situation, and I fear I have done that. The fact remains that some folks are simply on a different level of the game, and will therefore have a different experience. What works for us will not work for them ... The &quot;rest of us&quot; do not have access to Elemental-Time-GOD. Why would we want to comment and offer input on something we know nothing about? I, for one, will offer input when I have experience to base it upon.<br />

I wouldn't say you aren't a true shaman, but if you're not in high end GoD, your viewpoint isn't very respectable about how things are for shaman dealing with the invalidity we have in GoD.<br />
<br />
I also have to ask if shaman are truly useless in those zones, then why are the guild on Tarew Marr who are in those zones begging for shaman? <br />
<br />
For raids, guilds still need a couple of us around for focus/FA.  We have a small niche still left at raid lvl encounters, yay, rebuff the dead and hit FA when the spell gem un-grays.  <br />

And as said by countless poeple if your not at that level and dont know the problems we have you shouldnt try to argue.  <br />
<br />
that being said i dont think Deciedon is actually saying we dont need improvement he just saying that he didn`t like the way people are complaining, which is valid, however i disagree the only times anything is done is when enough poeple complain/whine. though i say we are complaining not whine as the issues are valid</div></div><hr />

No - it just means that when you talk about issues in these zones you have to back up your statements with something else then personal experience. Deceidon has not made an effort to back up anything he said at all. If he is proven wrong he just ignores it.<br />
<br />
I for one will not discount anyone's opinion based on the zone he is in. However if you want to talk from personal experience you should be in the same zones as the people who are complaining.</div></div><hr />

That pretty much sums it up. <br />

How is that? I haven't ignored anything, and I've tried to answer every reponse in the best way I can. I never said we don't need more healing, in fact, I've argued quite the contrary repeatedly, but no one seems to notice. I am not time geared, but I have been in GoD. My 'respectable opinion' as to the state of shaman in GoD means nothing to anyone that isn't willing to carry on a two sided debate. <br />
<br />
I've been accused of posting merely to serve my ego (boggle) and of ignoring evidence to contradict what I've said, but I don't see how I'm guilty of either of those. <br />
<br />
All I said was, and I freakin reposted it in my last post, was stop bitching about other classes and work harder to come up with REASONABLE suggestions that you know the devs will consider. ****, cudar didn't have any trouble figuring that out, I don't see what the problem is. <br />
<br />
Some of you seem to think I'm here to work against you, but that's not the case at all. I came here to tell you that I think some of you are being unrealistic and the way you're going about it is all wrong. That's it. That's all. There's nothing else to it. I didn't complain about my 57 necro, Blazz, I was making comparisons to help some people understand my presentation. Your comments aren't even worthy of debating because you obviously didn't even read the entire post. Call me the worst poster you've ever seen, whatever. I came here and expressed my opinion and those of you that refuse to see another side to the debate immediately call me names and tell others to ignore me. <br />

So be it, i'm done with it. I support any and all movements to further improve the shaman class, but i refuse to join in on whines about other classes and personally degrade my chosen class, as some of you have chosen to do. Because whether you choose to believe it or not, some of you would have the entire EQ community convinced that Shaman's are ****in worthless, and those of us that do still play our shaman don't need that **** hanging over our heads while we're trying to play the game.</div></div><hr />

hehe , i said that was what you meant, i didnt say you said it well. i dont think poeple are bitching other classes, none here is asking for other not to have what they have only comparing what they can do  and have and what we have and cant do, then they usualy give ideas to improve which can be good or bad. i think there is a difference there.</div></div><hr />

You suggest we work harder to come up with reasonable suggestions that we know the devs will consider but you believe that asking for a heal that is still under the druid's is unreasonable?  I assume you did not read the stickied post that Glorianna composed.  By the way, that post has been brought up a few times now to refute what you have said (read: suggestions to devs in a pleasant tone)<br />

Also, nobody is whining about other classes here.  Weighing other class ability is necessary for a discussion of class balance.  You continue to refuse to involve any other classes in such a discussion (/boggle).<br />

I hate seein **** like Chutoi posting on the eq boards to new players not to play a shaman because the class sucks. When i say these things hang over our head, this effects us in game as well as out of it. <br />

I'm confident that the shaman class is going to see some changes. I'm confident they'll see those changes without druid and beastlord bashing taking place on the Crucible, but if it helps, carry on I guess.<br />

Man come the **** on, try to comprehend the goddamn post. You claimed that a shaman brought nothin to a group, so I asked you what a necromancer brought to a group, just as a comparison. We all know that necro's are famous for getting groups in Everquest, I don't think I need to explain that one. Like I said before, i'm not going to debate druids with you. i didnt' say they bring no utility, as i've tried to point out to you about fifty times now. I said they brought less utility than a shaman. And when i say utility, I don't consider nuking a utility.

You are working against us. Not everyone here is making unreasonable requests or constantly comparing our abilities to those of other classes.

Have YOU read these other posts? I just do not see most people degrading shaman or whining about other classes. What I do see is people demonstrating the deficiencies of the shaman class by citing examples of another classes abilities. What I do see is people using specific game examples where we perform poorly to further elaborate on where we need help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I missed this post when I replied to the thread, I will comment on it now.<br />
<br />
AT A CERTAIN LEVEL Necromancers and Druids and most every other class brings WAY WAY more Utility to a group than a Shaman. We have cited example after example of the &quot;utility&quot; of Shaman made trivial or even completely useless IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. <br />
<br />
Your main problem is that in YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION you still bring a fairly large amount of utility to a group. Shaman are incredibly powerful in many many places in this game. We are MORE than adequate healer+slowers in LDoN Normal. We are very solid additions to groups where slow isnt constantly mitigated or fights last 45 seconds or longer. We can easily serve as back up healer to Clerics or Druids in lots and lots of zones. Our buffs are quite good to people who do not have max stats. <br />
<br />
In the words of the now infamous Giac, CONGRATS ON BEING EXCELLENT IN TRIVIAL CONTENT.<br />
<br />
I want you to judge our &quot;utility&quot; in CURRENT content. Gates Trials and LDoN hard. Lets start using those as a &quot;barometer&quot; to measure our abilities, shall we? <br />
<br />
Now, enlighten us with your wisdom on what utility we bring in THESE places.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you need to open your eyes.<br />
<br />
I haven't restricted my focus to posts on the Crucible, some of this comes from seeing posts such as the one I mentioned from the EQ forum boards where Chutoi consistently bad mouths shamans to the general community. He's not the only one, but he's the most prominent. I understand that his hope is to draw the attention of the developers, but I still firmly oppose that form of demonstration. <br />
<br />
I also said I had tried my best to respond to every question as well as I could. Whether you choose to actually read what I post or take apart little sentences that you find different from your point of view is your prerogative. I'm still answering as best I can. I don't have the time nor the inclination to respond to the type of posts where people say I haven't been to GoD becuase if I had I would have Sha's Revenge for my beastlord. I never said anything about that. I asked why people were bitching about a 65% slow that was highly unattainable for the average beastlord, especially one that was only attainable at the last level of the game. But you don't see that, do you? Apparently not, because reading comprehension is beyond some of you. <br />
<br />
This entire post has degenerated into a 'me against you' debate because I disagree with the way some (yes, some) of you go about trying to get some attention or the shaman class. I never said the entire shaman community was a bunch of idiots, Blazz, so don't even go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">. . .Man come the **** on, try to comprehend the goddamn post.

<br />
Hi Deceidon, I know that this post was not directed at me specifically, but I still do not follow you.  What is it specifically that we have that gives us more utility than druids or necromancers?  I regularly play with a necromancer, and I have to say when Im filling slots for a group, I count her as a utility asset.  She has a strong pet, she does dps when the group needs it.  She steals life from the mob and heals the entire group with it.  She drains mana from mobs then passes it out to the casters in the group.  She kites adds if were about to be overwhelmed.  She can FD split if we need it.  She regularly does all this in a single sitting. I consider her one of the most flexible players I know.<br />
<br />
When you said druids brought less utility than shamans, I listed various different things that I would consider utility abilities earlier and showed that druids in fact had more functions than they could provide their group than shamans do.  Afterwards you told me that utility did not matter in God anyways and I was off the point.  <br />
<br />
I took issue with the notion that shamans provide better long term dps than druids do, and gave specific example why it is not the case in the current content, and you still have not explained the flaw in my examples.<br />
<br />
I think some of the flack that you are getting from others is because you make statements about things that you assume to be self evident, when to others it is not.  Im not saying this to be argumentative, but I still do not understand what you meant when you claimed that druids do better dps long term than shamans, or that druids (and necromancers) have almost no utility for groups in comparison to shamans.  <br />
<br />
Can you explain what utility shamans have in abundance over druids and necromancers.  Understand in making this comparison Im not bashing any of these classes. Im not calling for a nerf. No one has.<br />
<br />
You seem to have strongly held beliefs about why it is unreasonable for shamans to ask directly for rebalancing. You claim that people here are being unreasonable.  And yet personally I understand the logic behind Chutois posts, but I do not follow your posts at all.<br />
<br />
Help me out Deceidon.  Utility is not self evident to me.  Im a lvl 65 shaman on AeRo server who is in a small guild struggling with hard Ldons, and trying to explore God.  Make me see this utility.  Explain it to me.  Treat me as if I was a noob who had no concept of shamans.  Make me understand the utility of shamans in the fast paced high dps fights with slow mitigating mobs that is the basis of  SOEs new content.</div></div><hr />

Then point out where we are wrong. If you actually posted facts maybe people would not attack you so vehemently. Seriously, tell us where we are wrong and tell us why we are wrong.<br />
<br />
I'm confident that the shaman class is going to see some changes. I'm confident they'll see those changes without druid and beastlord bashing taking place on the Crucible, but if it helps, carry on I guess.<br />
We are not. We tried that approach several times now and it just does not work. What druid and beastlord bashing by the way?<br />
<br />
Man come the **** on, try to comprehend the goddamn post. You claimed that a shaman brought nothin to a group, so I asked you what a necromancer brought to a group, just as a comparison.

Since you did not seem to read mine (or others') post let me list druid utility again - not their superior damage, not their superior healing, not convinience spells like SoE - utility.<br />
- stun<br />
- harmony<br />
- snare<br />
- charm<br />
- evac<br />
- resist debuffs<br />
<br />
shaman bring<br />
- slow<br />
- haste<br />
- resist debuffs<br />
<br />
Where is the superior shaman utility?<br />
<br />
I haven't restricted my focus to posts on the Crucible, some of this comes from seeing posts such as the one I mentioned from the EQ forum boards where Chutoi consistently bad mouths shamans to the general community. He's not the only one, but he's the most prominent. I understand that his hope is to draw the attention of the developers, but I still firmly oppose that form of demonstration. <br />
How is listing facts badmouthing? Can you actually point out where he is telling lies?<br />
<br />
I never said anything about that. I asked why people were bitching about a 65% slow that was highly unattainable for the average beastlord, especially one that was only attainable at the last level of the game.<br />
Because we are discussing the endgame here. Any spell two expansions old has to be taken into consideration. We are taking into account Daluda's Mending, a very rare spell from this very expansion. And that &quot;last level of the game&quot; is a lot longer then the previous 64 for many of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Ok, you have to assume that in this game the two distinct divisions are utility and dps. Always has been this way. Rogues, for example, are not a utility class, they are a dps class. While shaman,  yes, shaman are a utility class. We bring buffs, slows, heals and debuffs to the group. Buffs cover a broad range of things, such as AC, HP, Attack, attack speed, and every physical attribute a character has. Slows, heals and debuffs, I think, are self explanatory. This is utility, this has nothing to do with dps.<br />
<br />
Now, I will concede some things here. Stat buffs, as many  have mentioned previously have very little bearing in the high end game because most people's stats are already maxed. I've already said, more than once, that this is true and that we need more utility, and i've listed examples that other people gave as well as a couple of ideas off the top of my head. With me so far?<br />
<br />
Slows..mitigation, speed of encounters in GoD limits slowing capacity, but doesn't negate it completely. Mobs are still getting slowed in GoD believe it or not. Amazing. Anywhere outside of GoD, slow is still a key factor in any encounter and shaman's are still sought after for having the best slow in the game.<br />
<br />
Debuffs..damn good ones, say whatever you want about that.<br />
<br />
Heals..again, I've already agreed that to bring us in line with new content, our healing skills could use some adjusting. As I've also said, there are many different ways to make changes to healing without stepping on any one classes toes, through the use of AA's and the limitless options availble to a heal spell in its design. Like a broken record here..I'm still missing how you're missing it.<br />
<br />
Now on to dps..as I've said already, and its really not arguable, shaman were never a dps class. Our main focus was utility, ie, everything listed above. Our biggest power was the ability to do long term damage with powerful, long lasting damage over time spells. With new content, this has diminished a great deal but when fights only last a few seconds, I really don't think anyone's focused on how much dps their healer/buffer is putting out. I don't give a rat's ass that my cleric can nuke for 1100 damage, becuase he needs to be more focused on keeping my health up.<br />
That shaman over there needs to make sure mobs are slowed and debuffed and that our buffs are topped off before he worries about adding damage, and when mobs are dropping fast, then if he sits on his ass and does what he's supposed to do, who cares what his dps is?<br />
<br />
How any of you can continually come here and ask me to list 'shaman utility' is beyond me. If you hadn't figured out in 65 levels that your shaman was a utility class, then I don't know what to tell you. Now, again..and again...I agree that our utility has diminshed somewhat. Not completely by god, but somewhat.<br />
<br />
As I said before, many goddamn times, i'm not going to debate what a druid can and can't do. But I will throw this out there, for the sake of argument. What I feel the druid brings in the way of utility:<br />
<br />
Heals, damage shields, snares, harmony, buffs<br />
<br />
Heals- better than ours, and i feel that we should be on par with them. We always were before, i dont' see why it needs to change now.<br />
<br />
Damage shields - great utility<br />
<br />
Snares - another great utility<br />
<br />
Buffs - one, that's not easily stackable, but a decent one none the less. I will mention, however, that it doesn't add to any stats if some aren't capped already.<br />
<br />
Harmony - Cry pot of gold all you want, but its a highly *highly* resisted spell the higher you go, especially in GoD, in case you hadn't noticed.<br />
<br />
Do i feel that a druid brings less 'utility' to a group than a shaman? Yes I do, and I think i've explained why. If my views aren't the same as yours, please don't ask me to list them again. Tell me I'm an idiot BoT bot, etc, i'm sure my overinflated ego will survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Then point out where we are wrong. If you actually posted facts maybe people would not attack you so vehemently. Seriously, tell us where we are wrong and tell us why we are wrong.<br />
<br />
Ok, how about 'shaman sucks'. Wrong. Don't like it? Oh well. I don't know how many times I have to say it, but I won't support those kind of comments, and I will defend the class. That's a tough one to figure out, isn't it? Posting facts? I've been posting them. And you've been ignoring them. You ask, i reply, you ask again as if I never did. I don't know what else to tell you.<br />
<br />
<br />
What druid and beastlord bashing by the way? <br />
<br />
Unbelievable. Shaman have been bitching about Sha's Revenge for months now. Somethin else I thought was ludicrous. As far as druids, shaman have been crying about druid heals for months as well. I can't say I don't disagree with that, per se, but I will say that I'm not gonna whine about what druids can do, I'll just ask if mine can be a little better than it is. <br />
<br />
And this is just what I meant. You do not list anything to support your opinion. Why should anyone listen to you, let alone be convinced if they start out with a differing opinion?<br />
<br />
Bull****. I've done nothing but list stuff to support my opinion. I accept differing opinions, its the opinions of those that either don't read the posts or tear apart little snippets that I have problems with. I wont name any names, Murtak.<br />
<br />
And I listed how much more utility druids get. At which point you tell me that that was never the point<br />
<br />
No, again, learn to ****ing read. I told you that I didn't consider dps to be 'utility', and that some of what you listed was already negated by GoD simply because they were abilities shared with the shaman. That's mostly according to you, by the way, not me. You also insisted that I was saying druids had *no* utility, when, in fact, I never said that at all.<br />
<br />
Where is the superior shaman utility?<br />
<br />
Read the post above this one. Then, do everyone a favor, and quit, if you haven't already, because you're not going to be happy with this class no matter what changes are made. You can't see any positives now, then I don't think that you ever realistically will. By the way, I've tried and tried to bring to light some of the positives of the shaman class and you continually shut me down. That's not my problem, that's yours.<br />
<br />
How is listing facts badmouthing? Can you actually point out where he is telling lies?<br />
<br />
Saying shaman plain suck isn't listing facts, its spouting a poorly formed opinion. Primarily because not all shaman feel that the class sucks. Immediately after Chutoi's post telling a newbie not to play a shaman becuase they suck, another player goes on to tell the poster that they should try the shaman, how its a great class, and /gasp, goes on to list advantages of the class. ****in a-mazing! Someone has a positive outlook. Un believable.<br />
<br />
I'm done arguing this, becuase like I said before, i'll continue to play and enjoy my class. If you don't like, oh ****in well. Everybody knows by now that I don't think the class is broken and people bitching and whining on public boards about the class being broken pisses me off, hence the entire point of this thread. Get it? Got it? Good. This is my last post on the subject, and probably the last post on the Crucible. As someone else said, I can see and hear enough bitching and whining in real life, I don't need to come here and see it to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Actually I answered it, and you even cut and pasted it. Would you like a play by play of what I did yesterday evening?<br />
<br />
You said you tried GoD, meaning that you have spent very little time (and very recently) in GoD.  That does not make GoD where you normally play.<br />
<br />
I do think the shaman is a great class, and I'm sorry if that bothers you.<br />
<br />
I think Shaman are a great class too, for the most part, but the game has changed in such a way that the newest content seriously diminishes the Shamans abilities.  To add to the frustration, there are Shaman who haven't experienced any of the new content and/or the highest level of older content, commenting on how the class is in content they haven't experienced yet.<br />
<br />
I hate seein **** like Chutoi posting on the eq boards to new players not to play a shaman because the class sucks.<br />
<br />
Can you link to such posts please, specifically those stating to new players not to roll a Shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm confident they'll see those changes without druid and beastlord bashing taking place on the Crucible, but if it helps, carry on I guess.<br />
<br />
It's annoying that you feel comparing and/or listing abilities of other classes next to Shaman abilities is &quot;bashing&quot; them.<br />
<br />
You claimed that a shaman brought nothin to a group, so I asked you what a necromancer brought to a group, just as a comparison.<br />
<br />
Actually the problem is that Shaman don't bring much to a group in new content that isn't a) already present or b) done better by other classes.  Our one trick (slow) is marginally better than other classes with it but we are still significantly penalized for having this small advantage.<br />
<br />
We all know that necro's are famous for getting groups in Everquest, I don't think I need to explain that one.<br />
<br />
Actually you should considering the interesting opinion you have of Necros.  I'm assuming that you mean they have a hard time getting groups because of their reputation, *despite* their actual usefulness?<br />
<br />
And when i say utility, I don't consider nuking a utility. You can base your entire argument on one goddamn hp buff that they have, as you have done the entire post, but I'm no longer going to get into it.<br />
<br />
I will take that as a claim and it would be great if you would state what you consider utility to be and what each a Druid and Shaman offer?  Please take care to consider this utility as it applies or is available in new content.<br />
<br />
I understand that his hope is to draw the attention of the developers, but I still firmly oppose that form of demonstration.<br />
<br />
You can oppose speaking loudly and, when necessary, sharply all you like.  Your position does not change the fact that in the past the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  It doesn't help that also in the past, when very calm and intelligent posts have been made to the position of Shaman in new content, they are disregarded.<br />
<br />
Whether you choose to actually read what I post or take apart little sentences that you find different from your point of view is your prerogative.<br />
<br />
Actually, many of us read all of your posts and refute your (attempted) claims one by one.<br />
<br />
I don't have the time nor the inclination to respond to the type of posts where people say I haven't been to GoD becuase if I had I would have Sha's Revenge for my beastlord.<br />
<br />
Nice copout there.  You don't have the time nor the inclination to respond to specific questions directed at the premise of your post?  At least you did have time to test out GoD *after* it was questioned whether you had ever before.<br />
<br />
Also, considering that a) runes don't drop in GoD, b) runes don't drop in LDoN hard, and c) there are many people who have elemental access but do not have all of their alt's 65 spells yet, I fail to see how we were to infer your immersement into new content.<br />
<br />
 Ok, you have to assume that in this game the two distinct divisions are utility and dps.<br />
<br />
I disagree, completely.  Where do clerics go then?<br />
<br />
 Slows, heals and debuffs, I think, are self explanatory.<br />
<br />
No they arent self-explanatory, because if heals are utility and they arent dps then were do clerics fit again?  Wouldnt that necessitate another category of healer?  None of the classes are truly one type.  While monks, rogues, and warriors have no mana bars they can do other things besides melee damage.  While a wizard isnt going to be meleeing, he is capable of a few other tricks than just nuking.<br />
<br />
Seriously, where do you come up with this stuff?  Slow is a utility?  Pre-GoD (and arguably LDoN now) slow was a REQUIREMENT!  There are four classes that have slow.  Shamans used to get groups in some places simply because of that one spell, then they would bring a few other nice additions.  The same goes for chanters, bst, and bard but it used to be that slow was the first selling factor then you traded off after that (cc for chanter, buffs for shm, dps for bst, pulling and various benefits for bard).<br />
<br />
 Slows..mitigation, speed of encounters in GoD limits slowing capacity, but doesn't negate it completely. Mobs are still getting slowed in GoD believe it or not.<br />
<br />
You are greatly underestimating just how much slow mitigation combined with extremely high DPS and low hitpoint mobs has decreased the usefulness of slow.  Actually, I believe its been shown that in much of GoD, the amount of hitpoints saved by a mitigated slow is actually just about as much as an extra heal or two each fight.  Yippee?<br />
<br />
As for your conceded points, you dont need to concede them since there shouldnt be any argument about them in the first place with the exception of your debuffs.  Cripple is arguably worthwhile, maybe, sorta.  That leaves us with malo(s) and for the most part we use it just for ourselves to help slow land.  Mages, who have just a slightly lower version of the spell, will tell you that its not worth their own mana to it since its about the cost of a nuke.<br />
<br />
 Heals..again, I've already agreed that to bring us in line with new content, our healing skills could use some adjusting. As I've also said, there are many different ways to make changes to healing without stepping on any one classes toes, through the use of AA's and the limitless options availble to a heal spell in its design. Like a broken record here..I'm still missing how you're missing it.<br />
<br />
Healing balance isnt that simple.  After all the AAs and innovative design changes, the bottom line is how many hitpoints per mana per second.  They can give us even further Spell Casting Reinforcement AAs that make Q and BoT last for 92.4 minutes, that still doesnt change their rate of heal.<br />
<br />
 Now on to dps..as I've said already, and its really not arguable, shaman were never a dps class.<br />
<br />
Actually, like most classes, we can be a high dps class if we wanted to but its a) not very efficient and b) not what the class is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
 That shaman over there needs to make sure mobs are slowed and debuffed and that our buffs are topped off before he worries about adding damage, and when mobs are dropping fast, then if he sits on his ass and does what he's supposed to do, who cares what his dps is?<br />
<br />
I thought you conceded that Shaman stat buffs were pretty limited?  The only buff that needs to be topped off is FA.  Also, with much of GoD the length of the fight basically allows for the Shaman to cast malo(s), slow, and maybe one more spell.  On top of that, he gets to bring to the group buffs that can be replaced by various other classes or are just outright useless.  At this point, the Shaman is there to maybe nuke once per fight or to throw in a heal or two.  Again, yippee?<br />
<br />
 How any of you can continually come here and ask me to list 'shaman utility' is beyond me. If you hadn't figured out in 65 levels that your shaman was a utility class, then I don't know what to tell you. Now, again..and again...I agree that our utility has diminshed somewhat. Not completely by god, but somewhat.<br />
<br />
You are underestimating how our utility has decreased in GoD and actually what a Shamans utility really is.  The Shaman does not have spells that one should consider utility spells so to speak, but the Shaman is a utility spell because they have one spell from so many different types of spells.  Shaman can heal directly, over time, slow, debuff, nuke, rain, dot, sow, root, invis, buff, etc.  The problem is that in GoD so many of those spell types just arent used.  You arent root parking GoD mobs, or using heal over time spells, or dotting, or buffing stats, etc.  We still have a few spells to cast, but other classes bring those spells plus more, because they specialize in the particulars needed in GoD such as charm, mez, nuke, melee damage, direct healing.<br />
<br />
 Ok, how about 'shaman sucks'. Wrong. Don't like it? Oh well.<br />
<br />
Context is not your friend.<br />
<br />
 I'm done arguing this, becuase like I said before, i'll continue to play and enjoy my class. If you don't like, oh ****in well.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">How any of you can continually come here and ask me to list 'shaman utility' is beyond me. If you hadn't figured out in 65 levels that your shaman was a utility class, then I don't know what to tell you. Now, again..and again...I agree that our utility has diminshed somewhat. Not completely by god, but somewhat.<br />
As I said before, many goddamn times, i'm not going to debate what a druid can and can't do.<br />
And this is what I mean by refusing to back up your arguments. How a situational ability - yes, slow is situational in GoD - and haste make up for the plethora of druid abilities, many of which you just skipped (like stun) I do not know, but at least this time you bothered to answer.<br />
<br />
By the way, i think you are missing something about slow. In GoD, and to some extent in prior expansions, slow is close to worthless. When MOBs die in 20 seconds and you take 5 to 10 seconds to land a slow - not counting resists - you are usually much better off just healing. When you have a charmed pet even having a clickable slow is not worth the three seconds it takes.<br />
<br />
Slow certainly does not make up for our worse healing capabilities. A single cleric will be able to heal better then two perfectly coordinated shaman.<br />
<br />
I do not like that, but since SOE seems unwilling to make fights last longer and/or remove slow mitigation we need something else to make up for the loss of one of our main abilities.<br />
<br />
Many of us want moderate enhancements in buffing,damage and debuffs and a solid enhancement in healing (yet still be below druids). You seem to want straight druid heals.<br />
<br />
Tell me, how are we asking for the sky. How is our proposal less stepping on other classes' toes then yours?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">Ok, how about 'shaman sucks'.<br />
Noone is saying that. We are saying we have severe problems in a certain type of content that is getting more and more common. We have other concerns too but the main one is that we contribute a fraction of what we used to on short lived encounters.<br />
If you equate that to &quot;shaman suck!&quot; I can not help it. It certainly is not what I see on these boards.<br />
<br />
Unbelievable. Shaman have been bitching about Sha's Revenge for months now.<br />
Oh yes, that has certainly been a hotly debated topic here. I can not even remember that spell coming up except when comparing slow across the classes.<br />
I see a lot more complaints about beastlords being better buffers then us. I see a moderate amount of complaints about slow mitigation making beastlords slow so close to us as not to matter. But the overwhelming majority of the complaints is simply that we do not contribute adequately on short-lived content.<br />
<br />
Somethin else I thought was ludicrous. As far as druids, shaman have been crying about druid heals for months as well. I can't say I don't disagree with that, per se, but I will say that I'm not gonna whine about what druids can do, I'll just ask if mine can be a little better than it is. <br />
So if we ask for a better heal to be balanced against other classes we are whining. If you ask for a better heal just because you want a better heal that is ok?<br />
<br />
What are you basing your want for a heal upgrade on? MOBs hitting harder? If your healing scaled to MOB DPS you would need instant cast CHs for 50 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">I may not be up in the end game, but from all im hearing in here why would I not want to see some improvements to my class before I get there? I dont see anyone whining here I see people bringin up problems with issues, game mechanics, and real group preference that is currently being used in the end content. And discussing reasons we are lacking (in the end game) possible solutions, citing real examples of how and why we are becoming less than desirable for groups (in the end game) and reasonable comparision of similiar classes with like abilities, and why they compared to us are being prefered compared to us (in the end game).<br />
<br />
another thing that may need to happen is 2 additional forums added under the levels area,  one being elemental and the other being Time / GoD maybe we can move these discusions about the end game there.</div></div><hr />

Knock off the insults and swearing, please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That isnt really fair man. I was wondering where you were getting all this &quot;shamans suck&quot; crap from, now I know. It wasnt something you read here. Yet you came in here assuming that the majority of the Crucible posters think that way? That is how you came off in your initial threads, anyway. <br />
<br />
Oh well, I have made my points here. Dec, have fun. When the wall comes up on you, remember what we said here. Until then, bask in the glory of your power, Shaman truly are the rulers of trivial content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Ok, you have to assume that in this game the two distinct divisions are utility and dps. Always has been this way. Rogues, for example, are not a utility class, they are a dps class. While shaman,  yes, shaman are a utility class. We bring buffs, slows, heals and debuffs to the group. Buffs cover a broad range of things, such as AC, HP, Attack, attack speed, and every physical attribute a character has. Slows, heals and debuffs, I think, are self explanatory. This is utility, this has nothing to do with dps.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
Do i feel that a druid brings less 'utility' to a group than a shaman? Yes I do, and I think i've explained why. If my views aren't the same as yours, please don't ask me to list them again. Tell me I'm an idiot BoT bot, etc, i'm sure my overinflated ego will survive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Deceidon, I understand where you are coming from now.  <br />
<br />
So you list our buffs, heals, and debuffs as &quot;utility&quot;, making us a utility class.<br />
<br />
The thing is, in the current design style shaman heals, buffs, and slows less and less useful, nearing uselessness.  This is the whole point of the shaman's complaint.<br />
<br />
1)Our buff's value has diminished.  As you conceded stat buffs are worthless.  Our focus line of buffs is weak in comparison to other classes lines of buffs.  Not only does focus do less than Virt or PoT9, but it also is unwanted by a growing number of casters because it does not stack with their mana regen line of buffs.  Our haste line of buffs is nice, but second best.  Still there is marginal utility there.  No one ever asks me for an ac buff, because ours is inferior, and does not stack. FA is handy, although a pain to cast because of the fast rate at which it dissipates, and the unreasonable recast time it has.  So over all our buff utility is based on FA and ToA/SLtW, both of which are nice, but certainly not stellar.<br />
<br />
2)Even though the utility of our buffs has shrunk I think most shamans could over look that, but the fact that our slow line has little utility is the real kicker.  Against the fast dying, always mitigating mobs the shaman slow line approaching uselessness, and is certainly not noticeably better than an Enchanters or BeastLords.  This is the real heart of the issue.  I would be more of an asset to my group if I nuked with my pathetic dd than slowed.  The mob would die faster and I would prevent more damage that way, then if I took 1/2 to 3/4 of the fight time to slow a mob, and then have the mob mitigate slow anyways.  The 20% figure that people talk about only exists in Kunark or Luclin era mobs that slow easily and fully, and last longer than 30 seconds. There is no utility in slows that are mitigated, and only function for 50% of the fight.  There is more utility in dps than slows in the new style content.<br />
<br />
3)Our direct heals are balanced around our slows.  Every time devs respond to shamans asking for increased heals, the bottom line is always, &quot;well not you don't need it because you have slow, it would be unbalancing if you had 75% slow and heals close to druids&quot;.  Of course it is now very common for shamans to face mobs that are immune to slow, or mitigate it heavily, and die 15 seconds after we get the mob debuffed and slowed.  The &quot;utility&quot; of our heals has been diminishing because of the new style content.  We do not have any healing utility if we can't keep people alive.  <br />
<br />
4)Since you listed slow separately from debuffs I assume you are talking about malo and cripple.  I will agree that the resistance line of debuffs is handy, but mainly to enchanters to help ensure that charm does not brake as quickly on their pet.  Enchanters already have a magic debuff.  Mages also already have the malx line of debuffs.  While there is certainly utility in resistance debuffing, it is not a unique ability, and it is not a strong enough utility to justify a claim that shamans are a &quot;utility class&quot;.  Cripple may be  nice, but there again it is nice for fighting old design mobs in Kunark more than anythign else.  I've been have been asked if cripple actually does anything or not.  I've never parsed it, but always assumed it was useful when fighting big melee oriented mobs.  However I have to admit I personally can't tell if it is doing anything during a fight.  Not a spell that I would hang my hat on.<br />
<br />
You and others have complained that the complainers refuse to see the shamans utility.  I was always puzzled by what people meant when they said that.  I think of utility spells as things like bhili, levitate, eb, or invis.  But now I understand where you and people like you are coming from Deceidon.  The thing is the shamans that are complaining about how the new style content is nerfing shamans are not ignoring the &quot;utility&quot; roles that a shaman have (i.e buffs, slows, heals, and debuffs) but play in a new style content where these lines of spells offer little functionality.  Our buffs were once nice, but now they do not fill any need that high-end players have.  The only three that are useful is bhili (marginaly so mostly for the attack buff) haste (assuming there is no chanter around) and FA.  Slows land half way through a fight in the new content, and then are mitigated.  The party would be better off with the shaman nuking and killing the mob faster, and slowing.  And shamans are clearly the worst nuking caster in the game.  Our healing has always been balanced around our slow.  Once slow is useless (as it is in the new content) shamans cease to be healers.  At best we are patch healers, on the same par as paladins.  Our debuff line is shared with other classes, and while handy, is not strong enough to claim that we have more utility than any other class, except for pure melee perhaps.  <br />
<br />
Shamans are nerfed in the new content Deceidon.  The only positive attention that shamans have received to remedy this (like the removal of our worthless GoD dot in favor of a marginally stronger direct heal) has been the direct result of people like Chutoi bringing attention to the problems that shamans face.<br />
<br />
The shamans that are complaining are well aware of the utility of buffs, slows, heals, and debuffs.  They know exactly how useful slow is against mobs that are immune, or mitigate slow, and die 15 seconds after the slow lands.  In the new style content the very things that you listed as our utility are directly or indirectly nerfed by mitigation and fast paced high dps fights.  There are only three real utilities that players can offer their group in the new style content.  Strong tanking, strong dps, or strong heals per second.  Shamans can provide none of this.  You have still failed to show the utility of shamans, because the new content directly or indirectly nerfs the shaman abilities that you listed.<br />
<br />
Im not saying that you are an idiot.  I am saying however that you do not understand the situation.  In Kunark I think your case holds water.  In hard Ldons and GoD it does not.  And these are the exact places that people are complaining about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">How can they upgrade us without way way overpowering us in the rest of the content? <br />
<br />
While I agree we are very strong in the rest of the content and were required in Kunark era content, We are by all reports worthless in the new end game content. How can they fix us in the end game? I dont think they are going to listen to us regardless so the point is mute, but I cant see how they can affect us without either changing the content which they dont appear to have any intention of doing, or bumping us a few notches, which they also see unwilling to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are end games clerics that can out tank bazaar geared knights over powered?  Why is it that its ok for shamans to be useless in the new content, for fear of making old content trvial, when old content is already trivial?<br />
<br />
End game players are already &quot;overpowered&quot; in teir 1 and 2 PoP, and normal Ldons.<br />
<br />
Ways that could result in shamans being more useful in GoD without making them more overpowered would be slows that mitigate mitigation.  Then one would have slows that had clear advateges in the newer content, but no advantage in old content.  But of course that is a pipe dream, as SOE clearly wants slows to be nerfed to the point of uselessness, since it is very difficult to make a challenging encounter with slows in place.  Of course the undoing of slow directly hurts the shaman more than the other slowing classes, because of the notion that the shaman's heals were complimentary to the shaman's slows, and so heals had to be balanced around slows.  BL's do not have significantly less dps that monks, even though BL's have slow.  Enchanters do not have poor CC skills compared to bards, even though Enchanters have the superior slow.  The fact that shamans were so heavily balanced around slow, and then have it yanked out from underneath them deeply effects this class in particular.<br />
<br />
Maybe asking for near druid heals is not the way, and better dd would be more acceptable.  If shamans had near druid dd, we woudl have somethign to fall back on in the new style encounters, but would still most likely use dots in the old word, or lower pop zones, as dd does not lend itself to root roting, and without snare maynot be particularly effective (although I do realise that there are easy clicky snare items to ba had by anyone).<br />
<br />
Of course I'm just typing off the cuff so to speak.  What do some of you more experienced shamans think?  Would a near druid lvl nuke give shamans a somewhat viable roll in fast paced, slow mitigated encounters, without beeing outrageous for slower paced older content where we traditionaly root/rotted, or slowed and agro-kited or tanked?</div></div><hr />
