<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spell (if vendor or even if quested for) will most likely be no drop. They don't want to make same mistake they did with luclin where ppl bought spells for those with no luclin. No sir.<br />
Some library spells (the cleric spell haste line for example) is NO DROP merchant sold to prevent non pop chars from gettign a copy.<br />
<br />
Now i don't mind that as long as they don't make me work for frog faction cause being a troll i am as kos as one can be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Knowing Verant's capacity for doing things the worst way possible, I'd guess Stoicism will require a quest; requiring you to kill a mob that spawns once every 24 hours or so.  With a gazillion shamans all wanting the same spell it should be fun, fun, fun.</div></div><hr />

It will be like SoL where on the box they show chars on horses and make it look like anyone can get a horse, but when you get ingame the cheapest one is like 10k and it's only good for mana regen.</div></div><hr />
