<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Most likely, this is going to be met with &quot;duh... obviously&quot; by some, but since it came as a bit of a surprise to my friend and I, I figured it might be worth a post.<br />
<br />
Went into a Gamesh Lair instance the other night to see how the XP was and maybe get lucky and spawn a couple nameds for spells with this trio:<br />
 - 65/167 shaman (1350 ac, 5200 hp buffed, this is me)<br />
 - 65/31 druid (bazaar geared gimp, boxed by me)<br />
 - 65/140 ranger (1350 ac, 6k hp buffed, friend of mine)<br />
<br />
We were doing OK with the ranger tanking and me healing with a combination of the 3k druid iCH and Shaman Q on the ranger and stacking epic + bane + blood, and DS damage from druid.  Wasn't especially dangerous, since the mobs near the zone only hit for 600-700, but it was taking us close to 3 minutes per mob, which at 2.5% aa per mob isn't fantastic.<br />
<br />
So we decided to switch it up a bit and have me tank so the ranger could use archery.  We'd tried this before in other content and not noticed much of a difference.  But in this case, the difference was astonishing.  <br />
<br />
I'd Q myself, pull with malos, slow the thing, and stick blood and ancient nife for agro, then keep Q up and canni when possible.  Mobs were going down in about half the time.<br />
<br />
So, most people probably already knew this, but I conclude that a ranger does enough extra DPS via archery compared with 2hs-tanking that a similarly geared SHM ends up being a better tank, despite much better defensive skills and melee mitigation from the ranger.  We guessed it was due to:<br />
<br />
 - twice as much damage from the ranger means less healing needed<br />
 - more efficient use of Q, since I can time refreshes on myself perfectly<br />
 - no riposte damage since I never actually turned on auto attack<br />
 - don't actually lose much dps from shaman since was still dotting<br />
 - picked up some dps from druid since less healing was needed<br />
<br />
Anyhow, when we switched to shaman tank from ranger tank, our XP rate in a GoD sewer went up dramatically, to the point where it almost didn't suck anymore.<br />
<br />
So if anyone has any tips and tricks for me for this setup, I'll be interested in hearing them.  And hopefully this is helpful (or at least amusing) for someone else who groups with rangers regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman should always tank for that trio with the exception of hard to slow mobs.  Pop Weaponshield until mob is slowed, then land aggro or jolt with Ranger and take over tanking.  I would let the Druid tank before I dismissed AM3 in a low DPS group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last night a trio of us decided to try out some tests - the players were:<br />
<br />
Myself, 65/234 shaman, just over 6000 HPs with Virtue and just under 1300 AC.<br />
Another shaman, 65/28, 5000 HPs and<br />
A cleric, 65/23, 4000 HPs.<br />
<br />
A pretty ragtag group, but not entirely atypical of a non-raiding guild. <br />
<br />
We tried Torment first, seeing as how it's a hotspot - 1% AA per kill, pretty dull. PoV was the next stop (I'd never tanked there before, remembering all too well the triple 544 of doom that got me in the low 60s). I found I could tank there as well, for 2% a kill. <br />
<br />
After that, we tried Lair from Gamesh, just to see if we could handle it. Zoned in, pulled a fly, miss, miss, 200 to start with - didn't seem too bad. However, I was tanking using a Righteousness (procs a 6-second stun and 100 point nuke) and using Disempower for keeping aggro. I did get a few Blood of Saryns off (for extra aggro), but unlike in PoV and Torment I was getting hit for near max a lot, and triple 600s hurt a fair bit.<br />
<br />
At the end of the fight the cleric had burned through 60% of his mana (using fast heals) and I'd used 40% of mine on DoTs and Q - I didn't canni 5 during the fight for fear of getting an unlucky couple of rounds. Disempower was also needed a fair bit as the other shaman kept drawing aggro from his poison DoTting - no surprise there!<br />
<br />
After that, we decided to call it a day as it was horribly inefficient (2% AA exp for that). However, whenever I've been called upon to tank in a group I've always used that aggro hammer plus Disempower (as a snap taunt). It looks like not meleeing might actually be better - and it also looks like I need more AC to effectively mitigate in sewers.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised in PoV - the mobs are weak compared to even sewers trash these days, but it was nice to see that what used to kill me without blinking is now tankable!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Holding agro against a ranger using low agro archery is no doubt vastly easier than holding it against another shaman's DoTs.  Just casting:<br />
<br />
 - pull with malos<br />
 - turgurs<br />
 - blood<br />
 - ancient nife<br />
<br />
and never casting another offensive spell or turning on auto attack seemed to work quite well.  I would expect to need to do a lot more to hold agro against another shaman stacking dots though, as you probably were.  I think I'd also use disempower or possibly the level 14 poison DoT for extra agro if I were holding agro against a high-agro class.<br />
<br />
I assume that you have LR5 since you have more AA than I do, but if you don't that may have made a difference also.  My AC being at least 50 higher than yours might also have made some difference.<br />
<br />
But really, I think the real benefit I got by tanking for my group was that the fights were significantly shorter because we optimized our DPS.  With the ranger on pure DPS instead of tanking.  The mobs dying 40% faster meant 40% less healing.   Shorter fights combined with zero riposte damage meant I was able to pretty much self-heal those fights and get even more DPS by using the druid as a nuker instead of a healer.<br />
<br />
Maybe a better DPS configuration for your particular group might actually be to have the cleric tank and self heal?   Assuming his gear isn't totally gimp, he should have better AC than you.  He should also be able to come up with some combination of cheapo spells that'll let him keep agro.<br />
<br />
Then the shamans can go full on DPS.  Killing the mob faster should save you a lot of mana.<br />
<br />
Actually, I guess you could just keep tanking for that group, but stack poison DoTs instead of meleeing.  Much more DPS from you that way means the mob dies faster.<br />
<br />
We saved a ton of healing mana by just making sure that we went with our optimal DPS configuration, rather than going with our &quot;best tank&quot;.<br />
<br />
Meleeing and using disempower for agro is certainly not your ideal dps way of holding agro.  I think you'd have been better off using DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you use spells like venom of the snake and envenomed bolt, its great agro for a low mana cost. Found this out when PLing my rogue.</div></div><hr />
