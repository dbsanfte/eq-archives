<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 55 and my soloing technique has changed back to a modified root-rot, something I really haven't used much since the 20's or low 30's.  Weird how things come back around.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of reasons.  The main one is that my equipment has fallen a bit behind and my self-buffed AC is only 937.   I'm currently pushing to get over 1k self-buffed, but I think it's going to take some Skyshrine armor to do it, and it will take a while to get there.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think I'm seeing a big division between the mobs that can hit through an AC of 937 and the mobs that can't.  I don't take much damage from a dark blue Greater Plaguebone Skeleton in BW, but a Wurm in the same area will hurt me bad if I let him.<br />
<br />
Is this a common theme post 55?  Am I going to be tanking less?  Or do I just need to get that AC up and then I can revert to tanking for my pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It all depends on what you're killing. I would never try and tank a wurm because their melee damage is massive for their level. Unfortunately, they're also very hard to root/rot because of their insane melee range. I'd suggest avoiding them altogether. Same thing goes for Frost Giant Elites or nameds. I can't tank them long enough to kill them even if I keep them double-dotted (triple-dotted if you count the pet). When I max 2hb, I'm going to switch back to my REIF/SBS combo and then I should be able to get over 1k in AC and I'll try tanking elites again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hrm, I'll try and answer a little bit.  Although you should note, I solo'd a good bit up to around 55, but havent solo'd one bit since then.  You mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
As far as mobs you should still be able to tank, there are some you should still be able to tank.  Golems in the Grey, just about anything on the plateau in Scarlet Desert, toilers in maidens eye, certain mobs in skyfire.  I can't remember which of the skyfire mobs really.  Wurms seem to hit fairly hard, chromadrakes dispell and arent worth the effort.  The sperms are easy though, and the other wyverns and other mob that i can't think of the name off the top of my head should be doable.<br />
<br />
You didn't ask for gear advice.  And there is alot of people willing to answer gear questions if you actually wanted it.  But I thought I'd throw a few out there to mebbe get you thinking about what you could do.<br />
<br />
There are things you can do to upgrade your gear short of temple of veeshan.  Some are expensive.  Some are very expensive.  Some you probably won't see solo, but if you plugged away at them in groups, you'd get them eventually.  You might want to think about raising your hp's as well as ac.  It's hard to raise both at the same time.  But if you manage it, it's well worth it.<br />
<br />
If you were floating in money, here are some things that you could buy for upgrades on ac and hp's<br />
<br />
Imbued granite spaulders<br />
The Seahorse cloak out of Siren's Grotto<br />
Heirophants cloak<br />
Buying the stuff to quest the Potc earring<br />
Crystalline Spider Eyes<br />
Coldain skin gloves<br />
Cobalt Drake Belt<br />
Spider Fur Belt<br />
6ac/65 ring or shadel bandit ring<br />
<br />
And of course, for spending some real cash, there is the new cultural player made chain armor.  Very nice hp's on all peices.  Decent ac on most of it.<br />
<br />
That's a good chunk of money.  I don't think most people have the cash for wholesale upgrades like that.  But, mostly start small, and work your way up.  Try to get what you can in xp groups, and pay for as little as possible :D</div></div><hr />
