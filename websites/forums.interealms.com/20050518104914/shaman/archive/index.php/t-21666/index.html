<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I missed it, but apparently there were a couple GM's running rogues that would assasinate players for 400 plat.  A guildy of mine paid to have one of the guild rangers assasinated.   :p <br />
<br />
Anyway...we all got a big kick out of this event and I hope SoE does more stuff like this...it really adds a lot to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
DANG!  I missed it. :mad: <br />
I'd blow 10kpp to repeatedly slay a few people from our R&amp;F/Scammers forums for 400pp a pop. :p   Did you catch any names?  I want to do this!  That's a money-sink I'd gladly participate in.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">haha, that does sound like fun, 400p seems low, I'd probably have everyone in the guild assassinated for a laugh.  I can just see their faces now and the comments they'd have.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, man, to just sit in PoK and have anyone who shouted &quot;plz&quot;, &quot;N E&quot;, or &quot;pst&quot; killed.... I'd turn my account back on for a day to blow my 100k on that, provided I could keep assiduous vision on my hired assassin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sit in bazaar, find all the PST newbs, all the traders that over price items, all the newbs that constantly ask stupid questions, and the newbs that give even more stupid answers back. The fun... the fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I paid them 401pp on Quellious to kill my Guildleader, but I think they were unable to do that as he was in PoTranquil(cant attack anything there), then he laughed at them and zoned into an elemental plane, and they couldnt follow him :*(<br />
<br />
  After some deliberations they gave me back my moneh!!!<br />
<br />
  Was still fun to see my confused friend, as 2 NPC looking things(complete with a First and Last name in the /say window) were harassing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Interesting way to sap the plat surplus out of the game. Hired killers lol. I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OOH!  why do I have to be packing :*(   Woulda slain MANY current and ex guildies, repeatedly.<br />
<br />
<br />
  GM, here's 40K, bindcamp Gloriana till she squeals, charge me if it goes over the mark :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*laughs* That's a fun idea they came up with.</div></div><hr />
