<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trooll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a troll shaman worshiping Innorruk.  I just turned level 40 and finished up gathering the 4 components for canni 2.  (Clay from CoM, Bones from KC, Powder from TT, and the ground spawn from TD)  I then found the great Oowompa in Timoreous Deep and hailed him.  Nothing.  I conned him and he was dubious to me.  The raiders around him were all apprehensive.  So after searching on a few web resources I'm stumped on how to raise my faction with this guy in order to complete the quest.  If any of you know what faction he is on and how to raise it, I would be most grateful for your help.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd imagine he's on the same faction the other ogres are on. and you should be able to do it dubious? I was iksar and had no problem. I did my turn in running behind him while he was agro on someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">that faction is VS btw. I don't think you need to raise it to turn in for quest. or to be sure get  an ench to charm him for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Great Oowamp isn't on VS faction, as far as I remember. All the other ogres on the island are, however, and the Oowamp may well assist them if they attack you.<br />
<br />
When I did the Canni 2 quest I couldn't get the Oowamp to talk to me at all, so I took a leap of faith and just handed him the items. It worked, and I got the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ask Oowomp, 'Who are the McMerin Clan?'<br />
See if he responds to that.<br />
<br />
I'm Iksar, and Oowomp is indifferent to me -- I had assumed he was neutral to everyone, so I wonder why he's not to you. The other ogres are on VS faction, but he'll assist them anyway. Maybe he likes other ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you can get quest text out of him then you can do the quest.  I was max KOS to VS when I did mine and he was indiff.  Just pull the crap around him and kill it so it does not interfere.</div></div><hr />
