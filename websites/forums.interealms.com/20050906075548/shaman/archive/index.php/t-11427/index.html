<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is it worth it for someone who has been gone about 8 months?  tell me what you think ;).  i still get longings every once in a while.  also, what do you think of your current server?  i'd consider moving servers if there are good ones out there, pretty much everyone i know from quellious is gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OMG Mojo! Come back to Quellious if you're coming back! (And join us :P We could use another good raid shaman.) I'm sure you'd know half our roster anyway hehe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's always stuff to do in EQ no matter how long you've been gone.  With PoP especially, it is very easy to catch up.  If you want to play then go for it.  I think that VI reactivated a lot of innactive accounts last week, didnt they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly my opinion of EQ is this.<br />
<br />
Correct me on my history if im wrong but VI was calling the shots before , then SoE stepped in and took the reigns , there i now a whole new team basicly running the show. If not then whatever , all i know is for the last few months ive seen alot of positive changes , we still are missing a lil attention , but whatever. To me what i see is a comany trying to undo a MESS that was made of this game. I think they are doing pretty good , the actions in LoY and before LoY have sold me on this idea. The motivation might be pride in a product , or pure greed cause people were getting sick of stuff , but the fact is i see a comany putting fourth atleast a lil more effort to make this a better game. This mght be all perspective , but thats what i see.<br />
<br />
Persoanly im pleased with EQ alot more today then i was 5 months ago and im STILL having alot of fun.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps you decide in some way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heya Mojo! :)<br />
<br />
I'd love it if you came back again, but if I was in the same position as you, I'd like for someone to tell me the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't come back.<br />
<br />
Read a book, watch a good movie, go play some pool, watch the sunset, learn another language for that trip you can be planning, go for a bike ride, a hike, a walk in your most naturistic area.  Go camping, swimming, learn martial arts (I know you're a black belt already).  Make a web page for your family to look at.  Go through your old pictures and reminisce.  Call up an old friend that you've lost contact with.  Call your grandma/grandpa/mom/dad/brother/sister.  Volunteer.  Give your mate more attention and care than you have ever done before.<br />
<br />
You may not see &quot;Your skills in ******* have improved (###)&quot;, but it'll be happening.   And to the best character you've ever created.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what I'd like someone to tell me after I've ended my time in EQ.<br />
<br />
But what you really want to hear is that the game is still a helluva lot of fun, and there's a ton of stuff to be doing, especially for one of the ubers like yourself.  Others are returning too.  Hell, even Derra (Pahtoonya) is back again.<br />
<br />
Whatever you decide bro...be well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like EQ alot, I think there is still alot of fun to be had.<br />
<br />
On the otherhand PoP is absurdly frustrating at 65 if you arent in a giant raid guild. You find yourself with nothing to do but xp in bot or pov basically. Maybe CoD or HoH if you can stomach boring lb mob camps for key parts(but keep in mind that you wont ever progress past them if you get in via key quest).<br />
<br />
Topping that off is that the xp is so great in dreadlands 2.0 - 8.0 that even at 60th there is no point in xping anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Basically if you are a more casual player.. resign yourself to xping in dreadlands 2.0 - 8.0 till you want to shove your spear of fate right between your eyes =p<br />
<br />
If you are a heavy raider  you will prolly like it though =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi Mojo. Though you never really knew me, I am one of those fairly old school Shamans on Quel, that ironically, no one has ever heard of lol.<br />
<br />
I think you need to ask yourself a few things. Like, do you want to come back but not have EQ take over your life in many ways all over again, as an example. PoP is clearly catored to the uber guild crowd, the rest of us tend to often be bored. So with that, you know to be really productiive, you will probably have to be raiding a lot. So if you really are serious about coming back, be ready for it to take over a lot of your life again. <br />
<br />
I still play to this day, even in a guild that isn't all that ambitious. But I'm a pretty sad addict :p. If I were to have left for as long as you did, I wouldn't come back for what SoE has layed out on the table currently, but that is just my opinion. Good luck to you whatever you decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Quitting EQ is easy, I do it frequently.<br />
<br />
As long as you know you can walk away when you need to, playing EQ is a passtime.<br />
<br />
However, if EQ is an all-consuming activity for you, or you fear that it may become one, then my advice is don't come back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I enjoy eq .. i like grouping / raiding .. it's fun and beats watching TV<br />
<br />
i don't ever sacrifice RL for eq .. i play bball twice a week and football every few weeks .. eq in moderation is fun. <br />
<br />
If you do come back, staying on your server would allow you to raid easier, but if you really want to go to a new server, you may want to consider e'ci. It has probably the most advanced public raiding system out of all the servers, and while I don't really participate now in it, i have in the past. They're up to tier-3 pop zones and taking out AoW and comparable encounters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well one thing i would definitely not be able to do is devote much time to it, it'd just be a for fun thing.  not only am i working a full time job, but i am also in the process of starting up my own company with an old high school friend, and those of you who have done it know how much work you have to put into it if you want it to be successful.  i'm so low on time that i don't have time to hit the gym more than twice a week, and i've had to stop taking jiu jitsu :(.  i've pretty much read every book i own ten times, and tv sucks.  things with the woman are good, but she's in LA and i only see her on weekends.<br />
<br />
i definietly don't want to get into raiding.  while i enjoy it, it takes too much time for me.  i dunno, im still thinking about it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am having an absolutel blast, but I started over 100% from scratch with 3 other people.<br />
<br />
I went necro this time, so I feel shame. However, with pop portals, and bazaar, easier to get things, and most of all, population is spread out.<br />
I have set foot in only one luclin zone really, to get an item, and no Planes, I dont even have the foggiest idea how to get to them.<br />
<br />
There is so much damn stuff to do even otuside newest expansions now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another 'old school' SHM here (so old, Sunmoon has apparently erased my post count which was 2k+). I remember you from way back Mojo. I have left many times, once for over a year and a half. I have to say the game is much more enjoyable now than it has ever been.  KEI mixed with Bear Form (has regen)/Chloro (or whatever)/SLN (has regen component) = almost zero downtime = EQ that doesn't suck (which DAoC was supposed to be but I digress).<br />
<br />
PoP made travel trivial (I always thought the Firepots did too but alas I was one of those that didn't get the chance to bind in TD before they made it unbindable - which, if you don't know, is bindable again).<br />
<br />
They have made many improvements to the game that are clearly geared towards making the game more fun. I hardly ever see crowds anymore (cept maybe the bazaar,  Ssraeshza Temple, Nexus or PoP bank) as the world is so big now that we are no longer cramed into LGuk or SolB (how's that for old school). They have added so many new and improved equipment items that you can't possibly keep up with it thereby flooding the game. That makes it almost meaningless to farm (cept for a small percentage of super uber items) which means loot whores, camp holders, lists for camps, fighting for camps, camps in general, fighting for drops, are mostly a thing of the past.<br />
<br />
In fact, the area of the world per capita is so big, you pretty much have to bring your own group to many of the places that used to be overly camped. Finally, with Paludal Caverns and its insane xp bonus, you can get from 1 to 25+ in days, so starting a new toon is also trivial.<br />
<br />
They have addressed all the issues I had with the game. There just isn't any reason left to NOT play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Good to hear its going well for you Mojo!<br />
<br />
If you finally managed to get out of the claws of EQ I would urge you to stay away - even though it seems that there are quite a few people that you know that are still playing :-)<br />
<br />
If you really do think you can manage to only play a little from time to time you should probably start all over on a different server so that you dont get tempted/twinked by old friends to level too fast.<br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever you do and I hope to hear how it goes with the new business.<br />

Sorell, if your post count was removed, send a private message to the mods, mine got screwed up a while ago too. Think Thantu hooked me up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I tried coming back a few months ago (back in November?). Wasn't worth it in the end. I ended up in the same place I always do, burned out and bored, but in a MUCH shorter period of time this time around.<br />
<br />
The wife and I are 99.99% sure we're done with EQ. We played to get as much fun out of it as we could, and even that only lasted a couple of months this time.<br />
<br />
My advice: give it a shot, but sign up for single monthly recurring charges and NOT 3/6/12 months in advance. Play as long as it's fun, quit (again) when it's not. <br />
<br />
I think we've played that tune for all it's worth at this point though.</div></div><hr />

LOL :)<br />

I still enjoy playing.  But my alt is a 55 sk so I have some variety in play styles.<br />
<br />
I do find myself only playing an hour or so at a time and sometimes I go a week without playing.<br />
<br />
I might have finally balanced EQ and RL.  Dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh, I came back a couple months ago.  Just before I left, I'd quit the Uberguild I was in, so I signed all my toons back to my original guild, and I'm having fun.<br />
<br />
I leveled to 60 pretty easily in the new planes, and stopped there, turned AA on.  I flip between casual XP at 60 in tier 1 zones, some older zones like OS, Cazic Thule, UP, Grotto, etc., and playing smaller characters.  But at 60, I have no shortage of places to go, I understand once you flip up to 61, it's a bit different.<br />
<br />
I've also come back with the understanding that SoE/Verant is totally incapable of providing sufficient customer support, so I can live with it.<br />
<br />
If you can play casually and have fun, do it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Twidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Come back and start a ranger, youll never look back...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">come to think of it i dont even have the cds anymore.  oh well :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Don't let that stop you.  If you're coming back, you want PoP for Plane of Knowledge travel ease if nothing else.  That'll run you near $30.  For a total of $50, you can get the gold box which includes everything through PoP, so lack of CDs shouldn't be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">looks like all us OG shaman decided to think about starting back up at the same time here!<br />
<br />
brings back some memories :)<br />
<br />
I think I am going to start back over from the beginning and see what I can do.<br />
<br />
deffinately going shaman again, maybe something other than the barb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I too, have been thinking of coming back to the game I stopped playing 2 months before Luclin.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to read up on everything thats happened since I left, boy is there a lot.  I have also been trying to follow my old guilds progress.  When I left they were just starting WW dragons.  Now they are taking on AoW and some of the  POP targets like Grummus.  Add to the fact that all I have left on my character is my epic and a couple of pieces of no drop gear, and you can see I have some catching up to do.<br />
<br />
Also like mojokyn, after the last time I quit I ended up destroying my CDs.  Is there a way I can download the necessary files for the expansions.  Im saying this because I really dont have the cash to spend $80 on EQ gold.</div></div><hr />
