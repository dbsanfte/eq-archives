<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">thats for SK epic ( i think, not sure, maybe rogue) .  He doesnt drop log every time but it is usually much more common than the scroll, keep trying, it will drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It took a couple of days for me to find the courier, but he does pop in two distinct spots in the stables, and he usually does drop the student's log.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I killed him about 5 times I think.   Every time he dropped the scroll.  The last time, he dropped the scroll and my log. Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fairly sure that when you right click on the correct scroll, it'll list it as the 'Student's Log'. Anything else and you've got more camping to do.</div></div><hr />
