<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I, an oracle, got my ass handed to me tonight by a level 56 paladin.  I'm a gimp without malo and torpor, so I dunno what to do :o.<br />
<br />
I annuled him 3 times to make sure his buffs were clear, but after that the only spell I landed was insidious decay, and it only stuck b/c it is unresistable.  After ID, he resisted 3 POI and 2 poxxes.  malosini didnt take.  turgur's didnt take.  no way to try and epic him b/c he would interrupt me thanks to the 9 second cast time.  I tried everything I had on him and couldn't land a single spell.  When I was oom I gave up and declared him the winner.<br />
<br />
He had a nature's defender, a very nice 2hs that was hitting me for 150's regularly, even with over 1000ac.  He said his MR was about 160.  blah<br />
<br />
Afterwards, a rogue in the guild said &quot;it's not what you do when your spells work, it's what you do when they DON'T work that make you good at pvp.&quot;  That made sense to me, but I am absolutely stumped on what I can do.  This rogue swears that shamans are one of the strongest pvp classes, but he is also known for talking out his ass about stuff he's clueless about :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TjSz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">High level melees with high resists are very hard to kill. Heck, high lvl melees with low resists are hard to kill because our dots take so damn long to cast (not to mention the LOS changes which really screwed shaman PvP in certain zones). I don't have insidious decay yet (51) but you may be able to stack maladay over it which will drop his resists even lower. Does he have a horse or run 3 or jboots? If he doesn't just train him and try to KS the mobs. Somebody might say use a pet. But a paladin with a good weapon should own your pet right quick. I dont' think there are really too many options. Oh, I would dispell more then three times or inspect him before the fight to check what kind of resist gear he has. He might have Resist Disease low in his buff stack. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The classes were balanced by looking at relative abilities one to the other, not with PvP glasses.  If you tried to balance them both ways, then all the classes would be virtually the same.  Because of this, Shammy's are one of the least capable /dueling classes.  We're pretty good if yer talking about GvG, but not PvP.  We're too support-based for us to be a real threat to tanks, chanters, monks and hybreds.  If you wanna see something funny, watch a warrior take apart a cleric, once he gets his hands on him.  After the first hit, the cleric doesn't move or complete casting anymore ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Knights are supposedly very hard to beat in a duel (I suck at PvP too so shout at me if I'm misinformed). So don't feel too bad!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pali's are a VERY strong PvP class, chief.  Don't let it get you down.  One thing I'd suggest (assuming you can stick them) is to look into your spellbook.  Check for spells that have other effects and low casting times.  Blind is very effective.  Also, don't overlook melee if you see them casting.  It doesn't take much to move someone, and hybrids have no channelling skills.<br />
<br />
One problem with being a caster (other than a wizard) is that most of your stuff can be resisted easily.  A well prepared tank can probably eat you alive.  Pumice stones for dispells, clickable cure poison/disease stuff, SoW potions, etc.<br />
<br />
Log onto a PvP server and get some advice from the shaman there!  :)  I bet they have some kick-ass advice!<br />

<br />
have you used your pet? Have you used the terrain to your advantage? After ID try to stick Insideous Malady. If I do this, most disease dots stack.<br />
<br />
But: If a pally is well prepared for PvP you really have a hard time winning. He has all tools to beat you up (Dispel on himself to remove dots, cures, heals, LOH, stuns, nice melee output). This is for sure one of the toughest opponents you could look for.<br />

<br />
But I would definately have Blind mem'ed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TjSz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually I think a lot of the classes were reasonabley balanced in PvP before Velious/Luclin. Uber melee gear + uber resists + AAs + Selo's speed Horses totally wrecked balance.<br />
<br />
It would be great if Verant had an Old school PvP server with no Luclin/Velious. Or at least took out lifeburn/manaburn put in a PvP melee dammage nerf (hi spell dammage nerf) and made horses dispellable..<br />
<br />
As for the suggestion of using blind you aren't goign to land blind on somebody with 160MR. Is that buffed or unbuffed btw? If you get Malo and it gets the 50% effectiveness bonus on blue servers and the 160 MR is buffed and you dispell MR and land Malo for -67 MR leaving your opponent with 53 MR then blind/root might work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bind somewhere in zone<br />
<br />
Summon a pet<br />
<br />
Mem all your disease spells (insid, poi, pox, and plague)<br />
<br />
Send in the pet and cast these dots<br />
<br />
Gate to your hiding spot<br />
<br />
Bind sight and wait to make your move.<br />
<br />
This will lead to a long boring fight, but you can regain mana better than he can.  He can regain health better than you without torpor, but his mana will run dry.  Then you can use your DoTs to take him out.  For extra fun make some DS potions and use your JBBP for extra damage shield.  Has worked for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey don;t feel bad. I have Topor and Malo and its HARD as hell to kill a palli in pvp.  Once had 2 of them wipe out a group of 8 people who can pvp.  Could not out run them ,due to the AA  horse, trust me i tried.<br />
<br />
If I am able to sneak the Palli I MAY land Bane after 2 or 3 casts. With the DD componet  on our dots we do tend to get resisted.  I try to stick my pet and maybe open with epic dot if im lucky (once again sneaking).   If you cast topor on yourself you are pretty much dead if the person has primal/ crit aa points.  <br />
 <br />
Yes before Luclin I was able to fight with hardly any complaints in pvp but with the addition of AA points well its a new ball game.  I had one Palli crit me for 500 a pop, twice in a row.  OUCH.<br />
<br />
I hate to sound like a broken record but we have not had a upgrade to our DD or Dots since Kunark.   Even if we got the ancient spells they would still be resisted.    Still partner up with a enchanter and a Bard and there is no one you can't kill :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Against a melee, particularly a paladin (a tough class for a shaman to beat), dont fight them in an Arena. Fight them somewhere where you have room to maneuver.<br />
<br />
Use levitate, and get yourself up a slope then run straight out towards the downslope to get a bit of extra time to cast. Against someone you know has high DR, mem ID and IM, and cast both. Slow with Plague of Insects once IM has landed, then drop Pox and/or Plague.<br />
<br />
With paladins, once you've gotten the spells on him that you want, dispel once with Nullify to clear out the first two slots. If he doesnt have more than one insta-clicky besides JBoots, his DOT heal (one of the main things that make a paladin so hard to kill) will now drop into that second slot, where you can dispel it as soon as he casts it. If he has a Goblin Skull Earring *and* JBoots, then you're pretty much screwed. :p<br />
<br />
Errr...just realized the paly you were fighting was only 56th, so he didnt have Celestial Cleansing yet, but the tactic still stands for 59+ paladins. Fortunately, paladins only get Counteract Disease, so it's not easy for them to remove the debuff *and* the DOT/Slow, as long as you reapply ID everytime he cures it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A 56 paladin with 150mr very likely sacrificed a ton of HP, AC and mana to get there. Given that your disease dots were also heavily resisted, it seems likely that he buffed his disease resists too. <br />
<br />
Therefore I'd recommend that you actually nuke him to death. It sounds like a cold-based attack was the last thing he would have expected from you. Would have certainly been worth a shot. With canni and some decent regen you would be able to avoid his melee and wear him down with nukes now and then. <br />
<br />
Don't do what they expect you to do. Anybody smart facing a shaman is going to buff his PR, DR and MR (if a melee).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I play on Rallos Zek (/wave Hi Vova!) and I hardly use my 54 balst. Because it is 7 seconds!! 7 seconds is a lifetime in pvp. I hate that spell. Why did we get stuck with a 7 sec nuke when everybody else got a 4 sec or less nuke???<br />
<br />
Druid's 54 Scoriae - 4 sec<br />
Mage 54 Char - 2 sec<br />
Necro 54 Deflux - 3 sec lifetap<br />
Cleric 54 Reckoning - 3.5 sec<br />
<br />
That is 2/3 priest classes with &lt;4 sec nukes. Where's my 3 sec nuke?<br />
<br />
Only other class that got screwed was enchanter with a 6 sec cast time. Last night I could not get a 7 sec blast off on a monk who was about 100 hp to dead. He aggrod a guard and it killed him.<br />
<br />
I say 'Hey Verant. How about a 4 second Ice nuke?&quot;  They are such bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jindaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Trust me - coming from a PvP server I can tell you killing an equal or greater levelled Paladin at 55th level such as I am is a damn near imposibility.  If the Pally knows his stuff he will simply cure off or dispell any form of damage you can do to him.  He will run you OOM and then open up on the melee.<br />
<br />
Shaman do not have the killing blow to gamble with the LoH and win - the Paladin keeps that in his pocket if he has it up - if not his healing powers are pretty damn good without it.<br />
<br />
Don't feel bad about this not being a win on your side - you will do well against other classes, but fighting a Paladin is a tough one for almost any class shy of a MB wizard.<br />
<br />
By the way - Pumice &gt; any druid :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Since disease isn't working on him, we need to use something that is guaranteed to NOT resist.<br />
<br />
Yookin be prepared too, hows alchemy by da way?<br />
<br />
Anyways - go farm Ice giant toes and make yourself more Stinging Warts than life.<br />
<br />
The Chardok Ring at the moment is sorta icky to get, but was informed not too long ago it stacks with our 31pt DS potion, if ya have a JB BP then thats about 59 self DS!<br />
<br />
Along with that, other preparations may include Ivandyrs Hoop. I'd hunt ice giants a while maybe with a friend, (some are dark blue at 60). Get about 110 toes and yer set for about 30000 instant heal damage?<br />
<br />
If average hit is 150, you'll have at least 5000 self chloroblast healage (I'd use superior heal+ focus items if you have em), 30k from the warts you have over 35000 worth of heals.<br />
<br />
35000/150 = 233 hits, that multiplied by 59 would be 13700dmg just from damage shield =) Shy of 8000 with only JB bp + the DS potion.<br />
<br />
If he has a soulfire than it'll prolly be sorta icky, that would only equal more Stinging Warts, as pet kiting doesn't work if you know what you are doing (joust pet).<br />
<br />
I would cast Insidious Decay and maybe Malady if you can get it to land( I realize you had well over 5 disease resists) on him just to freak em out and pretend those are dots, don't let em know that you have dmg shielding, hopefully he doesn't know much about shaman class =(<br />
<br />
Ivandyrs Hoop = 720 dmg and 720hp heal for yoo<br />
<br />
I know using potions is cheesy but pet is too easily jousted, his disease resist is apprently too high to land Pox even with a debuff. I'm thinking he can probably still live after we nuke him with our full bar, remember the 66% penalty.<br />
<br />
A shaman with 3000mana (average?) will be able to nuke about 12 times, max hit of 445ish. Since he had a lot of resist gear, lets say he has uhm 2500hp to be cool? Loh will heal a lot... then add in his single heals and bang...we can't do enough damage to take him down, count in resists cause after all he has resist gear =(<br />
<br />
PS I'm an ogre so my math prolly sucks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously. <br />
<br />
How do i out-melee a melee class?  Please tell me b/c i am dying to know.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone else for the good info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When I was lvl 58, I fought a duel in the arena (lake rathe one) with a lvl 59 paladin (epic) and won.  I had exactly the same issues as you describe.  He had very high DR and PR and forget it as far as MR goes . . WAY too high for me to land anything.  I had a dog to help me, but I had the restriction that I couldn't leave the platform in the middle of the arena.  <br />
<br />
I used guile to win.  First I pet kited him and when he attacked the pet I clicked epic on him.  That annoyed him so he turned on me again with the dog still nipping at his ankles.  Round and round we went, me running away, him pursuing, dog nipping.  <br />
<br />
He turned and tho I cast a heal on the dog, it died anyway.  OK, pally at half life due to the epic dot . . . kewl . . but I'm outta options.  <br />
<br />
I remembered a spell that I thought before had nothing to do with PvP:  Invisibility.  I managed to mem that spell in between getting my ass handed to me and managed to cast it.  I disappeared . . . paladins dont get see invis spells and this one lacked any items that granted this.  I got behind him and away a bit and started casting epic on him.  I landed it and he came after me, i dodged and ran away with him pursuing.  I kept that up till the dot wore off and he was lower on life.  <br />
Then when he stopped to celestial cleansing his hps back up, I cast the epic on him again.  round and round we went.  I used invis to gain casting time again and again and he kept LoH and efficiently healing himself.  This went on for probably 15 minutes and FINALLY he ran outta mana and I won.  <br />
<br />
So it CAN be done, but yer gonna need a bit of luck and a lot of guile.  I went on to beat a lvl 60 warrior with ToV gear in the finals after that and to win the PvP tournament.  I killed him with judicious use of dots (disease landed), pet, and epic.  I had to chain 'blast the pet to keep him alive vs. the warrior who decided to kill it right off but the pet died right as the warrior did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Using invis was a good idea. Give you props for that. Poor suck pally never thought about buying a bracer of hidden for 3k   :)  Probably goes for less on a non PvP server.<br />
<br />
First thing I ever do when I get attacked by anyone other than a wizard/mage is two clicks of my Egg-Shaped pumice. That would take pretty much all the buffs a pally could muster. He has to spend the time to rebuff if he wants DR or PR back. If he tries to rebuff that is just extra time for you to epic.<br />
<br />
Keep annul magic memmed as well, because when he dot heals, you cancel that off him. Sucks if you spend all that mana to heal and it gets wiped. I do that all the time to necro/druids that like to splurt/winged death. 350 mana to get it wiped away by a 75 mana spell really sucks.<br />
<br />
Those are just my ideas. I have better luck beating melees than I do casters. Just dont have the damage output if dots resisted. Screw that 7 sec DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">At 45 I almost beat a level 51 Paladin... but he was kind of a gimp. Didn't even try dispell me. Got him down to a couple hundred hps. Probably could've won if I had a JBB/Fungi or refreshed my chloro before the fight (3 seconds in and it goes down... ARGH!).<br />
<br />
I've always heard you need high MR against a Paladin so they don't just blind/stun/root you themselves. At only around 90MR I resisted maybe 90% of his spells other than blind.<br />
<br />
With that high MR/PR/DR and probably CR he's dropped a lot of AC. Can't totally depend on kiting because he can blind you just as well as you can blind him (maybe better).<br />
<br />
Dispell more. Use pumice or whatever. 3 won't cut it. I Dispelled that guy about 8 times with Nulify and I know he still have buffs (and wasn't bunk buffed). They get fancy self regen, haste, bollocks, etc now.<br />
<br />
Paladin's have a LOT of healing power. Gotta down them 5 times before they actually die. Anytime he &quot;glows&quot; you have to dispell him again or he's just eating an unsnared/unslowed Torpor.<br />
<br />
Of course... if he's got dispell memmed with correctly ordered slots and a nice stack of cure potions you better just bend over and take your medicine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If he is in an open place like say East Commons it is real easy to just joust the pet and you can't even land a spell on him because if he's smart he wont sit in one spot and attack the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Don't feel so bad. Pallys are no push over in PvP.Lot of good info allready posted here so I will try to throw a bit of my two cents in without saying whats been said. Start with your own casted pet.If the tank pally ever takes attention off you and goes to the pet ,use nuke. If he/she stays on you, oh well, not like its a difference when we solo anyways. Great pvp item to use is a instant click pet maker drop KC. He they kill the pet, click new pet.  If you have a mage who you know, have them make you some focus items. The faster caster ring and more better damage bracer rock in pvp. Use your potion ability. Stinging wort potions and damage shield potions help alot. If you get it to the point where they use LoH, from then, it is a matter of who can last the longest, or who runs oom first. Since we have cann, chances are, we will last longer. Try and try to land malosini on him until it lands. Once it does, start layin on debuffs, like cripple and slow.Then blind. If you can get a fungus spore in FG, use that too, its a snare right click, 10 charges. From then, start their downfall. Course, this like I said, depends on who lasts the longest. And what like Soupy said, they have to sacrafice some gear to make their resists higher. Use that to your advantage. I'll post more when I wake up more.</div></div><hr />
