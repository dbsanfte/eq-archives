<br />
I originally posted this response to your request in Gloriana's thread reporting on her trip to the summit.  You had said that you needed further proof to show to Rytan, could the shaman community provide it?  So I posted this.<br />
<br />
I also offered the comment there that you did a fine job of responding to the various flames and shaman-vs-shaman backbiting that flared up there for a bit, and asked for you to do a similarly fine job of responding to a thoughtful presentation of evidence for you to share with Rytan.  <br />
<br />
Haven't gotten any response.  Not a word.  As I said, probably lost in the clutter there.  So I'm reposting it here.<br />
<br />
********** pasted from post in original summit report thread ****<br />
<br />
The shaman community has provided lots and lots of arguments and numbers. Numerous shaman have provided pages of specific numbers showing how shaman heals, slows, and dps compare poorly with other classes. Murtak's detailed analysis is the one that sticks out in my mind most clearly, a model of clear persuasive mathematical argument. We are given to understand that Rytan has been unconvinced by this. You have asked us to provide stronger proofs. Let me try to provide some.<br />
<br />
Proof #1. Murtak et al have provided pages of hard mathematical evidence demonstrating the progressive weakening of the shaman class in healing, damage dealing, and slowing. Rytan has provided no counter evidence. Therefore Murtak et al must be deemed correct, and Rytan must be deemed to have conceded the argument. Thus it is proved: Shaman have been progressively weakened in core areas: healing, damage dealing, and slowing.<br />
<br />
Proof #2. The Steel Warrior and the Ranger's Glade (I expect the monks and SKs as well) have posted many extensive parses demonstrating the very minor differences that increases in strength and dexterity have on damage-dealing. Rytan has provided no counter evidence. Therefore the warrior and ranger analysts must be deemed correct, and Rytan must be deemed to have conceded the argument. Thus it is proved: increases in buffing power will have miniscule effect in actual game play.<br />
<br />
Proof #3. Melees newly arriving at Vex Thal and Tier 3 Planes are almost at the present stat cap. Most Time / Gates melees already have equipment that would give them at least 50 more strength, stamina, and dexterity if there were no stat caps. So if the stat cap were raised by another 50 points, these melees would already be maxed. A shaman giving every stat buff would not raise their stats at all. Rytan has provided no counter evidence that buffing would somehow make a difference for melees whose stats are already capped. Thus it is proved: increases in buffing power can have no effect at all on those whose stats are already maxed from equipment.<br />
<br />
Proof #4. There are dozens of personal testimonies on this board of how the shaman class was strong and welcome at level 50 in Kunark, and now feels marginalized or useless at level 65 in Gates. You indicated in a post here several months ago that there is indeed a purpose or vision for shaman in this new content, and you would find out what that vision is. You have not provided this. Therefore the shaman community must be deemed correct, and you must be deemed to have conceded the argument. Thus it is proved: SOE has no vision for what shaman are supposed to be doing in new content; shaman have indeed been marginalized.<br />
<br />

I'm looking forward to real responses.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they're implementing the ability to break the stat cap by buffs only. If so, then it's not something all that bad. Pretty cool if we could actually buff people and not worry about it not raising stats due to caps.<br />
<br />
It would be beneficial, no doubt. But the real problem lies in them thinking it would be useful and therefore help balance us. In fact, as many people pointed out stats themselves barely do anything, especially at high numbers.<br />
<br />
Rytan on the other hand thinks they work wonders and if this does go through you can bet he'll start saying Shamans shouldn't be complaining our about our buffs anymore since there is no more cap on them.</div></div><hr />
