<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday I was in a open raid and shrank the whole raid was a madness.<br />
A lot of noobs don't know that shrink is only for group members like the invis spell. Would Sony fix Tiny terror in the future? We need a MGBable shrink spell. :mad: <br />
<br />
The raid was a total wipe if you want to know... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe how many years have we been asking for shrink castable out of group?  Thankfully, everyone in my guild has bought a shrink device or some other shrinking item, and I am very rarely asked to shrink out of group.  Happened tonight, though.<br />
<br />
I am not making this up:<br />
<br />
druid (of course it just had to be a druid) tells you, 'SD pls'<br />
/t druid I'm a shaman yo<br />
druid tells you, 'I mean tali of tribunal' note: we were doing a raid that does not require tali of tribunal, and this is the second time he has asked me for SD<br />
I give him tali of tribunal - two minutes pass<br />
druid tells you, 'can you shrink us please.'<br />
/t druid, 'cant shrink out of group.'<br />
1 minute passes<br />
druid tells you, 'would you join us and cast?' At this point I was grinding my teeth in real life.<br />
/t druid 'ok'<br />
/gs 'have to shrink some group, brb'<br />
/disb<br />
/t druid 'ready'<br />
2 minutes pass<br />
/t druid 'invite me'<br />
2 minutes pass<br />
druid tells you, 'nm someone got it'<br />
at this point I punched a wall in real life.<br />
<br />
Shrinking other groups wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for incidents like this.  If I could just disband, immediately get invited, cast, disband, and immediately get invited back to my original group, I wouldn't care.  This just pisses me off though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well honestly i guess im more of a prizick about this, but in the long run it ends this madness... for the most part.<br />

#1 You need to have a talk with your guild leader and have them enforce a requirment for carrying a minimizing device. I just picked one up for my SK and it was 850pp, so if you are in a raiding guild and you cant dish out that kinda low end cash for a tool, then you need think again about how much raiding means to you i think.<br />
<br />
#2, Shrink potions. Always carry atleast 2-4 potions. The amount you really need to figure out cause its relitive to how well #1 is currently enforced. Also you should talk to the GL about being funded for this task.<br />
<br />
#3 Talk to the guild leader about having a dedicated Gem carrier. I cant for the life of me remember what recharges the minimizing device, but whatever it is, have someone who raids often carry a stack of them and a toolbox. <br />
<br />
#4 There has to be a cut off on shrinking and buffs for that matter. Obviously this isnt a iron clad situation where you should be a jerk to anyone asking you for buffs. But there is a point in the raid where you spam /rs Last call for buffs and shrink. Let me be clear this is the LAST CALL.  After that they are on their own or you can hand them potions for shrinks. Which are a pain to get back sometimes, but hey, it beats the headache of leaving a group and trying to get someone to re-invite you. I think thats a big problem, people just dont understand how much of a pain in the arse they cause.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thats how i handle things. YOu might think im being a jerk, but really thats not it. Im trying to help people learn how to work as a team and to think about the problems they cause when they dont do the simple things asked of them by the guild. Like a said, 850 isnt alot of a shrinker and if you have a guildie that can make one, its even cheaper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mana battery  - class 6 recharges the device . and I always carry some with me as well as shrink potions and gate potions and i carry the folded toolbox to recharge the device in. ( So what, I was a girl scout LOL )<br />
I also carry peridots and pearls and emeralds. I usually don't have to ask to be reimbursed..ML comes to me and hands me plat or items :)<br />

<br />
They could make this a GoD leadership ability maybe.  That would solve it.  Group leader ability maybe - allow group buffs not normally allowed to be cast out of group to be cast on raid members in different groups.<br />
<br />
Not sure how complicated that would be to code though...<br />
Of course, just letting us tiny terror out of group w/ a confirmation box would solve the whole problem much easier.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never shrink people outside the group, if they dont have a shrink device.. <br />
I normally tell a wuzzy to give them a TL box, I think thats funny :-)</div></div><hr />
