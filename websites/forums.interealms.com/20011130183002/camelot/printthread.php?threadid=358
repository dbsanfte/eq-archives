<p>Thought I'd pass on the little things that have made the game better thus far.<br />
<br />
* You can adjust the messages you see and receive by right clicking on the tabs at the top of your chat box. Useful if you are on the group tab and still want to get tells, etc. This is also where you change text color.<br />
<br />
* You can resize the text box by hold-dragging the upper right hand corner of the text box, then simply dragging the separator line up and down in the two chat boxes. I currently run small text, 6 lines high on both at 1024 resolution.<br />
<br />
* Make sure you do xp/money tasks *before* you do tradeskill tasks. You can do almost unlimited tradeskill tasks per level, but only a certain amount of xp/money. Problem is, they are on the same counter.<br />
<br />
* Most people don't use any spec points on their char until level 5. This gives you the full range of your class talents without wasting a point or two.<br />
<br />
* You can jump off horses at any time by pressing your normal jump key. Useful if you see a rare mob, or don't feel like going the whole way.<br />
<br />
* Every box on the screen can have it's alpha channel accessed and adjusted by right clicking. I run all of mine at about 50% and it makes more of the underlying landscape come through.<br />
<br />
* If you ever die, make sure you recharge your con points before you level. You'll have to buy them at the next level's price if you don't.<br />
<br />
* To remove icons from your quick bar, left-shift + right-click.<br />
<br />
* To create macros such as /assist, type in "/macro /assist playername" That will create a quick button for you.<br />
<br />
* When doing tasks and consignments, I often create a macro for "/whisper help" Whisper allows you to only talk to that NPC without everyone else seeing you type "help" all the time.<br />
<br />
More as I think of them.. add your own! <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<br />
Now that's one I wanted to know.<br />
<br />
Tip of my own.  From what I have seen, if you are going to do tasks, do the kill Xmonster tasks.  You get those from the named guards and certain other NPCs around the land.  <br />
<br />
The kill Xmonster tasks garner more XP and more money.  I'd say it's double what you get from the Fed-x tasks.  Plus, you get the xp and loot from whatever mob that you have to go kill.<br />
<br />
Question.  How does one reply to another through tells?  I've tried typing /reply and /r but neither works.  Is it another command?  I don't have my handbook with me.<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon12.gif" alt="Wink" width="15" height="15" border="0"> </b></p>

<p>[Edit to answer Parson's question] To reply to the last /send you recieved, just hit 'r' without bringing up a typing line.<br />
<br />
The friends list mini-window is your friend. Keep it up all the time, it updates in real time. Set the transparency to match your personal preference.<br />
<br />
When adding friends to your list, they not only have to be online, but in the same zone. All of the outdoors (and the small towns) are considered one zone, but dungeons and the capital are their own separate zones.<br />
<br />
Keep your bow and both hands (whether weapons or shield) hotkeyed on the same hotkey bank to allow for fast swapping of weapon types. If you're an archer, keep your critical shot hotkey on this bank as well.<br />
<br />
It's better to hunt in areas that have few players, since you get a bonus for killing enemies that have been up for a while.<br />
<br />
If you can do so safely, bring your group to the enemy, not the enemy to the group. You get an experience bonus for killing stuff near where they spawned.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's better to fight a 2 or 3 oranges or reds than one purple at a time, you get a bonus for killing the friends your enemy calls for help. This calling for help is often known as BAF (bring a friend).<br />
<br />
Large groups can take on reds or purples typically, this is incredible experience. After a while of super-grouping, take some time soloing greens or working on tradeskill consignments to make up for the lower cash profits grouping provides.<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Nightfox, just hit r<br />
<br />
some other hints i have learned.<br />
<br />
For Kill tasks, check the named guards found closest to areas with mobs your area. For example, level 10 might check around Dvalin, or level 14 might check the tower with the banker at the myrkwood border.<br />
<br />
Why? Because if you are getting kill tasks in a regiion far below your level, say the level 15 recieving tasks in Mulurn, then you will have to run a great distance each time to the mobs and back.<br />
<br />
You can take your text down to an Alpha of 0, which will make the text white and the boc completely clear. A great way to have it, unless you are in a snow region.<br />
<br />
USe the ~ key to look around your character. great when being chased. All you do is hit autorun in a safe directin, and then use this technique to move the camera and look behind you. You can then see if you are still being chased.<br />
<br />
It is also great to use when on horseback or when you /follow someone. Enjoy the scenery.<br />
<br />
After the kill taks mob dies, hit /task to determine if your mission is complete (will say "Return to so and so for your reward".)<br />
If another player or pet got the last hit, your task is NOT complete. Quite a bummer to run all the way back to discover this.<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>You can turn of the dang death messages by right clicking in the system text box ( not the tabs). You can also filter out others hits and such here.<br />
Sadly enough, it's all or nothing on the death messages. So you don't get a message for a mob's death, or a party member, etc.</p>

<p>A few more:<br />

* "/bind" will also tell your current bind location<br />
<br />
* when forced to flee, drop the camera to static  (using F11 a few times) to check your six and see if the mob is still after you<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>** Shift Right Clicking your buff icons will remove the buffs<br />
<br />
** The group mini window can only be brought up when you are currently in a group, after you bring it up however it will not dissapear after you leave the group, or relog. Thus allowing you to place and adjust your mini group window to a permanent position so you don't have to use the big bulky Group interface.<br />
<br />
** Clicking Critcal shot 2 times will switch to a normal shot<br />
<br />
** Whatever arrow is at the top of your inventory when you draw a shot will be the arrow used regardless if you move another stack above before you release the shot<br />
<br />
** Reserve 50% sta for emergencies or fights you are unsure you will win, generally 50% sta and 30% health is all you need to get enough of a lead on a mob in order to escape.<br />
<br />
** Dying will remove the Task you are currently working on (mini quest for tradeskills)<br />
<br />
** Do not use mid over the shoulder camera view when being auto followed by a large PC (Troll, Firblogs) they will occasionally blot out your character and most of the screen<br />
<br />
** Using the scroll wheel while mouselooking in over ther shoulder view will zoom in and out on your character<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

ROFLMAO, very nice.<br />
<br />
Nice thread indeed! I never found out how to remove buffs!<br />
<br />
<li> when you see a buff goes, but 2-3 more disappears, doesn't mean they're not there, just recast one of the buffs (or asks to have one cast on you) will refresh the list o' icons.<br />
<br />
<li> talk (right click) on the bards or travelling minstrels to see if there are quests around your level, they usually have the ability to tell you quests up to two areas away.<br />
<br />
<li> leprecans (sp) are to be exterminated with extreme prejudice<br />
<br />
<li> always, /always/ check how many arrows you have before loosing that first arrow....<br />
<br />
<li>  when you're stuck under the world or between items, you can use /stuck to get away<br />
<br />
<li> use "T" to turn on a torch when you have someone following you, trust me, it helps... lots.<br />
<br />
<li> if you're in town and getting loads of lag (video), go to over the shoulders and tilt the display down a bit, so you're looking somewhat at the ground.<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>You can bring the Lag meter up with Shift+P (or is it Ctrl+P?  Pretty shure it's Shift)  It will give you 3 little indicators.  Green is good, yellow is marginal and red is bad.  I can't remember everything they are measuring though (connection, framerate, and something else).  Sorry, too busy working on my ranger guide (<a href="http://geocities.com/brightblades/daoc.html" target="_blank">http://geocities.com/brightblades/daoc.html</a>).  <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>The /stick command can be used on MOBs as well as player characters. It makes casters with a tendency to ping pong MOBs much less annoying.<br />
<br />
It also comes in handy with styles that must be used from the side or back of a MOB. /Stick, then use the strafe keys to swing around to the side or back.</p>

<p><b> Bow Range</b></p>

<p>I stole this from another ranger, but it works nicely for determining if you are in range to fire an arrow...<br />
<br />
Manually determine if you are in range of a monster.  Move back and forth until you are in the maximum range.  Then use mouse-look and make sure you are looking over your shoulders (so you can see the ground and the monster in front of you).  Next, press F5 (auto target I think).  There is now a cursor target at your feet.  Move the cursor target out to the monster at the edge of your range.<br />
<br />
Now when you find another monster, just turn on this auto-target cursor, to quickly find if it is in your range.  This will save you time, so you don't have to wait for that "target out of range" message.  You can easily "eyeball" it this way.  This is critical when in RvR combat, as wasted time targeting can mean death.<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>-- Tilde(the key that types "~") + arrow keys allow you to adjust the "follow" camera view.  It's a wonderful way to take pretty pictures of yourself, especially on horseback <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
-- If you start in Hybernia, do not kill sheeries at lower levels.  Why?  A lot of quests bring you to areas with purple sheeries roaming around (including your Ranger epic).  It is good to be friends with them <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">  Feel free to kill all Siabras though!<br />
<br />
-- Torch is nice but getting used to it is bad.  Why?  Simple: Would you turn on your flashlight when you are playing hide and seek?  <br />

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>- When in RvR, turn your torch off.<br />
<br />
-  If your group is in trouble, do everything possible to make sure one rezzer makes it out alive, much easier, and much cheaper than all having to do tombstone runs.<br />
<br />
-  If in Hibernia, do not kill Lucradains for your first 17 levels, them bastages love to aggro once they are hostile.<br />
<br />
-  If its a static spawn, the BAF code is definately in play, roaming mobs for the most part can be pulled singly.<br />
<br />
-  Take up a tradeskill, it breaks up the monotony and you can make some nice cash after 350 or so.  (Sorry to ruin your secret Yosh.)  Best bet is to just make items until 250 or so, and then start doing consignment.<br />
<br />
-  If you are doing a tradeskill make friends with other tradeskill people.  I.E.  I can make about 1-2 gold per consignment now because I have a tailor make the parts I need for Scale Armor.<br />
<br />
-  Sometimes the easiest way to raise a secondary skill like metalcrafting is to start another tradeskill.  I.E.  When I needed to raise metalworking to do scale armor, I did weaponcrafting to get the skill raises.<br />
<br />
- Neat little trick in Dungeons when most of your party is wiped out a ways inside the dungeon, and the rezzers zoned.  Have everyone disband, and then have a stealth class start the group.  They can then go down and invite those who are dead, and you can then rez them from a distance without having to fight back to them.</p>

<br />
doh!  I knew I should kill you on EQ test that time.  You know too much.  Here is the full secret: Make Ranger, PL him to level 5 and take up fletching.  Avoid making any metal-headed arrows so your metalworking stays at 1.  PL his fletching to 300 or so.  Then do consignment.  At a skill of 400, you will be making at least 1 gold per consignment.  So far, bow consignment is the best that I have seen.<br />

<br />
Absolutely.  I do digress a bit on the metalworking skill.  I tried the weapon smith route and it was painful (not expensive though).  Then I found that the best way to raise metalworking is to make sellable trinkets (hinges and brackets).  Do not be afraid of the material cost.  THE PRODUCT SELL BACK AT LESS THAN 10% LOST.  I raised my metalworking to 400 with the cost of 3~4 golds.  And it is fast.<br />

From what I understand if they turn and run you will autofollow them so you can still attack them without having to chase them manually.<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>/stick and /follow are the same thing. Basically what happens is 2 things..<br />
<br />
1) you will always face the PC or NPC you are stuck/following. This allows you to easily circle strafe your opponent because strafing is not turning your line of view (which breaks autofollow/stick) Handy for setting up styles from various directions.<br />
<br />
2) You will always stay with range (to the best of your abilities) of the object you are /stuck /follow ing. If they out pace you you will eventually become unstuck/following from them<br />
<br />
basically /stuck is a better more versitile version of EQ's /follow command gives you some more flexability with setting up styles and attacks. Also /following a roaming guard can saver yer ass if your AFK in hostile territory.<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
