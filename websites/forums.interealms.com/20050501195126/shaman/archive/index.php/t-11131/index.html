<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many bone chips does it take? <br />
<br />
I estimate ive turned in around 2500 and am still scowling to the crusaders. (Went from dubious to indif with the Troopers)<br />
<br />
Also are there any other alternatives besides bone chips? My poor little wrist can't take that many more.<br />
<br />
(Barb/Tribunal, if that makes any diffrence)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Troll Shaman Worshipping Inni.<br />
<br />
Took me 7300 bone chips to max all the factions that you get from the bone chip quest.<br />
<br />
I am apphren to Necros and that is from killing thousands of outcast and bandit iksars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yu start wif -2000 fakshun wif Cabilis unless yu worship da one, true god.  Da approximate fakshun ranges be below:<br />
<br />
-800 and below: Ready to attack <br />
-800 to -500: Threateningly <br />
-500 to -100: Dubiously <br />
-100 to 0: Apprehensivly <br />
0 to 100: Indifferently <br />
100 to 500: Amiably <br />
500 to 800: Kindly <br />
800 and higher: Warmly <br />
<br />
Each set of four chips givs ya 1 fakshun point, meanin yu'll need 1500 points or 6000 chips ta get ta dubious wif da Crusaders.<br />
<br />
Da only alternative fer fakshunin Cabilis be da Explorer Knives quest.  Ya gotta kill FV fakshun-aligned explorers in sum ruins in LoIO, gather dems knives and giv to a Trooper who semi-wanders half-way atween Cabilis and da Lake.  Ya get more fakshun per hand-in dis way but da explorer knife drop-rate ain't great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snarky of Cazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Being both of both a good race and deity, it's my sad duty to inform you that you may still have a ways to go. This link on the paladin boards (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showMessage?topicID=66.topic) shows that a Brell worshipping dwarven pally had to turn in more than **7500** bone chips to gain good Cabilis faction. Perhaps it will be easier as a shaman ... but it's difficult to say, and I wouldn't hold your breath.<br />
<br />
There IS a much easier way. *evil chuckle* There is a warrior-factioned npc in Lake of Ill Omen named Trooper Vaurk (he stands alone about halfway between the entrance to Cabilis and the Lake) who will give you the same factions as the bone chip quest - only MUCH faster - for 4 Explorer Survival Knives.<br />
<br />
The catch? The knives are dropped fairly commonly by the explorers in LOIO, which are set up in a hut near the lake. They are on Firiona Vie faction, and killing them gives rather substantial hits with most Faydwer cities. BUT! The quest hand-in itself has no negative faction. So, if you can find an evil guildie/friend willing to kill the suckers for you, you can faction the easy way. Beats the hell out of bone chips, and I wouldn't do it any other way.<br />
<br />
Btw, /wave. First post :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">took me right about 8k bonechips, barb shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you play an evil race and don't care about factions on Faydwer, don't do bone chips - do the aforementioned explorer knife quest in LOIO.  Five or six stacks of the nodrop knives from the explorers there will give you decent faction with most Cabilis faction groups.  (Then you just have to worry about Brood of Kotiz - but then, bone chips have the same drawback.)<br />
<br />
Did it that way the second time I went for Cabilis faction - it's MUCH faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I thought they did away with this quest by permakilling the turn in NPC...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It was broken for a while, you could buy stacks of the knives at a time from some vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They permakilled the turn-in trooper until the problem with the knives being buyable was fixed - he's back now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Blah, I guess its more bone chips for me. I am actually broke from buying bone chips, spent about 1k on them so far.<br />
<br />
Im want to save my FV faction, I don't know why :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can't get an evil friend to kill the explorers to collect the knive for you, they are Nodrop,  well at least the ones I  bought off the vendor were  :p<br />
<br />
The best loved kitty in Cabilis :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Too easy. It's just too damned easy. You should never be allowed into cabilis given that we kill our own if they dont worship CT.<br />
<br />
It's really disgraceful how you see so many softskins running around my hometown these days. Competing with the broodlings in field of bone, hanging out in our taverns..makes me SICK.<br />
<br />
We need to kill every softskin that gets close enough to glimpse the walls of our fair town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Youichi, you let them kill and you loot.<br />
<br />
What level are these explorers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">CT worshipper here, still had to work my green ass off to get them leezards to let me in their city. I think I started off as 1K points better than non CT worshippers but still took so many bone chips, I lost count. I got so burnt out from doing it, all I go to Cabilis for is to buy blood water.</div></div><hr />
