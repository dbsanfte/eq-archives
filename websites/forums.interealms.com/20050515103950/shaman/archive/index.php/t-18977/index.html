<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what some other people's thoughts are on fighting with pets around in this next expansion.   OK, mainly just wanting to ramble, but maybe some good can come of it ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
  From what I have seen, we can get 2 more levels of spiritcall making for a total of 7 SC pets out.  We also have AA for pets getting critical hits and proc'ing a 75 point DD as well as our group spells hitting pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Should all of these enhancements also work on the 7 SC pets, what do you feel is the best line up of spells for utilizing the pets?   If you never tried hasting the SC pets before, I can assure you that even doing them with SLTW singly makes for a huge change in DPS.  So obviously the first spell I would aim for casting after SC activation is Tali of Alac.   Beyond that though I wonder what spell gems are best spent on.   You could try tossing in a group DEX boost for more crits and procs, or throw out some DoTs.<br />
<br />
  It should be interesting to see what new strategies arise with all of this pet modification, and I hope that people not only keep an open mind about what to try, but also an open dialogue about their experiences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Would be interesting, to say the least.  Make sure to pop SC when you need to ToA your group anyway and go to town.<br />
<br />
It remains to be seen if our pet can survive against GoD mobs long enough to be worthwhile.  I can't seem to keep mine alive in LDON.<br />
<br />
Hadn't thought about buffing pet's DEX to improve proc rate.  Has anyone studied whether buffing DEX improves the proc rate when a pet is wielding proccing weapons now?</div></div><hr />

I don't have any data, only ancedotal evidence.  But yes, FoS + Diaku or (if you really want to go crazy)  IoS + Mortal Deftness + Diaku makes a noticable increase in crits with mage weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm. That would be cool use if the silly pet AA worked on SC, 7 dogs with 50% more haste would be some good damage.</div></div><hr />

Thats a big Negative Ghostrider.<br />
DB Cons hit 400+ and that is NOT deep into the Non-instanced zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Besides, a 75pt proc?  Isnt that roughly on par with a level 22 beastlord pet proc?  Really worth the aa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im very leary about these new pet aa.  Although this is a way for us to do more damage with less agro.  How many times have you been in a pick up group where the warrior can hardly taunt the mob off you from your initial slow.  Not being able to nuke or dot with out the mob turning your way.  From what I have read on lucy the pet buff adds 75dex and will proc a 75dd.  I can only hope it has some crazy proc rate like the cleric summoned hammers.  This effect used to be a 75 damage per tick dot, or 12dps if it proced enuff to keep it on the mob constantly.  If it has a average proc rate like one of the proc augs from ldon, its only 1-2dps addition.  The dot is looking better already.  Would really like to hear about those pet crit attacks.  As some one said earlier, it would be nice to have these crit hit work with spirit call pets.  Two extra spirit call pets just means more push.  <br />
<br />
Im really not a fan of dogdog.  I use him with groups, but not very often on raids.  I raid more than I group so you can see that problem.  My only hope is that we all get pleasantly surprized, like with Virulent Paralysis.</div></div><hr />
