<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dear all,<br />
<br />
My character got lucky and joined a reflagging raid with a raid guild 2 months ago and killed the dragon in POV. So I hailed the Planer Projection and got some messages but I did not receive the yellow flag message. <br />
<br />
I followed the raid party to the under ground tunnel and clicked on the portal at the end of the tunnel and ported back to POT. I know I was suppose to zone into HOH if I had done the POJ trial at this stage. <br />
<br />
Last night I finally successed the POJ trail and completed the POV/POS flag with ONE free AA point and an improved POP charm. So to my understanding my HOH flag is not completed and because it was late at night so I did not go any further.<br />
<br />
I used the search function form this board and try to read all the related topic and I believe I need to talk to The Seer and say &#8220;Unlock my memories&#8221; <br />
<br />
Then 2 things might happen: <br />
<br />
Either will fix my flag right away after say that to The Seer or I need to revisit all the Quest NPC and each time I fixed one flag I need to revisit the Seer again for the next flag.<br />
I also got the Grummus flag.<br />
<br />
Or I need to get lucky again and need to join another POV raid and need to hail the Planer projection again and click on the portal at the end of the underground tunnel. I did not actually received any flag from the last POV raid or this flag only can be completed by clicking on the portal underground.<br />
<br />
If possible please share your experience.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much and sorry for my poor English.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">would help if you posted what the seer actually says when you go talk to him.. but yes, doing flags out of order can and should be correct by saying unlock my memories a couple times, since they opened up those zones, preflags arent necessarily needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used the search function form this board and try to read all the related topic and I believe I need to talk to The Seer and say “Unlock my memories”  <br />
<br />
Yes that is the first thing you need to do and it should clear you right up. I would say both tho, Unlock my memories, and Guide my meditation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quoted from Seer after saying Guide my meditation:<br />
<br />
Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunel. The information provided to you the Mithaiel Marr and Karana any information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
<br />
Grummus has been destoryed, about his corpse you found a smalll word to protect from disease.<br />
<br />
Now the Grummus has been destoryed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulor should open before your might.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the typo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make sure you have spoken to Alder Furstil or whatever his name is, the guy standing at the enterance to PoD.  Then go back to seer unlock memories.<br />
<br />
you hail him and say &quot;what ward&quot;, if i remember right, should get you a character flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You didn't get the flag from the draggin in PoV. Where you in the raid that killed him? When exactly was this? Before or after out of order flagging was added (i'd assume after)? The actual flag is like BoT where you get the flag when you zone into the zone. Since you got kicked to pot instead of zoning in you never got the flag. As far as your bert flag yeah you seem to be missing the preflag of &quot;what ward&quot; and if you do that and unlock that should clean up your guided meditation some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had the same problem and so did some others in guild.  We did Aerin Dar and then did a PoJ trial.  Went back to get the AA's for both and ended up with only 1 AA out of it.  Used the guided meditaion and it say character receives a flag but when i went to &quot;shorty&quot; he wanted nothing to do with me about getting my second AA.  To be honest i could care less though as i got the access i was looking for in progression and i think my charm upgraded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seems like I recall some peeps in my guild having this issue.  I want to say after they tried sorting their flags out, they went back and zoned into HoH through the stone and got their upgrade then.  Something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you for all the reply.<br />
<br />
Last night I did the &quot;unlock memories&quot; to the Seer.<br />
Than I got the HOH flag message right away and double check with &quot;guided meditation&quot; and the HOH flag message shown.<br />
<br />
The annoying part is my Charm did not upgrade and I try talk to the other NPC for the additional aa and it did not work.<br />
<br />
So I ran to POD entrance and talked to the Grummus flag NPC and ran back to POK and try get back my flags fix one by one, ran to POJ and ran into the quest room with the Tribunal. I tried to talk about Mavuin etc and he replied something like dont worry about Mavuin etc. at this point my friend poped in EQ and asked me to hunt in HOH. <br />
<br />
So I zone into HOH and BOOM, found that my charm upgraded!!!<br />
Ran back to POK and talked to the NPC and got my additional AA as well.<br />
<br />
Once again thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah entering HoH has something to do with activating that flag.  If you hail the Aerin Dar projection but don't zone into HoH you will have the same problem.  Had several guildies get the AD flag before the PoJ trials one and they eventually got both charm upgrades.</div></div><hr />
