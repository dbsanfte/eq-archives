<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just returned from a month off EQ (due to RL issues, not WoW or EQ2!)<br />
<br />
Last night I spent a couple of hours exping in WoS (left wall.../yawn).<br />
<br />
In that time we probably killed 6 or 8 named of one type or another. We got a grand total of zero runes! The named included the shadowhunter, who dropped some 18/20 melee class weapon (ho hum), but not a single rune.<br />
<br />
Maybe we just got an unlucky run on the RNG, but before my enforced break, WoS named seemed to drop runes more than 50% of the time....<br />
<br />
Anyone else noticed a significant decrease in rune drop rates over the last month?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">humm, I thought droprate had been increased alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't say I have - runes been pretty consistent really up as far as the 68s (still missing a few 66 runes - have trouble with them all right). Have only seen one 69 drop. Fortunately I won it too, so am pretty happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got a 66, 67, and 2 68 runes in the last 2 days off of about 8 named kills.  None of them were in Wall of Slaughter though.  The overall drop rate in other zones seems ok to me, though I can't say they haven't specifically nerfed WoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Last week I was in a group that got 8 or 9 runes from WoS in two hours, including one 69 one (go, me!).<br />
<br />
Granted, our group had a tracker - and the entire north half of the zone to ourselves for those two hours...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">RCoD has usually yielded great success in rune drops in my experiance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its pretty random to be honest. I have been in MPG groups &quot;farming&quot; named and never seen a rune drop in 6+ hrs, conversly I have been screwing around in WoS and seen 10+ drop in 2 hrs, including TWO level 69 runes from back to back chimera spawns.<br />
Personally I finished up my level 68s first, mostly by luck, then got a few 67's in there. To date I have yet to loot a 66 rune /shrug. <br />
RCoD is perhaps a bit better, as most &quot;camps&quot; have a good 3 or so named that you can pull, sometimes a lot more, thus increasing your rune possibilites. I would hit that zone at full clip either LFG or BYOG...there is a great cloak that drops there (click my magelo for that) and you can hve some happy rangers, rogues, monks, etc there as well...great zone and outshines WoS for farmable loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That cloak item from RCOD is the bane of my existence. Seriously. :p<br />
<br />
If it's runes you're wanting, RCOD/MPG are better than WOS, though at WOS house/hill camp I've seen four drop in about a 45-minute span. Sounds to me like you got an unlucky RNG streak. I haven't noticed OOW drops or runes being scaled back, truth be told, which surprises me. Perhaps the December patch will prove me wrong.<br />

PG sucks. The rate of drops is decent, but the rate of Nameds spawning blows compared to WoS Kyv Ass, or RCoD Statue, or NC murk halls. There is a good guide to NC rune mobs on Druids Grove, I posted the link on another thread.</div></div><hr />
