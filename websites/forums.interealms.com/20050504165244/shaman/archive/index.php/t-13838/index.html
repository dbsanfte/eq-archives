<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All,<br />
<br />
I will usually target my pet and cast Regrowth of Dar Khura and Spirit of Bri Li to give it to both the pet and myself, well last night, the pet wasnt getting either of these spells, just me.  I thought maybe my /tgb had been reset so I did /tgb ON and tried again, still not landing on the pet.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Sadly, this guy is right. It would be really nice if group buffs got pets too :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am not trying to get a group buff cast by me on my group to land on my pet, I am trying to get a group buff cast by me with the pet as my target to land, which has in the past worked.<br />
<br />
Yes, it would be great if group buffs landed on pets in the group, but its not the topic of dicussion in this thread.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think they understand what you're talking about.  I know I do anyway, and it has never worked for me, but then again I haven't tried it in a while, so maybe it was bugged for a little bit or something.  If I target pet and cast, it's just like I had nobody targeted, and lands on my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Arrgggg, now you have me questioning whether I cast SoW/Regrowth on my pet or Dar Khura/Bri Li all these long months!!<br />
<br />
TGIF, I need a break.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rikax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Never worked for me either.  And I've tried on several occassions.  Maybe you cast SoW or Regen directly on the pet and confused it with another &quot;group only&quot; spell.  Strange things happen late at night after hours of playing and little sleep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Group buffs do not hit pets, never have as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">has never worked for me either, even with TBG on, i use to try an SoB my pet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Used to be able to target pet and group buffs would hit both him and yourself - although even if you were grouped, the buffs wouldn't hit your groupmates - ONLY you.  Now, it won't even do that - group buffs hit only pet if cast on him, not yourself.  That's what the original poster is saying, to clarify things.  And no, I doubt its a bug.  SOE has a long history of hating the solo player and rewarding social dipsh!ts, this falls right in line with that mentality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Have never been able to hit pet with a group buff, they don't take.  Only single target buffs can land.  So targeting pet and casting group regen will only regen yourself.  If you've been casting on the pet with group buffs all this time, you've been wasting a ton of mana =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So targeting pet and casting group regen will only regen yourself<br />
That's how it is now.  Awhile back it wasn't this way - group buffs, with pet targeted, would hit both you AND pet, but NOT your groupmates.  I usually use the single target buffs anyway when soloing with pet, so couldn't tell you exactly when this change was made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I vaguely recall being able to use group buffs on my pet once upon a time, but it's been months at least since that was changed.  All the debate about whether it was ever possible or not aside...  IMO, we SHOULD be able to use group buffs on our pets.  /bug it and hope for the best is about all you can do though.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaft, I've never know that to work and I've been playing for over 3 years.  Maybe I wasn't paying attention, or was on test server, or something; but most everyone here says group buffs have never stuck to pets.  Either way, it doesn't work now and hasn't worked that way for a long time, if ever, IMO.<br />
<br />
With that said, I think we should be allowed to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Trust me, it worked that way, and not that long ago.. the change took place at most a month or two back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hullk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Shaft is right - I used to solo in fungus grove all the time during the Luclin era, and by targeting my pet, and casting Khura's focus, it would hit the pet AND myself.<br />
<br />
I think the change came with planes of power - I remember noticing I couldn't do this anymore when soloing in Plane of Disease.<br />
<br />
Buffing your pet and yourself was possible at one point.<br />
<br />
Edit - The reason it didn't work for some people might have had to do with the /targetgroupbuff ON function.  When the function originally came out, it was always set to off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I tried it just once, soon after luclin came out and it didnt work. Never tried after then so not sure if it did ever work but will take your word on it. And yes, it SHOULD work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When the (TGB) function originally came out, it was always set to off<br />
Aye and IIRC it reset to off every time you zoned, camped, etc.. even if you had it turned on.. I may be wrong, but I think I remember it being that way, and a patch fixing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Now that I think more about it, I do seem recall being able to do this a while back, but I thought it stopped working months ago, and never tried since.  Maybe it has worked some time in the interum though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was never able to get a group buff to take on my pet, targetted or not. I always thought it stupid that it didn't work. Makes no sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've never seen group buffs work like that. They will buff your group if cast on a npc but not if cast on your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have always wished this would work... Alas it's never worked for me and tgb is always on. I think you may have assumed it's work, but i've been thinking this for a long long time. <br />
<br />
Now granted, I have not tried in AGES as well. So maybe at one point a bug allowed for this ability, and they finally got around to fixing it again to the way it's supposed to be.<br />
<br />
/shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have never known of it to work either, though it could have been bugged and worked for a time I suppose. Always irked me that I couldnt SoW my pet with the BiLih I had to mem for the group anyways. Course it bugs me that a Spirit wolf pet, should even need to have Spirit of the Wolf cast on it to run faster, it should naturally run at SoW speeds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just wanted to post to say that buffing pet worked for me similar to those posted before.  If I were in a group, or by myself for that matter, I could target my pet and cast a group buff.  Either way, grouped or solo the spell would take on my pet, and myself.  <br />
This was good stuff back in the day.  I also recall at the time, that I could cast a group buff spell with myself targetted, and it wouldn't hit the rest of my group!  I had to target someone else in the group, and then everyone would be the group buff.  That could have had something to do with me not having /tgb on at the time.  I didn't even know about that back then.<br />
Time frame?  I dunno, maybe four months back.  Not too long after some decent group buff spells entered into my spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I want to confirm that at level 50ish I was able to tgb my pet with any buffs I wanted.. I haven't tried it since level 60 since my pet is only there as a 2k hp boost..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Targetting my pet trying to hit it with group buffs has always had the same effect as if I was targetting any other NPC.  <br />
<br />
in other words<br />
<br />
the group spells would either hit myself, or if grouped would hitmyself and my group.<br />
<br />
would have loved to give my pet alittle more attack with SoB =(  /feedback guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Think they did this so you wouldn't group buff charmed pets.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have never been able to target pet and cast group buffs on it.  Single buffs yes, group no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I just got Dah Khura a couple days ago, can't cast it on my pet either.  Would be a great feature with the next expansion though..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I used to be able to cash Dah Khura on my pet by targeting him, or a least I&quot;m fairly sure I could. But it has been a few months sense i've played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yes i remember when you could do this.  You could cast grp buffs on the pet and you and the pet would get them even if you were grouped.  You just had to target the pet.<br />
<br />
If i recall correctly this stopped about 2 months ago, after a patch.  Shame really, as when soloing you could save time buffing you and the pet up.<br />
<br />
Just another one to put into the shaman history book.  And it still worked after PoP too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">It's been longer than 2 months.  I used to get annoyed that Spirit of Bih Li didn't work on the pet.  Basically casting a group buff on your pet casts the buff on your group instead.  (I use this to my advantage when I have the mob targeted and want to cast a group buff, I just cast it with the mob as the target and it works fine.)<br />
<br />
Question: do you have /targetgroupbuff on or off?  If it's on, it could possibly behave differently.  Wish I could try this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">:D  :p Let's log on and test ...<br />
<br />
OK will do and report (much) later, what happens.<br />
<br />
If anyone comes back earlier, feel free to stop the confusion here  ;)</div></div><hr />
