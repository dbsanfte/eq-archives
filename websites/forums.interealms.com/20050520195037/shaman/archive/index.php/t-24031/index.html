Its stupid... becuase you'd think you could just click on them like an expedition, but what you have to do is hail one of the &quot;taskmasters&quot; and say 'what task'  then it will give you a list of (post 60 only 1) tasks to complete.  They are difficult but possible solo from what I've seen.  both the options I'm given as a level 63 are only of the medium length which seems like it could take around 2 hours, maybe less with a tracker.  There is a nice sized platinum reward of over 110 plat.  Haven't yet completed one to comment on the amount of experience.  At lower levels click your handy dandy find button in PoK and look for one.  If you're in your high 50's /60's I'd imagine you just need to hit dreadlands or overthere to find the appropriate taskmasters.  I think they gave give you one of 2 possible quests.  Does that help any?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tasks are horribly done.<br />
There's virtually no difference between a task, and a quest.<br />
My history with doing tasks:<br />
-Got my 61 bard.  Ran over to Qeynos to get a task.  Guy says &quot;you too good for my tasks.  try dreadlands or overthere!&quot;<br />
-I sigh and run off to the overthere.<br />
-I find some taskmasters in town, and talk to them.  They have a few tasks for me.  All of them that I've been able to acquire involve me running off to skyfire to start to check out some location before getting next step.<br />
-I set off to Skyfire<br />
-I find the location they refer to after running across that bigass zone, and get my next step<br />
-next step says &quot;go into VP and find Dragon01's lair to find further info.  Ok.  W-T-F!  How the hell is a 61 bard going to be keyed for VP to further doing these tasks?  My bard is decently twinked out, and he *still* doesn't have his VP key.  What a waste of this task.<br />
-I leave the task.  Port hammer back to Overthere.  Get a different task.  Run back to Skyfire.  Find the location.  Get instructions to go to Veeshan's Peak again.  leave task.  try this all again a *third* time.  same bull****.<br />
-I try a different taskmaster.  same task selections.  *joy*<br />
-I figure I'll get more success in Dreadlands then.<br />
-I run off to dreadlands.<br />
-I find the taskmasters scattered around the zone<br />
-They all say &quot;my tasks are too hard for you!  go away&quot;<br />
-well Fug.  Thanks for wasting my last hour and a half.<br />
<br />
-So I log on my shaman to see what kind of tasks I can get.  I think I'm 66 or 67 at the time.<br />
-I go to Dreadlands first.<br />
-I find the various taskmasters around the zone.<br />
-They all tell me &quot;my tasks are too easy for you!  go away&quot;<br />
-well Fug.  I'm off to Overthere<br />
-I port hammer over to Overthere.<br />
-I talk to some taskmasters.<br />
-the *only* task I can get is the same one.<br />
-I take it.  They say &quot;Go talk to dude in Frontier Mountains&quot;<br />
-I run off and do that.  He says &quot;Go to Droga and find the dining hall&quot;<br />
-I go there and do that.  I get a message saying &quot;kill 10 flame masters to proceed&quot;<br />
-I spend the next 4 solid hours soloing in Droga to finally get my 10 flame masters, and get about 4 loots from named mobs.  There were zero flame masters up in the *entire* zone when I zoned in.  I headed to Flame Master Jopar's spawn point, and cleared mobs around his location for most of the time.  As far as I can tell, there are *three* spawn points where a flame master is possible to spawn.  None spawned in any other locations than the ones I found.<br />
-I got about 10% of my way to level 68 when I got my 10th flame master to spawn.<br />
-I gate out and talk to the last dude wherever I have to talk to him, get my ~110 plat for the quest (combined with my ~1000pp from soloing) and get an extra 2% of my level.<br />
-I port hammer back to Overthere to see if I can get any other tasks.  Nope.  Only one task is available for me.<br />
<br />
I'll never do another task again with my shaman.  And as of right now, it's *physicly impossible* for my bard to do a task.  Great patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you should see what they say to my 51 warr ...<br />
they want me to kill mobs by royals haha .. no way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Probably beyond level 40 or so (I've heard), the task system is fubar'ed.  You either ruin factions or get things to do that are impossible for your class to do solo, which is the purpose of the tasks.  Mainly this is just another system to get newbs (no offense to anyone using them) to lvl 65 or so and get them into the zones where they have no clue what they're doing.  At least it doesn't automatically flag them for PoE/PoF/KT.  Sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its a shame. If anything was going to help continue my billing in EQ, this was going to be it. But by the time they get around to fixing this, WoW will be out im sure. Still see no reason to stay sadly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well from my experance there are 3 task masters in the over there (65 shsman here) the 2 iksar one that I have talked to both give me the same single task to kill flame masters in droga. now if the one in side the city gives stuff for VP i can not comment on since I am KoS there. the other place I could get tasks would be in the dreadlands and thay all involve running in to chardok. from the one task master I checked there. <br />
<br />
as for rewards for theses tasks when you complete em, you get the cash and when running 100%AAexp you get a orange bub of experance. if your not a tracker and just go in droga and keep a couple to 6 spawn spots dead tell the 10 required mobs pop (or there is not that many up to begine with to gank) then that might net you around a AA of experance if your soloing so all toled around 5 to 6 orange bubs of AA experance for about 2-2.5 or so hours work. can be better yes, but with out the right flags or no group its not to bad. plues you get your chardok faction up higher to boot ). and droga drops around 15 plat a mob so the plat you make as a reward is realy pittance to what you make killing plues rubys flame emraleds and other loot drops are a nice plues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Juujuu brings up a good point:<br />
<br />
Whats the difference between a task and a quest?<br />
<br />
And who was the dumbass who came up with these tasks?  Obviously they have NO clue about the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello lvl 35 Cleric... go into the [Temple of Veeshan] and return me 5 dragon scales for a reward!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i heard the post 60 one you will ruin your chardok faction on. No thnx !!!<br />
<br />
Just to address the negitive rep bump i got for this post, since your too weak to leave your name ( what else is new ).<br />
<br />
This is not &quot; trolling &quot;. This is addressing a concern i have with the task system. I would be playing EQ right now if the task system wasnt utter crap. They tossed it in cause they saw WoW was going to have it and did a half arse job. This is what everyone on the forum here has said thus far and my beta experience has shown me. OoW has a lot to offer and if you bothered to read my posts, which im not going to pick out for you again ( yes i know who you are ) then you would see how positive i have i have been trying to be for the sake of the people that play EQ even though i do not.<br />
<br />
So you know what you can do with your neg rep bump. And i take back what i said about finding things to respect about you, even as you were cutting me down. Your just plain ignorant IMHO at this point.<br />
<br />
Good news is you cant rep bump me again loser and your too weak to address me in a PM or in a thread arent ya ;)<br />
<br />
Eww  that had to sting a lil  &lt;3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I also did that task that Juujuu was talking about.  Went to dinning room, proceeded to wander around, picking off the flame masters as I found them.  The task altogether took me two and a half hours at level 66.  I made 4% regular exp and 600pp in that time in sellable vendor stuff.  Btw, the flame masters can spawn in a lot of spots.  Many of the mobs can be just about any of the variety of goblins in there.  I had most of my luck near the Runri camp and the Jopal camp.  I have yet to check out the other tasks, been too busy in the expeditions hehe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Almost everyone gets the flame master killing quest it seems.  And I don't just mean shaman, as I helped an enchanter do her's the other day, and several of my non-shaman friends have also gotten it.  It seems to be one of the only three or four tasks which actually exists for 60-65, and apparently multiple task masters give it out.  On the plus side, if you already hunt in drooga like me it's an extra few precentage points of exp that just require you to run around a bit.<br />
<br />
As for how tasks differ from quests, they don't really except that tasks have an even worse plot, but a better interface.  Also tasks can do stuff quests can't, like require you to simply visit a spot.  But since quests can already have you pick up a groundspawn, kill a mob, or hail an npc at a given spot, I really don't see how tasks have added anything at all to the game.<br />
i heard the post 60 one you will ruin your chardok faction on. No thnx !!! <br />
Litgruv, I defended your post in another thread because it was relevant even though you don't play anymore.  But I really think that this post was just spreading gossip, and all that does is create the &quot;telephone&quot; effect, making people run around like Chicken Little yelling about how their Chardok faction is falling.  The fact of the matter is there are multiple tasks, only one of which involves fighting in Chardok.  And while I love to bash SoE as much as the next guy (if not more), I really don't see the problem with having a single task that involves killing in Chardok.  This may sound crazy, but once upon a time we all used to think of Chardok as a dungeon, and even if you don't because you are working on quests there, you can simply go to a different task master for a new task (the one where you kill in Drooga, raising Chardok faction, for instance). In my mind, if you think something is wrong with a Chardok killing task you might as well claim Velious is broken because you can't do the Dragon quests if you are on Giant faction.<br />
<br />
You claimed that your post was &quot;addressing a concern I have with the task system.&quot;  I personally find this to be a very poor defense of a post which was essentially of a &quot;I heard from my brother's friend's girlfriend's uncle that if you kill all the bears and skeletons in Qeynos Hills a gnome necromancer spawns who drops VT loot&quot; nature. This &quot;concern&quot; you have is over a system you've never actually tried (on a Live server), never bothered to research (I don't consider it research to read about how a single poster tried a single task, didn't like it, and logged to come complain), and that you couldn't try even if you wanted to because you don't currently have an active account with the expansion the task system came in.<br />
<br />
IMHO, this forum is about spreading good information.  I'll grant that (our political system nonwithstanding) if you throw out enough information, whether good or bad, the good will (eventually/usually) come out on top .  But I just don't see the point of gumming up the forum with incorrect information, needlessly confusing people until someone more knowledgeable comes and corrects it.  I know this wasn't your intention, but when all you have to go on is other people's experiences and not your own, you have no way of checking their veracity, or making sure that you fully understood them, and so bad information is inevitable.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say you shouldn't post here, as I have a great deal of respect for you from your old posts when you still played, and even if I didn't I feel anyone with useful information should be allowed to share it, whether or not their account is active.  But in this case I don't really think you contributed anything useful whatsoever.  Thus, I'd like to respectfully request (and not just anonn neg bump you as some might) that you please, in the future, refrain from rumourmongering, and restrict your comments to topics on which you have firsthand experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the iksar vendor in dreadlands (in combine city thingy) gives 2 quests. one seems to be the goblin one, and the other is in veksar.....got killed trying the veksar one as one new epic mobs was campin zin, that was a fun cr.<br />
<br />
really post 60 the tasks dont give enough exp.....think 30% of an aa at 65 would be almost reasonable, instead of approx 19% as in case atmo.</div></div><hr />

I thought the only meaningful difference was that quests can be done over and over again, while tasks can only be done once...?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, I haven't even looked at the task system at all, so I don't know for sure, but that is what I remember from some post during the OOW beta.</div></div><hr />
