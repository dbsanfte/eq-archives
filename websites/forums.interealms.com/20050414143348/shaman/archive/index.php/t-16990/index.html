Unfortunately for me, the DSL is more expensive, but when @Home died, Cox couldn't keep the network up for more than a few minutes at a time.  I've only had one real problem with DSL in the 2 years I've had it.  I almost always have a trader going in the bazaar while I play.<br />
<br />
BTW, I have a Linksys box.</div></div><hr />

i've used DLS (southwestern bell) &amp; i'm on cox cable. i find that the cable goes out a lot less in my area (arkansas). the download time is about the same, i two box/ed just fine on both however. i guess it's just personal preference, i'd like to tell cox to shove it too, but it's the lesser of the two evils in my area.</div></div><hr />

DSL is sometimes more reliable than cable.  It all comes down to how good the phone lines in your neighborhood are.  Consider this, in some places phone wiring was installed before you were born, it is all corroded and nasty, it has enough trouble carrying your voice, let alone DSL signal.  DSL is a pain in the ass to install, you either have to have separate wiring installed, or you have to put these lame filters on each phone in your place to keep them from interfering with the signal.  <br />
<br />
Cable on the other hand is much newer technology.  The wiring is protected (phone lines are often part of a bare wire rats nest if you check the junction box outside) the diagnostic options are superior (there is positive feedback from your cable box/cable modem).  I found the difference in support between my cable company and phone company (I switched from DSL to cable) to be day and night.  The phone company often had to keep me on the phone while they called someone else to see what was up, and then half the time the answer was &quot;we dunno, call us in an hour if you still have problems&quot;, or worse, they would say well, it is the weekend and the comm center in your area isn't staffed right now (I live in so cal, that is f'd up).  Whereas the cable company would tell me right away, yeah, cable is out, we are working on it right now.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  I had DSL with Verizon (by the way, f verizon to hell, can you hear me now you bastards?!?!?) for two years, I had multiple outages that lasted for a day or two, two outages that lasted more than a week, and to add insult to injury, the bastards disconnected me a week and a half early when I cancelled service (not counting that in my original outage count, so technically I had THREE outages longer than a week).  I have now been with charter cable for three years, the longest outage I had was for about 6 hours in a really kickass storm.  The connection has been far more reliable than my DSL connection ever was, I hardly ever have to think about my internet connection, and that is just plain awesome.<br />
<br />
To answer your other questions.  You can two box using DSL just as easily as with cable.  Patch day will likely take the same amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DSL gives you dedicated bandwidth (no sharing like with cable, and a steady rate of transer), easy installation (plug a filter into the phone jack, you're done), and more reliability (long as the phone's up, DSL is). <br />
<br />
So long as your DSL provider is Ma Bell or her children, and not Verizon, I would go that way.<br />
<br />
I've heard more horror stories about Cox Cable and Time/Warner Cable than I can ever remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Look at usage in your area.  As the previous poster mentioned, cable is shared, and that can depend how many people the cable company puts on each node.  I'm in an area that just recently got cable (Time Warner), and has a pretty small subscriber base.  I have never seen speeds go under 1 mbps, and often reach up to 2 mbps, because there are few people on the network.  If you live in a large neighborhood where lots of people are likely to be on cable, then you will probably have lower quality, and will notice spikes in &quot;peaktime&quot;, usually about from 4:00 to 12:00 pm.<br />
<br />
Best bet though is to ask people using both services in your area, or check out sites that do ratings.  www.dslreports.com is a good one, you can find people in your area who use the service and what sort of average results are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its VERY provider dependant.<br />
<br />
I have DSL, and excelent service... (sonic.net is incredible if anyone is in N cal) some of my friends have other providers with terrible service, some have ok service... some have cable with bad service (outages that last for days with no explanation), some have cable and love it.<br />
<br />
In general, the technologies are different in a couple important ways:<br />
<br />
DSL is dedicated bandwidth -you buy an amount of bandwith and thats what you get.  Want more? pay more.<br />
<br />
Cable is shared bandwidth -depending on activity levels in your area it can be very fast, or not much better than dial up.  You tend to notice peak usage times.<br />
<br />
For gaming either will be more than you need.  Buy a router and sharing the connection among several PCs wont even be noticable.  I like the Linksys models because the user interface is super simple -a nice easy setup.  The actual hardware involved (chipset) is exactly the same among the three main brands: linksys, d-link, netgear so whatever you get should work fine.  Update the bios on any of them if you have troubles.  It will fix most problems.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have QWEST DSL in the pacific northwest.  I dislike Qwest as a company overall but in 4 years I have only had about 5 outages...   4 of them being under 5 minutes, 1 of them being 4 hours.  So I can't complain.<br />
<br />
The bandwidth is plenty to play eq on 2 machines, use game voice and listen to streaming music without any trouble.<br />
<br />
<br />
ymmv.<br />
-Henora</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One issue with Qwest is getting it set up.  Make sure you have them repeat every piece of information to you multiple times before you hang up with them when you are ordering, because if they **** up on something, you could be sitting there still waiting a week later and nothing will have happened.<br />
<br />
They screwed up my order three times in a row, and maybe it's my fault because I didn't call every day to confirm my order, but after three weeks of screwups, (original order placed on August 27th, latest estimate was that I'd get my modem in the mail and have my service set up on September 23rd!) I told them to go screw themselves, and called Time Warner.  I got a date when they'd come to set it up, they came, took 10 minutes to get the connection set up, and I haven't had an outage yet.<br />
<br />
As of literally right now (6:45 p.m. CST), I test at 3146 kbps down / 369 kbps up using dslreports.com speed tester.  I live in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area.  Cable from Time Warner costs $44.95 a month ($29.95 first three months), DSL from Qwest costs $34.95 a month for 256 kbps down/up or $39.95 a month for 640 kbps down / 256 kbps up.  I've had Cable now since September 24, and have not had any outages.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind when you get Qwest (at least in my area), you're actually getting MSN broadband.  My brother in Nebraska is on Cox Cable and he has had no issues with his connection.  YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">TimeWarner is pretty decent in WI. The only thing to fear is the day they decide to merge the service with AOL Broadband. /shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I work for Qwest so wanted to clear up that you can use another ISP besides MSN. It just costs more cause MSN has promos that pay for the modem and installation. Anyway if you want more info and the straight scoop PM with an e-mail (that I can respond to away from work, hehe).<br />
<br />
I used both Qwest and Cox and have to admit Cox is faster but was more expensive. I have a 1MB VDSL connection though and it is more than enough to two box and surf the web during down time. Anyway let me know if you have any other ?s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know quest via the CLEC I work for and thus see alot of how they operate and what types of focus is passed down to employees from upper management. I'll never buy qwest dsl, for the simple reason that the company only cares about quantity, and not quality.<br />
<br />
The best way probably is to ask neighbors and find someone with cox cable and see how it performs at a couple different times. Cable (docsis) is a more robust technology than any dsl for the simple reason that dsl has to run over a single copper pair back to the dslam. If you are in a area with low usage on the cable side of things and have high quality cable tv in your area then I would go with cox.<br />
<br />
With my comcast cable in a low cable usage area I get about 3mbit downstream and 300mbit upstream. Most cable providers use the same gear as well (varying CPEs of course) all cisco head end routers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Having been a Qwest DSL SSC I can tell you, that I've not worked with the company for 2 years but still have it. Why? Well...first off, I have Qwest DSL, but not Qwest ISP (now MSN /shudder), my dsl line goes to a DSL isp of MY choosing *from a list, not all isp are dsl capable*, this cuts my cost below the Qwest DSL/ISP. Secondly, I live in a heavily populated neighorhood where the average cable user is 1 in 2 or 3 (lots of under 40's &amp; college students here - game users), which means, the more cable users online, the individual bandwidth goes down. Cable may have 2x or more the bandwidth of DSL, but thats in NON-peak hours. <br />
<br />
Let me give an analogy that I used to use :)<br />
<br />
You are going to a movie theatre. There are 3 doors: #1 is for Dial-up users, #2 is for cable users, &amp; #3 is for dsl users.<br />
<br />
#1 is a smallest door and the line is huge and extremely slow.<br />
<br />
#2 is the largest door granted, but when the matinaee's are over and it's night time shows, it takes longer to get in then during the day.<br />
<br />
#3 is the DSL door, Just room enough for one person....but then..you don't have to share it, it's yours. period. It even has your name on it. ADSL is Qwest DSL, therefore this is your exit door too, not the side door out of the movie theatre with everyone else. Same bandwidth 24/7. <br />
<br />
When it comes to reliability, DSL wins hands down. When it comes to neighorhoods that don't have as many cable users, Cable wins. That is basically what it comes down too. Up to you. If your DSL is less expensive then cable, get cable unless you live in a neighorhood that doesn't have very many people on its cable hub &amp; you're d/ling huge amounts of info every day.<br />
<br />
edit: As for Qwest caring more about quantily then quality, this is true, but so does the cable company. All corporations are like this. But having had no Qwest DSL outages in 4 years where I live, I'd say that is pretty **** good quality. And...I use a Cisco external router, tyvm *response to previous poster* :) provided to me from Qwest. Internal modems are Intel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those ciscos (675?) are workhorses no doubt.<br />
<br />
If you can get qwest dsl through another ISP reselling it then thats a different story, and often you will get a better deal in the end.<br />
<br />
(cable modems terminate back to a router of some sort normally referred to a headend, dsl terminates back to a dslam. Both devices translate the various protocols into other protocols so they can be moved back to switch and data facilities to be sent to their appropiate destinations on the net)<br />
<br />
Cable and DSL only get slower when they are oversubscribed heavily. Basically most cable modem headends and dsl dslams are normally not in a telephone companys central switch location. The dslam/headend have to get back hauled to a central data center/switch facility some how, and the *size* of that circuit it the limiting factor on how fast your connection is during peak usage. That is if the connection is not limited in size already (most dsl has caps on it at the dslam).<br />
<br />
Asking questions up front of the provider you are interested will take you a long way :) heres a few.<br />
<br />
1. what size connections do you backhaul your headends/dslams back to your data facilities with? What percentage is it oversubscribed?<br />
<br />
2. what types of bandwidth caps to you configure your connections with?<br />
<br />
3. how much oversubscribed is your total available internet transit in my area? whats the utilization percentage of your internet backbone?<br />
<br />
4. what type of service commitments do I get with my connection (i.e. how fast they will respond if your connection breaks and when then will respond)<br />
<br />
<br />
You'd be suprised how much mileage you could get from giving these questions to a sales rep or something. Keep in mind that many of these questions will only be answerable by a engineer.</div></div><hr />
