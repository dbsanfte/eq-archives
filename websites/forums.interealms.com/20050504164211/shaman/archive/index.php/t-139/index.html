<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lumor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally I have retired my last piece of totemic.  Last night while guild was doin hate and the minis.  I ended up getting my first pieces of Rune Etched.  I was so stoked.  First piece I got was a bracer, then later in the evening Arms dropped for me.  Then after we did Maestro and the hands, we killed one more golem that was around before we were going to port out.  And bam he dropped my BP.  After a few weeks of slowly upgrading, I am starting to see some results, now if I could just find someone selling an artic wyverm mask, I would really be doin ok..<br />
<br />
Question, should I keep the totemic for the resists, there is no one in my guild that I could hand it down to, and after the dreaded camp of that damn tree, I dont know if I wanna sell it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey good for you! I never did get an RE bp, stupid golems.  If you're looking for a decent mask, try an enshrouded veil, very nice (AC: +7 Wis: +2 Int: +2 Fire Resist: +10 HP: +30 Mana: +30) and sells for less than 1K on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gratz on the RE gear. I can only hope to get some armor upgrades soon. At 51, I still have 3 pieces of totemic (BP, legs, boots) and am starting to think that 2 - 3 hours of play time each night is going to make it really difficult for me to get some raid type upgrades (RE, RC, etc.). Glad to see that not everyone is decked out in no-drop gear at 51-52. Priority is the JBB fund, so I don't do a lot of shopping.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on keeping my totemic BP and legs for the small resists when I upgrade....if that ever happens. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, nice gear at 52 and gratz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gratz...I tried for weeks to get a RE bp, spent like 20 hours in hate and not a single bp dropped so I left, few months later I joined Royals, and first raid with them I got my PoG bp :p .  Well, about a week later Royals went up to hate for Inny...we killed the spites...2 BPs dropped, both in my bank now heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grats on the BP. :)  It's certainly a nice upgrade, depending on your level.  As for a mask, another option to look for is a Bone Mask of the Jarsath ( 7AC, 2 Str, 8 Cha, 4 Wis, 5 DR &amp; PR) - should be able to buy it for 1k or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got 3 pieces of RE (including the BP) on my first hate trip.  Got rid of the god awful jar jar BP which I gave to a banker to wear ;)<br />
<br />
Raikor, at 51 you can go nail jar jar crap in KC easily enough, even at a couple hours a night.  Kromrif legs are another choice, get a druid partner for these and its doable.  Go on Kael raids.  Get a party and do the bank for thurg armour.<br />
<br />
Lumor, grats.  The RE is nice enough and a good upgrade to totemic.  Personally, for the loss of all that AC/WIS/Mana for 5 MR/DR/PR I'd say screw it and pass it down to a young shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the ideas, Tarthug. Can't wait for Kael...got the leg gems, just need to find the right opportunity/group/raid to go. Would love the Kromrif legs, but thought the quest was still broken. Anyone know if it's been fixed?<br />
<br />
Oh, and is jar jar worth it? I mean, is it crap, but better than my current crap? heh ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lumor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks everyone!!!<br />
<br />
Glori, thanks for the suggestion, I think I am going to see about that veil the next time I am on, or even the one Cush recc'd.<br />
<br />
Raikor,  I only play 2 nights during the week, and maybe 2 saturdays a month.  The upgrades will come, most of the stuff I have has been gotten in a single group.  One thing I noticed in your profile was that you wear a lizzy mantle.  Check out my shoulder item Elder Wolf Hide, you can do that solo in about an hour to an hour and a half.  I have gotten one for my shaman and necro in less then 3 hours.  just invis to the back of the cave and kill the PH and named.  One is Ghowlik the other I forget.  They are really MR and hard to root, and snare but ebolt lands like cake, so just ebolt and melle it down till its dead.<br />
I was lucky on the JBB, a friend gave it to me when Kunark was still new, so that saved me a ton of saving which is good, since I have never had more then 5k at any one time.  Also I see you your falsehood, why not get your sow boots, you can do it with a single group.  That will be one less ac but with the wis and other stats not to mention the clicky sow.<br />
<br />
Just a few suggestions, hope you dont mind.<br />
<br />
Thanks again all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tamajin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Big Congrats. I spent 150 hours straight in Hate to get mine. Still the best looking Shaman BP in game 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dunno...something appealing about a barbie in full JB armor...like a golden Wonder Woman (that's one thing that is definitely NOT improved by the new graphics!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats on the new BP!!  Definitely get an Enshrouded Veil because the AC is gud and more resists/hp is what it is all about.  I end up using the Enshrouded over my MoW most of the time and a BD earring shud cover the resists you lost from the Totemic really nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Very nice! Congrats on a lucky time up there : )<br />
<br />
As far as face slot is concerned, it depends.  It's a really tough call for me between either the Arctic, the Enshrouded, or the Crystal Spider Eyes (8 ac, 35 hp/35 mana).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lumor:<br />
<br />
I don't mind the suggestions at all and thanks for the tips. Sorry for the partial hijack there. Picked up the lizzy mantle for virtually nothing to replace the coldain shawl, a quest that I think I won't keep interest in. I'll look into the Elder Wolf Hide for sure.<br />
<br />
Aye...Sow boots are coming up shortly. I'm in a pretty small guild and we have been helping some other mates out with epics. I just haven't asked for the help yet, but am getting anxious to kill that nasty wolf. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wore a BS tunic till like 55, then killed griz to get my tot bp.<br />
then a few days later got PoG bp, on my one and only PoG trip.<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, Engelica, you sound kinda like me.<br />
<br />
I had totemic greaves until 54 when I finally looted jarsath pants.  I went to Hate oodles of time and never managed to get a pair of RE pants.  Finally, at level 59, I got a pair of RE pants.  Within the SAME week, I got thurg and SS pants.  It was like making up for all the pants I had been denied!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hehehe...I'm selling my Arctic Wyvern Mask....but I'm on TM. :P<br />
<br />
I currently wear a Worked Dragonskin Mask...10 AC, 8 CHA, 4 Fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Woo Congrats!<br />
<br />
I love my RE bp, and in my normal group almost never swap it out.. even for regen.(cleric is always fm cause I do my job well *grin* so he tosses me a CE now and then to cann with).<br />
<br />
Decent AC, good Wisdom.. and it just looks so old school uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Two other very nice face pieces are the mushroom veil and the crystal spider eyes.  Both are AC 8.  Shroom veil has I think plus 15 dex for all your proc'ing needs, and an obscene amount of either poison or disease resists, I forget which, and 55 mana.  Crystal spider eyes acts as a light source and has something like 30 hp on it and maybe some mana too, I forget.  I don't see the mushroom veil sold very often because even though it drops MUCH more than it used to, it is still a rare drop.<br />
<br />
If you have access to something like Mask of War, more power to you.  <br />
<br />
Probably the average guy without access to uber stuff can be pretty happy with the tailor-crafted arctic wyvern mask.  I know I was; and it sells for 500 or less on my server, cuz tailors make tons of them trying for skill-ups.</div></div><hr />
