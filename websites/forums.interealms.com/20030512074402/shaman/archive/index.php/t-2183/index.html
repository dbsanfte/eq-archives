<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grhunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I got my tear, a ranger killed the child before i had a chance to stop him. Did i miss any Faction hits that would make the quest not work for me when i get ready to turn in my tear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope.  I don't think you get any faction hits on the child.  A simple way to check is to go to one of the spirits in EJ and con it.  I think you just need warmly for Rak, but you may want to do a couple of the other parts of the quest over again just to make sure.  You are never penalized for having too high a faction.  :)<br />
<br />
It doesn't take much extra work to get to ally.  If your guild doesn't mind, just kill Ghiosk and do the books again.  You can do that and Rak in the same raid, and it only adds a couple of minutes as you can run go do the ghiosk turn-in while they are finishing up pulling Rak's reaver down.<br />
