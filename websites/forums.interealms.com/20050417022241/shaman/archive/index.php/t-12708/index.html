<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a free or cheap web host where I can store some pictures mainly.  I wouldn't mind having the ability to actually have a website someday but just pictures will do fine.  I've tried 2-3 different ones and maybe I'm doing something wrong but none of them seem to work.  I upload the file and everything fine but when I use it in my sig it doesn't work.  I'm pretty sure it isn't a bandwidth issue because I've tried just using it on my guilds message board and it still isn't working or it will work for a few hours and then not work.  The only one I really got to work is villagephotos.com or something like that which worked great but had a limit of like 120kb.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The reason the link you have in your sig at the moment is not working is because the file in question is stored on webspace that does not allow hotlinking (ie referencing the file from other websites)<br />
<br />
You need to find an isp that lets you link to their webspace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, Mozeley.  I was kind of wondering if it wasn't something like that.  Do you have any suggestions on an isp that will let me link to their webspace?  In the meantime I'll look around and see what I can find.</div></div><hr />
