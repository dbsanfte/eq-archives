<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.<br />
<br />
As you can tell I have had CPU problems since this move to Oki.<br />
<br />
The main problem is with the ISP I have now.<br />
<br />
Background is that Okinawa use to be monopolized on Base by Konnect 56k dial up limiting you to either 90hr or 120hr per month for 20 something dollars.<br />
<br />
Being lucky, or so it seems, I got Base housing on a base (Camp Courtney) that is able to get a higher speed unlimited connection.<br />
<br />
It is called Satallite Internet and like cable you are always connected.<br />
<br />
The regular downloads and internet is fine (downloads at about 40kb/sec so not too bad).<br />
<br />
I wanted this internet because it is unlimited and is way faster than dial up.<br />
<br />
But I have now come to find out some problems I am having. Basically EQ needs certain ports opened during play (something like 1024-some big number off the top of my head). <br />
<br />
My problem, to what I can tell, is my ISP for SOME REASON has these ports closed causing me to go LD withing 10-20 mins of logon.<br />
<br />
I have called the tech and he has been gaffing me off. Well before I snap on him tomorrow I wanted to see if anyone here is in Okinawa.<br />
<br />
It seems to me from my talk with the tech that turning those ports on isnt a hard job but he made it seem like some HUGE security breech if he opened them. <br />
<br />
MY GOD i have had internet in Hawaii, TX, NY, CA and this is the first ISP to EVER have these ports closed.<br />
<br />
So does anyone have satallite internet in okinawa and know how to fix this problem. I happen to get my internet through FADTEC although another company is called MicroPlus.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is the problem.<br />
<br />
As far as I know (which, admittingly, isn't that far), ports probably aren't your problem. EQ works by sending and recieving packets of information concerning the game. Your download speed (as you said, 40 kb/sec) is fine.<br />
<br />
The upload is the problem. Satallite Connections save up packets and send them in one chuck every few minutes, or so I've been told. So if you are on long enough, there's a good chance the server might think you've disconnected, since you haven't sent information packets to them in a short while (a few minutes).<br />
<br />
This is all based on hearsay, can anyone confirm what I think I know?</div></div><hr />
