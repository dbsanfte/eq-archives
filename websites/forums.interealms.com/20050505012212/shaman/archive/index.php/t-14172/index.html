<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fireonyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im about to PL a necro as my 2-box partner.  I seem to remember some site listing zones and their ZED.  Anyone have a link?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The actual everquest site used to have a post about it.  I seriously doubt you can find it now.  I do know that Kaesora, CoM, and The Hole are a few of em.  Best thing to do is go to eqatlas or allakazhama and look up each zone.  One of those 2 will show the exp modifier.  Use Kaesora as ref.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have just started a newbie toon on a fresh server and have leveled up to 21 in 3 days.<br />
<br />
The dungeons I have noticed that give a significant exp return have been Warrens, Kurns Tower and Paludal Caverns. Remember this is just soloing as a total newbie so your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
If PLing, I normally camp my butt in PC from lvl 5 to 24 then move on unless PC is really over crowded.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2 That spring to mind off of the top of my head are HHK, and Paw.  If I remember correctly they were listed as 30% and 13% respectively.  HHK can get crowded, and paw is usually empty.  Both are good for the 20-30 range of levels.</div></div><hr />

I always kind of wondered, if you do a quest in a zone with a multiplier, does it give you more EXP too?  If so, each part of our epic might get you 12 pts instead of 10!!!!!!!  (of course you need 112,000 to level, though :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kedge has a huge xp modifier. I know its the largest pre-PoP one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have been PL'ing a necro also so I figured I would share what I did.<br />
<br />
Go to Guk top.  I know according to everyone there is no ZEM there, but I have to think there is and i'll tell you why.<br />
<br />
At lvl 20 my necro was getting 6 to 7 percent per kill or better down near the &quot;Old Froglok&quot;.  I moved on about lvl 26 to the ancient croc area and got 5 percent and better off the crocs and pulling the frogs outside his room.  This took me all the way to 34.<br />
<br />
My plan was to move to Lower Guk at 34 since I would have the new pet and a little extra dmg.  I moved down and what do you know, the frogs in Lower Guk, that were yellow actually gave less xp than the blue frogs in upper guk.  I zoned out and killed some more blue frogs and would get around 3% xp, then zoned back into Lguk and kill a yellow frog and get 2% xp.  At any rate, I have to believe there is a ZEM in Upper Guk.<br />
<br />
Once you leave upper guk head to Gunthak and camp the beach or go to the first small town (not the one leading to Dulak).  On the beach there is a lot of undead and your necro will be able to nuke to his/her hearts content, just use the shaman to pull with slow, sic pet, and nuke, if mob aggros you FD and pop right back up and nuke some more.<br />
<br />
The xp here may not be as good as some other places but the loot is not bad at all and you will have the opportunity to get your evok skill up quite a bit on the beach.<br />
<br />
The town area is much harder (because you will get over pulls and ST gets resisted a bunch) but the xp at that spot is fantastic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Upper Guk does in fact have a 12% ZEM.  It was left out of the original Producers Letter that listed the other ZEM's but was mentioned in the following patch.  Refer to the Patch History on Castersrealm.com if anyone wants to see for themselves.<br />
<br />
From the January 17, 2001 Patch:<br />
<br />
&quot;Changes/Enhancements<br />
<br />
While not mentioned in the Producer's Letter, the Zone Experience Modifier has also been increased in Guk (Upper Guk), by roughly 12%.&quot;<br />
<br />
My experience per kill has been roughly:  dark blue = 3-4%, white/black = 6-7%, yellow = 8-9%, red = 10-11%.  This was observed as a Level 10-20 Dwarf paladin and a Level 10-20 &amp; 32-37 Troll shaman. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

The reason it might look like they nerfed this is because you used an ogre the second time around. Ogres have racial modifier that means they need 10% more xp. So if the zones got a +12% mod and you have a -10% mod it looks like the mods gone.</div></div><hr />
