<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have been down to the juggs more than my share of times, but i have never been past the bridge/bench area where you first encounter the juggs.  i have tried to pull some of the juggs out of the room which takes a rogue/bard to open, but i pulled 5 and eat the death to save the group.  i am usually not with enchanters that can take 5 juggs at a time.<br />
<br />
is there any way to get past that area and pull more juggs?  even an ok group can finish the spawn cycle by the bench, and be forced to pull shrooms out of boredom...<br />
<br />
pulling more juggs would allow for a better chance to see torpor drop, and that is the last kunark spell i need.<br />
<br />
any help or info would help, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you need a monk/sk/necro (pref monk) to FD pull them... or someone to eat a death every time you pull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what level can you get into a juggs group im 54 now i plan on going there to try for torpor to drop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can get in a group there at 54 (as long as the rest of the raiding party is competent/higher level)... but not sure on your chances for seeeing Torpor from them. Be better off getting in on a dragon kill I think (Gore, Sont).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for the info all...i was guessing a monk needed to pull, but i always takes a rogue instead lol....gonna have to switch him out for a monk, and have the bard open the door. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That door isn't locked, anybody can open it by clicking on the firepot to the right of the door.  Be aware that it can only be opened from one side though (to my knowledge), so somebody will have to stay by the door and click on the firepot to open the door for your puller when they pull from deeper in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A FD puller is not really required for juggs.  Just a compenent enchanter.<br />
<br />
I did an eight hour jugg raid with a L60 warrior; L60 chanter (with dire charm); L60 cleric; and me (57 shaman).<br />
<br />
Pets helped with damage, but GoK works wonders on the Juggs.  It got to the point we where yelling at the warrior about only bringing in 3 or 4 juggs on a pull.<br />
<br />
The chanter had a frog DCed and I had wolfie up.  I even got hasted and went to work with my new Hammer of Spiritcalling.<br />
<br />
And to think, this used to be a raid area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">L60 chanter (with dire charm); <br />
<br />
That AA skill is insane.<br />
<br />
How many shaman spells did you get, out of interest?</div></div><hr />
