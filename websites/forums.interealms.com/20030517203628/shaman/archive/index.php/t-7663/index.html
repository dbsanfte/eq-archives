<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all:<br />
<br />
Having just made level 45 after 3 years or so of having a blast with my shaman I am to the point where the JBB becomes an option.<br />
<br />
Last night in the Bazaar I decided I would forgo a bunch of my good gear to gather up the 18-20k or so to buy one.  So I sold my SCHW, BSH, Mushroom veil, Barbed Ringmail, Worked Dragon Breeches and a couple other smaller ticket items to add to the 9k I already had.  I am sitting at 23k and ready to buy, question is....Is the JBB worth downgrading a few pieces of gear significantly (notably the pants, BP and SCHW) and does it add that much to your power.  I am assuming yes at level 45 where I am now...<br />
<br />
I guess I have big ticket item hesitancy in buying it, tell me to go buy it please...hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">45-50 it is a Godsend. After that it isn't EXTREMELY useful, but it still helps. You'll probably end up never wanting to sell it after you've had it for a few levels, and there's a good bit of no drop gear you can get or quest for that's greater than the items you previously mentioned. Just buy it, and use it from 45-5(1, 2, 3, or whatever), then make the decision for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thankies, now hopefully I can find one for sale.  Had someone who wanted 20k last night, but fell short.  Someone was selling for 18 a couple days ago as well but I hadnt yet started my liquidation...hehe.<br />
<br />
Off to the Bazaar!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">JBB is one of the best equipment items you will get.<br />
<br />
I use mine continuously. It is a 33dps item when chain blasting.<br />
<br />
In a group I slow the incoming mob, sic pet and chain blast. With my horse up, I am medding while maintaining a steady flow of damage for NO MANA!<br />
<br />
Want to powerlevel a lowbie? Let them beat things till just past half, then switch to the next mob while you JBB the previous one into little pieces.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">worth every penny....  i use it all the time even at 60....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, still using mine at 60 as well. Get one if you can. It is that good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Woohoo, bought one today for 22k.  Paid a bit more than some others were selling it for BEFORE I had the time to gather up the plat, but hey, its just plat.<br />
<br />
Took it out for a bit of a trial run in DLs and, ummm, WOW.  I pulled with slow, ran back to dog, rooted, JBB'd until root broke, sic'd the pet and swung my BSH hammer in between JBB blasts and was dropping the MoB's insanely fast.<br />
<br />
So in short to finance the JBB with only 9k on hand to start, I downgraded BP from Barbed Ringmail to Acrylia Chain (bought for 250pp), legs from Worked Breeches to Rygorr, Silver Chitin Hwraps (dont need em anyways cause Im just swinging once in between JBB blasts) to Leaf Scaled Gloves (200pp in bazaar) and best of all, to gather up plat I sold my BSH for 2900 and about an hour later bought another one for only 200! My lucky day I tell ya.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the input and after drooling over the prospects of having a JBB for 2+ years now I can't believe I'm finally clicking it...WOOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just got mine last week and it's like a whole new game. It took me about a month to go from 51 to 52. Well one week with jbb and I'm now 54. It's worth every plat and downgrade ya gotta do to get it.<br />
<br />
I personally traded my iksar bp, 9k, and one of my velium fire wedding rings(he was adamant on getting the ring) for the jbb. While I was nervous about losing my ikky bp, I'm so glad I did it. And I turned around and bought another VFWR for 200pp. Borrowed a barbed ringmail from guildie and am well on my way to having enough to pay him for it/buy my own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I paid 38k for mine at level 57... way more than I intended, but I've wanted one for so long and they are almost never up for sale on AB, so I just had to farm plat for a while after buying it. It's a fun toy though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 58 it's a consistant way to deal out damage, more reliable than swinging a hammer.   That just feels wrong :(  I wish they'd improve our weapon skills so we could match or exceed this one stupid piece of equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Is JBB a soloable or duoable camp with a 58 Shaman? What is the ideal group? What is the smallest group that could do this effectively?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">JBB drops in the crypt in Old Seb. You need a rogue to get in there in the first place, and after that its really territory for a solid group with decent crowd control.<br />
<br />
I don't have much experience there but don't think its doable without at least 3 people (yourself, chanter/bard, rogue, well equipped and at your level) and would suggest at least 4 (add a tank). Its normally taken by a full group I think.<br />
<br />
I stand ready to be corrected, not actually been in there yet but spent a while in Seb trying to get in a crypt group :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dont need chanter ;) managed to clear to the blood of chottal with a FG.. me. cleric, ranger ranger sk and wizzy... was quite pleased we managed without the mezzer ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Okay, thanks, guys..gonna try for it soon..I really want the bracer... does it have to be worn to be used? Or is it rightclicky from an inv slot? Or for that matter is Wolf caller's bracer usable from inv slot..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've only had a jbb for a few weeks now, but I love it.  Not only is it free damage, but it appears to generate much less agro than a DOT of the same damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">take your jbb to the darkpaws in JPF. Pull with tigirs, and jbb them to death while the dog chews.  2 blues solo at 56 an hour, still a full blue at 58, no risk, mana regens while you blast.</div></div><hr />
