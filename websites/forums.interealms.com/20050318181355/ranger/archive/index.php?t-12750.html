<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Porthios</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone else feel like we got the VERY short end of the stick when it came to spells?  Pretty much just upgrade all our old spells by 25% or so and give us a few new druid buffs and yeah...thats about it.  Only things I saw that I liked really was the Mask of the Hunter, self manaregen and our New nukes.<br />
<br />
Now lets look at SKs....they get HORRIBLY AWESOME MANA EFFICIENT nukes, I don't care how long the recast time is.  Most of the 60+ ones not only do damage but buff them as well.  They also get DS spells...not great but I bet it will stack with all other DS spells.  I like seeing new lines for Hybrids...but not when they dip into other's spell lines.<br />
<br />
Pallies get group heals, good idea I think to make their healing potential useful so if you regen the non MA's and have the pally heal every so often it will work good.  But they also get some nice proc spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
This may not seem like a whole big difference, but take that into effect with Triple Attack for 2h wpns (THE WORST THING I think the they have ever done) I am just wondering how far down they ladder we might slide....</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the AA's need some serious revamping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelawen</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think our spells are fine as is. The AA skills we get really suck IMO though.<br />
<br />
But if you want to complain about sk spells you should be complaining about their pet that gives them more dps than us by a fair amount. Quad 55 pet that they can self buf the atk and haste for. The pet is green but it still does considerable damage when added to their existing dps.<br />
<br />
I think many of the new pets some classes are gettin are overpowered. Take shaman for instance, pet that cons blue to 65 that they can summon at level 62. A pet that enrages and shields them when they drop below 2 bubs of hp. Its only double 60's plus like a 30 kick. Anyways heres a funny story for ya.<br />
<br />
Last nite I was duoing with my shaman bot in PoV. Killing level 62 golems. I got distracted and wasnt watching my hp very carefully and when i turned around i had just under 2 bubs of hp left. So I start to heal and the golem gets a real lucky round in ( quad for close to max on all hits, max 544 plus gets a few procs in which are 375)..... I go to back up and the next round drops me. So the thing turns on the shaman pet, i start to mem dots with shaman and the pet enrages. ( Golem is just above 50% hp at this time btw). I torpor the pet and drop a pox and a nife on the golem. To make along story short, pet lived through rest of fight with 3 torpors total. I dont think that I could have lived through that with only three torpors and i have 6300hp and 1530ac. Anyways is one oober pet.</div></div><hr />

far as spells go.. we got the big shaft thier. and vi says .. but you have better tracking then anyone else.... ah big whoop, how many times have you been called upon to track, not alot of exp groups out thier go oh a ranger he got tracking, and snare but with the new mobs most run speeds cant be changed so no snare root .. rangers are made even more useless to groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daesun</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like our new AA skills, means I don't have to worry about grinding AA points forever and can have some fun.  I didn't want a repeat of Luclin where I had to get 45 AA points before I was considered worthwhile to invite on a raid.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvanoshi</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im fine with our spells, and i think they are saying &quot;you got some great SoL aa skills, so suck it up and drive on&quot;.  Which isnt cool, but it happens.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaysenn Stormra</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's good and bad, but mostly bad I think;<br />
<br />
Good is that we don't need to endless grind AA's to get the more interesting ones (unlike Luclin) but then noone does;<br />
<br />
Bad is half our spells we won't be using, or we've taken a step back (from warders back to three spells again) theres nothing particularly new or interesting in our spells (unlike SK's with their new regen, SC, massive attack buff, new uber pet, etc); just druid cast offs and a couple of extra little things that really I could live without. Oh and harmony, gee thanks. Pointing out that our pull spell has gone, whilst another hybrid (SK's, surprise) gets a new one (DA/HS) which really cheered the paladins up.<br />
The AA's sound okay, but the snare one is frankly taking the p!ss; headshot could be fun and the rest, triple attack for two handers and double attack for bards/beastlords (admittedly ours will get better, but thats a class still, gone again) I still feel like we're getting a two finger salute in general from all of this.<br />
<br />
No wonder I'm playing my necro instead at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kodith</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must say that I haven't been able to figure out why druid cast off for resists and such are going to help.<br />
<br />
Some of the nukes/heals/roots are nice upgrades but there are alot of situation based spells that we will probably almost never use in the new list.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sucks if you ask me but you didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taewedar</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*shrug* I'm holding off on 61+ for the moment, but only a few aa abiities interest me which is fine. As Dae said, when I'm done grinding exp I can set it to 50/50 and just relax like a cleric after MGB :)<br />
<br />
Our spell line up is ok, but nothing special. Nothing I say to myself, I MUST get 65 asap for. Verant isn't very creative and I agree rangers along with a few other classes got left out overall in POP upgrades. Perhaps as more gear is found I'll be proven wrong, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelador</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What annoys me about the new spells is that when I turn in an ethereal parchment all I get for my trouble are second-line druid spells that are available at vendors :/</div></div><hr />
