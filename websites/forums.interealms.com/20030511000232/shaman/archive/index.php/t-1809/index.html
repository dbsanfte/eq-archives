<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baxtur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok im in a bit of a pickle here....im lvl 37 and my defense is a whopping 115, im now noticing that when i get hit..i get hit often, and get hit max for every swing..anyone have any tips on upping my defense safely and effectively?  ive tried with the guards in west freeport..aggroing them fully buffed and running to the zone line to get beat on, but they take me down to practically nothing in just a few volleys...any help would be appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, the only way your gonna get that defense up is by taking more and more hits...Try soloing yetis in DL, from what i heard they dont hit that hard, and you can solo em pretty easy.<br />
<br />
or jus pull a few low blues and let em whack ya up abit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ouch - that is too low!<br />
<br />
One tactic you could try is to maximise your Armor Class at the expense of everything else. Sacrifice Wisdom, mana, hp, everything for raw AC (you dont have to sell your good gear, just put it in the bank). That way you can artificially elevate your armor class. As a rough guide, you should be aiming to hit 800+AC self buffed at your level<br />
<br />
Also, use the incapacitate/cripple line of spells so that the mobs dont hit so hard (I cant remember which one you have at level 37). Some people say that when trying to raise AC you should not slow, but that is just plain wroong, because if you slow the mob you get more regen happening</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baxtur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well as it is now with my gear and all buffs on my ac tops at around 550 :( <br />
<br />
im not really rich as it is...and going to rathe to hunt hill giants just isnt feasable because i play on vallon zek...and im a vah shir :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try to work up cash to get some more AC that way.  at 32 my ac is about 570, and my defense is only 120 ;( even though i try to raise it constantly.  <br />
<br />
For me, solo tanking isnt great, cause im stuck in levels almost as bad as 19-23. once iget my pet i expect i can do abit better as far as tanking abit goes...<br />
<br />
If you cant even take a hit from mobs that you try to raise defense on, then your in bad shape.  Artificially raising AC will be the best thing to do.<br />
<br />
edit: try pet kitin til the mob is about 30 seconds from fleeing, then turn and melee its arse todeath.  Your defense will get maxed pretty fast i would think, not to mention your offense =)</div></div><hr />

Even if they are green, as long as their lvl is parallel with your skill level then you shud grow quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Close Urd, especially about what your AC should be at level 37.  But as far as how to raise your skill?  You  can not use green mobs to do so, they MUST be XP giving mobs, so Light Blues are the minimum to get any skill increases (also, dueling won't work either, neither the PC nor a pet).<br />
<br />
So go find the easiest hitting lt. blues you can, debuff them, buff yourself, and let them swing at you for as long as can stand.  Just take it and heal yourself as long as you have mana, then either zone or kill it and start again.  Will take you a while, but it will increase :)<br />
<br />
p.s. - I think I finished off my Off/Def skills on the Seafuries in OOT, but I was in my high 40's by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've heard that needilites in Echo caves are *very fast* hitters, but not a lot of dmg. Pull with Incapacitate or Cripple and then just heal yourself.  Go ahead and pull out the 1hb or 2hb (or whatever melee skill you have been neglecting) and try and get a few skillups as you swing wildly.<br />
<br />
get it into your head that you are going to spend some time NOT getting any kills/xp.  Just stand there and get beat on until you can't take it any more.  Pretty sure you have to be fighting a light blue or higher mob to get skillups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
800 is not at all unrealistic. I am talking about sacrificing all other stats purely for armor class, as a temporary measure, until he can get his defense skills back into line. Do not judge what is a reasonable Armor Class based on your own gear my freind. I consider my gear to be &quot;ghetto&quot; i.e I am untwinked and this is my only character over level 20, but at level 49, my crappy armor allows me to walk around with about 920AC (self buffed). I hit 800AC (self buffed) at level 40, and that was with wearing wis/mana items too, so 800AC when you are not giving a stuff about anything other than AC is perfectly reasonable.<br />
<br />
Fast hitting / low damage mobs are an excellent plan. As I suggested before, using Incapacitate and Slow will maximise your survival time. at level 37 I was fighting Drolvargs along the cliffs in Firiona Vie - pulling to pet with malise, letting pet take some hits while I cast slow and incapacitate and then stepping in and meleeing - this soon maxed out my defense, but seeing as you are starting from a lower base, you may find Drolvargs a bit tough, but the principle should work.<br />
<br />
P.S. Baxtur, I play on Vallon too, so if you ever see me online, send me a tell, and I might be able to sell cheap, or even give you some gear upgrades - at the least, I will help you do the Kromriff Military Leggings Quest (14AC 6str 5wis 5cold 5 disease from memory)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">that quest is bugged i think<br />
<br />
broodmother or whatever the mob you have to kill has poofed, or is borken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also finally maxed my Defense off Seafuries in OOT at lv. 47 or so, and I spent a LOT of time soloing and meleeing to get it up.  Those giant-sized mobs seem to raise defense soon, I got the last 3 points all in one hour!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhoots, I agree with Wey, go to Fironia Vie.  There is a fantastic soloing spot in the NE corner, just past the mini giant fort.  It is in the &quot;canyon&quot; that leads to the Swamp of No Hope.<br />
Watch for where the ground changes color as you enter the canyon area.....NO WANDERING MOBS GO PAST THAT POINT.  This is critical because you can single pull Drolvargs and Frogluks back there all day, no adds.  And there is a zone line to run too if trouble occurs.<br />
<br />
Set up your doggie to guard at a spot about 100-200 yards back from where the ground changes color.  Give pet and yourself haste, pull with slow and bring Mob back to doggie, when you get there, lay on a DoT and melee the Mob to Death.  Have a nuke ready for the runners (or root them).  I suggest sticking to the melee types, the shamans are a pain, and I found nuking them the best way to kill them, this will not help with your defense (on the other hand, sometimes you have to kill them to get more warrior types to spawn).<br />
<br />
<br />
I spent several levels at this spot in my mid-high 30's increasing my defense and offense skills after many levels of grouping (and healing)!<br />
<br />

Good luck to you!<br />

Even when i cana dance i seem to med slow to me that is.   Here is my equipment.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hrmm, if you have 175 defense, and that equip, your ac SHOULD be much better...<br />
<br />
Anyway, as far as your mana regen situation, if you canna dance your gettin 25 or so more mana per tick at that level then a cleric or druid, or any caster w/ no form of regen.<br />
-<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, my defense skil is soooooo annoying.  Im 35 too, and recently have solod a decent amount, but even if i tank a mob the whole fight, my defense never seems to go up...its stuck at 125 right now, and hasnt gone up for a very very very long time...(i took the social route and grouped alot, so thats why its so low :()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For high 20s to 32 needlites are the way to go.  Those buggers hit faster then anything else in the game, but luckily for rather small damage (really, hits go like 2,2,4,3,2,11,15,2,3, etc)  Defense will be maxed in NO time.  At level 30, fully buffed i hav 712 ac.  Yes my wisdom only 140, but I still seem to have enough mana to kill two dark blues at the same time.<br />
<br />
Here is a list of low to midlevel gear that I STRONGLY recomend:<br />
<br />
Range, get a med totem (5 wis and 5 ac, you can't loose)<br />
<br />
Rings, Nothing beats Ac 6 65 hp rings, IMHO. (for the first 40 or so levels)<br />
<br />
Face, Arctic Wyvern Mask RULES.  decent Ac AND decent Wis.<br />
<br />
These three slots, very often are completely neglected AC wise, try out this combo, you will be amazed.<br />

<br />
I agree with Weyalan - 800 isn't unrealistic at all. At level 35 I have 778 AC unbuffed (with defense almost maxed for my level - I believe I am 3 points shy from max).<br />
<br />
Here is a link to my gear:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=141697 <br />
<br />
This stuff is all pretty common and fairly inexpensive. I was mildly twinked at the start - a friend gave me 1000pp. I earned most of my cash day trading (buy low, sell high) and farming mammoth tusks.<br />
<br />
As for building defense - make sure you don't slow the mob that's beating on you, you want as many hits as possible. Common sense, but I always forget and cast slow.<br />
<br />
Soloing is probably your best bet - or duo with a caster and play tank :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">F15E0476:<br />
<br />
Look through your gear and consider every piece that doesn't give you AC.  I&quot;m specifically referring to your +6 Wis Rings and +7 Wis Face.<br />
<br />
Drop 19 Wis and you can get Arctic Wyvern or similar (something with around 6 AC plus Wis), and a pair of rings.  If you can only afford the AC 5/55 hp rings that 16 extra AC - with the shaman modifyer of ~1.5 thats an extra 24 AC, and your Wis is still up around 160.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you focus on pure ac, its not only possible... its even somewhat cheap... No item costs more than 1k.  My Troll battleshaman can self buff to over 950 at level 45.<br />
<br />
Rings - 6 ac/65 hp or if you plan to solo vs non casters 10 ac/-7 save magic are nice until your defense skill is up.<br />
Earrings - Orc fangs are a cheap start, cougars are 1 point more of ac, beyond that is expensive<br />
Helmet/Arms/Gloves/Boots - Anything better (for pure ac) costs much much more<br />
Chest - A regen bp is more important than AC if you can afford it<br />
Bracers - Sentry/Ryghor is nice.  A very nice but lil bit more expensive ac item is the JBB with 14 ac and a nice bonus at 45 :)<br />
Belt - Straw spun is a cheap 10ac.. spider fur belt is the same ac + hp<br />
necklace - Spider fur or ryghor.  There is one 12ac item with no other stats that isn't too bad<br />
range - Gongra idol is nice ac resonably priced<br />
face - the Arctic Wyvern Mask does indeed RULE. <br />
cloak - either totemic or spider fur.  both are 10ac.  spiderfur is a lil bit better<br />
<br />
For weapons, I recommend using 2hbs, but if you want to go pure ac then get some help to do the hunters pike quest in dawnshroud and get a charred guardian shield (25 ac 50 hp or something like that).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">dis is fairly simple...<br />
<br />
a) maximize joo ac gear.<br />
b) tank solo dark blue / light blue mobs<br />
c) get a guud weapon for damage output 2hb is best.<br />
<br />
At first,  you will not  be very eficient.  Joo will have to spend mana<br />
on healing yourself,  rooting, and sometimes joo may just have to run to zone.<br />
<br />
Over time,  as your defense improves,  and your mele skills improve joo will be transformed into a battle shaman instead of a soft shaman.  This is an amazing thing and you will become an eficient exp grinding machine.<br />
<br />
Try to do all your damage with mele weapons to get all your weapon skills back in line.  Save the mana for healing so you<br />
can stand in the fight a lot longer.  This may not be possible at first but will become very easy over time.<br />
<br />
In the long run this works fantastic with JBB also.  The JBB just replaces the primary source of damage output.<br />
<br />
Fixing joo defense problem is a trivial exersice that requires little more the determination. <br />
<br />
Joo have a big job to do but when it is done joo will hold joo head hi and snicker at the lesser creatures of Norath dat run around screeming &quot;get it off me&quot;,  &quot;help help help&quot;. <br />

<br />
worked great =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sacrifing THAT much wisdom i would never contemplate. I do like to act as a battle shaman. Here is my Magelo.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125247<br />
<br />
My Defense and Offence maxed nearly every level, and i wasnt specifically aiming for them to raise. They rose if i was in a 3some in DL, me and 2 monks say, and i was pulling with slow and then dotting, staying in melee until the monks gained aggro then backed off to med/canni dance.<br />
<br />
Ahh well... i maxed out by accident. Hope what the others are saying help you hit max :)<br />
<br />
P.S. ANYONE... i mean ANYONE... laughs at my bloodstained tunic... and ill break legs i swear. Bought it at level 22 outside Sarnak Fort in LOIO for 200pp. My biggest investment till about lvl 44 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Urdegish,<br />
<br />
As long as you do keep your defense maxed for your level, it is relatively easy to make up the points for the next level, as you go along...the point that was being made was if, by grouping too much and soloing to lottle, your defense falls seriously behind the max for your level, it becomes increasingly hard to raise it, because whenever you do try to melee to get defense raises, your AC is so low that you get pounded to pulp in seconds.<br />
<br />
Nobody is suggesting that you should sacrifice all other stats completely for AC in general, but in the specific case of having a problem with low defense, it is one of the more logical solutions - and as I said before, you would keep your good wis/mana/hp items etc in the bank to put back on when you had got the job done.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, you had better start breaking your legs, because not only did I laugh at your bloodtained tunic, I laughed at almost every single item that you are wearing. There are only 2 items that are good, and 2 items that are OK - the rest I would throw into the Ocean of Tears...and I am not some uber shaman from a powerful guild - I have soloed most of my life, and I play on a PvP server, so certain zones are a no-no, but I would not be seen dead in gear that bad, and im a couple of levels lower than you (actually, I would be seen dead, because I would, in general, be dead). Hell, you could SOLO mobs that would drop upgrades to most of your slots...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i kinda have to agree w/ Wey here Urdegish...<br />
<br />
<br />
alot of your slots are filled w/ AC less equip, and your total AC is only about 700...<br />
<br />
You could bump that up alot very easily, yet you wear wis gear in those slots.  <br />
Im not exaclty LAUGHING, because i wear some of those items, but thats not my doing..i was twinked that way :P  the fact that your bragging bout a BStunic is whats laughable</div></div><hr />

Just a piece of advice, DO NOT LEAVE IT TO CHANCE!<br />
<br />
As Wey pointed out, if you spend any significant time in playing healer/buffer to groups, your defense will lag behind.   From numerous threads/comments on this board you can see that this is a serious problem!<br />
<br />
Just spent at least 1 out of 3 levels soloing/meleeing and you should be okies.<br />

In solb its uber hard to actually solo, because the mobs are, for the most part, all static spawns, but its easy to get aggrod on, as there are always pops or adds, and a slow brings em straight to you.  I expect my defense skill to climb up pretty fast, as i get hit on almost everypull.<br />
<br />
The point is, even if you play healer/slower, as long as you do it in the right zone, you'll get aggro enough that your defense will go up anyway.</div></div><hr />

If you want a nice, not too &quot;uber&quot; chestpiece that has good AC AND Wisdom look for a Froglok Scale Chestplate (24AC, 5 WIS, plus other junk stats). They sell for around 3000 pp on Saryrn.<br />
<br />
At your level you should be able to get into Kael groups and work on your Thurgadin Quest armor. You can even MQ many pieces nowadays for pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />

I would specifically recommend the Magelo a few up from yours ( http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=141697 ) as an example of what to go for.<br />
<br />
My immediate recommendations to you would be to buy a Ceremonial Iksar BP for 5k, then load up on Jaundiced Bone (hat, arms, gloves, boots). You aren't going to get a JB BP or legs any time soon, so look for other pieces for those slots. Then buy some Velium Fire Opal rings,  etc. None of these pieces cost more than a few hundred each. Of the items you're currently wearing, I'd only want to keep the JB stuff, and the belt, cloak, earrings, and bracers.<br />
<br />
You would probably drop like 30 wisdom but I have to ask: so what? Are you going OOM much? If not, the extra wisdom isn't really helping any. What with cannibalizing between med ticks we get our mana back pretty damn quickly anyway.<br />
<br />
Essentially, you are wearing druid gear. There's nothing wrong with druids, but we're shamen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
p.p.s. List please of mobs i can solo in order to upgrade item slots (please include SV items as i need them for guild raids) ]<br />
<br />
People did not make fun of your gear Urdegish, they merely pointed out, quite rightly, that you could and should have better by level 53.<br />
<br />
Here are a couple of suggestions of upgrades that you could do yourself:<br />
<br />
Legs: Kromriff Military Leggings would be cake to solo at 53. The leggings are 14AC and 6wis along with some strength and some resists<br />
<br />
Neck: A Blackened Alloy Medallion from lowbie dungeon Runnyeye would be better than this - its like 5AC 6wis 6int<br />
<br />
Feet: GE boots are way over-rated for a Shaman. If you sell em you will be able to buy upgrades for other slots. I suggest that you start you epic and get maybe 2 friends to help you take down the dire wolf in Mistmoore to get your black fur booties<br />
<br />
Shoulders Personally I would pick Tattered Mantle over the shawl (12AC +disease resist) but you might prefer to camp in Hollowshade at the Sonic Wolf cave to get the Sonic Wolf Cape (or whatever it is called) with 10AC good wis, other stats and resists<br />
<br />
Range: Hollowshade again, but this time camp the Grimling Chieftain for his Runed Smudging Stick - AC, Wisdom, and plenty other stuff too<br />
<br />
Chest: Blooodstained Tunic blows. Ry'gorr battle mail will be solo-able for you now I think. Personally I would wear the Totemic BP instead of the Bloodstained.<br />
<br />
Fingers: Personally, I would splash out on some 6AC 65hp player made Velium Fire-Opal rings. Sell them 7wis rings to a druid. If you want to camp upgrades, try 5th floor of ToFS for the wedding rings that drop in the wedding area<br />
<br />
Bracers: If you hang out in Karnors (and lets face it you can solo in Karnors if you want, but its easier to be in a group), you will pick up Jarsarth Bracers which generally rot on the corpse 8AC and 4wis, but I cant remember what else. Alternatively you could do the Kromriff Bracer Quest in Kael Drakkel (my faction couldn't get any worse atm in KD, so I cant give you details), or you could do the SS quest that gives the bracer that summons the throwing hammers. Hell, I would wear the totemic bracers instead of RMBs<br />
<br />
Ears: Forest loops and pixie ribs arent bad, but personally I would get some imbued Ivory Earrings<br />
<br />
Head: Pegasus Headress is definately druid material. Either the Totemic or the JB helm are way better IMO.<br />
<br />
Your Hammer, Belt and Cloak are good items. The JB gloves and arms are not bad, but you would be considering upgrading them about now if you didn't have so many other slots to upgrade. <br />
<br />
Resist Gear. With all the resist gear and jewellery you already have, I would not worry about getting any more resist gear for the time being. To be honest, the 20k that you spent on resist gear would have been better spent on a good BP. I dont know what server you play on, but on some servers you can get a Fungi for that. Alternatively Iskar Ceremonial, Froggy, etc are all relatively cheap. I would also suggest that you get the Shield of Falsehood, which you should be able to solo in a couple of hours<br />
<br />
To be honest, my best advice to you would be to go to Velks Lab and group - you will end up with various really nice items: I have been grouping in the ledge group a bit recently, and for about 12 hours spent there I now have the shield, gauntlets and eyes, all of which are really nice. I have missed out on rolls on various other pieces. The other alternative is to head to Seb and group - again some nice pieces drop there.<br />
<br />
Recently I have been going to the planes a bit - I am in a guild that is not strong enough to do planes raids generally, so I just rock up to &quot;pickup raids&quot;. So far I only have a bracer from hate to show for it, but I have declined on helm and legs because I alreadyt have better. Another good tactic is to camp KD arena - my small guild can do that (we can break and hold the arena with as little as 6 peeps). As I said before, I am in a small non uber guild (we have about 4 level 60 players and about 25 active members). I am un-twinked and almost ghetto. Nevertheless, self buffed I walk around with just under 950AC and 160 - 165 wisdom and about 1700hp. I would consider this to be at the lower end of reasonable - every piece of gear that I have would be considered standard non uber, and I can see realistic upgrade paths for every slot (especially my lame Rygorr BP heh heh).<br />
<br />
I don't wish to reopen the AC/wis debate - if you like being a wis shammy, that is fine with me, but even as a wis shammy, your equip need some work</div></div><hr />

<br />
What You really need to do is to cast Agi buff and Fury on You.<br />
Fury stacks with agi (not with dex buff), but i'm quite sure that the relevant stat for defence is agi and not dex (as someone mentioned before).<br />
My Str and Agi was both around 170 with Fury.<br />
Other spells You gotta have on are quickness, hp buff and regen. Str can't hurt either.<br />
<br />
I pulled mobs with Listless Power  (the melee debuffer) and meleed them until death. If too low on health i rooted, stepped back, healed and joined the fight again.<br />
<br />
My defence went up nearly once per fight, so the key really seems to be Agi and Fury.<br />

Just like to clear a few things up:<br />
<br />
1) The resist gear on my Profile is meant to be in the Future Goals profile... i didnt know inventories carried on thorugh all the profiles<br />
<br />
2) K leggings... Seriously only just found out how to do this quest, I will complete this as soon as I get back<br />
<br />
3) BA medallion looks good, Runnyeye next stop!<br />
<br />
4) I have my black fur boots. I prefer GEBs over them for wis and use the boots for SoW<br />
<br />
5) I have a tattered mantle, use it for Zlandicar raids. I am in the middle of Coldain Prayer Shawl quest, so that will be updated to 5th or 6th reasonably soon.<br />
<br />
6) I dont have Luclin, so your Range and other shoulder item are out the window, but i may be getting it soon.<br />
<br />
7) I am recieving a JB BP very soon from a guildmember as he has now recieved a Thurg BP and passing it down (hopefully to me)<br />
<br />
8) I am replacing rings with Bands of the Arisen Cultists (guild are getting 10 in a 5 hour camp)<br />
<br />
9) Head slots are tough to find, and i sold my JB helm to a merhant for 400pp cos no-one else would buy it! I am looking to buy an Othmir Fur Cap to replace the Headress<br />
<br />
10) I have my Shield of Falsehood, i use it when i swap out my Hammer for my Spine Chill Spear.<br />
<br />
11) My resists are WAY too low for my guilds raiding. We are not a huge 00abar raiding guild, but regular HoT and dragon raids require me to be pretty damn well kitted out resist terms. <br />
<br />
12) Im a troll. Cant use Imbued Ivory Earrings.<br />
<br />
13) My guild no longer raid KD. The only time spent in KD is taking down Vindicator and the Statue.<br />
<br />
Im not griping, and i thank you for your comments. Mail me at the the_biscuit_bandit@yahoo.co.uk if you want to talk about it more, since we seem to have hijacked the thread :/ :P<br />
