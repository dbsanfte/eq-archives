<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi level 50 Shaman here and I'm looking for a good place to solo. I'm in need of some cash, so any place that has some good loot drops would be nice. Right now my gear is kinda junky for my level so thats why the loot would be nice =p (If you want to see my gear my Magelo is in my sig) I was going to go back to RM for the money but I'm getting sick of it there. If that is the best place that you guys think I should go though, I will head back there. Anywho...I was thinking of going to the IG camp in EverFrost. I was also thinking of killing some SeaFurby's, but I heard they have lots of HP and take a while to kill. Any suggestions on where to hunt solo would be appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Myrddinteh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In CS there's a 3 spawn of Wyverns that you can normally sit on.  Good xp, and sellable/quest gems drop there.  You just have to convince the quadders that it is a camp :/  You can single pull them with a yawn.  No faction hit either even though they're on CoV.  Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to City of Mist, the pyramid area you shoulod be able to solo pull the 6 mobs on top. <br />
Could get lucky and get a wu stick or what not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replies you two :) I'll go and check those two places out, I'll just be glad to get out of RM heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go to DL and kill Plaugebones in the Ancient Combine Outpost in the big old pyramid.<br />
<br />
This is a great spot to quad for wizzies, so go hijack this spot today.<br />
<br />
Loot is about 75pp an hour and... Woot!  bone chips!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Echo Caverns, deep room, until 51. All the way. 50% lb, but I did 50-&gt;51 in 6 1/2 hours.<br />
<br />
Although now at 51, I'm having a blue an hour average, so it's going to be awhile to 52....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quick cash. Two ways I did that at that level. The XP way and the non-XP way. XP way is solo seafuries in the ocean of tears. Non-XP way is kind of silly, but it works (if you're a barb shaman). Bind at Halas bank. Go into Permafrost with pet and kill everything between all the camps excluding King's room. (Preacher, Archaeologist, Alchemist, Jailer, and one other I forget the name of that drops the Wolf Fur Slippers). Kill a path as you go because the greenies will probably aggro you in spots. Strength &amp; rage buff yourself for the strength bonus and loot up only the &quot;good&quot; stuff (chain armor, high quality ore, etc.) especially permafrost crystals because those seem to sell really good in the bazaar to smiths and potters (10pp-50pp each, depends on market). Clean the place out if someone's not camping it, and gate back to Halas, sell, bank, run back and repeat. Kind of slow and boring and no XP at all but I made about 1K per day doing this at level 51 and in 4 days was able to purchase a fishbone earring and start soloing in Kedge Keep.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Politetraethyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am curious how these worked out. I am pretty much one of the higher level members of my guild and so cannot always find a great xp party...also PvP server so it hard to find quiet XP spots. <br />
<br />
I got to Lvl 50 using the Giant Spawn in FV and the birds in TD, but that got boring and xp not so great.<br />
<br />
I am pretty familiar with CoM but I never thought to Solo the pyramid. I am going to check that out tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />

FV Forest Giant camp.  3 spawns on a 6 minute timer. They drop Giant Lord's tunics, cash loots and the like fairly regularly, as well as weapons worth some okay vendor cash.  Rare drop Forest Loops still sell well in the bazaar, or just vendor them for quick cash.<br />
<br />
Still okay exp at 50, 51 will be slow there, might want to move on.<br />
Nice thing is this has same zone vending/banking, so you don't have to be gone long once you are loaded down with cash &amp; loot.<br />
<br />
If you do a search in this forum, you should find a thread here where I went into the details of how to pull the camp, positioning, and so forth.  It might be in the 40+ forum instead of here since I used this spot in my upper 40's, but that was with a JBB, which makes it tons easier.  That was awhile ago too. :D<br />
EDIT:  Found the threads, here they are:<br />
This thread. :) (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=1319)  AND this thread here. (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=585) <br />
<br />
Though it may be slow, considering your gear, this should still be a viable cash/exp spot for you.  (The search feature can really help you find these &quot;secret&quot; spots.)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Politetraethyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I leveled to 50 on the FV Giants, but I have to say only 1 in 3 are actually blue after dinging lvl 50. I did not need a JBB or anything, just HoS, SOW and haste my pet, envenomed breathe a giant and run around waving my hands like a druid while my pet bites the giant in the ass the whole way. I actually was able to get better XP and cash from Giants in Rathe, but we all know what a camp fest that palce is. <br />
<br />
If your an off hours player I would stay in Rathe...unless your on a PvP server like me and are ready to fight it out for every spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the suggestions :)<br />
<br />
I never really got around to checking this thread heh. I ended up doing some SeaFurbys, a little KK, IG's in EF and some other places as well. I'm now lvl 53 WITH a JBB =D Got lucky and found someone selling it for 11k, so I snatched it up . I'm now soloing in the Gnoll Cave in JaggedPine Forest. Great exp and some descent loot every once in a while :)<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks for all the suggestions.</div></div><hr />
