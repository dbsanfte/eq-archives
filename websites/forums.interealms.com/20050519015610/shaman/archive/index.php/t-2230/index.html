<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all. Over a year ago I left my lvl 51 Shaman and quit EQ. Well, I've returned to Halas to start all over again and have got my new barbarian shaman to level 4 ;)<br />
<br />
I am sure lots have changed over the last 12 months. Could someone outline the major changes to shaman ? Also I put 15 pts into WIS and 15 into AGI at creation - my old shammy was high AC and I plan to go the same route with this guy. Make sense?<br />
<br />
[EDIT] Also...are there any low level quests for armour?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Major changes... hmmm....<br />
<br />
We get Summon Companion now to summon our pets.<br />
<br />
Minor bearform at 29.  Several other new Luclin spells were added at all levels.<br />
<br />
No spellbook required to med, ever.  Just sit down.  (Once you get med).<br />
<br />
No XP loss until level 11.  Level 10 and below, no corpse when you die - you get respawned with all your gear at your bind point.<br />
<br />
Best low-level armor quest AFAIK is still the one that results in leather of some kind, is it the spider fur quest?  I forget.  You can look it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the new cann 5 AA ability, a lot of high level shaman are attempting to maximize hitpoints.  I don't think 15 extra ability is bad, but I think 15 extra sta would be better. <br />
<br />
Castersrealm has a listing of patch messages, you could read through that and see what has changed since you've been gone.<br />
<br />

Cann V makes HP more important then it was.</div></div><hr />
