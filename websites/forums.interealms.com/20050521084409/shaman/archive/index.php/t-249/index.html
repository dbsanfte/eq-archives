<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hit 60 2 days ago and now already killed Yeld twice :D . First time she ran and teleported (buggy pathing) and summoned me to hechava and i finished her with a jbb and no loot, then died.  Second time I pulled in front of ToV (drags down), and it went smoothe, 2 copies of Death Peace, 2 Dragon Meat, and talise (gave to a druid nearby).  Lots of fun to kill her too.  Going for AE'ers soon (hechava prolly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How about some details?  I'm looking forward to the day I can do this.  What spells did you use?  What tactics did you use (such as pet or not).  What kind of gear do you have (ac/hp)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">first time i tried her(about 7 months ago).<br />
i had &quot;only&quot; <br />
self buffed:<br />
957 ac<br />
185 wis<br />
torpor/malo.<br />
regened 42/tick standing<br />
<br />
never been in big guild that why my gears was medium.<br />
now my stats are:<br />
ac 1034 <br />
wis 215 <br />
regen 50/tick<br />
63 aa points.<br />
but didn t tried her since that.would be much easier now........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have around 1015 ac, 200 wis, and 2200 hps self buffed.  I would make a pet, give it haste, fully buff myself, then cann torpor to full.  Would pull her with malo and turgurs once I get to pet while shes catching up.  Then I hop on my horse (slow, but consta med with auto attack off and if your not moving) and just epic dot, jbb, and torpor when needed.  Once I would get her down to about 40% I renew slow (prolly dont need to, but do anyway) and use bane to speed up her death then finish up with epic and jbb.  BTW, Yeldema isnt worth being called a dragon, shes way too weak (219 max hit and of course, no AE).  Shamy60, are you an iksar? My HP a tick was only around 18 standing hehe, but I gave my friend my fungi (til he hits 51).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been putting off killing Yeldema,  should go give it a try. <br />
<br />
I have 1420 AC,  2600 HP, 200 FR/CR/MR self buffed and have epic/jbb/torpor.   What AE dragons have people tried?  I was thinking of trying Hechaeva since he's right near my camp spot that has only one roamer that comes by every 30 mins or so.  I'd like to find out where Makala is but he seems to be a random roamer and I haven't found out his pattern just yet, but I know he drops Bracers :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raytes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Jaradis, you should own Yeldema. I solo'd her the first time with ~940 ac and around 1800 hps selfbuffed. I can now reach 1100 ac and  2k hps self-buffed and the fight seems much easier.<br />
<br />
The big deal with the Ae'ing dragons isn't the dmg from the ae as good resists will counter that fairly easily but the random dispell. I've fought in WW many many times and it seems all the dispells are random. So if you have Torpor on and Hech (or whoever) dispells that you are in trouble. Another danger of hunting anything in WW is the random pathing of some of the dragons. I have seen Glati, Von, Jen Sapara, Onava,  Amcilla, and Tantor  wander near my pull spot near Yeldema and Hech.<br />
<br />
Gikk from 7th Hammer solo'd some ae'ing dragon, but I forget the name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeldema is fairly easy its those darn ice burrows adds ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Akaylas-Fearstheshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got Hechaeva down to about half life, but about then all my buffs were gone.  I think if you mabey... have 2 clickies, 3 craps, you might be ok.  It might be random, but if what I remember is true, it did first slot a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've found a very good size spot that only has one roamer that comes by every ~36 mins.  Its either a gimp dragon, drake, or wyvern depending on which spawns.   So I'm not really worried about adds.<br />
<br />
I have 2 right clicks (could snag my telescope off my warrior for a 3rd) so I'm not too worried about buffs dying.  Guess there is only one way to find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Jaradis i'm gonna have to come talk to you in game and find out where that spot is!  Biggest problem i have in WW is adds.  It takes some time to kill these dragons, and more often then not i end up dying from a wanderer.<br />
<br />
Which AE'ing dragons are possible?  If it drops a 5/4 talisman, chances are it can be solod (barring adds).  As for dispells, if you only have 2 right clicks chances are you're gonna get full dispelled by the end of the fight.  I usually use 5 (dorf ring, sow boots, grim aura earing, and 2 PoM flowers) and still end up loosing a buff or 2.  If you loose your hp buffs you loose your ability to can5, and without can5... there's very little room for error.<br />
<br />
One piece of advise for anyone trying to solo WW dragons, at the end have root up.  If they get too far from you they sometimes warp back to their bind point, and that can cause all sorts of problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well I have a PoM flower as well.  Curious, how are you using two if you have to wear them to use?  Swapping would be a real pain I'd think.<br />
<br />
As for root,  I have a Spear of Constriction.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just soloed Yeldema last night.<br />
First time was a nasty death when Mraaka popped on me.<br />
Second time was surprisingly easy without adds. Dropped some dragonhide boots too, which was a nice bonus.<br />
<br />
For the insta-click items, you could make some of the original alchemy stuff if you need to. Insta-click lev, insta-click 150hp heal etc. Would need a couple of inv spots free.<br />
<br />
So, want to spill the beans about the pull spot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've killed Yeldema half a dozen times in the past, she really is a creampuff.  I was so scared the first time I did it, but it was surprisingly easy.  I have fairly low end gear as well, about ~2200 hps, ~1000ac selfbuffed...had about 2000 hps the first time I tried.<br />
<br />
Basically, I fight her near her spawn, just at the cliff edge, on the coast.  Only had trouble with an add once.   Velious Drakes don't assist, but cragwurms and other dragons do.   (they don't assist if you are on COV faction and aren't naturally KOS to them, that is.)<br />
<br />
The first time I attempted, I took way too long, lost my pet to riposte right away and had an add, and failed.  After that, no problems.<br />
<br />
The last time, it took me like 8 minutes or so(I am pretty conservative with my mana, so I am not stacking dots like mad or anything).  Basically, buff, summon pet.   Park pet inland a bit so he attacks from the rear.   I  pull with Malo, then channel Turgurs.  Apply epic dot and keep it up constantly.  Canni and Torpor as needed, apply other dots as you feel comfortable.  Dogdog chews at her from behind.  A little while later, dead Yeldema.  JBB if you feel like it and are able to use that, I usually don't.<br />
<br />
Keep a timer on your slow, so you have time to reapply before it wears off, leave room in case she resists, which sometimes happens.<br />
<br />
I don't kill her anymore as I am on CoV faction and 2 kills will drop you from max ally to warmly.  And, thanks to a certain friend shaman and monk pair(*wave* :) ), the dragon boots aren't worth much on my server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What are my chances of slowing her with No Malo or Tash? I'm going to try this with a 60SK friend, but if I can't get her slowed in this first 2 or 3 casts I'm guessing we're going to be on CR. I've killed her a few times before but always with a group.<br />
<br />
I have Torpor or I wouldn't even think about trying this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Jormal, as you are an oracle its pretty easy to stick a malosini on Yeld , I tried it out 3 times today out of curiosity (I do have malo) and it worked everytime (with no tash).<br />
<br />
Yeldema really is a _walkover_, there are way harder froggies in seb, dont be scared because shes all dragon shaped :)<br />
<br />
The other nesting dragons with AE/dispells are pretty much cake too if you have 1-2 ight click items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks. Was going to try it anyway, but now I know it's been tested.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Another prime piece of loot is the 1hd blunt off Tunare. Effect is ensnare....that would damn near trivialize Heck. Take him up near the clear spot near the pirate ship. Never had a roamer there at all and ended up pulling all my mobs there for small time &quot;friend&quot; raids. Just dot the crap out him Bane/EB PoX and Epic then let the ensnare take effect (pray for procs) and run away from him...never tried it though but the theories ALWAYS sound good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Only problem is...  they summon.<br />
<br />
The Spear of Constriction I have snares em just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I use the strip of land near the pirate ship too, NEVER saw an add come down there (a drake comes kinda nearby sometimes but not near enough to aggro).  Also, how do you take AE dragons? Need Cann 5? I tried Hech and had to get out cause her AE killed my pet and I was oom and couldnt torpor and cann enough without getting my hps too low...gated to tov and zoned fast at about 50-60% hps (had to run for a second so she would waste a summon on me then gate).</div></div><hr />
