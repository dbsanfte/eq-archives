<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought this would be kind of fun, I'm not as serious as alot of people here so I don't know of all of the good bugs. A few come to mind. (not in any particular order)<br />
1. Sharks in erud crossing.<br />
<br />
2. Being drunk on a horse spells didn't cost mana(I saw this one in the patch message, I wasn't sure if it was true or they were joking).<br />
<br />
3. Being bumped down to lvl 50 after you pre-ordered one of the expansions(I forgot which one).<br />
<br />
4. /petition they never get back to you(ok that's not a bug, but it feels like it)<br />
<br />
5. auto rewind/DX9 collision<br />
<br />
6. Turning in bat wings for tokens<br />
<br />
7. PoK crashing<br />
<br />
8.10k damage drop from zone XXXX<br />
<br />
9. DX 9 bugs<br />
<br />
10. Gates expansion<br />
<br />
Ok.. I was reaching near the end.. I drew a blank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>otakuryoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">#1 bug of all time was the original treant fists that monks could quest for.... unlimited charges of insta-cast complete heal for yourself.  I had them for 1 day before they got nerfed 8(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lol yeah, the insta self CH treant fists were awesome.<br />
<br />
how about dawnshroud where if you pulled mobs to the Netherbian Lair zone you could hit them and they couldn't hit back? :)<br />
<br />
Howling Stones where you could zone in, agro the skeletons, drop them into the basement, gate, and they would be stuck down there and you were free to kill the golems in peace.<br />
<br />
Mobs in HS running into the wall when feared... bard + wizard + 3 random people + Rogue = AE group!<br />
<br />
HORRIBLE pathing in Siren's Grotto pre fix, that allowed you to just sit there and cast spells on mobs and they couldn't hit you, they were just stuck.<br />
<br />
The &quot;only 3 mobs can attack you at once&quot; bug, duoing Fungus Grove with a bard and pulling like 30 shrooms :D<br />
<br />
Marked Signet dropping in Frontier Mountains.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stuff that still needs to be fixed:<br />
<br />
mobs in water will randomly swim down to Coirnav's room and get stuck in the wall, Hammertooth is down there as we speak, he wiped a coirnav raid a few days ago, heh<br />
<br />
like 80% of the mobs in Field of Gib in fire get stuck in one lava pool, makes pulling minis a snap if you know what lava pool it is and stay away from it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry... #1 bug?  &quot;Alchemy is working as intended&quot; ... when you couldn't get ANY skillups on it.  Shamans petitioned it for ages.. Verant tested it and tested it and tested it... always with a inhouse bumped character... which made it work =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What about that bug that would allow a single bard to AE kite ALL the mobs in HoH?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Loved it when they bumped MOB spellcasting and Thought Horrors were casting Garrison's.<br />
<br />
And the lotus things in Fungus Grove were casting nukes about 10 levels above their con.<br />
<br />
Sebilis must have been pure hell. I can only imagine how much 3 Krup Wizards dropping a Garrison's each on a lvl 55 Monk must hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gardner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I liked when the Spear of Fate was a heal instead of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>skafloc1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">typing /who in the bazaar was kinda fun when doing that would not just crash  you but bring the entire zone down<br />
<br />
another entertaining one at least was  when the illusion guktan spell would turn whoever it was cast on into a male human *made for some interesting screenshots and incriminating guild board posts*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I second the clicky heal from the Spear. :) <br />
Another good one was when you could give your pet a weighted axe and it would hit for full damage at the pet's default delay. Turned Gonner into the best killing machine in the game. A related bug was at the same time a Necro could give his pet a weighted axe, feign, put the pet on /pet guard here and come back 5-10 levels higher by the same time next day. At that time those 10 levels were equivilant to 2+ months hard work (more like 8 or 9 months at the pace I was leveling at that time :) ). I know of more than one necro to use this in Lower Guk. This was why they changed the feign death rules to make the pets poof way back when.<br />
And then there's the boats, the longest running bug in the game. I have eaten more deaths from the boats than from link-deaths over the years.<br />
<br />
God ya have to wonder just how many man-hours they have spent over the years dealing with the problems the hasty band-aid patches to these type of bugs caused them later down the road when weird things started happening with the program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I honestly don't see many bugs, even though I've been around for a while and done a hell of a lot.. however I guess most memorable was def the LDoN download where if you died you got deleveled to 50.  That night we were in time and I made it through phase 3 and onto four.  Killed Saryrn np and then to TZ.  Something happened and I couldn't get out in time and he hit me two rounds.  <br />
<br />
Tallon Zek has hit you for 2200 points of damage<br />
Tallon Zek has hit you for 2567 points of damage<br />
Tallon Zek has hit you for 1550 points of damage<br />
Tallon Zek has hit you for 2310 points of damage<br />
You have been slain by Tallon Zek<br />
You have deleveled to level 50.<br />
<br />
.... that sucked.. You can't zone into time unless you are level 65 so i couldn't even get my corpse until the next day.  Think that it happened to five people in my guild that night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That Pally AA that could crash zones rocked. <br />
<br />
The bard thing wasn't a bug, just an overpowered skill and some players willing to try things out.  Just like those old AE groups in the prenerf Grey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Barbarian Female 2hb anim. As far as i know i still go about trying to pierce stuff with my big hammers...</div></div><hr />

Today's news.<br />

<br />
Necromancer pets will no longer despawn after 2 minutes when their master is feigned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1.  How can we forget the naked bug!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SylentsofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">a good one i remember<br />
<br />
When rogues hit 60, you can run while sneaking, when they raised the lvl cap to 65, the runspeed scaled up per level, at 65, you had some selo's speed sneaking rogues :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the best bug, shadow step, body duplication.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There was a bug which make Ranger bow = machine gun. Right after POP released I think.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Necromancer pets will no longer despawn after 2 minutes when their master is feigned.<br />
<br />
Overdue change, since the pets are now non-agro the exploit it was designed to prevent is no longer valid. I was suprised to see it though. Nerfs tend to be like laws, once inacted it's hard to make 'em go away even after the original reason for their existance is long gone.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the machine gun rangers one, oh man how could I forget that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">How about the poTactics faction sploit that was getting necro's insane amounts of xp in the pit? Or the plat dupes that ruined the economies on most servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Best bug for me is early on when u just had the original everquest, the Gm's made and event where in Temple of Cazic-Thule a Gm lizard ranger, dressed in fulll rubicite(made everyone drool), ran and rallied all  the mobs in zone to the courtyard.  Course this killed basically everyone from the top tier of the game at that time.  Problem was the bodies got reduplicated on the ground.  <br />
<br />
Gorg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">players falling through geography on the Z axis was always fun.  &quot;stand still while I kill you.  Now consent me.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I seem to remember that Bards used to be able to play an AE damage song on top of the statue in the CT courtyard and go afk while their character auto leveled much like the necro bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My top 10.  These aren't necessarily the most impactful, or the most destructive.  Flair and uniqueness helped a lot at getting into the top 10.  Anyone can be a crash bug or lag.  It takes more to be one of the best!<br />
<br />
10. The Field of Bone earth elemental.  The quasi-rare Burynaibane Spider had, briefly, a very different proc than it was supposed to (summoned a level 50+ mage earth elemental pet under your control).  And you thought Paludal Caverns was easy levelling.<br />
<br />
9. Involuntary Nexus transportation.  For awhile, the Nexus Scions were ready souls, and would eat people even without the transit item.  IT was fun to watch players flee from the GFay spires, hoping to avoid being sucked into Luclin unwittingly.<br />
<br />
8. Nakes graphics.  For their sheer novelty, and the humour left in its wake.<br />
<br />
7. Free Coldain Velium Tempers.  Probably the best documented of the economy-damaging bugs, this not only shook up bazaar behavior for months afterward, but revealed other exploits, and helped lead to a frenzy of &quot;fake&quot; bug stories as exploiters sought distractions to buy time for their own effects (like the infinite plat banker, and some if not all of the shark exploits).<br />
<br />
6. The Lord Inquistor Seru exploit.  Preserved forever as the Cuirass of Sad Exploisation.  An an asside, I knew about this, and didn't did it - I now wish I had, the CoSE would be such a unique trophy piece!<br />
<br />
5. The LoY pre-order level 50 bug.  For the sheer amount of panic it instilled in the populace.<br />
<br />
4. &quot;Working as Intended Day&quot;.  As rangers fondly referred to it.  The archery machine gun was unprecendented in its uniqeness.  And it got a truly humorous emergency patch, at that.<br />
<br />
3. Faction wars!  Best known for PoTactics fun, but doable in Storms (and Temple of Veeshan!) as well.  Disruptive beyond belief, but truly a sight to have seen all the same.<br />
<br />
2. Sentinel.  The first of the crash-inducing bugs.  Everything else is just playing second fiddle.  The Paladin Act of Valor AA gets an honorable mention thought, for being such a sucky AA that it took an amazing amount of time before anyone even KNEW that it crashed the zone!<br />
<br />
1. Clicky spell refresh.  When they finally fixed the system so that clicking an instant-cast spell no longer removed the recycle time between casting spells, people across Everquest where forced to rework casting strategies and timing, a change that I would argue was instrumental in the push to make EQ put focus effects in game (especially spell haste).  Few bugs have been so widely used, or taken so much for granted, and fewer still have had such a lasting impact when they went away.  Clicky refresh, I salute you. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My favorite bug was the one where when a named mob reached 0% health, the entire zone crashed.  This was on the same night where the floors in ssra were full of holes and people would randomly fall through and reappear somewhere else at random.  Most people ended up in PoK, but some ended up in PoSky and runnyere and crap like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hmm one bug was after a patch and everyones armour was a bunch of lettuce and other items.<br />
<br />
Another bug was when everyones corpse floated above the ground, that was funny.<br />
<br />
The blue diamond bug, where this merchant sold blue diamonds ever so often, at the time blue diamonds were 1k and consequently devalued down to cost price.<br />
<br />
One bug I heard about was ssra emp appeared at the entrance of ssra on a few servers.<br />
<br />
The Scarecrow bug, corpses would appear as human scarecrows.<br />
<br />
Oh the one in pon where this raid has obviously wiped on the tree there, the tree then preceded to summon everyone in the zone and was not possible to get your corpse for about 30 mins till the Gm came.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">you guys forgot the bag exploit in  velious days *** ~  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">the bug where Rogues were sololing some of the hardest mobs in the game, I cant remember for sure but I believe it was piercing weapons were scaling up in damage every swing, rogues were piercing from the front for backstab damage with normal swings...didnt last long.<br />
<br />
pathing in lower fay, bugged for years, newbies on the way to MM getting harm touched from across the zone by that damn horse.<br />
<br />
bleh to early for me to think of more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Boats. Nuff said, lol.<br />
<br />
I also remember the toolbox bug...make a tool box for next to nothing and sell to vendor for 9-10p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Iknumon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I remember when I'd just started to play... there were a couple times when player traders in the Bazaar would get sucked back to their home point without warning.  Seeing as most of them were ridiculously encumbered, getting back to Bazaar was a trick.  I actually saw this happen one evening... stood in the Nexus for about half an hour watching...traders...craaaawwwlll... back to the Bazaar.  As they got near I'd zap em with a strength buff.  They'd practically leap into the air and run into the nearest wall.  One of the funnier things I've ever seen in EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Boon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Diabalein - That bug with the rogue's was due to the codeing of bane damage.  Each swing the bane damage on the weapon added to the base weapon damage so you had rogue's doing huge amounts of damage especially with backstabs.<br />
<br />
It's fun to remember all these bugs you all have brought up, keep up the good work.  I'll try to think of a new one sometime soon here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Seems like I recall that after the new UI went live, people found out how to modify it so that you could put any item for any race/class in any slot.  I'm sure a warrior with a BP in every slot was pretty impressive at the time. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I liked the unlimited mage epic pet bug, it was back in velious or luclin.  Mages could summon unlimited numbers of pets and would zerg everything in WW to death.<br />
<br />
My second favorite was when enchanters could charm stuff that did 600dps, cept they never fixed that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Best bug ever ..... Doppleganger aa for chanters. <br />
<br />
When it came out, chanter would create x doubles of himself. Who would then proceed to each create more doubles, who would also create doubles exponentially.... then they'd start attacking mobs, which they'd mez. Then they lost aggro on the mezzed mobs and start attacking the raid. And when killed they gave elemental equivalent xp. There's something innately cool about cloning someone only to have the clones turn on their creator. <br />
<br />
Bug resulted in the following quotes...<br />
<br />
- OMG Tinknade is agent Smith !<br />
<br />
- Doppeganger xp group after raids !<br />
<br />
- Ahh the lag ! Kill them before they crash the zone ! (4 chanters using doppleganger at the same time = up to your eyeballs in gnomes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
***************************************************<br />
Other favorites include but are not limited to : <br />
<br />
Velious armor dropping off trash mobs in Eastern wastes after a patch... quickly followed by an emergency patch. <br />
<br />
People foraging rubicite in Emerald jungle (back when crafted was the definitive warrior armor)... Also followed by an emergency patch.<br />
<br />
Being able to hand in batwings in place of tokens at the casino... first day... also emergency patched. Didn't find out about it till too late to try. This bug was also coupled with an extra patch to implement the actual winning of prizes at the casino AFTER a guildmate blew 200 k there. <br />
<br />
Plane of earth horse bug. Getting off your horse in Poe left a copy of your horse at that spot. Later resumonning your horse anywhere in the zone would make you appear on this previous copy.<br />
<br />
Your fd is unavailable at this time, you must wait 38764186238568456 seconds for it to refresh.<br />
<br />
The one day when FD was accidentally fixed, wish they'd left it in. Fd, mobs mem wipe, you could get up right away to tag or whatever. Best time pulling ever.<br />
<br />
Early froglock illusion spell used to turn you into a human male... Fun spell if you were a female character into cross dressing. <br />
<br />
Killing Saryrne used to crash the zone unless you left one bird of the first wave alive (or something along those lines)<br />
<br />
AE Taunt resulting in everyone's horse attacking your tank.<br />
<br />
Plenty more where those came from.</div></div><hr />

Making Phin Esenrap and the Priest of Discord in Qeynos fight.<br />
<br />
Not really a bug but really funny: The many myths and ways to get Pzyjn to spawn in Qeynos Hills - this at the time, was great fun to watch. People trying all of their different theories like having to kill a rat that wanders to the ruins at exactly 4pm game time while keeping xxx spawns clear and she'll wander right over to you, hahaha, man that was great.<br />
<br />
Not many people know about this one but a few years back, all of the bandits in lake rathe (a few other zones too) had at least 100x their normal hit points, making them so not worth the xp :P<br />
<br />
Also not really a bug but kinda funny: being able to give items / weapons to NPCs. There was a guy trying to be nice and give some newbies a suprise when they killed mobs, they'd drop velium weapons... Well, the problem was the mobs were hitting for 5x normal damage and chain proccing 11dd so nobody could kill them, haha.<br />
<br />
And a recent bug that was never listed as fixed but was recently; it's kinda hard to explain but i'll try :)<br />
<br />
Pet's wont use nodrop weapons, right. Well, there was a bug where you could give a dirk of the traitor (procs every hit, makes you spinstun around in circles forever) to a pet, and it would &quot;use&quot; that weapon in it's secondary, but it acted like it didn't. You could then give a high damage proc weapon - mage summoned ones, and that weapon would use the proc rate (every hit) from the dirk for it's proc rate, so every hit would be for whatever the damage, plus the 100(ish) dd proc :p<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are others I've left out, just cant think of em atm :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necromancer pets will no longer despawn after 2 minutes when their master is feigned.<br />
<br />
Pets do not draw attract aggro from wandering mobs. Pets were poofing when necros had to wait the full 2 minutes to clear mob aggro. Doesn't seem like a biggie, but at 59 and above the peridot cost requirement to cast pet gets both old and expensive when the pet is poofing as a result of game design. Good fix for those necros.<br />

it is the tactic monks used for a long time to kill bother Zephyl for a robe of the lost circle in rathe mountains... he quads for 350ish normally, but people would give him a 2hb and he would only double.<br />
<br />
Similarly, a common tactic was to hold on to a minotaur horn when soloing the raster camp in your 40s as a monk, and give it to raster, so he couldn't swing with his offhand.<br />

<br />
By making the weapons essentially replaceable by combining a sword of runes with the scabbard (from memory), it meant that the best pet weapons EVER were created.<br />
<br />
A guild on the Nameless used three mage pets dual wielding warrior epics to mow through PoHate, and ToV got a mauling too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I remember a bug in the bazaar where you could buy no drop items from other vendors.<br />
<br />
I remember a bug where you could somehow equip any piece of gear in any slot.<br />
<br />
I remember a bug where bards could no longer cast spells after one of their weapons procced.  (it was either that, or their weapons didn't proc while they were singing songs).<br />
<br />
the bug where Rogues were sololing some of the hardest mobs in the game, I cant remember for sure but I believe it was piercing weapons were scaling up in damage every swing, rogues were piercing from the front for backstab damage with normal swings...didnt last long.<br />
Ah.  Ya.  What happened was +elemental_damage was counted after every swing, either that or bane weapons.  So, a 10/20 weapon with +1 fire damage was 10/20 with +2 fire on the 2nd swing, and 10/20 with +3 fire next swing and so on.  After 100 swings your weapon was 10/20 with +100 fire damage on it.<br />
<br />
Wake the dead on enchanter's corpse and having the pet charm gods.<br />
<br />
My friend's enchanter's horse ceases to shield mob01.  That was amusing.<br />
<br />
Not really a bug but really funny: The many myths and ways to get Pzyjn to spawn in Qeynos Hills - this at the time, was great fun to watch. People trying all of their different theories like having to kill a rat that wanders to the ruins at exactly 4pm game time while keeping xxx spawns clear and she'll wander right over to you, hahaha, man that was great.<br />
Actually, there's some merit to this.  Pyzjin only spawns at night time.  Her placeholder is a rat that wanders through the ruins.  The spawn time of mobs in the zone is a set time.  You kill the rat PH at a certain time in the game day so that the first respawn of the rat is at the first hour of night time in game, and you kill the phs as soon as they pop to maximize the chance of getting Pyzjin to spawn.<br />
<br />
Theft of Thought used to make you go OOM when it procced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Anybody remember the bug that allowed you to run at perma-SoC speed upon resurrection?<br />
<br />
It was before horses and fabled jboots and the like, and involved, if I remember correctly, dying, then going to the zone where your body was with a res inc, and casting SoC before the res hit.  You'd get resurrected and the only icon on your screen would be the Res Effects, but you'd be at SoC speed until you zoned!  Was fun to toy around with, until it was fixed.<br />
<br />
Also, in Beta, there was an annoying metal rat sliding around the mountains bug in Ak'Anon, as well as the famous dying near a server repop and having all your items both on your body AND on your corpse, effectively duping everything you had on you.  The one time it happened to me, though, all I had was like, 5 backpacks full of spiderling silks and a couple rusties.<br />
<br />
Forage tables being messed up in Guk for a day or two, allowing people to FORAGE manastones and the like, as well as GM event only quest items from the past.<br />
<br />
And who could forget the infamous pottery scandal?  Wooot...<br />
<br />
Also, there was awhile where I could shadowstep up to the ledge overlooking the orcs in Highhold Pass and shoot them without getting hit in return (was playing my wizard at the time).<br />
<br />
And, the bug that I never encountered from beta up through 2003, but now experience constantly...<br />
<br />
Getting stuck in walls/tents/etc, and having to wait 30 seconds to rewind!  BAHHH!<br />
<br />
Also, the boats being broken in a game that is 5 years old and is working hard on expansions for new content... but... the boats are... broken...?<br />
<br />
P.S... and about when items used to be giveable to npc's... I thought it was funny to see all the Priests of Discord decked out in bronze armor and rusty greatswords :)<br />
<br />
P.S.S. Almost forgot the merchant right outside of Freeport who would somehow be on the roof half the time and not sell you any food or drink, I petitioned gm's to get him down a few times, way back in the day before everyone had misty thicket picnics and fuzzlecutters aplenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Badasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">A good recent one was the Cleave I effect on the tipt bracers.  That effect was coded to increase your chance to critical hit by 20%, rather than by 20% above your current percent.  Every melee in the guild that got one became a blender...especially rangers, who were critical hitting on just about every bow shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">So, every 5th shot would be a crit?  Damn.  That's what was up with the cleave effect.</div></div><hr />

My favorite Bug I heard about and unfortunately we didnt use... SK HT was instant cast and instant recast.  You think machine gun with a ranger is good when they hit for 150?  Hows about a SK chain casting HT as fast as his little fingers will push the button and landing them for 8k. :)  Since HT is damn near unresistable they were using it on EP/ PoTime fights.  The way I hear it only the folks that could do the fights anyway knew of it so it's not like Scrub_Guild_001 was getting through to PoTime because of this bug.  But still it blows me away that a SK could crank out over 10k dps with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Technically not a bug but a friend of mine once gave a ulthork tunic to a begging newbie... who promptly died 5 times before realising the negative hp mod on the tunic was killing him every time he equipped it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could dupe your corpse and all the items on it by getting agro then running to the zone and going LD just as you zone. You logged back in to find yourself in the new zone, and a full corpse in the old zone. The side effect was though that it crashed the first zone so anyone else in there was screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">My favourite bug was the Cheese exploit, originally the ingredirents for cheese cost less then the merchant buying price, so for every cheese you made, and sold to the vendor you made about 8 gold pieces.  What made this bug expecially memorable, was it occured on the day my gould was having a Slave Auction, and half the guild was sat in the merchants room in Shadowhaven, 20+ people all making cheese :)<br />
<br />
My second favourite bug was the explorer knives bug, where the knive you hand-in to a trooper in LoIO for positive Cabilis faction were put on a merchant in Ferrot. I read about this on my guild messageboard and rushed home to go and my bag fulls of knives, but by the time I got to LoIO they had perma killed the trooper. I have all my bags full of knives for two months till they put him back ! But it saved me about 6000 bone chip handins :)<br />
<br />
The bug i most like recently, is the quicksand bug, where you see people/horses up to thier waists in the gruod, always makes me smile.</div></div><hr />

You just grouped, he sat down outside in the water in a safe spot, and the stoopid dark elfs would path to the pet parked at the tower door and get slaughtered.   Worked wonders for power leveling around level 50 to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Kyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Man those are some ones, the oldies specially bring back some good memories.<br />
<br />
Ones I can think of off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
- Zoning in the Karanas from one end to the other by zoning while in the water (beat that bard speed!).<br />
<br />
- Using the eye of Zomm to target any mob in the zone and bring them solo to zone entrance (Velk was horribly abused on my serv).<br />
<br />
- Pathing, esp in the gnome city was so bad u could get mobs to stand there and do nothing while u burned em down.<br />
<br />
- Rogues pickpocketing bazaar traders.<br />
<br />
- Giving mobs items (covered before), which they should have left in game, with some editing.  My fav thing to do was give an orc pawn high amounts of copper ;).<br />
<br />
- Creating player names with single characters (There was a player with the name 'A' on an old server of mine (Mith marr).<br />
<br />
- Watching bards play songs while their weapons go thru their heads.  Oh wait...<br />
<br />
Ah shoot - there was a hilarious charming bug but I can't remember it enuff to make complete sense of it.<br />
<br />
Anyway - great earlier posts and great memories.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Shazbot!  Forgot this one, not a bug but no longer can be done and provided lots of entertainment.  Back in the old bazaar days (East Commons tunnel), at the cave entrance I took my enchanter, dropped a platinum coin, then casted minor illusion, which turned me into a platinum coin, then watched countless players try to pick me up.  Even the high lvls were suckers, hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">no, giving an NPC that normally quad attacked a 2hb would cause him to only double attack.<br />
<br />
it is the tactic monks used for a long time to kill bother Zephyl for a robe of the lost circle in rathe mountains... he quads for 350ish normally, but people would give him a 2hb and he would only double.<br />
<br />
Similarly, a common tactic was to hold on to a minotaur horn when soloing the raster camp in your 40s as a monk, and give it to raster, so he couldn't swing with his offhand.<br />
<br />
this ended when they made NPCs no longer accept items given to them.<br />
<br />
Speaking of bother Zephyl, monks also used to give him several K of cp destroying his ability to fight with encuberance, and hitting him with the huge AC penalty monks have for being too heavy.<br />

Flash back to 1999.  There was something about zoning into East Freeport from Ocean of Tears on the boat that consistently caused Everquest to crash on my computer.  Wham, bam, welcome to desktop.  That in itself wasn't such a big deal, but by the time I was able to log back in, it put me on the boat zoning BACK into Ocean of Tears.  Nothing like another 60 minute round trip ride to make Prathun a sad panda.</div></div><hr />

Oh boats were great! <br />
<br />
Boat zones player doesn't.<br />
Boat arrives at the OOT dock, or should I say through the dock, and when the boat leaves your sitting on the dock still.<br />
Boat zones and you find yourself back on the dock.<br />
Boat zones, you crash, and by the time you get back into the game your at your bind point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prathun,<br />
I have always wanted to know one thing. Why is it when you zone into CT the hall is going one way as you zone in, but once you pop inside CT the hall goes in the other direction?</div></div><hr />

There is another zone like this but I can't for the life of me remember where it is. Somthing like you face south as you zone in then once you zone you are facing east. very strange.</div></div><hr />
