<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was recentally flagged for tactics (last night as a matter of fact) and was wondering about some of the in's and outs of the zone as i've heard of people soloing in there for some time,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They used to solo in the Arena..... haven't seen anyone solo there in awhile.  Bring a group with you to PoT, as on my server, it's not very crowded.  With the flag changes though, that should change</div></div><hr />

if memory is right they only did pov/ pos / bot / hoh / po torment  for flag changes</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, that's why people are gonna flood into PoTactics after change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ahh gotcha i thoguht you ment the influx of people running into tatics if they let people go into tatics without killing behmoth my bad final</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe, no..... I mean anyone who's set up for Tactics will probably start EXPing there again, to avoid the crush in HOH and BoT....  Beheamoth will still be a requirement to get in, or group quest....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmm... better farm them stampeeding piglets to high heaven now before the &quot;crush&quot; hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On the upper tier walkway, if you head left as you come out of the zone in, you'll find a big room with nothing in it.  I pull ogres in there and kill them all day long.  7 highly polished gems and counting.<br />
<br />
I get adds fighting in arena, but I haven't been down there much so I am probably missing something.  If you sit in the room where the piglet comes through, there is a safe corner, but not really enough room to root/dot when a roamer comes by.  The daiku oracles are also a huge pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Couple nice solo spots, the one Jinheim mentioned is good, though lately I've been having serious resist problems with root.  Got one mob who resisted 9 roots in a row as I kited him around the room, and when one finally landed, it wore off in 3 seconds, only to bounce 3 more roots before i died.  Have tried twice more and found 2 more mobs very similar, but killed tons before that with no problems.  Not sure what sort of bad luck streak I'm on.<br />
Most diaku mobs are only partial slowable (Warriors are fully slowable), and a few are casters.  Scouts are rogues, then there are sk's and shaman mobs.  The shaman mobs suck.  You'll root them, they'll root you back, then dispel the root on themself, and come beat you silly (happened a few times).  SK's are mean too if they land a snare on you and break root, you're in trouble.<br />
<br />
Almost nothing summons, so you're pretty safe root rotting.  The wraith mobs are necros and quite mean, I'd avoid them at all costs.<br />
<br />
You can solo the pit, but you have to be incredibly careful and pretty fast and lucky.  Mobs randomly path around, but don't always go clear to the edges.  So if you get one near a wall, good chance you can finish him off before another comes close enough to agro.  The agro range is pretty small for most mobs.  There's a zone out in the right side corner coming in from the zone, I always solo there and end up zoning out a lot.  But better than nothing if the upper room is camped.<br />
<br />
There's also another room if you go out the arena on the far side and hang slightly left and in the first doorway, there's a long room with some beds, at the end is a large enough area (armor against the wall) where you can root dot between mobs and wanderers w/o agro.  SK's and shaman spawn here in pretty good number, but sometimes you get lucky and get all warriors + scouts (rogues) for a while, and it's great.<br />
<br />
Almost all the mobs in the pit are fully slowable.  The boars and crows are higher level (and thus better exp), but the gladiators and zek initiates are a little lower and can be easier to kill.  If you're bringing a group, try to get a spot in a corner of the arena, there is a huge density of mobs to pull, and you don't have to worry about partial slows for the most part.</div></div><hr />
