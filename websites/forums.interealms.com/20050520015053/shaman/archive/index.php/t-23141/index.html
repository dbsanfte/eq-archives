<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>servingme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi. i am a 65 shaman with 100 AAs. Since it is hard to spare my time to get elemental flag and guild raid. i gave up being in the guild and getting Time flag.<br />
So, now i want to make a another character to play with my Shaman together. Currently, i am think Berserker or Monk. I plan that i will camp (box) BoT zone or Basement of HoH zone.<br />
<br />
I know SK is most popular one, but i don't want to be a Tank while i am playing with group, i want enjoying damages with groups =)<br />
<br />
So, Monk or Berserker: ( at lvl 65 with some basic AAs)<br />
Which one makes more Damages?<br />
Which one is more efficient with my Shaman?<br />
Which one is better in Tier 3 ( the BoT and HoH line ) zone?<br />
<br />
Thx for ur time ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Monk = pulling.<br />
<br />
You wanna make this toon to basicly bot your shaman with. Well if you like pure DPS i would say go with zerker.<br />
<br />
Right now the zerker is a lil funked up, but they will get around to fixing them soon and if you ask me, they really arent a bad class, if ally ou wanna do is be added DPS to a group. Not to mention itll be easy to 2 box. <br />
<br />
However, if you get a monk then you will be required to pull, thats basicly the monks job is most cases, though sometimes a bard or ranger can be more effective, but when i comes down to it, the monk is still the puller class.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if i were you, i would chose zerker. But im not you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>servingme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thx for reply, the one more question is that i saw many monks and shamans duoed in BoT zone, so i have no worries about monk but<br />
Berserker can duo (except any Named )with my shaman in BoT zone as much as monk does?<br />
if they could my choice should be Berserker =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I two box shammy &amp; monk.  Pulling is easy, just set up a couple targetting hotkeys - one to target your monk for easy healing and one to assist your monk for easy slows on incoming.  Easy peasy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As a shaman you can solo in BoT. So anything that adds DPS to your kills is a plus.<br />
<br />
Monk will tank better once you fill out their AA's but to be honest, in this game, soloing and duoing in tier2+ content is more touble then its worth. If this is your plan then your better of with a real tank class or a enchanter. <br />
<br />
Like i said, as a shaman you can solo a lot of BoT in the lower section, but its no cakewalk unless you have some serious elemental+ gear.<br />
<br />
You cant have it all with 2 people, you need to decide how your going to play.  Grouping or solo, cause each path will have better choices as far as the class you will want to pick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Zerkers suck right now. DPS isn't that great.  They bring stun (if dealing with gating mobs or self healing mobs) and snare (which you might already have if you're a troll shammy). <br />
<br />
Monks are better dps (right now) and can single pull.  And they'll take less damage than a zerker with their avoidance AA's.<br />
<br />
However, a zerker can hold aggro over a monk.  That stun and snare will help (unless you have monk weapons that proc stun, or above average dps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you want to have the familiarity of being broken and unneeded, go with berserker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ive tried em.<br />
<br />
I have a 64 monk with 20 odd aa's and he sucks. The problem is they take spike damage and cant taunt.<br />
<br />
With a shaman, if you cant dot and canni when your playing yer shagged on dps. Ruppy puppy only puts out low 30 dps, high 30's with full mage kit.<br />
<br />
Whereas if you can load up a dot or two you can raise that to the 80-90 dps sustained without resorting to over concentration on the sham.<br />
<br />
You need to concentrate with the tank, cause kicks and such add bout 10dps, and if you miss positioning because you are busy on the sham, then you get into a &quot;cant hit target from here&quot; or &quot;cant see target&quot; loop where you can drop significant dps easily.<br />
<br />
I measured my monks dps at around 100 (he needs some better weaps).<br />
<br />
I duo'd him and my sham at about 140dps on beeeeeez in bot sustained over time, ie when your too boored or distracted to seriously crank the dps.<br />
<br />
Compare that with my shad.<br />
<br />
Hi puts out arount 80dps and his pet clocks in at around 30 dps (with mage toys and sham buffs)<br />
<br />
This means he is already outdamaging the monk.<br />
<br />
Hi life tap means if i dont watch his health and need to rip of a heal, he can heal himself for about 1k dmg. I havent missed a heal on him in months and months.<br />
<br />
His snare and fear means I can load up some dots on the mob and actually concentrate on canniing the sham a little. I can run blood and bane or blood and epic and sk can still easily keep agro.<br />
<br />
If i want to run three dots at once then the sk needs to fear every now and then, or i actually have to hit taunt occasionally.<br />
<br />
I have clocked my sham and sk at around 220 dps on the same beez in bot in the same lazy xp mode.<br />
<br />
But most importantly snare = no runners and trainbulation which is my biggest cause of death when dual boxin.<br />
<br />
One of my friends insists a pally is even better, and after trying him a little i would have to agree.<br />
<br />
With the stunn up to lvl 70 aa, nothing cheals. cheal sometimes extends the fights in bot. However the dps is significantly reduced. I clocked the pally and the sham at under 200 dps.<br />
<br />
However stun is almost as good as snare to prevent runners and a high end pally can chain stunn for a while, its just unfortunately while they do that thier dps drops to very low.<br />
<br />
but if it all goes pear shaped pallies can rezz. So what the lord giveth the lord taketh away.<br />
<br />
Also with SU3 on undead mobs like in hoh the pallies dps is as good as the sk's.<br />
<br />
Pally can chain stunn till things are slowed though, so they are a better big mob team, however dps/minute i would go with a SK.<br />
<br />
As an adition to that I have tried a mage recently and they are great.<br />
<br />
However if you want to log on and have people chase you down and offer you oral sex. I would suggest a cleric.<br />
<br />
You will never be short of playmates if you start a cleric to match your sham. Nor will you be short on invites to all the huuuuber guilds.<br />
<br />
In the end its your decision. But dont be swayed by the strait dps potential number of some of the dps classes, agro management for a sham and the stupid stuffed up implementation of dot agro (I know one of my good friends is a wizzy and my sham is pounded if i even begin to aproach 25% of his sustained dps) is really the key issue in dps/minute ( and xp per hour).<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've had a Berserker hold aggro and tank quite well in normal LDONs.  Since I avoid BoT like a needle being held by a Haitain transvestite - I can't speak for that zone.<br />
<br />
The Zerker in question isn't &quot;uber&quot; even by his own standards.<br />
<br />
YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">he could provide benefits in the near future, but given the current status, itd be hard to tell</div></div><hr />

<br />
They will get a few quick enhancements that will make rogues, monks and rangers scream, and berserker twinks will become enomorously popular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dual-box with a ranger:<br />
-40 point long duration DS at 65<br />
-good for root and shoot with tough mobs<br />
-better DPS than either the Pally or SK<br />
-tangling weeds/snare/ensnare means a Ranger can hold aggro basically forever without using a significant amount of mana.<br />
<br />
Drawback:  Worse tankage than any of the mobs above, however, they do have some self-heal capabilities.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well yeah, but I've never gotten TOO much use out of Damage Shields against mobs that are 75% slowed.  The DPS would be nice, though.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't do berserker, personally.  I'd even be hesitant about monk, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd choose a monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't dual box, but have duo'd with a friend's lvl 63 zerker.  Surprisingly enough, it was a really good combo, with his stun/snare he was able to peel mobs off me rather quickly and with slow he was able to tank them well also.  I was able to load up on some dots and the heals to him were almost always covered with Q and nothing else.  Granted this isn't in tier3 Pop or GoD.  However, from my personal experiences with my friend's zerker I wouldn't discount them too quickly even with them being &quot;broken&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">SKs and Paladins are the better choice if you ask me, and I'd lean towards an SK (pulls + snare &gt; aego + stun).<br />
<br />
What with the GoD weapons, Monks can put out some pretty high DPS (dual 17/20s I do about 120dps without kicking) but their taunt is very very lacking, and while some fights you'll only get hit twice, other fights you get hit every single time. Doesn't really &quot;fit&quot; for botting anymore if you ask me. Being able to pull your own singles is cool though.<br />
<br />
Berserkers atm just don't have anything special... but they can snare and stun which can come in handy. There's nothing that makes you &quot;special&quot; though (at least not yet). Hopefully they get cool.<br />
<br />
BST/DRU = win</div></div><hr />
