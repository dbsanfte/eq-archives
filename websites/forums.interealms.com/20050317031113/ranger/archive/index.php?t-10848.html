At 18 by lvl 20, most people called me the master of MM(not to brag).  I could pulkl a mob from inside jail all the way to other side of pond no adds.  Creative use of Harmony &amp; just learn the layout / time it takes to do things.  Awsome EXP.  Just Stay away from casters if ya fight them, drop em' fast.  (258 a pop) ouch.  Use Camo alot,  walk around &amp; learn the place learn to solo it.  &amp; If you prove you can add som,ething to a group with your skills bring them the mobs wack for about 10secs &amp; pull another with bow / harmony not too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulvian Stormweaver</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mistmoore is a great and under utilized zone (although nowadays with the caster changes it might be a tid bit tougher for younger season Rangers. (or easier seeing as now meele can interrupt mob casting with less difficulty.)<br />
All of castle Mistmoore is outdoors, which is great for those who took time to master harmony pulling also.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore is divided into the following area's.<br />
<br />
Courtyard.<br />
This area has mobs which are generally level 19-23, they can be either meele, wizard, mage, or necromancer. Assorted Gargoyles spawn around the Tower.<br />
<br />
Meele mobs- Not much to them, slightly more hp than casters, but none of those unpleasant 200 dd &quot;suprises&quot; from them.<br />
<br />
Necromancers - They have less Hp then the meeles, but will try to life tap you and use other spells, clinging darkness among them, it might be a good idea to get some magic resist items to facilitate running for zone if need be. Their favorite spell is the level 16 necromancer 160dd poison nuke, very hard to resist at low levels.<br />
<br />
Wizard - Arguably the easiest caster mobs in Mistmoore, very little Hp, and they tend to cast more than anything else, if your party has one of these, wiping the floor with MOB wizards will be cake walk.<br />
<br />
Mage- Toughest Caster mobs in Mistmoore, they always buff with their Damage shields and like to nuke with fire. Make sure to dispell them, or you will be taking damage three ways.<br />
Damage Shield, Nukes, and mob meele.<br />
<br />
Gargoyles - More Hp than the pure meele mobs, and they hit slightly harder, though I noticed are not as resistant to PC spells. Also they drop their eyes, which are stackeable, and sell for approximately 9pp to Vendoors, very nice, and light source of money for young players.<br />
<br />
Named Mobs: Any of the mobs in the courtyard can place hold the Glyphed Ghoul, he is higher level (Upwards of 28) But has a nice reward for those who take the time to kill him.<br />
-Crested Mistmoore Shield (Common)<br />
-And Vial of Ghoul Blood (Right click 50 Magic resist buff with a very good duration) (also common)<br />
<br />
Past the courtyard is what many like to call the Graveyard Canyon.<br />
Mobs here are just a tid bit higher level then ones in courtyard, and come in same classifications. Albeit no gargoyles.<br />
Any mob here can Place hold the Glyphed Ghoul also.<br />
<br />
Next up is an intersection of sorts.<br />
Going to the right will take you to the graveyard.<br />
Going to the left will lead you to Canyon Proper and Castle Mistmoore itself.<br />
<br />
Graveyard - Mobs here come in all the abovementioned classes, and one new addition, Cleric.<br />
Clerics will be your biggest challenge, as they not only meele, and nuke you, but will try to heal themselves, and any other mobs you might be fighting.<br />
The wandering spawn who comes trough the door place holds the Imp who drops a nice caster dagger, and also a meele eyepatch.<br />
In center of the Graveyard is the tomb inside of which a flower spawns which you hand in to Ssynthi, the shadowed man behind the tomb, he in turn gives you faction, and a no-drop necro only scepter used for one of their quests.<br />
<br />
Up past the graveyard trough the hidden wall is Jail.<br />
Inside there Ive only seen Plate Clad meele mobs and Necromancers. They are approximately level 28-30, three of them spawn right inside within each other's assist aggro range, so be carefull if you venure there.<br />
The steps leading upwards are the spawn area of Avenging Caitiff who gives you Electrum Bladed Wakizashi for our call of flame quest. Killing him yields Crested Spaulders (11 ac 6 stamina) and Crested Helm (10 ac 5 str 2 dex --Not sure on the dex)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ictinia</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These look like pretty nice equipment for the level of Mob that drops them. I'm wondering if it's possible to camo up run in to where the Avenging Caitiff is on the stairs and kill him then recamo and run back out of the castle with out getting agroed?  My other question is does anybody know what the hp hit is for jumping out of the tower window and running to the zone in case of an emergancy?  This looked to me to be a fast way out. Of course your going to have quite a train but if you could make it with camo up it might work. <br />
<br />
Thank for all the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tallynn</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible to run to the jail camo, but there is a trap on the secret door leading to the stairs that dispels invisibility.  Just something to keep in mind, though I suppose you could just re-camo once you went through.<br />
<br />
Also, the jail mobs, if they are melee, do not leave their cells and do not assist each other.  Casters most definitely help each other.  Sometimes.  The jail is kinda buggy.</div></div><hr />
