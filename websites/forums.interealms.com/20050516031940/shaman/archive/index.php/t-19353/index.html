<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those that haven't been keeping up to date:<br />
<br />
In GoD we will be getting an AA called Secondary Forte.  It will allow us to choose a second specialization.  I assume almost everyone is currently specializing in alteration.  Divination and Abjuration are out of the question (please no divination jokes, they're old and lame), so that leaves evocation and conjuration.  I've been thinking about it, and these both sound like perfectly viable spec lines.<br />
<br />
If I had been given the choice at the beginning of PoP, I would have without doubt jumped on conjuration as my second spec.  At that time, I still soloed a lot, and I was still doing mostly luclin content for raids.  I didn't have spear of torment of velium strike.  I had even more pathetic nukes, but considerable dots.  I was fighting mobs that took a long time to die and didn't resist my dots so much.  As I went through pop, though, I started using my dots less and less.  LDoN would have been the final nail in the coffin if it hadn't been for Bane.  Mobs just die too fast, even in hard mode, for Blood of Saryrn to run full course.  This makes is dreadfully ineffecient.  Luckily, though, we did get Bane.  It is a very powerful dot, and if you apply it early it will run full course or close enough.  It is also very good for dotting an add, because it will almost always run full course.  Blood of Saryrn is also good for this, and recently I have started memming it instead of malos for normal adventures (I looked back over an entire day's worth of adventuring - 8 adventures - and realized I hadn't cast malos once.  I stopped memming it).<br />
<br />
However, although I do use my dots in LDoN, I use my nukes much more.  If I am busy debuffing or healing and I don't have things under control until the mob is at 50% life, it is too late to use a dot.  However, it is never too late to use a nuke.  In addition to that, our dots are also pretty high aggro.  In most normal adventures I do, I no longer worry about overaggroing.  A slowed ldon mob simply cannot hurt me, and if being the MT is the price I have to pay for putting out significant DPS, so be it.  However, it can be a bit of an inconvenience.  In most LDoNs, I am usually the puller.  If I have aggro on the only mob in camp, I can't pull without dragging it along and thus annoying my entire group.  I have to wait for it to be dead before I can start my next pull, thus slowing down my group.  With nukes, I very rarely get and keep aggro.<br />
<br />
So, typically, this is what I do in an ldon:  Pull some mobs, slow them, VP one and Bane it.  Then I /assist the MT and just start nuking.  That's one dot vs. many nukes.<br />
<br />
What about on raids?  If you've read many of my posts, you know that I prefer the healing and support role on raids versus the damage role.  Thus, I don't bother with dots.  However, I do keep velium strike memmed and use it pretty often, although it is not my primary focus.  The ratio of nukes to dots while raiding is, for me, overwhelmingly in favor of nukes.<br />
<br />
As for soloing, I very rarely solo any more - it is just too boring.  However, when I do solo, I use dots exclusively and I stack so many of them that it does drain my mana.<br />
<br />
So, when I look at everything, I think I nuke a whole lot more than I dot.  If I were given the choice to make right now, I would probably pick evocation.  I'd only have two qualms with this:  1) Shamans are supposed to be a freaking dotting class and it just doesn't seem shamanly to pick evocation over conjuration.  However, this is really just a flaw in the basic design of dots.  2) The only situations in which I heavily use dots (soloing and ldon vs. lots of adds), I find that dots drain my mana.  I rarely see my mana drop rapidly from nuking, even from chaincasting velium strike.<br />
<br />
I think when GoD comes out, I am going to wait to buy secondary forte, although I think it is going to be one of the strongest AA's we get.  I want to see what type of encounters will be involved.  If the expansion follows the same pattern as PoP and LDoN, and the encounters just keep getting faster and faster, I will pick evocation without a doubt.  If things slow down a bit, more like encounters in luclin, I might be tempted to pick conjuration.  If they give me a reason to solo again, I will be even more tempted.<br />
<br />
So, what do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Leaning toward evoc, but I still do a bit of soloing.  Though when I think about it, I run lower on mana when in an LDoN group than soloing some stuff in droga or wherever.  Still undecided though, I don't think either will be worth the big aa points for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably going to do evoke since I nuke most of the time on raids and ldon groups. Won't have 10 AA's for this for a while though so will have a lot of time to make up my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What about the conjuration based nukes and rains?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Simply put the lower mana cost on the nukes and the insane cost on DoTs makes conjuration the better choice imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
I still solo/duo alot in Droga/Tactics, Conjuration is an obvious choice for me.<br />
<br />
When I'm casting conjuration based spells, mana is normally more of an issue for efficiency than when I'm nuking in LDoN.  If I'm dotting a mob with a Blood of Saryn (535 mana), I'd rather get the mana savings &amp; fizzle reduction (w/ a higher skill) on the big mana drain spells.  Blood + Bane is over 1k in mana gone in about 10-12 seconds whether they land or bounce.<br />
<br />
My DPS in adventures is mainly from Bane+dogdog.  I use Tears of Saryn for nuking to bolster that.  The Tears fizzles (5 fizzle adjust, /sigh) and high resists plus its situational use are really annoying.  In weak or non-traditional Adventure groups (where I'm carrying a greater burden), Blood+Bane on root-parked mobs can make a big difference, whereas a few extra nukes (especially w/ Tears limited situational use) aren't going to be as much help.  We're practically dead last in mana-efficiency on our DD's, so it just makes more sense to me to make improvements where they will do the most good - which is in DoT's for me. :cool: <br />
<br />
When I'm soloing, kill-rate is dependent almost exclusively by my mana.  In groups there are so many other factors (puller, group's mana) that affect kill-rate that my mana level is rarely the determining factor in whether we will be slaying significantly faster or not.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spear of torment, which I use religiously now, is conjuration. I almost never use velium strike anymore, and tears is limited too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">conjuration all the way.  I'm using it right now (in beta).  I'm sure that I might test out Evocation, but it's seemed to have taken a bit just to work up Specialize: Conjuration up.<br />
<br />
Either way, I do use VS alot during raids.  However, I still would much rather use dots more if I could (poss now with SCS), and I already use rains as much as possible, so that's just a bonus for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can't even imagine choosing evocation over conjuration.  It isn't even close.  My primary source of damage in PoP xp type situations is Bane.  If GoD is anything like PoP (high hp mobs), then that's the spell I'll be hitting every mob with.<br />
<br />
Even for LDoN, I mostly nuke with Spear of Torment, which is conjuration.  It's faster cast and just lands much better than cold on most mobs.  <br />
<br />
I just don't even see this as a serious choice, and I'll be really surprised if even 10% choose evocation.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Somebody explain to me why people think Rains are Conjuration. I keep reading that.<br />
<br />
They are Evocation based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Doh, my mistake!  I just usually associate poison with conjuration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Evocation ,i nuke much more than i dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Spear of tormet is a nice conjuration nuke.  dots are conjuration.  <br />
<br />
VS and Rains are Evocation.  <br />
<br />
if I pick conjuration I get all my DoT's and one Nuke (one that is OK with elemental glves).  Evocation is just VS<br />
<br />
SoT casting time is so much nicer, I hate how long VS takes to cast.<br />
<br />
Conjuration all the way here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Conjuration all the way.<br />
<br />
I use my dots mostly only in solo.<br />
<br />
In time (phase 1/2/3) or LDoN, when the mobs are debuffed, I chain cast VS and with all the mind buffs avaible, I can't go under 95% mana :D, so evocation is not a huge mana eater actually ;).<br />
<br />
In the other hand, Conjuration is a huge mana vampire with the dots and poison DD ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">conjuration specialization + elemental/orante gloves = &lt;3<br />
<br />
looks like im stuck with these gloves till we get a new nuke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm rather embarrassed to say that I never noticed that spear of torment was a conjuration spell.  That pretty much settled it for me, I'm going conjuration for sure :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm waiting for someone to post how they had conjuration as their primary specialization to begin with and that they plan to get Alteration as the secondary.   heh heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I seem to remember someone mentioning something on another post about a quest (in Temple Sol Ro??) to fix your specializations. I've done a search here but can't find it. Does anyone have any details or can link to this quest? I think I might have screwed up my specializations. Alteration was my first pick but not understanding how they worked back then I think I switched to something else too early and messed it up. If it is possible to fix this up I should do that before picking a Secondary Forte. Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would have to say that it will be conjuration for me as well.  I use spear of torment almost exclusively when I decide to nuke (partly because of the speed, partly because of the reduced mana cost because of my ornate gloves).   I also typically use Bane during raids (though honestly I spend more time thinking about healing than thinking about damage).  I rarely use my poison or disease based DoTs at all - - since I stopped soloing some time ago.  They're just *way* too slow to use in groups, no matter when I cast them.  Still, SoT + Bane.  Also, I can summon Dogdog for less mana with conjuration.  And summon food and water too, for that matter.  Perhaps I'll even fizzle less on those spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Conjuration is the only way to go IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm wondering how the specialization reset quest, will be effected with this.How will you reset which you want as your primary specialization and your secondary.<br />
<br />
Til I know I've got a safety net in place cause I make a bad choice, or just think the grass is greener and want to change, I'll hold off here. Enough other things to keep my interest as yet.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The quest sets ALL specialization to 49 no worries about that.<br />
<br />
I also like to add if you get a nice procing weapon the nuke is not that great. with 100% haste I proc semi often, crit semi often, and hit in the 180-210 range farely often (LDON). A lot of times on inc I'll slow (paly stuns) bane go in and hit 200 proc 800dd, hit for 210 in like 2 seconds + 420 tic goes in and it's nice..<br />
<br />
Remember the jbb trick? you hit attack and hit jbb and get procs between jbb.. I do the same with my procing weapon and sot (since it's almost a mana free nuke). With conjuration is IS a mana free nuke for all practical purposed =]</div></div><hr />
