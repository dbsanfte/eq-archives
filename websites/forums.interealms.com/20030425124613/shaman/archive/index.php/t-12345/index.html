<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Obadia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well i have to at least ask...<br />
don't suppose anyone knows a way i can raise my defense now that im 57?really bugs me,feeling i gimped my char out of alot of ac because i didn't take the time to really learn how to develop my char  :rolleyes: <br />
 ashamed to say,but i have a whopping 160 defense  :o  been playing my char for a year and not real excited about a reroll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It isnt...just solo your way to 60 or at least till you got your def maxed! And tank in the face...Katta is a very good place for that!</div></div><hr />

This is NOT a new subject, but it hasn't been brought up in awhile.  <br />
I ran a quick search and didn't find the threads I remember.<br />
/sigh  board wipes stink.<br />
<br />
Ping Fuzzlecutter in West Freeport is level 35.  I used him to raise my defense skills when they were a tad under the weather in my 40's many many moons ago.  If he still cons dark blue to you (don't think he will, but I'm too tired to do math) then he'd be a good target to raise skill with.<br />
<br />
Just be aware this is a very BORING way to do it.<br />
<br />
If you have 2 machines, you can use a PC's pet that cons dark blue to you and just have it whack you repeatedly in an arena duel.  When you need to heal up, have your buddy back off the pet.  You can get skill ups in this manner.  Once again, it is an EXTREMELY boring method.<br />
<br />
Your best method is to go solo dark blue mobs and tank them while killing 'em.  You want the easiest, lightest hitting mobs that con dark blue.  It doesn't matter if they have a gajillion hitpoints or drop nothing.  What you want is a mob that will hit you repeatedly but lightly again and again and again, but also allow itself to be rooted.  (That way you can root it, back off and self-heal.)  NPC's work great for this sometimes, but many have been upgraded so that they hit rather hard and fast, or have friends that will assist them...Neither of those would be good for you. :(<br />
<br />
I'm trying to think of good mobs for you...Maybe the bottomless gnawers in Skyfire?  Or some of the frogs deep in lower guk?  Bah, it has been too long.  Research the 50-60 hunting forums and look at good spots for soloing in your level range.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, find a druid and just go duo somewhere with you tanking.  It will take awhile, but you will get steady skill-ups AND exp at the same time.<br />
<br />
Don't lose hope, but you have an uphill battle ahead of you.  Those 40 points in defense are critical, and should be made up ASAP!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just had this conversation with someone in PoK tonight.  <br />
<br />
Lots of people believe that with the awesome group exp available in some Luclin and PoP zones, there is no reason to ever solo.  But unfortunately, what you end up with is low defensive skills which get harder and harder to raise.  <br />
<br />
But back to the subject at hand... Katta is an AMAZING place to practice your defense at 57-58.  You'd be hard pressed to find anything better.  However, if you prefer to keep your faction safe, you might wanna try the Geo cave in WL (the place you get gems from for the 8th shawl armor), or one of the new higher-level LoY zones, like the Crypt of Nadox.  <br />
<br />
Your best bet is going to be power-gaining your defense skill, unless you plan on soloing for exp in one of these places.  What I would suggest is finding a single blue con near a zoneline, buffing your stats, slowing him, and letting him beat you down while you blow your whole mana bar healing yourself.  When you're at zero mana, simply zone, cann back to full mana, heal up, rinse and repeat.  By doing it this way, you can also be more selective about your target, because you won't be taking faction hits for killing any mobs (even a level 45+ guard in your hometown will work).<br />
<br />
Those 40 points are going to mean the world to you in a few levels.  I would suggest getting it done asap.</div></div><hr />

mobs there will con blue to light blue and they all hit fast but not too hard. The best part however is you will get loot. I soloed there this morning for about 2 hours and walked away with 800 plat. Not too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Obadia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks for the great tips everyone,sounds like there is some hope out there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spiders in Velks might be a good choice for raising defense. They don't hit too hard (unless you get backstabbed) and you'll get some exp for them. There may be easier mobs though. I'm not sure what the underbulks in echo on the side leading to the Deep would con to you. If they're still dark blue, they'd be a good choice. They hit fairly fast but not too hard. Seafuries maybe. That's all I can think of at the moment. Good Luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My experience with trying to raise my defensive skills at level 52 by fighting seafuries constantly was depressing-- maybe 1 skill up every 8-12 hrs. The good side is that I was getting some loot and exp. I suggest finding a good spot to solo where loot is good, hope for the occasional rare skillup, get experience, and use the loot to buy the skillups from a trainer. I have no idea how much it costs to do that. I am at 180 defense right now and will post back when I find out how much one practice point will cost me. Maybe someone else already knows.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rebul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">unfortunately you cannot train defense :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dubarnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">solo gorgana's in ME for the last bubble of ur next few lvls.  I did this from 54-60 (i think my skills were maxed anyways)... but it definately will raise them,give u exp, make u a better player.  Also you can do this any time in the lvl if u can't find a planar group.  Not as good exp, but exp none the less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does the /duel pet method still work?<br />
<br />
Once, you could find a good friend with a dblu or better pet, duel them and fight the pet.<br />
<br />
Best way is to have the owner haste the pet (more hits) and drop his MR so you can get a cripple on it.<br />
<br />
Fight, pause to heal, resume.</div></div><hr />
