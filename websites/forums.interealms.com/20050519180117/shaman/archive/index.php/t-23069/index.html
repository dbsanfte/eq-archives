I having been playing my Wizard on the other box lately, just because it is easy on raids, and crit nukes are alot of fun, even though I don't have nearly all the aa's yet. -edit spelling-</div></div><hr />

<br />
I switched to a Shaman shadowknight combo when it became apparent that Enchanters roles were less crowd control and more buffbots. / Charmfodder with the improvments to lull and singlepulls. <br />
<br />
(yeah the pendulum has swung but I like the dynamic of tank/meele better now It isnt as powerful to a group but Then again I am not crowding out other enchanters either. And My guild finally has a few to use more than once every couple weeks. )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">100 odd aa's, he is a fantastic easy ldon tank, however I have found that in raids, espacially the new raids of high dps low hp mobs meaning rapid action counts, that i **** up tooo much trying to run a tank and a sham.<br />
<br />
Worst stuff up was dotting the wrong mob and nearly wiping the raid. Great thing to do on a raid with a guild you are apping to cause yer last one self destructed 8)<br />
<br />
Tried a monk, but they require a lot of positioning work.<br />
<br />
Tried my friends wizzy, that was good, but added very little to the duo arrangement as a wizzy needs a fair bit of maintenance and so does a sham.<br />
<br />
Didnt want to make a necro, although dou nec/sham in vexd would be awesome xp.<br />
<br />
So i made me a mage.<br />
<br />
Mage dps &gt; sk and the mage pets (51 earth so far) are pretty tough. I understand they start to fall behind post pop2 but I am thinkin i need a 10k tank to tank anything in GoD as my SK get arse raped.<br />
<br />
Mobs that double and quad for 1k are a bit tough on a hybrid tank unless you have very alert healing.<br />
<br />
I want to get the mage to 65 so his pet can tank easy ldons.<br />
<br />
I have found a char that requires little maintenance to put out significant dps is required for a sham as shams need a lot of work cannying etc if they want to put out reasonable dps.<br />
<br />
He is my DPS+ char, send in pet, leave him for a few minutes, nuke once at 50% = ownage.<br />
<br />
Thats my opinion anyway.<br />
<br />
Mind you my friend swears by a bard, he must be ambidextrous or something, as bards are serious wrist work on the twisting songs.<br />
<br />
A chanter is also good. charm kiting if fun. but they also need management when charming.<br />
<br />
PS mage pet puts out more dps than sham pet (51 earth). Tanks better as well against poi mobs.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

3 accounts but stick to 2 boxing **if** I am not grouping/soloing, which is prefered. Also tend to let accounts expire month to month and only re-subscribe if I feel the desire to play the toon. That desire is getting less and less.<br />
<br />
Mix and match as the mood hits me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I usually 3-box with two computers and tend to use 65shm and 65mag on my main puter then either a 65clr, war, or wiz on laptop.  I have a 65 enc for the laptop I could use also but that could get hairy charming :)<br />
<br />
My fiancee will play the clr and wiz on two machines, then I box the war, shm, and mag.  Very easy to run through ldon missions when you have your own group ready to go :)  The war is terribly geared though (6500 buffed hp, 22% haste) so we can't really do much GoD stuff yet but anything Tier3 PoP or lower is cake.<br />
<br />
The only chars I have boxed on a raid though have been the shm+clr and only if the cleric is in the same group and not in a rotation.  Shaman just take too much attention for me to box on a raid :(</div></div><hr />

Since we started playing again last week there hasn't been any multi-boxing going on, but we're enabling all accounts for LDoN, so I'll probably fire up the Cleric and Warrior this weekend to try out a few adventures with my Shaman and wifes Druid. I'll only be 3 boxing now. :)<br />
<br />
Even if the wife decides to revive her Rogue for the adventures, she's already expressed an interest in two-boxing the Druid on her second computer. It's contageous I guess. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've boxed a shaman and warrior for ages.  I like the combo, although I suppose it may lack some versatility vs an sk or ranger or something.  Dual-wielding snare weapons is pretty reliable for getting things snared quickly anyway, although not fool-proof, and you'd be surprised at what you can single pull via line-of-sight/proximity aggro. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Orignally I was a Ranger.  I got tired of the Ranger and started a Shaman on the same account.  I then transferred the Shaman to its own account and became a Ranger/Shaman hydra in the Velious era doing Shaman/Monk as an alternative.  Then I added a third account and powerleved up a Cleric.  Then a friend gave me a 65/220 Enchanter.  Most recently, I moved the monk to its own account.  <br />
<br />
Now it's Ranger/Monk/Enchanter/Cleric/Shaman.  Boxing two melees can be a bit of a challange, but as long as I can find a corner to tank in to get around the push issues, it's not that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sinron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Nice thing about a ranger/shammy cambo is you get more HP buffs and over all better buffs.  Only down side is you need to keep the ranger well geared and aa'ed to be comparable to a SK for tanking..  My Ranger is 4k HP unbuffed and can tank anything Tier 3 without any trouble, but remeber the SK could tank a lot better with comparable gear and aa's :/  But as far as buffing and tools I like the ranger/shammy..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If I was to change my setup today, I would probably have changed the my SHM to Troll so I could get the snare necklace.  This combination has everything I could want (still a little light on healing) except track, snare, and porting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I 2box a monk and shaman, old-school.<br />
<br />
That duo serves my purposes.  Wish I had snare and stun, but that's the only things the duo lacks.  Oh, and I wish the monk had a way to taunt better besides weapon procs.. if I add anyone to my duo and can't find a tank, the monk tanks and he can't keep agro very well for people with itchy nuke-fingers.  The monk tanks fine in places up to and including Tier-3 PoP.  He did require quite bit of decent gear and AA to get to that point, though.<br />
<br />
If I had the resources and time, I'd add a paladin and druid to the mix.  A 4-box of a paladin, shaman, druid, and monk would meet most of my needs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I dual box a 64 Monk from time to time as my signature suggests. Works very well in the old world or on low blues in PoP, not so well in PoP+. Perhaps it will get better once the Monk gets more AAs.<br />
<br />
As most of you know, the main problem with Monk tanking is not that they take too much damage, but rather that they take damage unpredictably. Miss, miss, miss, 57, miss, 266, 266, miss. Not a problem when the enemies' max hit is for &lt;5% of the Monk's buffed HP, but becomes an issue when they grow bigger and meaner. Thanks Cazic for Stonestance, Mend and FD! :)<br />
<br />
I also have a 47 Beastlord and a baby SK on the Monk's account, but they are too young to be effective partners. I'll probably take the SK to MM in a couple of levels and get to max ally with RoS as a fringe benefit.</div></div><hr />

Dont box my pally for raids, just whenI can't seem to find a group, I'll load him up,and go PL him up a little more. EVentually when he's 65, can easily duo HoH or some such for kicks.  picked a plate class, mainly cause of the higher ac, and being a &quot;tank&quot; class, and chose pally out of the 3 plate tanks for the added healing power.</div></div><hr />

For almost anything I do, the paladin can keep up with heals with her sword (procs a group heal, plus a lifetap), and she can group heal and heal over time, and the shaman dots and nukes her heart out.  It's worked well for me. :)</div></div><hr />

I can tank with my shaman, and the dps out of the mage pet is insane with full shaman buffs and mage toys.  And, unlike melee two boxes, I just point the mage pet at the mob and he stays on it...if the mob moves, I don't have to worry about the pet standing still and not doing anything...much easier..<br />
<br />
Oh, and the bombs from the mage himself are nice once the mob starts to turn and walk away....<br />

I used to do Pally as my two box, but no more...a shaman/mage combo is sweet.<br />

Only do more than 6 when tracking something or taking done stuff where the extra dps helps but having to have a solo machine for autofire on the ranger kind of sucks :(<br />

the big winner is no &quot;you cant see your target&quot; etc's<br />
<br />
Big downside i can see is summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
Love the set and forget element.<br />
<br />
Also i didnt know this, but mage pets can root almost anything. even normally unrootable mobs.<br />
<br />
This means mr debuf + mage pet = guarenteed rootage.<br />
<br />
Most fun.<br />
<br />
pet pulling with a mage means you can get anything single, then he can summon a dps pet.<br />
<br />
Having fun so far. I enjoy this more than the SK, i actually get to put out more dps with the sham.<br />

Buffs, tracking, invis, archery, foraging, mastery of almost all weapons are all very nice. But needs a good amount of AAs and/or equipment to be able to surive tougher things.<br />

A slight minus is that both shaman and ranger use the same type of armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most healing i do with shaman is throw a quiessence cause normally i pull with malos or slow so not much time to deal with heals on shaman. Really depends on your style. For me i plan to do higher content with my team as i have other buddies that box as well and we go on rampages of mobs trying to figure out what we can tackle with just us.</div></div><hr />

I love the insta group aspect though and keeps morons out of my groups. <br />
<br />
Speaking of morons... The best was a lvl 63 chanter telling me that Fo7 has FT95 and he was currently at 109mana/tick with KEI + Fo7. Man any jackass can level now... :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necro is amazing as well but dont really start seeing the benefits till later on... strong snares dots FD summon corpse etc... the list goes on<br />
again it depends on your play style in my opinion i think of necros as more of a kiting class and i hate to kite so if i had to pick would prob be mage</div></div><hr />

<br />
snare + many dots + FD = dps the **** out of it and FD and worry bout the sham.<br />
<br />
That and BLIND acts as a fear if no PC's are close to it.<br />
<br />
That means you can still fear kite in pop zones with a necro and a sham.<br />
<br />
Mages are great tooooo, and if you get the mage charm in bot you can clear all of the upper beez with a mage charmed pet.<br />
<br />
However each is situational.<br />
<br />
Necro's in raids usually need to pump mana to clerics which required concentration.<br />
<br />
Shamans need to conentrate to put out dps so necro + sham in raids is hard.<br />
<br />
Mages just send in pet and blow chit up. therefore in a raid situation they are better.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would have to go mage + sham for raiding and necro + sham for xp'n.<br />
<br />
Note the necro/sham for xp'n is by a significantly large margin.<br />
<br />
But we are social creatures us human beans, and at the end of the day, being desired is better.<br />

<br />
I'm gonna say a qualified &quot;no&quot; but it's darned close. Necros have unreal mana regen and eventually that turns the table vis-a-vis DPS.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - Mages crank out serious DPS and I've seen them solo stuff which, at the time, made me scratch my head and ask, &quot;How can you solo that unslowed?&quot;<br />
<br />
But, I've said this before and I'll say it again - Necros can do EVERYTHING (*) but tank - and they have the Pet for that.<br />
<br />
(*) Everything defined as:<br />
<br />
Mez - yes<br />
Charm - yes<br />
Heal - yes<br />

DOT - yes<br />

<br />
Oh, and grouped with a Necro who periodically soloed the named in a Hard LDON. (Guk)<br />

Personally I think it depends on your playstyle. I like Necros better, but Mages are nothing to sniff at.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">but necro's put out more dps over time.<br />

Necros and shamans are both ballanced towards long fights.<br />
<br />
Mages in LDON's rock 8)<br />
<br />
Necro's suffer from the sham problem of when a mob dies in 30 seconds the dots havent even begun to kick in.<br />
<br />
Not sure wether the pendulum would swing back the necro way on hard ldons though, never done a hard with a necro.<br />
<br />
Mind you if you want to root rot necro ans sham are very powerfull.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">necro + sham.. is that considered &quot;easy&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Mainly cause you can load up the dots then FD and concentrate on one char.<br />
<br />
However when raiding they need to be alert cause they tend to have to mana pump the clerics.<br />
<br />
Dot Chars need to watch for dots wearing off though, so its not as easy as a nuker.<br />
<br />
Clerics are great for botting cause they have significant periods of innactivity. However they do stuff all dps so arent great as a duo additive.<br />
<br />
However when you have a sham/cleric you never duo, people chase you down the moment you log on and offer you all sorts of fun groups.<br />
<br />
I had a ball when i ran my 65 sham/cleric for a while b4 my friend wanted his cleric back *sniff*<br />
<br />
But..... when the sheeet hits the fan, clerics and shams are active at the same time. Therefore you cant handle really out of control situations as well as two single botted chars, and you own all the keep alive responsability, which can be a drag sometimes, especially if you group with wankers who feel their job is to instruct you on when and where to heal.<br />
<br />
But thats not usually an issue with cleric/sham combo cause you develop a good tight group of friends very very quickly who make it there job to keep you adequately amused. They know you dual box and know and accept your limits.<br />
<br />
Some people are real wankers when i comes to dual boxin. Me and my friend both dual box, me sk/sham him wizzy/cleric. We often do 4 char ldons and finish in about 40 minutes, but multi boxin is very prescriptive, ie there is a formula that you use so every knows what to cast when and deviation from it can be hard.<br />
<br />
And although ive only struck it once, some morons get ****ty when they realise you are dual boxin.<br />
<br />
I tend to be very up front about it and force people to accept that they know and accept this up front.<br />
<br />
Mainly cause you move slower trying to control two chars then one.<br />
<br />
I event had a couple of wankers decide to /q in 10 mins into and adv when they found out me and my friend were dual boxing. At that point I realised you need a &quot;no dont give the moorons the points&quot; option for LDONS. *grumble*<br />
<br />
Mind you we did just loose the cleric cause one of the tossers wouldnt mezz the mob beating on him *sheesh* probably tooo busy bitching with his mate at that point.<br />
<br />
Anyway with a decent tank these days you dont need a cleric to heal ldons. So we finished it on three toons till we got around to running the cleric back. (he was in the adv for 5 mins before we completed it)<br />
<br />
Needless to say, these two wankers are on me and my friends &quot;dont group&quot; list. <br />
<br />
Funny how some people just dont realise you reap what you sow.<br />
<br />
Whilst this is all off the point, Cleric is a great second box aditive, but a bitch to PL cause they do so little damage.<br />
<br />
With the zoning pets thing now though dogdog + epic + shaman buffies now can be faster than a druid if yer near a zone (*hint*)<br />
<br />
Once you get to lvl 46 he hits pop and accellerates no drama.<br />
<br />
Necro is not as desired for raids and groups, but puts out more dps so is a better partner for when you are feeling antisocial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">box a 65 pally with my 65 shaman....only issue i have with 2 boxing a tank is trying to gear the tank...when you have a shaman main on raids most guilds don't let you bid for your twinks over other mains.  honestly the tank needs to be better geared than the shaman....so like i said, i find it hard to keep the pally geared in suitable gear for tanking god mobs + some pop stuff.<br />

recently post pop everyone and their mother started a shaman/sk box<br />

but with GoD sks suck worse than any class other than zerker<br />

seems like not only does sony hate shaman, they hate us so much even ancillary classes associated with people who PLAY shaman get hit<br />
<br />
so I gotta say... goddamit shaman.  stop hurting innocent other classes<br />
<br />
say NO to boxing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">unless you're one armed, old, or suck at computer games 2 boxing isn't in any way limiting.<br />
<br />
you can 2 box ANY class without any loss of efficiency if you are any good at boxing.  for years I've boxed a shaman and bard.  I'll be honest, it's true that I'm smarter than any of you but my coordination isn't above average but even I can twist 4 songs and fully heal/slow/root/sic dog/cure disease or twist 3 songs and mez and do above any differently than playing 1 character... you can even autocircle and kite on one char and run around independently on the other.... of course many people macro **** but it's not requisite to do anything more than set up in-game hotkeys<br />
<br />
many people 3 box and you'd never notice it<br />
<br />
therefore, you should pick the 2 classes you like to play rather than think about what's easy... it's a surer bet to burn out if you do otherwise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Two boxin reduces your reaction time, cause you need to react in both places at once.<br />
<br />
To say it makes no difference is really hard to justify.<br />
<br />
Not unless someone has half the reaction time and double the ability to make decisions and control those decision.<br />
<br />
Something that would be extreemely unlikely.<br />
<br />
Let alone the difficulties involved in trying to move two chars at once.<br />
<br />
However the previous poster that boxin sucks mainly because in every guild I have been in alts only get stuff if no mains want it.<br />
<br />
Because tanks are very very gear dependent, that means they get nadda, so they fall behind in the tanking game very quickly, dont get flags and become a problem.<br />
<br />
My 100AA sk gets arse raped in anything harder than the crematorium adv in GoD even after I burned a million LDONS and got him full ornate or Tak plate in every visible slot (sans bracers, cultural are as good). 1600 ac and 7.5k buffed all mitigation aa's and still gets his jiggers handed him on a plate.<br />
<br />
He recieve 0 loot (nada, nothing zip) even after 6 months of raiding to get my sham EP flagged. The guild even refused to give him a rotting 2hs when he got flagged in on a water raid. cause he didnt have the DKP cause he never got raided in cause no one needs an extra tank and he was an alt and was always the first char dumped from the raid when a cleric needed to be flagged in.....<br />
<br />
Not that I dissagree with thier decision on dumping him, he was not really usefull and divided my attention so i went from slowing and buffing everything automajically to worrying about positioning my tank so I could go back to the sham and do his job without him dying the instant enrage hit, or pulling agro of the MT or hitting the wrong target, or pushing the mob in the wrong direction.<br />
<br />
I dissagree with not even giving him a rotting 2hs, thats just stupid, but i spose thats one of the reasons I stopped raiding, no matter what guild your in there is always a number of lootz whores that bitch and moan about every single loot decision ever made untill such time as people are afraid to make a decision for fear of having to waste the next 4 hours in tells explaining why X person got it and not Y or Z.<br />
<br />
The main mitigator to that is if you are a DPS class or a healer (read wizzy or cleric) Because they stack on raids and are needed. Main clerics are just as rare as hens teeth.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine used to dual box two clerics.......<br />
<br />
Now wasnt HE in demand 8)<br />
<br />
Once again, clerics are very hard to beat as alts, no dps but by jeesus they get you places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">it would seem pretty boring lvling up the same char twice :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">As any caster, every time you cast a spell you cannot cast another spell for at least 2.5 seconds.  Clickies and other things may change things, but shaman are not know for fast casting spells or clickies.<br />
<br />
This means that for 90%+ of the time, a shaman is sitting there doing nothing.  It does not take a ton of talent to use that 90% of the time to direct the actions of another character (In fact, after 2boxing for so long, I find playing a single character to be mind numbingly boring).  <br />
<br />
For most of the day to day grind activities, this is 100% adequate.  However, there are times such as a &quot;run to zone line&quot;, or &quot;mobs attacking both toons at once &quot;where the 90% inactive rule fails, and when that happens the 2boxer is at a big disadvantage.  Conversly there are times when a 2boxer is actually at an advantage due to having control of two characters, such as timing an invis to land on the chanter less than half a second before the chanters mez lands on his pet.<br />
<br />
For raids, I pre-announce which one toon I plan to roll with and I stick with that.  I'm not in an end game guild, so I can't speak to the loot policies other than to say the only problem I ever had was from a guy who brought his SK to roll on the haste belt from the kithkor general... few months later he brought his bard to roll on rumblecrush's plate... few months later he had a vindi raid wait on him to race his lil shaman there in case the chain dropped...  needless to say my guild didn't give his complaints a lot of weight.<br />
<br />
I've recently started 3boxing... its much tougher than 2boxing, but I love playing different classes and I'm patient enough that I don't care if I don't get to the end game two expansions (or more) later.  My army of alts will prevail :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">But i also find with a sham that if you really want to get the best out of them you need to canni a lot and cast a lot, so you are in fact very rarely not casting something.<br />

I get by with a few scripts, but my dps doubles when I run my sham only.<br />

Thats why I cant dual box a hard ldon or a trial, or I dont like to. Sometimes people want me to so i can pull and slow but i try to avoid it.</div></div><hr />

Depending on what is needed typically.  As far as the whole loss of efficiency goes, there is no doubt in my mind that I am not as efficient as I could be as a Rogue but that is because I think of Gargas as a little dot.  Keep him to the side till after I've got all the mobs slowed and keep folks healed up and alive and then when I am sure my main job is done, I'll start tearing it up with them daggers!  Biggest thing though is that like folks have said, once you start casting what do you need to look at your screen for?  Typically the mob is incoming I'll start casting malos, while that is casting I'll get Garg into position, w/o looking at the other computer I'll slap my slow hot key as I'm still working BS and evade.  Using F# and hot keys I've had tons of folks not know that I'm boxing because my chars appear to be doing stuff at the same time.  <br />

<br />
Reason is with necro + shammy, u can almost do all the things that any 2 toon can do, with following benifits :<br />
(1) FD pull or FD pet pull.<br />
(2) Snare<br />
(3) Rez<br />
(4) mez<br />
(5) corpse summon<br />
<br />
In terms of flexibility , necro really like a swiss army knife and pss , better than shammy:P<br />
<br />
Only downside, is u need to do more work to get the best benefit out from both toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Mage: - Bonus Malo, means you can cast slow earlier on yer sham, thereby reducing dps of the mob quicker.<br />
<br />
You can also send you pet in to act as a barrier to an incoming mob till slow pull the agro off them and they get to your tank.<br />
<br />
For mages pets are cheap.<br />
<br />
Duo + good, mage pet pulling makes pulling easy. DPS is good, set and forget dps is great, but no snare.<br />
Group + excellent, Can work sham and basically use mage pet and nuke when shamans work is done.<br />
Raid + excellent, timing malos and slow will save you much mana and allow you to be more efficient.<br />
<br />
Pet kits and decent pet dps means you will contribute significantly on the rapid clearing phase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Necro: - Bonus snare, FD + Rezz (raid saver) and great killing potential.<br />
<br />
Duo + excellent, about the best duo for xp per hour.<br />
Group + very good, snare and pet add great dps and security.<br />
Raid + good, necro dmg is slow to build hence not great in clearing phase, but the use of FD on boss fights allows you to stack a huge number of dots without worrying about agro.<br />
<br />
Beastlord: - Bonus buffs, slow, great dps pet, raid desired buffs.<br />
<br />
Duo + very good, slowing with the BL while you malo with the sham means early slows. Pet snare aa means boog runner control.<br />
Group + good, Melle dps from the BL means much time spent positioning to get maximum effect, however stackability of buffs contribute significantly.<br />
Raid + very, pet adds good dps, timing slows and malos is a great bonus<br />
<br />
Enchanter: - Bonus mind buffs, slows, fantastic pet dps when charmin, very desired in raids.<br />
<br />
Duo + Excellent, Crowd control rocks. Charming is just insane. tash compliments malo, stunns means pet can tank just dandy.<br />
GRoup + Excellent, same as above except mana regen significantly increases group dps.<br />
Raid + Excellent, massive dps with charmed pets (if somewhat tricky to control) and crowd management (chanter mezzes, you slow and malos, and point the tank at the right mob)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Vanexx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">My shammy is my two box...my main is a necro..once you learn the classes, its not that much work to box both. Hotkeys/macros are your friends.<br />
Being solo gods, any class combined with a necro is a dynamite combo. There are no regular xp zones in the game that we can't succeed in. Mages are great dps and can have great tanking pets, but too many limitations (no 'natural' snare, no get out of jail card besides gate, no self healing, an inability to handle multiple mobs). Mages are also mana limited to enchanter buffs and their own mod rods, since the death of pet canni as they once knew it. Necro is nonstop killing in any number of ways (charm, kiting, fearkiting at lower levels, summon kiting, root/rotting, ToM-tanking). And a necro tanks better than any other Int-class due to runes/aggro-holding/lifetaps/natural propensity of necros to chase hps over other stats.<br />
<br />
Actually, with my necro, my shammy is actually ...DPS as much as anything. Slow and then dot/nuke. NO fear of aggro being taken.<br />
<br />
Another benefit of the grouping: Charming. Yes, not at many zones as an enchanter of course, but a good number of zones are availiable. And malo (when you get that level) is perfect for extending the duration of our charms.<br />
<br />
Only things this combo doesn't have are ports and tracking, but hell, who needs those these days. PoK for getting around and a necro is second only to rogue (and sometime better than) in scouting and getting places.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">If your actually up to Elemental level mobs or GoD zones where the mobs are hitting over 600+ you or the necro will tank...treat the pets as a continous dot. They will never keep agro with the DPS you will need to sustain to make exp efficient enough. In the lower lvls 50-60 sure..or you can fear kite with the necro and load up the dots as well. <br />
<br />
90 percent of my time grinding AA's at the lvl 65 level was spent agro kiting and pouring on the dots. No tanking just run around till the snared mob dies. When I went to the sewers and Duo'ed with my shaman I would Tank with the necro no problems but keep in mind at this stage both characters were some what time geared.<br />
