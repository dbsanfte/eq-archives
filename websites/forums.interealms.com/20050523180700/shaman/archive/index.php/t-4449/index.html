<br />
i dont know why , bu the AC isnt right , im positive unbuffed i have like 710 AC<br />
<br />
<br />
but can you think of any reachable upgrades ? im not ready to dump 50k on a cloak , so you can skip those =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Things I would go with:<br />
6/65 rings on both fingers. (~500pp)<br />
Tattered mantle  (12 ac 20 hp) shoulder (~200pp)<br />
Slime covered rubicite coif from CT (16 ac 65 hp, 6 agi, 4 fr/cr) (4-5k)<br />
Earrings, either get jewelry made black sapphire ones (25hp/mana, 2 ac i think), or any of the 3 from chardok, generally sell for 500-1k, stats 2 ac 35hp/mana, 1 wis, and have fun effects, scale of wolf, cure disease, cure poison, very handy)<br />
<br />
If you don't have much money i'd work on rings/earrings first.  You'd lose 14 wis, but gain up to 200 hp (180 w/ bs ears), and 10 raw ac (about 15 noticeable).<br />
<br />
Other than those, work on getting some PoG or Thurgadin quest armors, they'll upgrade most of your stuff with a pretty nice ac/wis/hp balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow.  This one is almost too easy.  :)<br />
<br />
Ears: Imbued Golden Ivory Earring (cheap- under 100 pp, maybe much less if you provide the ivories- and a great combination of AC and WIS.)  You could probably break even on this one.<br />
<br />
Face: Arctic Wyvern Mask. You get a nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask, for just a few hundred pp (or less- I see these in the bazaar for 50 pp sometimes.)  You should make money on this.<br />
<br />
Neck:  Fine.  Keep your eyes open for a Crystalline Torque.  10% less mana on all spells = good.<br />
<br />
Head: Get a JB helm.  You'll gain 15 raw AC in exchange for 6 Wisdom.  It's a good trade.  The JB helm should set you back a couple hundred pp.<br />
<br />
Wrist: If you DoT much, you might want to swap out the supple scale bracer for a Chipped Bone Bracelet (CBB) (with the CBB you get &quot;Affliction Efficiency II&quot; - which will cause all DoTs under level 45 to cost 25% less mana to cast.)  Bracers are a tough slot to upgrade economically... supple scale isn't great but it's okay.<br />
<br />
Arms:  Fine<br />
<br />
Hands:  Fine.  Upgrades are Coldain gloves or Crystal chitin gloves, but these will each set you back a few k, and what you've got now is good enough.<br />
<br />
Fingers:  6/65 rings<br />
<br />
Shoulder: Tattered mantle (100 pp or so, maybe less.) <br />
<br />
Chest:  Fine<br />
<br />
Back:  Fine.  You AC/HP upgrade is the Ancient Seahorse cloak (ac 20, +25 hp) but it's at least a few k... and it looks like you want to maintain a wis/AC balance... so what you've got is okay.<br />
<br />
Waist:  Look for a cheap Chitinous belt (ac 13, +5 wis, lots of other stats).  Flayed turmoil belts are really cheap now, too... same with smiter's girdles.  <br />
<br />
Legs:  Tough spot to upgrade, especially on a budget.  Kylong legs (ac 16) are more available then they used to be, and make a nice choice.  Jarsath legs are the freebie choice, but not so easy to come by (drop in Karnors basement and NO DROP.)<br />
<br />
Boots:  JB boots will only set you back a few hunderd pp, will provide a nice raw AC bump, and will give you right-click Nimble.  Worth having.<br />
<br />
Range:  There are some nice AC range items worth looking into.  I use a Stone Idol (no drop from the 4-arms camp in Maiden's Eye, ac 5, +8 wisdom, +15 magic.)  Even a goranga idol (couple hundred pp) gives nice AC.<br />
<br />
Weapon / Shield:  Fine<br />
<br />
I think the most bang for the buck looks like this- in order:  Head, Face, Feet, Range, Right ear, Rings, Legs<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
