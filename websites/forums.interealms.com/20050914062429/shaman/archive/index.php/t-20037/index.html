<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Somehow, I have managed to stumble into a *great* guild and we are dangerously close to Sol Ro's Tower.  Yes, the content is 2 expansions old but the EPs are a place I never thought I would visit. :)<br />
<br />
So I've started researching the zone a bit and I'm wondering if SRT is anything special - Is it just another step on the march to the EPs or is it a 'plateau' where a guild might raid again and again (and again) for gear?<br />
<br />
Worded differently:  Should I be searching for quite a few gear upgrades in the Tower or are the EP's so close behind that I shouldn't worry about it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any comments / observations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good question.  I'm in the same situation, and am looking forward to the answers from those who've been there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cebilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Solro is damn good xp for a start - and Ornate drops fairly frequently (in my experience about 1 piece an hour or so) from trash mobs.<br />
<br />
As far as raiding in there goes treat it like BoT towers - Jiva, Xuzl, Rizlona, and Arlixir, while a bit tougher than the BoT tower bosses are easy enough with 3+ groups (4+ groups for Rizlona, thats a fairly tough dragon) and drop at a minimum 2 pieces of good loot. One Xuzl raid netted my guild 5 pieces of ornate from trashmobs, and 2 good items from Xuzl himself. Personally I think Xuzl is the easiest boss here, and should be the one you aim for first. Xuzl also has a fairly cool shield that I was lucky to win:<br />

Long range bump. :D <br />
I just became flagged for Sol Ro last night after my umpteenth Pick-up Bert raid actually won. :)   I am the ONLY person in my guild flagged to enter the zone - nobody else in my small guild family is even close. :( <br />
<br />
1) Can someone give me some tips or recommendations on what I could/should conceivably do in the zone SOLO or in a single group (pick-up) format?  2)I already regularly solo in Tier 3 (BoT/HoH/Tactics), could I extend my hunting grounds to Sol Ro safely when I'm alone?<br />
<br />
3)Aside from Ornate drops, is there any other tradable loot that I could hunt down to help out my guildmates who can't zone in?<br />
<br />
Any advice/recommendations appreciated. :cool: <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You wont be able to solo it.<br />
<br />
In a group... do what you normally do. Slow, buff, debuff, afk, root park, etc.<br />
<br />
As for loot.. ornate, that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I'm in the same situation that you are, Frekkels.  I'm sol Ro flagged, and no one else in my guild is even close.<br />
<br />
Sol Ro is a great zone in my opinion.  The mobs are tough, but not ridiculously hard, just hard enough to make you think about what you're doing (not like flopping through a normal LDoN while yawning), at least at my gear level(might be boring for time/GoD geared people, but no uber gear here).  <br />
<br />
The mobs have resists like you'd expect in a fire zone, high fire, low cold.  Also, their poison resist is a little high.  Not too bad after malos, but still expect an occasional resist.  They also have large aggro ranges, so watch yourself.<br />
<br />
The best news, though, is that they are relatively low in the MR department, and are fully slowable.  Since most of the pulls in this zone are pretty long, I tend to malos on inc anyway since I can still get slow to land before the mob hits camp...but it's not needed on about 70% of the mobs, from my experience.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, until you're pretty seriously equipped (4500-5K unbuffed) you can't really think about soloing, as the mobs in Sol Ro summon.  They are, however, fully slowable, and easy enough to single pull with someone that can lull or FD.<br />
<br />
If you get a group (more about this later), it's pretty straight forward.  You group up at the zone in, get buffed, decide roles, and head in like any other xp zone.  The mobs hit harder than tier 3, but not enough to change your tactics like GoD mobs.  I've offtanked here when I had to, though it's a bit tense when I have to. ;)<br />
<br />
As you zone in, be sure to stay close to the wall nearest the GY (behind you when you Zone in) until you are ready to move.  There are 2 wanderers that roam through the area, and with the huge aggro range of mobs in this zone, they can aggro pretty easily if you're not tucked back close to that wall.<br />
<br />
From the zone in, you can head either left or right, it doesn't matter which way, as they both lead to the same main hall in the middle at the top.  I recommend clearing at least one, if not both of these wanderers before moving to the stairs, to avoid adds later.<br />
<br />
Once you choose a direction, there will be 2 mobs at the archway into the tunnel (left or right), where you can see the base of the stairs.  Split these, and the mobs inside, pulling them back to the zone in.  Slaughter them and move to camp at the base of the stairs.<br />
<br />
Have your puller split the mobs at the top of the stairs and drag them down to you.  Singles or pairs are fine, the mobs are mezzable, and can be kited as long as you don't injure them to induce their summoning.   After clearing the top landing (and inside the archway, carefully), proceed up to the top.  Once there, you should be able to CAREFULLY make your way into the center room between the two staircases.  Make sure to stick to the wall!  This is very important, as I've said, the mobs have large aggro ranges, and you can easily drag a mob or three onto your party while getting into position.<br />
<br />
Once in the middle of the wall, facing the two sets of stairs...you're in  probably the most common position to grind.  This will allow you to pull the spawns from the top of both staircases, from the main room between them where you're camping, and from each of the lower towers (up each set of stairs in front of you).<br />
<br />
The drops for ornate are very streaky, as has been said, but they do drop, and with enough frequency to make it worth the time camping, especially since the xp here is pretty good.  <br />
<br />
As was mentioned, the fire elementals seem to drop ornate SLIGHTLY more often than the giants, but the xp isn't as good, and they have a nasty DS (it can be dispelled, or removed with MoK).  Usually in a good group, we'll end up pulling most of the giants in reasonable reach, then moving to some elementals while waiting for repop.  The zone repop is about 45 minutes, if I'm not mistaken.<br />
<br />
This upper area supports 2 groups fairly easily, more than that and it gets a little sparse...<br />
<br />
Now, on to the problems you'll face...<br />
<br />
The biggest one?  Finding a group.<br />
<br />
It's extremely hard to find a group for the higher end zones just by putting up LFG.  I know Frekkels personally, and I know you have lots of friends in the high end, so it may not be as much trouble for you, but don't expect to find a group just LFG in Sol Ro.  It's a BYoG kinda zone.  :-/<br />
<br />
Other than that, be careful, have fun, enjoy exploring and getting that sweet xp. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the great info Zorash. :) <br />
Are the mobs rootable?  I didn't get a chance to check.<br />
I was debating whether to solo one today when I got aggroed (while invis, which of course I know now is worthless) by a guard.  You weren't kidding about that aggro radius!  Didn't get Malos in, and 2 resisted slows later I was back in Plane of Tranquility - naked. :p   That coupled with the 700 hits and no means of exiting the zone except gate (which I almost never mem) rules out soloing there for me.   I'm thinking I could probably duo there with a monk or knight class if we were careful though.<br />
<br />
Sadly, most of those higher end friends I have are usually raiding, but I do have a few of them who are willing to show me around a bit.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Immune to Root.  <br />
<br />
Duoing with a knight is super easy.<br />
<br />
Mob Aggro Range = 200 - the same as most of our spell range, any extended range item will let you cast on them from outside of spell range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ack!  Sorry Frekkels, I didn't mean to leave out the see-invis part &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Too much info, I knew I'd leave some out *sigh*.<br />
<br />
Yes, the mobs see invis...so no invis scouting.  They are NOT rootable, either.  Even if they were, you couldn't rot since they summon.  But no, can't park adds either.  This is why I mentioned you can kite them as long as they're not damaged.  I should have specifically mentioned that they are un-rootable, though.  <br />
<br />
Also, the tip about ER4 is crucial.  Sorry about that, left that out too.  Their aggro range is about the max distance of most of our spells, so get your extended range item handy too.<br />
<br />
I fully agree about xuzl, if you can get a few groups, the shield is awesome.  I've wanted it for some time now (and the hammer and gloves, too!), but don't have the raid force flagged to do him :(.<br />
<br />
About duoing, yes, you can certainly duo there with a knight if you have a well equipped knight friend.  Pulling would be a pain though.  If you had a knight and a monk, or a knight and a cleric, you'd be set.  <br />
<br />
My  semi-usual group makeup for Sol Ro has been cleric (sometimes 2, one outside group), warrior, sk, monk, ench, shm (me).  This group does pretty well there.  The cleric normally pulls (ER4 + cha buff + lull) as it's faster than splitting with those huge aggro ranges.<br />
<br />
After the pull it's pretty straight forward, I won't presume to tell you how to fight a mob in a group :p<br />
<br />
Oh, and personally, as a rule, I never zone into Sol Ro without a fresh sow up and Gate memmed.  Twice now I've zoned in to someone trying to run from a bad pull, dragging mobs right towards the zone in.  One time I was actually able to save the poor soul, healed them, stole aggro and kited for a few while they used a gate potion, then gated myself.  It saved my life to have gate pre-memmed.  Once inside I drop it if the coast is clear ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you have any other questions, feel free to ask. I'll see if I can think of any more info.  I hate leaving the important stuff (see invis..duh) out.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting,<br />

Thanks for the additional info Zorash.  :cool: <br />
All my uber knight buddies seem to be chained to KodTaz (sp?) lately.<br />
All my normal knight buddies aren't flagged, lol.<br />
<br />
I was really hoping to get in there this weekend, but didn't get a chance, so ended up back in my old standby - Tactics. :D  I'll kill some stuff in Sol Ro someday soon though! ;)  I would love that shield.  :)  I've been alternating between a Bulwark and an old NToV shield (100hp &amp; nothing else on it really) for awhile now, and both are sorely in need of being replaced. :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm toting a bulwark too, unfortunately.  Not a bad shield, but definitely needs replacing.  I'd really like the shield of ssra ( off HP, I believe) for the hp/mana/ft6 (yes, six), or the barrier off of MB for the 100hp/mana/MP4(hate the stats on ornate boots...).  The circular shield of the blaze wouldn't be half bad though ;)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately these things are all raid mobs, and I don't do much of that anymore it seems.  Hopefully I'll get a shot at one eventually.  Until then, it's the old stand-by. :cool:<br />
<br />
Happy hunting,<br />

In can be easily done duo with a decently equipped (VT ish) monk as well.  Always a good plan to gear up dog with mage toys for this as well (every little bit helps!)  Just remember to pack a few gate potions along for your monk friend though because...well...as we all know monks are not too bright :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I'm with you on the &quot;never say never&quot; bit, powah.  I didn't mean to make it sound like it's impossible to solo sol ro.  I remember clearly reading posts here about people from these boards doing exactly that.<br />
<br />
What I said was, I didn't believe it would be a viable alternative to soloing Tactics until the shaman in question's gear was of a certain level, and even then, probably not as beneficial.<br />
<br />
While I may be able to take down a single guard, I would most likely be pretty drained after doing so (even if I had EB/ET/EP boots like you).  While this is a great feat, and fun no doubt, I wouldn't say it is an alternative to the near constant killing of Tactics that Frekkels is speaking of replacing.<br />
<br />
The other big problem, even for those that are far better equipped than I, is splitting the arch mobs, like you mentioned.  This is, of course, possible by multiple means...just a little tricky, and most dangerous (pull getting 2, run to ZI, root one, gate, heal, zone back in, fight rooted mob who you hope has remained rooted at ZI...rinse, repeat).  Still not providing a realistic or profitable, in xp or loot, unless you are extremely lucky on ornate drops, alternative to soloing Tactics or the like.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info though, I think I may have to go give it another shot, especially after the Q upgrade.  I came close last time, but didn't have many buffs other than my own (just virtue). ;)<br />
<br />
Be well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">1) Can someone give me some tips or recommendations on what I could/should conceivably do in the zone SOLO or in a single group (pick-up) format?  2)I already regularly solo in Tier 3 (BoT/HoH/Tactics), could I extend my hunting grounds to Sol Ro safely when I'm alone?<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt you could solo here - many if not all the mobs are immune to root, so you will need to tank these mobs.  Also, they have a HUGE aggro radius, so expect to have adds.  Your best bet is to duo here - a class that can FD would be good, and I would stay close to ZI.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, it is bring your own group type of zone.  Occassionally, I saw people looking for a replacement in Sol Ro, but it is a rare event - at least to me.  I normally did not see too many groups xping here when I was on Karana.  Usually people would work there way to the main hallway up to Sol Ro's Chamber and camp at the bottom of the stairs.<br />
<br />
Also, all/most of the mobs see through invis, so this is not an option either to go to camps.<br />
<br />
Lastly, there is no exit here, so you will need to gate out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hail powa~prophet, <br />
<br />
Our gear and AA progression are relatively close.  You have better foci, I have ~40 more aa's.  Raid buffed I hit 6300hp, but I'm generally soloing at 5900-6k if I stop off in PoK beforehand.  I'm interested in hearing what piece of gear you have that gives you &quot;Knight's Blessing&quot;  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1389&amp;source=Live), as I understood that to be Pally only.  Maybe you meant Marr's Blessing, a pretty uber 10% upgrade in focii beyond  IH4?  I'd love to see your Magelo. :) <br />
<br />
While I'm sure if I worked at it I could probably successfully take down a guard or 2-3 in Sol Ro, the potential payoff isn't worth the risk to me right now.  As Zorash said, it isn't so much that I consider soloing there impossible, as just not being very practical.  For similar reasons I don't try soloing in Vex Thal or Sleeper's Tomb even though I can enter both zones.  I am not desperate for Ornate for myself (have all the pieces I want), so the lure of possibly getting it isn't tremendous for me.  Don't misunderstand me, I'd love to get more ornate for my friends, but I don't need to be trying to do it alone. :) <br />
<br />
Sol Ro seems to me much the way Tactics was when I first started hunting there (it isn't as bad anymore in Tactics, frequently there will be a cleric in zone now) - Bring your own group, bring your own rezzer.  I don't want to have to beg for a half dozen rezzes per session as I learn the exact pecularities of guard pathing, aggro radius, and safe spots in Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
Invis'ing won't help me learn the zone (will just get me killed), and there is no evacuation route for me other than casting Gate (bleh :mad: ).  The idea of fighting at the zone-in is anathema to me, as I don't like to cause other people aggravation when they zone in due to my actions.  Most of my cleric friends aren't flagged for Sol Ro, and the ones that can go there are generally in raid intensive guilds where they can't just drop everything to come click their fluff-for-brains furry bear friend who died yet AGAIN in Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
I'm more than up for a challenge, but doing this all alone would be setting myself up for frustration in my opinion.  I am very eager to duo, trio, or single group anything in there so I can learn - but soloing there doesn't seem smart for me right now.  If I had access to a Sol Ro flagged cleric any time I wanted, I might feel differently. ;) <br />
<br />
Thanks for you inputs Korelen and Zorash. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>arfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">There is tons of really great advice here. Just a couple of thigs to add.<br />
<br />
I join in the feeling that though it is possible to solo here, it is not profitable. This zone works best if you think of it in terms of great experience and relative common drops of ornate. Certainly more ornate per hour than BoT.<br />
<br />
I usually rely on a guild group, that takes a short time to put together. I like very much to have an enchanter for cc and a group porter to make it easy and cheap for everyone else. The selling points to get people to come are the xp and ornate only, so it is hard to convince people to forgo xp in elementals to do sol ro.<br />
<br />
It is pretty easy for anyone to pull if you have a chanter(who can get a mephit pet on the second level as well) and with a good tank any other members will make a great group. If stuff goes bad, there is even more reason for wiz/druid. Since repop is 45 min, you can often run directly back to where you were after exedus.<br />
<br />
If 1 or 2 groups are farming, there is no down time.<br />
<br />
I pulled for my group (War,War,Shami,Chanter,Cleric,Beast) last night. Never got more than three. group was never in jeapordy. BTW I find that slow will almost always hit without malos, but I pull with malos from habit anyways. In three hours we got two pieces of ornate. Not unusual for me.<br />
<br />
We usually find that people get burnt out on this zone pretty fast, as it is relativly boring farming unless you are after the minis. <br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy it.<br />

Just thought I'd follow up with my soloing experience in Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
After the responses to this post, I decided to give it another shot.<br />
<br />
I pulled with malos, landed slow, alphad/buffed dog dog went in and promptly saw his rear, laid in a couple dots, called the wolf pack and set to work.  I kept Q up the entire time for healing, and ended up tossing in 2 tnarg's at different spots.<br />
<br />
If I had a decent melee weapon (sharkspine or the like) I probably could have dropped him considerably faster.  I also didn't make the best selection in dots, I'd fix that for next time.<br />
<br />
With my buffs and virtue, no mana regen buff, I managed to drop a protector without too much trouble.  I was nearly out of mana by the end (was using blood/bane/epic, I would use much more efficient dots if I were to do it again) but he went down without getting me below about 40% health (right after Canni V).<br />
<br />
So yes, definitely doable without EP gear, definitely fun, but definitely not as profitable in xp or loot as Tactics. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the inspiration to try it, I'm happy to have knocked one out ;)<br />
<br />
Be well,<br />

I zoned into Sol Ro last night after dropping MM with 60 people.  Never thought I would be here but looking forward to raids on the mini's and picking up a few excellent SHM items.  <br />
<br />
Other than the shield, any suggestions on gear to look for that drop in Sol Ro?  I'll be picking through Alla's this week but if anyone has a few suggestions it would be appreciated.<br />
