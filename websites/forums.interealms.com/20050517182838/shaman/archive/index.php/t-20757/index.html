<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LilGnomeLovin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is the scenario.<br />
<br />
I am currently leveling a mage I started a few weeks ago.  I was planning on then PLing a shaman up to dou with the mage.  This duo wont see anything higher then Velious gear I would think since I solo so much.  But then came the problem....<br />
<br />
I began to think about perhaps a bard as a partner over the shaman.  Never playing either I come here for help.  Now both can slow/heal/buff to some degree or the other. Bard can snare and can charm for added dps.  Troll shaman can snare and pets dont seem to equal a bard pet generally although charming is always more dangerous of course.  Bard can even mez where as a shaman can only root/tank the adds.<br />
<br />
Given that type of scenario what do you think?  Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 boxing a bard would be nuts, bards require constant keyboard spam to do anything.</div></div><hr />

Duo'ing two casters is kinda, well, nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LilGnomeLovin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The idea being whatever 'other' class I use would be played as 'main' and then just bot the mage for the pet tank and his nukes.  <br />
<br />
Wouldnt that make the most sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Melee.  Definitely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Best partner for a mage is another pet class. BST by far. Its take less &quot;attention&quot; than a well plays shaman does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I duo often with a mage, and I have to agree with lanolar.<br />
<br />
A second Pet class would be best, and I suspect a BL would be better than a shaman. Since the mage is offensively minded a class with more defense would be the best. I'd pick a BL over a shaman because the BL would not require the constant input that a shaman does (but you may be a more skillful 2 boxer than I am).  I'd want more healing per second than a bard could provide.  If you have bad pulls and need a mezzer, well the pets are good sacrifices until gate goes off.<br />
<br />
A mage+bard would be a serious min/max situation I would think.  With the charmed pet you are either going to plow through things, or things are going to fall apart at the worst time and the mage will die before you have time to gate him.<br />
<br />
With a pure melee partner I'd think that healing might be an issue.  Maybe a Pally, although I'd expect a BL with slow and their small heals could tank as well as a pally on an unsowed mob (or more specifically a mage pet could tank a slowed mob with the mage and BL healing better than an pally could).  With two pet classes the option to have the mage's pet tank is there until teir 3 mobs, (at least with low lvl equipment).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At higher levels MOB's hit too hard for a Bard to stay stationary...he has to stay mobile. Twisting songs constantly and mez and charms do not last all that long. Way too much work to try and two box a Bard.<br />
<br />
Seeler<br />
<br />
P.S. Yes I also play a Bard as well as my Shaman....duoing my Shaman with RL friends Mage has proven to be alot of good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some folks must have missed the first part that you were starting a mage and wanted to group with that class.<br />
<br />
Suggesting a Melee and a Mage is probably the worst thing you could ever do.  As soon as the melee jumps in there the pet will no longer tank and you are going to get rocked with no way of healing.<br />
<br />
Shaman and Mage are very good since both require very little attention.  I would completely dissagree with Ianolar about the BL requiring less attention than a shaman though.  The BL has to move to get into melee range and follow as the mob moves.  The Sham just hits hot keys... at least I know I do and I dont have to be facing the mob or moving or anything like that.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying Sham/Mage is better than a BL/Mage though.  BL slow is just as good as ours, they can dish out a hell of a lot more damage with their pet/melee/nuking/dots than we can with our dots/nuking/pet.  They also get the mana regen line for both classes and buffs that are damn near as good as ours while Ferocity is better than FA for the pets.<br />
<br />
So if you want to be a bad ass go BL/Mage if you want to be able to play while watching TV or making out with the old lady, play a Sham/Mage.<br />
<br />
*Edit* OH and about playing the Bard and any other class... dont do it!  A well played bard is like bringing 1 1/2 chars to the group but a poorly played bard is the worst group member to have.  With out twisting 3-4 songs at all times and adding in melee they are a complete waste of space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a great bard who could not be stopped by anyone.....<br />
<br />
His name was Fansy.....<br />
<br />
Check out his movie here: http://www.notacult.com/fansymovie/index.html<br />
<br />
Sorry for the derail but this is hilarious.<br />
<br />
I think by far that a shaman would be a much better partner than a bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A boxed bard is 30-40% less powerful than an identical non-boxed bard, in the best of circumstances.<br />
<br />
Bards are the most demanding and keyboard/mouse-intensive classes in EQ. Go for a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agreed.  Don't imagine that you'll be charming while 2-boxing.  *grin*  It's a good dream, but won't work out in the end.  I'm going to vote for a beastlord to go with that mage, here's my reasons.<br />
<br />
Bst get better pet heals than mage, and bst pet will do most of the tanking.<br />
Mage mana regen is just a little bit sub-par, so the bst's mana buff will help tremendously.<br />
Bst can buff dex about as well as a shaman (after a point), and I think it's just recently that the mage board has started posting info about their pets' extremely low dex.  Bst buffs will raise the DPS of the mage pet significantly.<br />
Finally, mage stun pet and bst stun pet proc often reduce a mob to near uselessness (with the proper buffs in place) - it's a powerful powerful duo.<br />
<br />
The bard would be great to have for convenience (selo's, mezz) - but the kill rate would be so much slower, it would be kind of painful for a 2 boxing situation.  I think bot bards are best for the person 5 or 6-boxing (*shudder*), where half the toons are just going to stand around most of the fight anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman spells are mana intensive, and require active mana regeneration. An effective shaman is mashing keys almost 1/2 as much as an effective bard. Is aggro ping pong an issue with two boxing? I wouldnt think the BL would have to run around to find the mob and melee. I would suggest the BL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">And who's gonna heal the beastlord? He wont really be meleeing much with just bind wounds... Beastlord Pet clerics are wastes of a class. Shaman and mage is a pretty good combo for old world stuff. My gf has a mage as her main, and it works out well when we feel like slumming it and going to chardok b or whatever. Root comes in handy, and neither beasts or mages get it.<br />
<br />
This is assuming you just duo with your bot. If you add a healer (druid preferrably imo), go beast.<br />
<br />
Another option is ranger. With a featherwood bow, they deal very good dps, and it has a built in aggro reducer, so the mage pet will continue to tank. Snare and root to help on adds, some minor healing to help patch up after an odd hit, tracking, etc. Ranger bots are rather easy to do with a nostromo autofiring the bow. If you get fire flagged, it would be easy to duo at tables with that pair as well.</div></div><hr />

The most effective thing, with the mage+BL combo, would be the pets tanking.  If the BL is not tanking the Mage's earth pet would be the way to go, at least from my experience with teaming with a mage.  Mage can heal his pet, with help from the BL, while the BL can heal his pet.  Mage pets can tank up to tier 2, before the mages got their new pet foci, without issue against slowed mobs.  Not that a mage plus a shaman would be a bad choice, they also work well together, but I would not enjoy 2 boxing, trying to keep up with canni without much ft gear (but if one is clever with hot keys, and good at doing three things at once maybe it would be less of an issue that I imagine).<br />
<br />
The only issue I see with a mage and a ranger would be healing, as that would force the mage pet to tank an unslowed mob.  Mage pet heals are ok, but not fast.  And it sounded like the original poster was not envisioning getting particularly high lvl gear, and so would be limited on pet foci also I would assume.<br />
<br />
If the pets are not tanking, then the mage would have to use an air pet, and a clicky snare would be invaluable for the BL or mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I duo with a Mage all the time. We are an awesome team. He pulls with mala and I slow on incomming. Air pet neatly picks up agro with stuns and dogdog, air pet and Mage chew the mob up while I heal his pet (and DPS as manna/time permits). To give you an idea of what you would be capable of: we do Valor golems with zero downtime getting 4-5pct AA a kill. I know you mentioned velious, The only thing we've really done there duo is the Kael arena for faction. We blew through it and left due mostly to boredom.<br />
<br />
I know that a mage/shaman would be capable of far more than we do, neither of us are elemental and far from uber twinks. I agree the beastlord would be a powerful combo too (nutz dps), I just caution that you're gimping yourself on your priest abilities. Sure, you both can heal your pets fairly efficently, but what happens when the beastlord starts taking hits? Don't underestimate the power of Torp or Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">man, a shaman and pet will outdamage a beastlord pet alone easily. Get a nostromo, set up a canni dance macro, etc. Mages are so incredibly easy to bot (hi, i nuke and sic pet... omg so hard), that the little extra attention you have to deovote with a shaman vs a pet cleric beastlord (barf) will pay off big time. Whats a beasts dps without his melee? Pretty mediocre. <br />
<br />
The ranger duo wouldnt work in straight up pet tanking. But you can aggro kite well enough with it. The ranger snares, and you autofire his bow, while controlling the mage for aggro. With a good nostromo configuration, you wont even have to look at the ranger's screen, and its considerably more dps than the mage/shaman or mage/beastlord set up (since the beast wont be meleeing).</div></div><hr />
