<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xolin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there are tons of threads on this topic, I used search then looked through a lot of the threads, but could not find the answer to my question.  Almost all of them were about what class to box, which I already know.  What I would like to know is how do you play two accounts on one PC?  I've tried eqwindows, WINEQ, and the only time I've been able to even get both characters logged in is with the regular EQ windowed mode.  But trying to switch back and forth with them by releasing my mouse, then closing out one instance(which slowly closes moving down the screen), then opening the other is just too slow.  Would anybody mind giving me some tips on what I can do, or even a multi-boxing for Dummies type deal(I am computer illiterate)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you probably need to go into setup on both EQ installations and turn pretty much all models off and run them on low rez settings.  Sounds like your computer doesn't have enough horsepower to run 2 full copies of EQ on whatever settings you're using.  If that doesn't work, you probably need to upgrade one or more of:  memory, cpu, video card.<br />
<br />
I'd also make sure you've got the most recent drivers for your video card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xolin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a Pentium 4 2.53 ghz processor with 512 mb RAM and a Radeon 7200 series 64mb video card.  I'm pretty sure I read on some other threads that people with about the same set up as me were running two accounts on one PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I haven't done this, but a friend uses EQWindows and EQ Play Nice (playnice?).  I guess the newer version of EQWindows lets you setup hotkeys to switch between screens quickly, and EQPlayNice drastically reduces the resources that EQ consumes.  <br />
<br />
Using both of those in conjunction, my friend running a 2.4 ghz 512mb ram pc is able to switch between screens rapidly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't 2 boxed on 1 computer personally but given your video card and memory your probably gonna have to optimzing things a bit.<br />
<br />
Turn off all new models that you can. Go for the smallest texture sizes and anything else thats gonna eat up memory. Also go in and turn off sound. Since your trying to run 2 at once you basically need to make sure it's doing as little work as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My machine is an amd 1.7ghz, 1gig memory, radeon 9800 128mb vid.  I turned most of the models off on the second account, dialed it down to a very small size (640x480 or something), and brought in the clip plane on both accounts.  It runs, but not all that well (a bit laggy).  I didn't do anything special in terms of third party software, just copied my EQ installation into a second folder.  I'd guess that memory/video memory is what's blocking you.<br />
<br />
Hopefully some of the 3rd party programs people have recommended, combined with reducing your video/memory intensive configuration settings as much as possible will get you going.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I also have a radeon 8500 on my 2nd computer.  The latest ATI drivers make that run a lot better.  If you're not on the latest radeon drivers, I'd install them for sure.  I didn't notice much improvement on the radeon 9800, but it sure helped the 8500, so I'd guess it'd help the earlier cards also.</div></div><hr />
