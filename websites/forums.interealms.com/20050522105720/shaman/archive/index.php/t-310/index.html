<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sedic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
  I left EQ for several months and have decided to come back due to some urging from several friends.  They left our old server (TP) and have gone back to Quell.  I am in the process of transferring my shaman, Sedic.  I had the SoF on TP and I was wondering, since it is faction based, can I just run back to EJ and talk to the spirit to get another Spear?  <br />
<br />
  I know this is just wishful thinking but hey, I can hope can't I?  :D  Does anyone have any information about this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, I think you would need another tear to get Rak to drop the scale to turn into the spirit.  You might ask around and see if any shaman in your future guild have a tear lying around in the bank.  Since they have the correct faction and you have the correct faction, they should be able to trigger Rak so you can loot a scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From all that I've heard you need to head back to Fear and grab yourself a tear and do the final CoM fight. Hand in the stuff you grabbed from Rak and recieve your SoF.<br />
<br />
edit: Hehe, what he said ^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">not anymore, but you can go get a tear from Fear then kill lord rak and loot the item for handin for you spear of fate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have talked to a GM on this issue (came up when I failed on my hand in of the last scale due to a faction hit I had taken before by accident....GET MAX FACTION! heh). <br />
<br />
Basically I was told if you had the Epic then moved to new server naked you should be able to talk to the last spirit and go thru the conversation to get your epic back.   Reason being is that it is possible to lose your epic (destroy it I guess...*shrug*) and this way you can get it back.  To prevent anyone though from running thru conversation to get spear you must have turned in scale, have near or max faction with Truespirit and received epic.   I was not aware of this but the GM did inform me this was possible and that if you move servers you can do this again to get spear back.  How true this is I do not know and for one will not destroy my epic to find out.  lol  <br />
<br />
What I suggest is if you had your epic already and moved to new server naked go talk to the spirit again.  If it works, great.  If not, just get Tear again and finish the quest.  Either way you do not lose out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You have to get the tear.<br />
<br />
Talking to the spirit to get it doesn't work anymore because people cheated by maxing out faction doing the lesser parts and entirely skipped over the Hole, Neh, Rak, and the Tear parts.  They just did the lesser parts over and over then asked for the spear (similar how you can ask for a new shield).  It got nerfed quickly and you have to turn in the scale now to get the spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its not to bad, really. The turn-in to Rak and to the last spirit yield ENOURMOUS xp. Turn AA to 100%, and I bet those two turn-ins by themselves would get you 2-3 yellows...probably more.<br />
<br />
But you cannot just talk to the spirit. You get the spear immediately upon giving the scale (like most any other quest reward), and the whole Heyokah conversation is just window dressing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow Jaradis, that stuff really happened??!<br />
<br />
/rude to the nosy shaman that leaked it out.<br />
<br />
;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So can you do the last steps over and over for awesome exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you want to go to fear, kill the golems, loot a tear, get a group that includes at least one mage and get them to come with you to com, kill the reavers and everything else in the way and then do the turn in and kill rak, then yeah, you can do it over and over again for xp. Seems like a few hours spent xp'ing may be an easier way to make an equivalent amount of xp though. :)<br />
<br />
edit: can't type :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well this isnt some you'd farm. but if you happened to pick up a tear in fear, and did reavers sometime it be well worth it.<br />
<br />
i wish i could remember better, but i think i got around 2 blue bubs in 56. pretty awesome, exp. definitely more then id make in a night.</div></div><hr />
