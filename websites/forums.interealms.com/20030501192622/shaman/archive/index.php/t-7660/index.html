<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just had a rant on the EQ message boards about alchemy :).<br />
<br />
If anyone else would like to go there and add their comments and/or suggestions on revamping alchemy please feel free to visit the thread below and post.<br />
<br />
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032017.html<br />
<br />
As i said on the thread I am currently 80 skill (around) and would like to have a reson to get it to 180, apart from the reason of burning a whole lot of money for some pretty minor gains.<br />
<br />
Please don't go there if you are of the opinion that getting GM is worthwhile in itself and any shaman who considers himself a true shaman should max this skill :p. <br />
<br />
I do not burn huge amounts of money in the game or in RL that doesn't directly reflect the impact spending that money will have on my lifestyle or what benefits it can provide, I hope most people would agree with me on this.<br />
<br />
Virtually every shaman considers alchemy to be still broken and while I admire those who took the time &amp; money to get to 180 before the potions revamp they would probably benefit the most because they would have a head start on us slackers :).<br />

Edit: It would be nice to see this thread bobbing along the top of the boards there for a while, while it may not make any difference it might make me feel better :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Explain whats broken about it?<br />
<br />
That you put ingredients in a bag, click combine and get results?<br />
<br />
Ahh they aren't the uber 5k regen + haste and KEI for 4hours results you wish you could have.... sure.. but it's not broken.<br />
<br />
Anyway I won't go post on that thread cause I'm sure you don't want &quot;someone like me&quot; to mess up your thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's broken because the sellbacks suck compared to all other tradeskills.  Potions with reagents that cost over 150p have a 9g sellback.<br />
<br />
It's broken because there's like one book on alchemy, and it's incomplete.  The only way people have figured out thing about alchemy is that they do all combinations of all combines, while all other tradeskills have books out the wazoo with hints about what to do.<br />
<br />
It's broken because the top end potions we can make are irrelevant because of items in an expansion, (belt of return, or that gate potion from Velious).<br />
<br />
It's broken because  potions we make (levitate) require a reagent to work (bat wing), while the store bought ones don't.<br />
<br />
It's broken because there are duplicate potions.<br />
<br />
It's broken because some potions (shrink/growth) have alternatives in other tradeskills (tinkering), that are much cheaper.  They're not unique, whereas nearly every other tradeskills effects are.<br />
<br />
It's broken because baking items have  stats now.... and a lot of our potions.<br />
Why buy potions when the baking items are much cheaper and last a lot longer?<br />
<br />
It's broken because for the amount of effort it takes (get to level 60 or above) to get grandmaster (&gt;180), there is no ultimate payoff more than a gate potion....a gate potion that a potter tradeskiller can make for 50p, and not even at grandmaster level.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I think it's pretty damn broken.<br />
<br />
And according to this:<br />

it's not going to be looked at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the PotC quest, baking, brewing, smithing, tailoring, pottery, and even fishing all have profitable recipes.  I can make some profit from stat food and drink continuously, if slowly.  Alchemy potions?  I'm better off farming spiders in EK for silks.  Potions end up costing too much, and don't last long enough.  The buyback in jewelcraft is about 99% for non-magic items, and over 100% for enchanted items.  Alchemy is what?  5% buyback?  Alchemy to 160 cost me 8283pp.  I've sent more getting alchemy to 160 than I did on all my other skills combined (smithing is a net profit thanks to sickles).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well Rokkeb, going by the tone of your reply then I guess you are right about me not wanting you to post on that thread.<br />
<br />
You must be one of a small percentage of shaman who actually believe alchemy is not , if not broken, then extremely poorly implemented.<br />
<br />
For a more detailed list of why its broken see the thread below yours :)<br />
<br />
I took an enchanter from 0 to 250 skill in jewelcraft over 2 days at a cost of 15k and made a nice amount of money from getting to be a GM tradeskiller, back when BD gear was worth something :). <br />
<br />
Why should most (if not all) tradeskills allow the people who have spent the time, effort and money to get to this level make a reasonable profit/return on their dedication apart from the glaring exception of alchemy (&amp; poison) ?<br />
<br />
If the effects you describe were available from potions what would be the harm in that for the shaman class as a whole ?<br />
<br />
What earthly difference does it make whether a shaman can sell a KEI potion for 200pp and make a reasonable profit compared to a chanter sat in the bazaar spamming his &quot;KEI for donations&quot; message every 2 minutes when all it is costing him is medding his mana back ? <br />
<br />
One of our guild chanters just made 60 yesterday, within 1 minute in the bazaar he got 10 tells for KEI, usual accepted donation on AB is 100pp - lets see 100pp x 10 tells x 60 minutes = 60kpp an hour if he wanted to become a KEI vending machine. Now if that isn't unbalancing to the economy I am not sure what is ?<br />
<br />
Ahh well, maybe you'll get your wish that alchemy doesn't need any upgrade. Out of over 400 page views (on this page and the pointer one in the General section) the thread has 21 posts, 2 of which were done by me.<br />
<br />
Looks like apathy will win by default over people attempting to improve the only class defining tradeskill that shaman have :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tinkering and poison making suck 10x worse than alchemy...<br />
<br />
Until those get fixed I don't care much about alchemy, because it does work.<br />
<br />
Sure at the top end of tinkering you can make some nice stuff.. but the farming is a bitch, and the cost to get there is much worse than alchemy.<br />
<br />
Poison making has about the worst sellback ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dafyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've posted my support to get alchemy fixed. Will it do any good, i really hoipe so, but seeing how shaman are becoming the forgotten class, i don 't see it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I take it your main is a gnome Rogue then Rokkeb :), else why be more concerned about tinkering and poison-making rather than alchemy ? - to paraphrase you :-<br />
<br />
&quot;you put poison making (tinkering) ingredients in a bag, click combine and get results? Explain whats broken about it (them) ?&quot;<br />
<br />
I am not very concerned about what other classes/races tradeskill problems (compared to shamans) are although I WOULD support anyones attempts to get them fixed. If people want to get those 2 tradeskills fixed they are perfectly capable of trying to organise something like I have tried here.<br />
<br />
I AM concerned abut a tradeskill that my main for over 3 years finds (almost) pointless to advance in.<br />
<br />
Errr, to say you won't support something pretty obviously broken because other things are broken worse is pretty short-sighted.<br />
<br />
Why not support this and when someone gets off their duff and tries to do something about those skills support that also - thats what I will do :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hell alteast they put in a crapload of new (and might i add awesome and not impossible to make) tinkering stuff in with PoP. what have we gotten? one thing... i agree that alchemy is broken, but we are the bastards of the EQ classes. no one gives us the love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">actually rogues have tried to get poison making fixed since EQ has been live...<br />
<br />
I'm not supporting anything.. mainly because verant just doesn't give a ****, and its a waste of time.<br />
<br />
And yes my main is a rogue, and a Gnome at that.. and I chose my 3 main tradeskills to be poison making, tinkering, and alchemy.<br />
<br />
They are not broken, they just suck ass.....   broken would be if you put: components in bag. click combine. you die. something like that I would consider broken... something VI doesn't care about.. I consider VI being dicks,and not caring about stuff, therefore it won't change... so why waste my time &quot;supporting&quot; stuff they will ignore anyway....<br />
<br />
<br />
If anything they will say they &quot;fixed&quot; alchemy, when they let you/us stack potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No one's forcing you to support anything.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At least they added new stuff with this expansion for Poison Making, see new components drop all over the place. What did they add for alchemy?  1 item part of another item?  Im on strike i make potions for me only screw everyone else if they want a potion let them level up a shaman and make em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Merdenoms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">3 potions that trivial relatively early are SoW, Shrink and Invis Undead.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Verant/SOE has abandoned Alchemy and so have I for the most part, I will make potions for personal use only now, there just isn't the market for them, If there ever was for more than SoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Volfie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Alchemy is a hobby not a tradeskill and Verant should list it as such. My skill is maxxed only because I was full 60 no aa to be made then and bored. Tradeskills make money hobbies don't that is all. I gave up on it getting fixed long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Alchemy will never be fixed.  After three years of dealing with it, I know for a fact that it will never be fixed. Verant doesn't care.  What more do they need to do to illustrate this to you?</div></div><hr />
