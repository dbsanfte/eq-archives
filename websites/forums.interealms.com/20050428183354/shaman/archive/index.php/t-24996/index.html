<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious, myself and about 8-10 working class old folk adults will be setting up shop, curious if any of the older shaman here will be as well, or hopping over with friends and guilds too? We should try to land in the same place, would be cool.<br />
<br />
Of course, horde is the only way to go, only sissies play a silly night elf or a gnome :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My group of RL friends will also be going Horde PvP, however we are avoiding East Coast like the plague...they tend to fill up the fastest.<br />
<br />
Probably go Mountain or Central.  Will post a server name once they release them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think there is any real latency issues going from the east coast to a central or mountain server? I too noticed the massive influx on the east and pacific.<br />
<br />
Might be a good idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im an older player and I have 4 other friends setting up one the east PvP servers.  So far it looks like we are going to play horde and setup a guild asap. I wish they would post server names before release so we can coordinate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doubt you will notice any difference in latency if both servers are equally populated.  <br />
<br />
I think it's mainly so ppl can play with others in the same time zone to help alleviate some different time zone problems.<br />
<br />
for example, I'm in pst and I log in usually at 6pm.  I consider that the beginning of prime time.  At that same time, it's 9pm over in the east coast and people will be getting ready for bed soon.</div></div><hr />

Due to the fact my guild is spread out all over the place, I've been playing on a Central Time server, and I'm in Seattle.  No noticeable latency</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wouldn't (for lag purposes) you want to be on a server that is contrary to your time zone?<br />
<br />
I know on Xev we had a Euro guild that for awhile was beating people to spawns after server reset simply by virtue of being online.<br />
<br />
Since WoW requires little grouping, I was thinking of going with a server that is not my time zone.</div></div><hr />
