<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate to admit it, but I have very little experience with root parking adds.  I did a small bit of it while soloing up through the low thirties, but that’s about it.  Somewhere in my mid thirties or so I started grouping with a ranger and a cleric.  The ranger always rooted the adds so it was never an issue.  For the last many levels I usually group with a necromancer who keeps the adds stunned.  Again its not been a problem.  But I just dinged 61 with little to no experience in directly dealing with adds and I feel that’s a problem.<br />
<br />
I have, on occasion, tried to pull an add away from the group and root it in place.  Assuming I get the spell off and it sticks I’ve found the spell breaks within a few seconds and we’re right back where we started.  I’m four or five points shy of max defense, so getting the spell off shouldn’t be a big problem now.  But what’s the point of doing all this if the mob is back in action a few seconds later.  To be honest, I’ve had better luck slowing a mob and let it beat on me until my group can come and help me finish it off.  Is there a method to root parking that I’m missing?  I really would like to learn how to do this properly. It may save my group’s life some day.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you malosini the mob, it has a smaller chance of breaking root.<br />
<br />
Petrifying Earth is the spell you want to shoot for eventually.  It's long lasting and has a magic resist adjustment that's really nice.<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis is an AA you want to work towards too-- can just push adds away and root them if things get hairy-- plus it's a disease resist so it plays with different resists altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I spent pretty much all of upper 40's and till 65 groupped with my wifes enchanter so I know how you feel. Personally I just do what you do, slow it and let it beat on me, cast Q and don't worry about it usually. If I can root it I will, but I never seem to have any luck with that either. The only time I even have root up is when I know I'm on CC and even then I'd rather have something else in that spell slot. Really wish I could get ahold of some ornate legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You need to debuff the mobs.  Every tick mobs get a resist check to break root, as well as the check when they take damage from a direct damage type spell/effect.<br />
<br />
if you malo a mob, most will stay parked pretty well.  You should have greater imobilize now (EDIT: GI is at 62), it has a -30 resist modifier, which allows it to land pretty well.  Once you get Petrifying Earth, which also has the -30 resist modifier, you can park mobs for a long time.   Greater Imobilize will hold for 1 minute, Petrifying Earth for 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
I will normaly slow a mob to get its attention fixed on me, pull it away from the group, root it, then apply malo to ensure that the root lasts as long as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First, use a faster casting root.  I do believe in paying the wee bit of extra mana cost for that.  <br />
<br />
Second, use the power of /sit to drag mobs off the melee scrum.  In fact, sometimes you can tie up a mob just bit /sit on and off and on and off, over and over.  Basically, you are sit-kiting.  It's very effective at times.  <br />
<br />
Third, use malosini to soften up those resists.  Makes a big difference on the hold power.  But, it's not necessary on a lot of mobs.  <br />
<br />
I like root parking.  When you get to do that stuff, it can be very effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually secret to holding mob aggro in situations where you need to root park is slowing it and keeping cripple memmed.  It is a fast cast and has huge amount of aggro.  Casting that and sitting down in place guarantees you aggro less you got an SK or Paladin taunting with spells.  I would invest into VP 1 2 and 3 if have the AA.   Keeping a root up like petrifying earth lasts a greater time than the fast casting roots.  I would just pull aggro and sick your pet on the mob till you can root it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">debuffing and rooting away from the group is 100% a artform IMHO. Its things like this that make me smile when people wanna believe that EQ takes no skill. Im sorry, but you can believe that EQ is super easy and yada yada all you want and to a extent its true. But the reality is that to play EQ GOOD it takes practice and skill. Just watch a highly skilled enchanter dancing around the group like a gust of wind mezzing 5 mobs or watch me toss slows on adds and sit for aggro, take a beating while i Q myself and root and offtank them while healing the back up melee and healing puppy who is also offtanking a rooted summoning mob. <br />
<br />
But yea, get VP or malos* once they are rooted, root parking is definetly a valid CC method when done right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always have malos mem'd, thats not an issue for me. I guess my major problem is I can't stand the thought of devoting 3 spell slots to CC spells (root, cripple, malosinia). Those would be the three slots I usually have devoted to DPS spells and just from my personal preference I really like being a dps shammy/tanking shammy over anything else. <br />
<br />
Guess I enjoy pain lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Unless you think Cripple does something worth spending the mana on (crack!), just use disempower (the level 14 much cheaper cripple) to draw aggro.  And yeah, debuff the mob with MalXXXX before/after rooting, it will make the root last a lot longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm.. not sure I understand.<br />
<br />
You say you have malos up, I assume you have slow up, root  would just be one more spell slot, not 3... malosinia and cripple arent needed... they are just fluf.  Unless someone is actively engaging the mob, slow will draw it to you no problems.<br />
<br />
If you dont keep root (of some sort) memmed, make a spell set with root int eh slot you want... then its just a quick click or /command away.  Spell sets have made swapping spells so much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well out of curioisty but you are using the highest level root you have right? Not the original level 14 root spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well out of curioisty but you are using the highest level root you have right? Not the original level 14 root spell?<br />
<br />
Until I got to 62 and got the -30 root I never bothered with anything other than the original one. I still used it until I discovered just how powerfull those -30 are when trying to park mobs in tactics. Now I use GI when in group and PE when solo. The VP AA is also handy, but I usually only use it to move a mob when parking in tight quarters or just to reposition a mob that is in the wrong spot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Petrifying Earth (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3196&amp;source=Test)<br />
Greater Immobilize (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3195&amp;source=Test) <br />
Paralyzing Earth (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=133&amp;source=Test) <br />
Immobilize (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=132&amp;source=Test) <br />
Instill (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=131&amp;source=Test) <br />
Root (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=230&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
These are the options we have for rooting targets.<br />
You'll notice that only Petrifying Earth and Greater Immobilize have any resist mods at all.<br />
The previous root spells we have access to have no resist mods.<br />
The main differences between them are different casting times and different potential durations.<br />
<br />
Throughout my levelling, I never bothered with anything but Root as my root spell until I got Greater Immobilize.<br />
One of the main reasons for this is the cheap mana cost for root.  It only costs 30 mana.  That mana cost is nothing.  And when you consider that all of our dots until level 64 break our own roots very very readily, spending a lot of mana on a root only to break it yourself as soon as you start doing any damage to it is a big waste of mana.  Also, when mobs die every 30-45 seconds, you don't really need root to last much longer than that.<br />
-Immobilize sucks compared to root.  It only lasts 2 ticks longer, but costs 80 mana vs 30.  The only benefit to it really is that it casts 0.25 seconds faster, which isn't really even much to worry about.<br />
-Instill costs twice as much mana for twice the duration.  It takes 0.5 seconds longer to cast than root.  It's ok to use, but if you don't need the super long root CCs, just root it with regular root and reroot after about 35 or 40 seconds seconds.<br />
-Paralyzing Earth is actually a good root upgrade finally.  It does cost 3 and 1/3 times as much mana as root though and has a 0.5 casting time more than root.  The benefit though from it is the full 3 minute duration.  That 3 minute duration is an eternity if you need to keep a few mobs on ice for a while.  If you have pulls of say 3 or 4 mobs at a time, I'd use this root instead of Root.  If you have pulls of say 2 mobs at a time, I'd use root.  Also, by the time you get this spell, you will have Cannibalize III and soon Cannibalize IV for mana regen.  You'll have enough mana to throw around that you can afford to use the more expensive casting roots.<br />
<br />
As for learning how to CC stuff better, the best way IMO would be to go solo in a dungeon where you get pulls of 2-3 mobs every pull.  For example, go to Sebilis or Charasis or something to solo.  You'll learn quickly how to move mobs to where you want to plant them, root them, and separate them from the other mobs you are killing.<br />
<br />
If you are staying in groups and need to learn how to CC stuff, on every pull of 2+ mobs, immediately think to yourself &quot;where should I root this so it won't be in melee range of anyone in the party?&quot;.  MaloXXXX/Slow the mob (should pull aggro), move to where you want to park the add, root it, then move away.  Repeat for each mob you need to CC.  Debuffing resists really is a necessity for effective CC work like that in many places.  If the resists are low enough, you can get away with rooting without debuffing first.  But most of the time debuffing resists with low aggro maloxxxx is just smart anyway to make sure your high aggro slows land ok.  Rooting it will just be that much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There is a lot of good advice in this thread for the new shamans. Could somebody update the sticky:http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13787 with a synopsis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We have two root lines; the root-enstill-immobilize line and the paralyzing-petrifying line. The former is faster casting but short duration, while the latter has a longer cast time (and takes more mana, I believe) but has a much longer duration. I've always preferred to use the long duration root because after you maloX the mob, you can park it for quite a while if nobody messes with it. <br />
<br />
It's a matter of preference, but perhaps you're not having much luck because you are using the short duration line. Try the long duration roots and see how those suit you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maybe Im unlucky but I found Paralyzing earth to be a perfectly horrid root.  When trying to use it to root park I never had it last its full duration, many (or should I say most) times breaking 5 to 10 seconds after landing on a mob that was taking no damage.<br />
<br />
I stopped using it the same level I got it after exping in Veksar and having it land and wear off an add 3 times in rapid succession whilst trying to deal with the 2 mobs I had.  When I was remmming my spells PE went to the back of the book and Immobilize was memmed untill I got GI.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thank you all for replying with such great information.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  I plan to stay at 61st level for quite some time as I start working on AAs.  So I&#8217;ll practice your advice with what spells I have and try to build up my parking skills.  <br />
<br />
There is, however, something I&#8217;m still not clear on.  I can understand the advice so far when applied to a single add.  But what should I do when a single pull turns into three or four mobs?  Currently I do my best to slow each one in turn, even the ones the necromancer has stunned.  Assuming there is no other crowd control, do I try to slow all the adds as I am now and then try to park them somewhere one at a time or should I slow one and try to park it while the rest of the party is being beaten on full force by the remaining mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What I generally do with 3+ pulls, if there's no enchanter (or say, necro mezzing) is get everything slowed first off.  The first add I slow's going to turn on me, but I can deal with that to get add#2 slowed.  Then I'll back them away and root them in turn.<br />
<br />
If you DO have a mezzer, or some other form of CC (say a Ranger or Pally helping root) slow then park 'em one at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Slow &gt; all<br />
If you have 5 in camp, you're best off getting each one slowed before doing anything else.  Chances are you'll have a handful of them on you at that point (but slowed, so it doesn't hurt THAT much), so you can simply move around, rooting them where they follow you.  If things are looking really bad, you'll need to root one, convince the melees to move over - rinse, repeat.  Depends on how fast your tank is going down.  If you don't have the adds under control by the time that CH goes off, you'll be pulling them off the cleric, no fun there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">When playing either my necro or shaman I'd had always in the past used perify earth to root for adds. It always worked for root parking whichever class I was on. As a shaman of course I always slowed the mobs first.<br />
<br />
Upgrades that we get in pop though do work better of course but PE has always been more then satisfactory for me whichever class I play, well at least till I got the upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">On multi pulls, hopefully the puller will give you a heads up and you can start off by rooting one away from camp to start.  From there, you can Malos/Slow one and root another while waiting for malos/slow gems to refresh and rinse/repeat.  Least that's generally what I've done in the past.<br />
<br />
If you can scrape up the cash or get lucky with drops and get them yourself, they make life a LOT easier.  You can malos/slow and click pants while the rest of your gems are refreshing so that you're one busy as hell shaman but locking mobs down fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Off topic, but you said it and I jsut feel the need to reply.<br />
<br />
If you have only pos/pov access then this might work.  If you plan on progressing any farther into the planes get 65 first.<br />
<br />
I had the same thoughts as you did. Get 61, new pet and some good spells and then grind out MC3, canni 5 and a few other AA's and then work to 65.  And then I got my first BoT group.  And was bouncing slows and debuffs like they were rubber off concrete.  got 62 and resists were noticibly fewer. <br />
<br />
AA is faster in upper tiers.  Better spells/equip drops in upper tiers.  Upper tiers necesitates upper levels though, and that means 65.<br />
<br />
This is only my opinion of course, do what is right for you.  I just thought that Id share my feelings on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Calabar, I was also going to stop at 61 and go for aa's but my guild told me to at least get 62 for bot/hoh access. I was in tactics at 61 and got lots of resists on slow up there, but as soon as I turned 62 the number of resists dropped noticeably. I haven't ventured into BoT or HoH yet but when I get there I am hoping I am useful. If not, I will either stay out or level up. I have to say though, that when you do stop grinding levels it is nice to actually see the aa xp bar move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">A good puller is going to let you know how many he is pulling.  I always try to position myself to see the puller and if he has 2, I root the one he doesn't have targeted, keeping it away from the party.  Then slow the first.  I do this because it seems that slowing a mob before it takes 10% damage will cause the mob to attack you.  So you've got a little time to work the casts.  If root is resisted, slow the targeted mob and then slow the second mob.  He will attack you, so run the mob somewhere and park him with a root.  Move back to the party and check on the first mobs damage %.  If it's getting killed nicely and your rich in mana go ahead and plague the first mob then watch for root to break.  That way when the tanks are done with mob #1 mob # 2 is already slowed, dotted, and ready to finish off.  I have used this tactic over and over in KC and the groups I've been with have been very satisfied.  Obviously if someone is mezzing mobs then you dont need it.  <br />
<br />
Again, if your soloing with dogdog, say in RM and trying to make that money quick this works too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Pulling 4+ mobs into camp, or pulling 2 mobs into camp, the tactic is the same for the most part.  The only thing is, you will tend to skip on maloing and go straight to the slow, then root, and hope they land.  When you have 4 mobs in camp, you don't have much time to try and debuff mr before going for the easy slow and long lasting easy root.  Having 4 mobs come into camp in Karnor's back when Kunark was new or getting 4 mobs in camp because you are pulling CoD, the tactics are still the same.  Slow the mob, that taunts the mob onto you, back off from the rest of the people in group out of the way, root the mob, repeat.<br />
<br />
Virulent paralysis is really useful for doing CCing in cases like this.  I'll usually slow the first mob, root it, then target another mob and VP it to blast it out of melee range of the group.  I can leave that mob for later and slow other mobs first.  I've ended up getting VP3 and it really pushes mobs far out of melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">another nice thing about vp is u can use it as soon as your spell has finished being cast, no 2.5 sec recast time on using it.<br />
<br />
edit, oh yeah, it also doesn't take up a spell slot for those just in case emergency when say a chanter ld's. dies. sucks etc and you don't have root memed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think this is the one of the key factors in being the shaman who gets invited back to groups over and over again.  We've all been in pick up groups that have really stunk and then there are groups that just seem to really work together well. <br />
The other day I was in a group such as this.  It included a Cleric, Rogue, Ranger, Monk, Paladin, and Shaman (me).  After only a few minutes of pulling, we had organized a system where the mobs were falling so fast that loot was rotting.  Nothing special seemed to be happening, no one was uber twinked and yet it seemed as if we had been working together for ages.  <br />
<br />
I had no KEI, but was doing the CANNI III thing. I told the cleric to CH me at 20% health.  Not always the best of ideas in KC, but I felt comfortable doing it because there was a feeling of trust.  I've shrunk everyone to make room for us to all get into the corner and also have room to maneuver during the fight. The monk is pulling mobs in and we would get the occasional ADD or POP, sometimes even up to 4 at a time.  Just being able to divide the mobs up and concentrate on 1 at a time makes the whole evolution smooth and this is where your skill at ghetto mezzing really pays off.  The shaman who can do this while hasting and buffing is going to be asked to join again and again.  It's not just a matter of Haste and slow but how all of it is applied in the support of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I must say that this has been a very inspirational thread for me.  I feel I do a good job as a shaman.  I keep everybody buffed. I keep all the mobs slowed.  I DoT the mobs when I have the manna to spare.  And I don’t go running off mewing like a little kitten if things go bad and I’m getting torn limb from limb.  However, I’ve always felt there was room for improvement, especially in the area of dealing with adds.  I’m looking forward to perfecting this skill.<br />
<br />
As for stopping at 61st level and working on AAs as apposed to leveling to 62 or higher, it’s a subject I’ve debated on for some time.  However, I think it’s the right thing for me to do.  I’m in a very small guild, maybe a couple of full groups of 50+ characters if everyone managed to log on at the same time.  There are now four of us that are 61st level, the highest level anyone has achieved in our guild.  When I log in I usually either group with guild members, solo with my shaman or my level 54 beastlord or I work on trade skills.  I almost never join pickup groups.  So the possibility of my joining a BoT or HoH group, even if I were 65th level, are slim to none.  So for the time being I’ll have fun grouping with my friends and working my way to Canni 5.  And with some luck perhaps even get Pox, Torpor, Malo or the dozen or so other spells I’m missing along the way.</div></div><hr />
