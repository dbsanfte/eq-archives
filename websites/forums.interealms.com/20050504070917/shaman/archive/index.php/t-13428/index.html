<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Everyone who has seen the new models knows that the 2hb motion is the same as the 1 handed pierce motion. It looks absolutely retarded. Since they apparently don't have the time or effort to make a 2hb animation,  PLEASE JUST USE THE 2HS MOTION FOR 2HB <br />
<br />
I dont know crap about writing video games, so I don't know how difficult this would be, but for the love of gawd please please sneak it into a patch if it isnt much work. <br />
<br />

I know sunmoon doesnt like these sorts of posts, maybe he'll let this slide ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this has been one of my pet peeves for a long long time , i mean who the hell jousts with a sledge hammer. It looks to gimp to me. The funny part is , in the character select screen the 2hb animation is how it should be ( imho ) its a 2 hand over the head chop...  -.-<br />
I wouldnt get hopes up on it changing anytime soon though , its just one of those lil things that doesnt matter much that will go on for months and years without being fixed. You know simple stuff like PoG's and affliction efficency, unimportant things :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree<br />
<br />
With the old models, you did a bonk then a poke.  Then Luclin came out and they upgraded it to just a poke.<br />
<br />
/boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Powers That Be have even mentioned wanting to fix this animation.  Seriously, how hard is it to send the &quot;2hb&quot; animation to a different subroutine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This has been an annoyance since I first noticed it in unrest way back around july 1999. I'm surprised its still like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shandy mentioned about them acknowledging the lameness of animations.  And it goes for many other animations they agree that blow.<br />
They said they'll like to fix them, but don't recall if they actually will.  Maybe it'll be an expansion &quot;feature.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Besides the poor 2hb animation, I really dislike the one barbarian animation when standing still.  I prefer to stand up straight like when nude (waiting for rez), not slouching swaying my head around like an iksar.  I also dislike the female running animation.  It is like Conan O'Brien doing his Anna Nichole Smith impersonation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally, I'd rather have a sitting bearform animation.  Actually I would like the whole bearform animation revamped so that it actually looks like something instead of the crap we get.<br />
<br />
If druids can sit why can't we.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yah agree with everyone.<br />
1. Add sit to bearform.<br />
2. Fix 2hb animation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Old models and 2hpiercing broke fairly recently and now use the 1h piercing animation also.  So it really can't be that hard =)<br />
<br />
2HPiercers should use the 2HBlunt animation, 2HBlunts should use the 2HSlash animation, it would make so much more sense visually, if your hitting something with a sledge hammer, you don't poke them with it, you swing it round into them =(</div></div><hr />

So THATS how I get 2449 posts....<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I agree too...</div></div><hr />

It would be wonderful if VI would retweak the PoS bear model and use that for bearform, bar the face, that model is fantastic and even has all the animations already there =(</div></div><hr />

You guys are really asking for it on this one...   I think they don't have a clue how to draw bears sitting...  we're either going to look like a bear/wolf sitting or we're going to lay down.  Fact is, bears don't really like sitting upright all that much, their front legs aren't that long.  They tend like to lounge much better....<br />
<br />
Oh, and is it going to help you if we get a sitting graphic but they don't change our eye level?  You still won't know uf you're sitting or not...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Change Bear Form to Raven Form and use the blood raven model from PoN. Why any selfrespecting Iksar, or Frog... or anyone else but Barbs and Ogres, would want to be a plump Bear is beyond me /boggle.</div></div><hr />
