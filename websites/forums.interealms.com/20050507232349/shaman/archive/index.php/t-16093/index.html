<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, I, as most of you, have made a twink or two in my time.  I enjoy twinking the hell out of them too.  Obviously money is a problem for most of us, but what if it wasn't?  How uber could you get your twink?  I'd like to let people create a dream set of armor and assign points to it and see who gets the highest amount of points.  Now, don't do this if you aren't bored, it just sounds like some fun if you have nothing to do at work or something.  Here we go:<br />
<br />
RULES:<br />
<br />
1.  no no drop gear<br />
2.  all gear must be all/all<br />
3.  no level restricted gear (you wanna be a stud level 1)<br />
4.  you may equip a shield, but no weapons<br />
5.  Chest slot will be taken by a Fungi Tunic, no choice<br />
6.  If a piece has negative stats, you must subtract those as well.<br />
7.  no stat food<br />
8.  you may not count wis and int. Pick one or the other<br />
<br />
THE POINTS<br />
<br />
5hp = 1 point<br />
1ac = 1 point<br />
5sta = 1 point<br />
every 1% of haste = 1 point<br />
10 mana = 1 point<br />
5 wis or int = 1 point<br />
<br />
Melees will probably be best suited for your dream twink, but it doesn't have to. I gave hp such a strong point total because I love seeing a level 1 with 1k hp unbuffed.  There you have it... have fun, tell me what your point total is, here is a template to put your gear into if you wanna share with us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, this isn't how I'd actually twink anyone, and I couldn't get that close to 1000 hp anyway, what with the all/all restriction (which the fungi belies anyway!), but:<br />
