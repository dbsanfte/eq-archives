<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">for as long as i have played EQ, i have always tried to do my best to stay on top of various miscellaneous effects items that may be useful for me as a shaman. maybe i have always just been missing something, but this information has never been readily available in any sort of organized manner. about the closest you could get would be scrolling through enormous lists of items that included every kind of effect, useful or non-useful in existance. <br />
<br />
for clarity's sake, an example for shadow knights would be holgresh elder beads. the effect is useful for the class, because they have a lot of beneficial spells that can only be cast via an npc. things like focus items, +effects, and class specific gear are somewhat obvious and easy enough to find. <br />
<br />
i am more than willing to put together and host a page for this, but there is no way i can gather all the information on my own. however, if people posted items they are aware of or use themselves that are useful to the class, i'm sure it would end up being a pretty useful reference, and probably lead to most of us seeing a couple of ideas we never thought of before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">http://samanna.net/gear/clickies.shtml</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://samanna.net/gear/clickies.shtml<br />
<br />
<br />
that is handy, but it is nowhere near complete, and most of the items really arent very useful at all for normal play. <br />
<br />
really what i'm aiming for is something more filtered, with more explanation, created by the shaman community.<br />
<br />
maybe i'm way off on this, but i would imagine that there are probably a lot of items out there that i know exist, but do not realise the practical value of. for instance, i've had an AoN for years, but it wasn't until shortly before the release of GoD that i realised it could be used to bring  a mount to an instant stop by the activation of the illusion respawning the horse model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">another example would be shield of striding. it has the same effect as the original pegasus cloak. the instant levitation allows you to gain about 6 feet of vertical eq space on the last place you were standing, which would allow someone to take the back entrance into vox's lair back in the day. it had a unique function, but by simply looking at a link of the item without using it, it would probably never cross a person's mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">click levi can't be used to fly anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it caps at about 6 eq feet...<br />
<br />
anyways, it was just an example of how just looking at links isn't the same. <br />
<br />
if there's no interest, than so be it, but if there is, i will make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AoN is also very useful in that it make you slightly harder to target in PVP, since the skelly is &quot;harder&quot; to click on to target.<br />
<br />
AoN is also very useful for when someone shrinks you and you dont want that, you just click it to reset your size.<br />
<br />
(not to mention being a life saver when Jester turns you in to A Protector Of Fire and your wizard starts blasting you to hell, pvp servers only though)<br />
<br />
Eye of Zomm can be used by necros as portable healing since they can life tap it (or atleast was before).<br />
<br />
So a list would be really cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">beads/probe are probably as useful to shaman as any other class up until the point of hitting content where pet pulling is shutdown. back when i camped SoS in cazic thule, i just sat in the little side hall to the throne room, sent eye all the way to the top floor, targetted, sent pet, watched for first hit, ran disciple back through about 15 mobs, and killed him solo :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A person who would flood such a list with both useful and marginally useful clickies is Asta Khaan of Vallon Zek. He is retired now but during his active days he could do the obscurest quests to gain items that might give help him, as long as there was a slight chance they would give him an edge in PVP...<br />
<br />
I'm sad to report I do not possess any of his tricks, but I have a vague memory of him talking about some quest for some mage only item that had the effect Reclaim Energy, in order be able to check if he might be able to gain mana (via inventory click) from his Dogburn petarmy.<br />
<br />
His guild always assumed that if something dropped and had an effect he would want it, so people used to pass stuff along to him.<br />
<br />
My standing advice for him was to get a personal Gnome to carry his golf-bag of clickies for him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">... and speaking of PVP and items with effects, I have to mention one of Asta's PVP kills, wich in my eyes is the best kill ever.<br />
<br />
The bridge to Icelad was usually one of the places where PVP would happen back in the days. Asta had his knockback-stick equipped and is jousting an enemy cleric when suddenly he gets a proc and - WHAPPP - he send the cleric flying.<br />
<br />
I have no idea why, but somehow something must bugged because the cleric landed in the RyGorr fort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The minor Reclaim Energy sploit with Spirit Call was very short lived.  Shaman can no longer click any item with Reclaim Energy on it (there were like 8 of them), and in any case all the zergpets were fixed to have a 0 return, so even magicians can't do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh boy, did I laugh. I'd have paid money to see that. <br />
I used to be terrified of that fort, lol.</div></div><hr />
