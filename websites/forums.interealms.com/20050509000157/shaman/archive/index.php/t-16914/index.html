<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone played with a Spell Guard 4 proc yet? <br />
<br />
I've heard it's approx a 700 hp spell-only rune that lasts for ~5 minutes, interested to hear information like proc rate, and whether canni4 eats the rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't know about Guard 4 specifically, but in general Canni does eat runes.  There's a bard song or two that grants rune-type damage absorbtion, these are awesome when canning.  There's also gloves in Vex Thal that have clicky rune and that allows you to cann without taking damage (10 second cast time though, bleah).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure if Canni would eat it (probably though, given how it's worked in the past), but Spall Guard IV reduces spell dmg by 5%, up to a max of 300hp, so for a Canni5, it'd suck up about 96hp of the dmg.  I suppose that might be handy at some point, but there are probably a lot of more beneficial augments out there for the price.<br />
<br />
I guess if you could keep it on all the time, you could look at it like a 5% increase in hp though, which isn't too shabby.</div></div><hr />
