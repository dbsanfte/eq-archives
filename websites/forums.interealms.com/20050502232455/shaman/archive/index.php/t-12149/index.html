<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know the location of the impassive sea spirit in Gulf on Gunthak ? I'm just starting this quest and I'm completely unfamilar with the zone. <br />
I have the walkthrough on the quest but it never mentions where the sea spirit is located. Hopefully I will have Stoicism very soon, as Torpor is well out of my reach. Unguilded, broke, casual ghetto Shaman in da house !!!! <br />
<br />
On a side note I just finished Canni II quest last night after 8 levels of headaches trying to get lucky with drops on the clay and shaman powder. /clap</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't have the loc here, since I'm at work, but he is floating in the prow of a shipwreck, very close to the beach. You enter the wreck from the stern, which is just a big open gap, with an elemental-looking critter on each side that you can't target. Just swim forward through the wreck to the prow, and you'll see him there. He's smaller than I expected, so I had to get pretty close before I saw him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The drunken pirates are found by following the RH wall when you zone in from Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Zone in invis because the scouts at the zone in area have a big aggro range and are tough for their level. <br />
<br />
While invis, follow the RH wall until you come to an alleyway behind a row of small buildings - the pirates are in the buildings. There is a good little &quot;safe spot&quot; next to a barrel type still in the alleyway. <br />
<br />
You can go into the buildings invis and target a drunken pirate, then go back to your pull spot and cast on them from there - it worked for me, anyway. I would pull with slow, and their pathing was long enough to land another spell before they arrived. It took me about 12 or so kills to get the bottle</div></div><hr />
