<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick spell line-up/cast question on slowable high level mobs (tier 3).  I got pounded the other night on Icestrike (BoT Ornate BP mold mob), and couldn't get slow to stick.  I was the only shaman.<br />
<br />
Started with Malos<br />
Cast Turgur's...resisted<br />
Cast Turgur's...resisted<br />
Malosinia...resisted.<br />
Cast cloud of grummus...resisted.<br />
Cast Turgurs...resisted<br />
<br />
Summoned...Pounded.<br />
<br />
Mob was also Tashed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestions?  I see in the Medicine cabinet he's slowable.  I'm sure having another shaman or two helping out would have avoided the summon/pound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malicious decay before you try to disease slow.<br />
<br />
I'm not very familiar with BoT named but I do remember them resisting tons.<br />
<br />
All I can say other than that is to keep trying.  Wait a second or 2 between casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For most all bot nameds you should open with malo(s), then Malicious decay and then spam grummus and sinia. If you confident of your tanks aggro abilities, then you can spam grummus and turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, afterwards thought malicious decay should have been in the mix, then grummus probably would have stuck.  I was surprised I lasted as long as I did before I was summoned (even though I was standing next to the tank under the mob).  Medicine cabinet said he is magic slowable, but grummus slow would have beat the mob.  Chanter was next to join me loading...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Use root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are several mobs listed as magic slowable but you'll use up a mana bar trying to get it to stick even with debuffs. Going Maliciious Decay/Grummus is a huge help and will often land on these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I notice it helps if I'm standing RIGHT next to the mob, especially on BOT named mobs. I've cast Decay, had it land, been resisted on Grummus, then moved up and had Grummus land on first cast. I was always told slowing from within melee range is Shaman 101, but sometimes the small details escape us.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The reason slowing from melee range is &quot;shaman 101&quot; is because it doesn't make the mob run across the room (away from all the melees gathered around it) if you get more agro than the tank.  Melee range does not help slows land, except in cases where you have to be in melee range for any spell to land (this is mostly on older mobs, not PoP stuff).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye Gwain. Just odd that I find it easier to slow a BOT named from within melee range. I don't believe I've ever landed a slow of any kind except those cast right next to the named. Are these just freak incidents? Have others had this experience in BOT or other POP zones?<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some BoTs are hard to slow without Tash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did you have charisma up?<br />
<br />
<br />
;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That particular tower boss (Einride Icestorm I assume) is too resistant to bother with magic based spells.  It mitigates to &quot;slightly&quot; or something anyways, so just disease slow with MD.  Brynju Thunderclap is also easily disease slowed.  Don't even bother casting slows on the other two tower bosses.<br />
<br />
You will do more harm than good to your raid if you get summoned and the mob turns his directional mana-tap on your clerics.  Positioning him is more important than slowing him really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Damn ... no, I wasn't charisma buffed. Come to think of it, I wasn't facing Northeast either. More like North by Northeast. I'll buff up and face the right direction, and see if slow sticks. Like I said, Shaman 101. Anyone have any pudding ?  :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Malos, Tash, Malosina and then Turgurs.  If theres no chanter then use Disease cause its very hard to land Turgurs without Tash and Malosinia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On most high-level PoP mobs, I won't even attempt a turgur's until malosinia stuck. And yea, I believe both proximity and cha play a role. I've had a pretty good success rate with this method too (slows landed on RD, RZTW, slowable BoT Bosses, etc.)<br />
<br />
- Malos<br />
- Get right under mob<br />
- Malosinia (repeat until sticks or it's taken too long to justify)<br />
- Turgurs<br />

Try buffing your charisma.<br />
Ooh, and maybe you can try spinning in circles while you cast!  That might work too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">No, the spinning in circles helps channeling.  :)</div></div><hr />

Granted, the group thought I was odd when I turned my back on them to face NE, but hell, it got it slowed. Imagine. The rumors are TRUE !!! Guess I'll start picking up those LDON charisma augs. :)<br />

That almost always works for me, although we sometimes have one shaman cast MD and grummus over and over to get some form of slow on, while the others malos/inia Turgurs.  Usually on BoT named, MM and RD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Spinning while casting = teh win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You forgot to take a couple swigs of minotaur hero's brew.  It helps with the spinning and automatically increases innate charisma.<br />
<br />
Your mana pool is also decreased, and the number of slows you can cast is reduced, so you also just solved the problem of pulling aggro.<br />
<br />
BTW, don't forget to hit that sense heading key before you cast slow.<br />

<br />
<br />
lol... Usually when I get to this point of justification, I sometimes wished I just nuked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You need to DR debuff him first, and then you can cast Grummus on him.  I did this last night with no malos and no tash ( we did not have a chanter ), and he was slowed with no problem.  Once he was slowed, then I Malosed him.<br />
<br />
I tried to cast Malosinia, but that was resisted, Cripple as well.  /shrugs<br />
<br />
As long as you DR debuff him first, you should be golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Time for some truths about slowing and debuffing.<br />
<br />
On any day that is a multiple of 3 you will need a charisma that is even number. Any day that is a multiple of 2 you need a charisma that is an odd number. And of course any day that is a multiple of 2 and 3 you may as well forget any debuffing or slowing as resists will just be insanely high no matter what you do.<br />
<br />
Any day that has the word &quot;day&quot; in it, you should start with Malos, then Malosinia, and then attempt Tugurs.<br />
<br />
And finally, yes, today's patch did increase resists and fizzle rates.<br />
<br />
ps. I have a bridge in N.Karana that is for sale if anyone would like to buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">your doing it all wrong folks...<br />
<br />
come on guys, using malo and insidious decay? learn your spell books people!<br />
<br />
ok, you start by casting spirit pouch.  Hand this over to the mob.<br />
<br />
Then you fire off a true north and a sense animal (make sure you have the 2nd highest person on the hate list targeted!  Anyone else, and you just wasted the mana)<br />
<br />
Now, you tiny companion the mob (don't pay any attention to the red message saying it didn't stick... It stuck) and finally end with an invigor on the MT.  After it lands, simply fire off a turgurs, and you're in business.<br />
<br />
P.S.  contrary to popular belief, charisma does not effect the landing of any of these spells, however, you MUST have your Agility maxed for this meathod to work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Getting higher level mobs debuffed is often a coordination of multiple classes.<br />
<br />
For a raid, I prefer to have a debuf chat channel with enchanters, mages and shaman.<br />
<br />
Shaman leads with malos can calls it out in channel. Malos is very low aggro. Next the enchanter tashes. After Tash is called, shaman tries to Turgurs while mage tries to Malosinia.  Doesn't always get you there on resistant mobs, but this is usually the best approach.<br />
<br />
Call slow resists in group so that the group healer knows to watch your health if they can.<br />
<br />
And those of you that believe in Cha and standing under the belly of a mob, just do it. <br />
<br />
I try to adapt to the situation. With some mobs I can stand at a distance and slow.  If I pull aggro, I get summoned.  If however the mobs run to me when I aggro, this is a bad thing so I adjust and stand next to the Main Tank when I slow.  I believe for certain mobs, you are less likely to have slow resisted if you are within melee range.  This was the case resently when I farmed ice giant toes in permafrost.  Greenie mobs to a 65 shaman and I still needed to back up against a wall and channel my slowes, dots and roots at close range.  Rooted mobs at a distance were resisted often and burned too much mana.  And this isn't just old world mobs, at 4-way in Baston of Thunder, it also seemed that I was less likely to get resisted when I was closer to the mob.  <br />
<br />
And relative to Cha, I am a believer. I spent roughly half of my EQ time from level 53 to level 59 two boxing a monk in the basement of Karnors before Luclin came out.  If I couldn't slow the mob right away, I got behind and had to spam heal resulting in a long med break or a train to the zone.  Over and over again I saw strings of resisted slows, cast Cha, then only occasional resists.  After that experience, I almost always have Cha on myself, be it an LDoN group or a Elemental/Time raid.  If I have too many bufs and I am worried about mob effects overwritting my good bufs, I don't hesitate to remove Cha after I've removed haste, ranger attack bufs and other stuff I consider useless.<br />
<br />
It cost so little time and mana to cast, I just do it. I don't care to argue with people about the value of Cha, they have their opinions and knowledge base, I have mine.  And I don't think anyone cares or notices that I cast Cha on myself after I hit the tanks. <br />
<br />
I'm sure am glad that my Shroud of the Stoncrafter (DRU CLR SHM) has a 5% channeling mod and CHA+15. Hey why they put Cha on this and other high end gear? Oh yeah, so I can get better prices from merchants.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Malicious Decay+Grummus.<br />
<br />
Highly MR mobs aren't worth bothering with turgurs unless you have a horde of shaman, or you absolutely need turgur's to stand a chance in hell of winning. Switch to nuking or patch healing once you stick grummus.<br />
<br />
Other tips <br />
<br />
- make sure enchanter is tashing and bard is singing hos. With those two debuffs on top of malos, you have a much greater chance.<br />
<br />
- Cast sinia between slow attempts, firstly you have to wait for slow to refresh anyway, and secondly it makes you wait a bit longer and gives teh MT more time  to get aggro<br />
<br />
- if you get aggro and die, you haven't helped your guild at all. Try to stay alive :)</div></div><hr />
