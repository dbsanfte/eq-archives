<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have the 5 non lore but trying to get this lore on good grieff its giving me nightmares. :(   paying 1kpp to any broodling that has it in there bags but still no luck :/<br />
<br />
/em ties the nose and then jumps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll be joining you in starting the cudgels after I ding 60. Not looking forward to the mindless camping and I have to start from the very beginning :/<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ah did this camp when i dinged 34 and im glad i got it out of the way! i did notice something peculiar.....if you wait for the crusader on the stairs (where he or PH will walk up &amp; down them) he will almost certainly never pop. the last 30 mins i ever spent in kurns he spawned 3 times in a row! he seems to pop more if you are away from the stairs when the PH will pop. i was up entertaining a young warrior broodling who was camping that darn mole. set muh timer for 10 mins then ran upstairs to helm keep the skelles cleared so he could grab tha mole. the last 3 times it poped it was the crusader! /cheer<br />
as i said whenever the pop happened and i was near enough to actually SEE tha pop it was allways a PH, the only crusaders that ever spawned for me did so away from my presence, so maybe this guy is just a little shy....<br />
hope this info will help someone get through this horrible, mind numbing beeotch of a camp! (with sanity intact)<br />
if tha cudgels are our mini epic then this has gotta be tha test of patience!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3 weeks patience? thats crazy hehe<br />
<br />
well i got it anyhows. on Heriophant cudgel now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nochnaya Zhara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had just the opposite problem.   I got 2 LORE ones in a row (if you can use &quot;in a row&quot; when there is a 2hr wait in between) needless to say i was extremely P/Oed and stopped camping that for the day at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Best not to camp him, just run over there when you log on and kill a couple spawns see if he shows, then when you're going to log off for the night do it again and see if he shows.  The way I figured it works was like some sort of queue of spawns, where when a certain time limit was reached (2 hrs? 4 hrs?), he jumped to the front of the queue, and when you killed the PH, he spawned next.  It takes a while to get them, but there's no reason to sit in the top of kurns killing greenies for hours waiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I twinked a heck out of an Iksar warrior, leveled him to 10-12 or so, put a fungi on him, and had him camp the Crusaders for XP.<br />
<br />
You could probably do something similar with most any class to make it at least somewhat more interesting.<br />
<br />
I did the first 4-5 quests ... maybe over a year ago.  The sixth shortly after it came out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as I can tell, there isn't any timer on the Undead Crusader spawns - it's a straight-up matter of one (the rare one) of a set of skellies on a particular spawn table.  I had a couple of instances where I managed to catch Crusaders within a spawn or two after the last one went down (less than a half hour apart.)  From what I can tell, the wandering skellies in that part of the tower (second floor from the top) can all spawn as a Crusader, but none of the static skellies will.<br />
<br />
When I first started camping the Crusader, we only knew of one spawn point for it - on the curving stairs up to that floor on one side.  There was a skellie that would spawn there and wander up and down the stairs.  After getting frustrated and going on a mass slaughter to relieve the tedium, I found a Crusader in one of the other wanderer's paths elsewhere on that same floor.  About that time, other people had started reported finding the Crusader in other wandering skellie spots.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to get on that floor and kill anything that moves and ignore anything that doesn't ;)</div></div><hr />
