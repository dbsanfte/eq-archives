<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do shamans just have crappy gods who don't bless us with well designed spells?  How do they justify us having an inferior buff that costs more and lasts less to a comparable druid buff?  Focus/7 vs Blessin/9</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahem ... this was the change from Oct 4th ... which has been mentioned on several posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nm then. my mistake. saw the date in details and didn't look in history.  thought it was a new change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">NP ... expecting it to change sometime today anyway ... hopefully into something better.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Akaylas-Fearstheshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All I'm going to say is this is much better than it used to be, and I'm not complaining at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For 1800 mana, anything short of 2.0 hours is a damn joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have to agree , this is better , but the duration is insane. i mean at this level we are gong to take on some serious things , i think we should be looking at a time frame thats equal to c3 and such high end buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Akaylas-Fearstheshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">544 hp, 75 str, 70 dex group buff for 1800 is a lot better than a single target hp buff for 480 hp and 1000 mana, 60 minute duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spell is still rediculous. 1 hour 20 minutes on a spell casted at level 65. Stupid and unacceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>elder zalkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i saw on castersrealm that focus of the 7th was obtained in Western Wastes, its prob just bull ****, but would like someone to confirm that it is bull**** =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well can't confirm that I've recieved it from a shadowy parchment hand in because I havent handed one in nor am I likely to anytime soon, but that is the way it should work.<br />
<br />
Castersrealm says Acumen of Dar Khura is a single target buff and that you can buy Paralysing Earth from vendors. The site is notorious for innacuracies on spell details so I would be 99% sure of saying that the info is what you suspect it to be, untrue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Woodoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hehe aye, as seredith said...<br />
<br />
 that site never had trustworthy info, probely never will.</div></div><hr />
