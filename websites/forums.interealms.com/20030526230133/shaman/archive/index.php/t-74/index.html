<br />
Just hail all the barbarians in that hut. You're bound to find the right one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes I'm sure.  The woman McMerin is the quest giver for McMerin's Feast (Cann II), and she is also the herb vendor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">his name is alex mcmarrin all the way at the back of the hut. my running tab is 4shroud of spirits 4 talisman of shadoo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zoggmak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When i did my trade in for these spells, i had 1 copy of each of the 4 required. In return i received 4 different spells. <br />
I am not sure if this was a fluke or not but it worked for 2 other shaman that i know as well.<br />
Anyway good luck with the spells guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hey AvalachW - come to Stormhammer and I'll give you a Torrent of Poison in exchange for ID and Shroud! I'll even throw in a 100pp. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">zogg, did u turn in all 4 spells at the same time? probably not as i imagine you'll only get one spell back? so i assume just one for one, and you happened to &quot;randomly&quot; get 4 different ones back? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got about 4 torrent of poison before I got anything else ;O took about 12 turn-ins to get Shroud..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have done the turn in quest over 30 times now, and haven't got a shroud yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The Key is to turn in all 4 of them at the same time.<br />
<br />
The first time I did this, I turn in all 4 spells at the same time, got all 4 spells in return.<br />
<br />
The second time I do this for my shaman friend, I turn 3 in first, got three different spells, then I went to my bank and get the last one out, give to the quest giver. Booooo, I got an extra copy of Shroud. :( <br />
<br />
Then later on my druid got all four spells from drop, wanna test it I went back to the dock and turn in two spells each time, got two different spell each time, but at the end I got two Talisment of Shadoo.<br />
<br />
So I assume no matter how many spells you turn in, you will never get two same spell in one return.  So turn in all four at the same time is the way to get all four spells in return. Try it floks!:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Or maybe turn in 4 copies of Spirit of Scale, as that seems to be the most common of the required spells (certainly the one I keep looting).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There is a NPC in the basement of the Shaman Guild in Cabilis that gives out spells for spells.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if he gives out the same spells as the one in FV??<br />
<br />
I know he does give out Talisman of Shadoo as I got it from him for Spirit of Scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks wontonn, i might actually see a copy of shroud.  I had a bet with myself that I would get malo and torpor before I got that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zoggmak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes Bryelle, i did trade them in at the same time. I did it like Wontonn sugested, have all 4 trade in spells on you at the time of trade in, and just give 1 at a time until you have passed in all 4. Do not hand in 4 spells at once.<br />
Well, that is what has worked for me. Like i said before, not sure if it was a fluke or not. I would test it for you guys but i am kinda KoS in the port in OT right now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Darn Zoggmak you just confused me, but that is not hard as I am a troll :)<br />
<br />
Ok do we put all four of the spells in the trade window at the same time?? Or do we stand there with 4 spells in our inventory and hand in one at a time, but make sure you hand in 4 one right after the other??<br />
<br />
It was sounding to me like we put all 4 in the trade window at the same time until Zoggmak said &quot;just give 1 at a time until you have passed in all 4. Do not hand in 4 spells at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da Lump</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Has anyone confirmed that turning in 4 spells of the same type will result in all 4 possible returns being handed back?<br />
<br />
Has anyone confirmed that turning in 4 DIFFERENT spells results in all 4 possible returns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Was told it's totally random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As I mention in my message above, I turned in 4 different spells, got all 4 different in return. Second time I turned in three different spells, got 3 different at return.  Third time I turned in two spell each time, each time I got two different spells returned to me at the same time.  <br />
<br />
So what I can say is if you turn in ALL 4 DIFFERENT quest spells at the SAME TIME you will get 4 DIFFERENT spells back.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it works if all 4 spells you turn in are the same spell thou, go try it out if ya want. I'm thur that part already. )<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Handing in 4 copies of Spirit of scale got me 3 different and one copy, then i handed in cripple and landed my fourth<br />

Luckeee me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I turned in all 4 different spells at the same time.  Shadoo and 3 Shrouds.  <br />
<br />
Of course, that's how my luck generally goes...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">So then, what shandy and my own attempt has confirmed then is that:<br />
<br />
Turning in all 4 DIFFERENT spells at once DOES NOT give you all 4 of the different quest spells.<br />
<br />
So can we please stop hearing all this about handing in all 4 spells at once.  It doesn't work.  It is a myth based on a lucky turn in that someone had.<br />
