<br />
Been coming back to this board in hopes that someone had a great idea for the early 40's... I am almost to 42 and would like to get to 44 asap. Loot is always nice, as spells cost money, but the main goal is to lvl. <br />
<br />
The Yeti's in DL are pretty weak for xp. Echo Caverns seems to come up often, but is this a faction disaster for a Barbarian shaman? Pardon my ignorance on this one...I don't think it's contageous. <br />
<br />
I don't get a ton of time to play, so when I get on, I want to make the most of it. Any suggestions? All responses are welcome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to Echo Caverns, not secrete side.  Kill underbulks, fiends and grabbers.  Mostly single pulls at 44.  great exp underbulk claws sell for a few pp ea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well from level 39-44 I hunted in Tembuous Mountians (Spelling??) at the Grimling caves.  Only real peice of equipment I have is an inky breat Plate with AC around 700ish AC (at 39).  <br />
<br />
Useing KEI and my pet I easly hunted at the caves there.  The grimlings hit the least hard there though I could kill most any of the bats, wolfs, and non-Named Aliens with slow Poison Dot and Pet with me meeleing.  Down time was little if any and the EXP was at least 1.5% a kill at 39.  They were good exp all the way up to about the end of 44 where most are light green by that time.  Loot there is also quite nice seeing as the grimlings drop Acrylia ore that sales in the bazaar for more then 20pp depending on your server.  As well there windstones that drop there that sale for 100pp or more depending on your server.  Over all I would give the place an 8 on zone rating.  Only problem I had there was every so often there would be a lvl 50 there farming ore in one caves and I would have kill bats and wolfs till they left.  Most times though they would end up sharing if they saw I was there mainly for exp.</div></div><hr />
