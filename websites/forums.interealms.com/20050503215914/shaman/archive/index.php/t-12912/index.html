<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Funniest thing happened to me the other night, I logged on in PoV and started the usual soloing of Razorfiends to waste the hour I had spare (not worth getting a group for this period of time) and torpor was rooting me instead of snaring. I had to click it off.<br />
<br />
I thought about camping and logging back in or even zoning but could not be bothered, made for a challenging hour of soloing though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Were you overweight?  Maybe didn't have sow on or something?  Tried to back up instead of strafing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You had walk on instead of run most likely.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If you have it set in your Eqclient.ini to turn run on for you, then you forget to check this often, and if you ever LD to the serverselect, and return to game it will not load the client properly, and you are set to walk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You had walk on instead of run most likely.<br />
<br />
This is why :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">65 and forget to turn on run.....<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah Caanus you hit the nail on the head thanks, a friend was using my acct, I was on with another acct and they said they would /q out so I could log on my shaman. When I hit &quot;Brell&quot; on the server select I arrived in the world without a char selection screen.<br />
<br />
I bet this is the same problem you described.<br />
<br />
Turley, so you remeber to turn on run each time you log on? damn aint you clever, ever heard of setting run to default in eqclient.ini?<br />
<br />
Get with the program :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My run is set to default, and I'm just picking on him. :)  Have to admit, not being able to move at lvl 65 and being like, &quot;***?&quot; is pretty funny considering it is something that you expect a lvl 1 n00b to do.  I have seen quite a few people walking around in newbie zones because they don't know how to turn on run.  I guess I'm just easily amused.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And by the way I got confused and thought that Jinheim was admitting that's what he'd done and didn't realize you were the one who started the post :)  So, I hope you are not offended by my schoolgirlish giggling ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I noticed this same thing over the last few weeks .... torpor rooting instead of snaring, seemed to be happening only in CT to me. Run was turned on and not overweight, neither sow nor lev had any effect.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is an effect that only occurs in certain zones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Happened to me tonight in BoT - every time I cast torpor I was rooted :(<br />
<br />
Didn't think to check if run was on as I have it on by default in client.ini <br />
<br />
Edit Just checked client.ini and RunMode=True (I assume this means auto-run is on still)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It means when you log in that run mode is active, however if you ever hit CTRL - R then you deactivate runmode, this is VERY easy to do on accident while trying to SHIFT ALT R out of the game in normal window mode, and even easier to do on accident if you use EQW with CTRL ALT R.<br />
<br />
   YOu can go to options and keyboard, then remove the capability to use CTRL R to toggle run/walk, then you never have to worry about it again.</div></div><hr />
