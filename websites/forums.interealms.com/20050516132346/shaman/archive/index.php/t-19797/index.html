<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Like the topic says I got my first glyphed rune today in BoT. it dropped off a named mob at the West camp. This was pretty suprising to me since I didn't think that runes dropped at all here except rarely off the larger named. I turned it in anyways and got my Fo7 spell and now I am trying to keep from selling it in order to finance all my other spells. It was my first group in BoT also so was a good day all around. Guess my question is how rare are the runes really?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty rare, never seen one from Laef, only 1 from Oreen, none in West and one in South. If you camp the end 4 mobs all day and night your likely to see 2, perhaps 3</div></div><hr />

1 rune out of 7-8 tower bosses i'd say (1st floor)<br />
