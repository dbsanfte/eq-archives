<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>svaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, what's everyone's opinon on this shield?  It looks to be +10 str +10 wis 25 ac +55 mana +55 hp, seems really nice compared to say, the sarnak battle shield or the crystal chitin shield?<br />
  <br />
     It apparently drops in 'The Grey' off of a named mob 'Heirophant Grazan'.  Eqmaps offers no further information, althought some people have noted that this Heirophant spawns near the SD zone.<br />
<br />
     I was there last night duoing with a monk friened, and the immediate question is.... *** does this mob spawn?  Is he a roamer?  What are his ph(s)?  What does this mob look like?  Is it a rock type mob, a golem, a shissar, or a skeleton?<br />
<br />
     Lastly, is this mob/drop so uncommon that  it would be crazy to expect to be able to loot this if not for pure luck?<br />
<br />
     Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The mob is a skele... I think other killing other skeles cause him to spawn. A tracker would help. He does drop other items as well, so you are not guaranteed the shield... Nice item though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hierophant Grazan is an undead skell in the north east corner of the zone. There are lots of skells there. Keep killing them until Hierophant Grazan pops. Not a roamer. He has three drops. Clattering Bone Necklace is common, Bone Handled Scimitar is uncommon, and Bone Braced Buckler is rare. You can see him wielding the scimitar or the shield when he has them. He spawns, like all the skells, in a little pile on the ground. You cant see any of the items he is holding until he agros and stands up. Druids like to kite here so you better have a tracker to help or you likely wont get him. Druids love this guy since the shield and scimitar are both good druid items. I got mine duoing with a ranger for exp when I was 54.<br />
<br />
It is IMO superior to the shield of Bane Warding for a shaman because of the hp. It is also less commonly seen for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>svaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the in-depth description, chief.  Hopefully me and my duo partner(s) can bag this fellow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This item showed up in General a month or so ago.   The concensus seemed to be that the BBB is a great shield if you are hurting for Wis/mana and don't need the resists of a SBS.  It is much better than a CC shield IMO, but the graphic is a bit dated :p<br />
<br />
Personally, I would never drop my SBS for this, but it really depends on where you spend most of your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sarnak Battle shield is a good resist item and every shaman should have one (unless they have Shield of Wurms or something). But its not the shield of choice for everday use unless you only raid ae mobs everyday. Mine is bagged pretty much everywhere except for HoT.<br />
<br />
If you can only have one shield and had to get it quick with limited funds Id say buy a SBS.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for well rounded equipment and are willing to put in some time, buy a SBS and camp the BBB.</div></div><hr />
