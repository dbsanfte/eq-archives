<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got an email to my private account this morning (my ISP's hosted account, not hotmail which I use for most public things), from support@microsoft.com that I have no idea what it is about. Copied it below:<br />
 <br />
From:  support@microsoft.com <br />
Date: Tuesday, May 20, 2003 9:19 pm<br />
To:  Wulfie's real email @ his isp.ca<br />
Subject:  Re: Movie<br />
 <br />
All information is in the attached file.<br />
&lt; attached: application.pif (52.7 KB) &gt;<br />
 <br />
And that is it.<br />
 <br />
I have no idea what its about as I refuse to open the attachment (I'm gunshy since I got burned on the ILOVEYOU virus on my machine at work: was in and opened it on an email from a coworker, before the alarm was up to the public). Also my virus scan has been intercepting a lot of email viruses lately, which also raises my hackles a bit. This attachment didn't get the boot by Norton, but I have no idea andwas wondering if it could be something new, and possibly ahead of the viruscan updates.<br />
 <br />
Anyone have any ideas?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Also, you can look at the headers of the email to see if in fact came from Microsoft or if it is merely spoofing the address. <br />
 <br />
If it were me, I would delete it outright.</div></div><hr />
