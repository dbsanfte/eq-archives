<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately I've been trying to add another spectrum of fun, and I'm wondering if there were previous posts or maybe a more updated post on how to PvP against Pallys, Sk's, Rangers, and even mages (even though ehey're not a hybrid class) who are all  end-game players with over 100+ AA's.<br />
<br />
I hope from this thread some of you more seasoned PvP players could shed some light.  (On a side note, one thing that bugs me is having a mage summon 5 little elementals on you plus having their pet kick your ass.)</div></div><hr />
