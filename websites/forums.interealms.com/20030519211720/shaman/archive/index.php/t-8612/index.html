<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have noticed something odd lately in the arena in bazaar.<br />
<br />
Once I got tashed by an enchanter then snared by a ranger. I was being beat on by 4 or so people so I ran out to heal myself. I cast torpor and all of a sudden when it wore off I could move at regular speed. I looked at my buffs and snare was gone.<br />
<br />
Today again, a warrior tashed me while I was kiting him (4 levels above me with crazy resists and gear and he had 7k hp or somewhere in that range). He then proced snare on me and it stuck. I finally managed to stick blind and slow on and I torpored myself quickly. Again at the end of torpor, snare was gone. <br />
<br />
So, has anyone else noticed this? Just thought it was odd so I would bring it up.</div></div><hr />
