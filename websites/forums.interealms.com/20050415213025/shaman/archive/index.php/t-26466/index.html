<br />
your own rules state <br />
<br />
There's a chance that an SOE representative might post here to discuss shaman concerns. We have wanted this for a long time.<br />
<br />
I will be moderating any such threads very strictly. Everyone should remain polite and focused on shaman issues. No personal attacks, no attacks on SOE, no attacks on issues which are irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I will delete posts and grant one week suspensions. You have been warned. This is not up for discussion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rytan hasn't come here in months - how come you're now moderating any threads that have something less then nice to say about SOE? <br />
Somehow I see a conflict of interest looming - this board was always a place where you can say what gets deleted on the SOE boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can say whatever you want - just be civil. This has never been the board to scream and curse and threaten. I very rarely delete threads - there is little to no censorship here.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;these boards have always been the place&quot; - I've been the moderator for 3 years - these have been the standards as long as I've been a moderator (and how Sunmoon ran the place when he was sole moderator as well).</div></div><hr />
