<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm about at the end of my rope listening to people throw this red herring around.  Look.  Any discussion of class BALANCE must include references to other classes.  The shaman class cannot and does not exist in a vacuum.  On a shaman-only server, shamans would be completely balanced, now, wouldn't they?  Now we're hearing that our comments make too many references to other classes, and are too fraught with &quot;class envy&quot; for him to sort through.  (Specifically:  &quot;What I saw was a lot of ,the grass is greener, and class envy&quot;)<br />
<br />
This is just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
BALANCE.  (here's one definition): A harmonious or satisfying arrangement or proportion of parts or elements<br />
<br />
So... class balance.  Seems like that would HAVE to be something like finding the satisfying arrangement or proportion (abilities) of parts (classes) relative to each other.  How EXACTLY does one find proportion - or BALANCE - between parts, without making references to other parts?  Here's SoE (or their liason to us, anyway) pointing fingers at US the PLAYERS, saying that the reason they can't do anything to help our class is because WE aren't presenting our arguments in the correct way.  In the same breath, they seem to be telling us to present what we want without mentioning any other classes.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it's very comforting for the SoE employees to stand around the water cooler and laugh about the players, and their constant whining, and how they just run around in this senseless cycle of class envy and wanting every ability in the game.  However, I do NOT perceive this as being what the majority of shamans at the Crucible are doing.  And I'm sickened to see our OWN members starting to revert to this kneejerk type of commentary.<br />
<br />
So I guess I just want to know this.  How do you find balance by using a scale with only one side?  They seem to be admitting that there's a problem.  But our attempts to present some ideas and solution are met with typical corporate blame-shifting and illogical accusations.<br />
<br />
Or, maybe there's some way to propose balancing to our class without mentioning our abilities relative to other classes.  In this case, someone please do enlighten me.  *smile*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are correct.  You cannot have a discussion about balance without making reference to other classes, simply because they are part of the equation.  You also will not ever see an entire community agree on what should be done about anything; its human nature. <br />
<br />
That being said, IS there class envy between shaman and other classes?  Probably.  And why not?  Given our current situation, it seems pretty reasonable that people would experience some class envy.  <br />
<br />
That doesn't change the basic facts though -- if Sony is serious about realizing that the game is steadily moving away from areas where shaman are strong to areas where shaman are weak, then they should do something about it.  The shaman community has offered a number of suggestions (which could be used in part or in whole) that would satisfy them.  In fact, the shaman community has worked really hard to put forward suggestions for improvement.  If Sony were to pick one (*any one*) I imagine many shaman would be very pleased.  That proposal that was posted wasnt a list of demands, it was a document identifying problems and possible solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why not consider getting some prominent Beastlords, Clerics, and Druids, to come here and join in the discussions. If debate can be held civilly between the four classes perhaps consensus could be made. Right now I am sure if the other classes can be bothered to swing by they are either laughing at the the arguing, or waiting to see what changes are made and how they will impact their own class.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to break down a set of ideas regarding slowing, healing, and damage dealing that don't automatically cause other classes to get annoyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">now, the other thing to look at is balancing us against the mobs.<br />
<br />
the mobs are trending towards radically higher DPS and shorter fights, shaman don't have a way to combat that.<br />
<br />
shaman didn't get a comparable increase in my own DPS<br />
shaman didn't get any near enough new equipment to handle that<br />
shaman didn't get an increase in my healing ability to handle that.<br />
shaman pet did not increase to the point to handle that.<br />
shaman debuffing ability did not increase to handle that<br />
shaman slow did not increase to handle higher DPS mobs<br />
<br />
with summoning mobs and large DPS, the idea that shaman root is effective is no longer true and shaman cannot allow the time necessary for dots to do effective damage.<br />
<br />
i don't care about what other classes got.  balance me against the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd agree but I think what often happens is that to break down the shaman and its many different types of spells you end up comparing it to many other classes who DON'T have the same variety of the same spells and who might be designed to be better at the spell being compared than shaman.<br />
<br />
So you might say:<br />
<br />
Shaman suck at nuking compared to wizards.<br />
Shaman suck at healing compared to clerics.<br />
Shaman suck at melee compared to warriors.<br />
Shaman aren't as strong of dot casters as necros.<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
Some of these are drastic comparissons but I think the point is valid.<br />
<br />
Overall, it makes it seem like shaman are weak - but none of those classes has the same abilities as shaman.  When making such a comparisson one always fails to point out everything the other class lacks that shaman have.<br />
<br />
- Wizards lack a pet that does anything except hang out, slows, dots, buffs, debuffs, etc.<br />
- Clerics lack slows, debuffs, etc<br />
- Warriors lack all special abilities and can't even hold aggro that well usually.<br />
- Necros have lots of abilities specifically vs undead...hmm...necros have lots of abilities...but anyways<br />
<br />
There's plenty of overlap in class abilities/spells throughout the game and there's no rule that says that just because 3 classes share an ability that they should all be able to do it equally well.<br />
<br />
Compare the shaman in its entirety, in all the roles it can fill, vs all types of content, against all other classes, one at a time...and see how it measures up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Versatility isnt a strength in a  6 man group. Utility buffs come in potions, or from half the classes in the game. How many classes have e breath, invis and lev? Those shouldnt count towards balance. The ability to either nuke poorly or dot uselessly (due to how fast mobs die) isnt a strength, it just saddles us to crappy upgrades for either.<br />
<br />
I am sick and tired of being told I am the Mario. He was only good because you didnt have 5 others standing around to do each of his functions better. In a MMORPG, the generalist has to be above average in their capabilities for them to be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Beastlords slow AND deal excellent dps and buff better. Chanters slow AND add superior CC, and absurd charmed mob dps, in addition to VoQ/VQ. Bards can slow AND CC/Pull. I see no reason pointing to these classes and explaining why its essential we perform additional functions WELL, as opposed to poorly, which is what all of our other abilities amount to. We arent JUST slow people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">'There is no spoon'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaffo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you want to hear what a cleric thinks, then so be it:<br />
<br />
<br />
 First off, I have never seen the shaman class as a main healer in the high end zones. I always picture them as assist healers, debuffers, slowers, etc. I also never really think of shamans as a damage class. What I always see when I think of our guild shamans, they are the ones up front tagging mobs, taking a few hits, debuffing and slowing them, then droping a HoT on the tanks or who ever to make sure that the live long enough for the chain to get set. But as we all know the current state of EQ does not allow this to happen. So I will give a few ideas for ways in which I think the shaman class can be tuned to the current game play without jepordizing the lower level game. And before you flame me for focusing on the high end please keep in mind, that even though I play alts, my main is a high end cleric, and that is the only level of the game in which I can honestly speak. If you want suggestions aimed at that level you will need to have someone from that stage of the game make suggestions.<br />
<br />
  The areas in which I will make suggestions are as follows:<br />
<br />
1: Healing: This is a difficult thing to modify without influencing the lower level game, and without hurting other classes. And I am not refering to clerics and druids. For healing changes also effect melees, since the game is tuned toward healing primarly. And if you severely ncrease healing then most likely they will increase MOB DPS to balance it, thus possibly damaging melee balance. So what suggestions do I have for the shaman class as far as healing? <br />
  A)  First a shaman AA ability since I feel that anyone who gets the AA would be higher level, and if they aren't then o well. If that shaman invested the time required to obtain the AA ability at the cost of GOD AA's, and with the prerequistes, then they deserve it.<br />
 <br />
NAME: Spirit Focus<br />
3 levels 4/12/18.<br />
10/20/30 %<br />
reuse timer: I am not sure what a current and balanced timer would be.<br />
I was thinking 1min. Since this is mainly designed to help you with healing and allow you the flexibilty to do your other tasks.<br />
This ability allows the shaman to transfer a % of his own health to the tgt. The first level would allow him to transfer 10% of his HP's the second level 20% and the last level 30%. With the same zero agtr effect as the cleric AA divine arb.Since this is a tgted AA and not a spell I don't think that it should be influened by other AA's or focus. But I don't think that would be a problem, since it is very easy for a shaman to reach  7K+ HP's. At that would give a shaman a 2100 instant cast heal. And since it is based off the HP's of the shaman it would scale toward the level of the shaman. So as the shaman progressed threw the game and recieved more gear/HP's the heal would also increase. And since the main shaman mode of mana regen is canni which also requires the shaman's HP's I fell it would be balanced.<br />
<br />
And then increase the shaman HoT to 400 HP's tick for 5 ticks. The added duration and healing of the HoT would allow the shaman flexibility to do other things, since if the shaman used the HoT on himself he could sdebuff/slow and with the AA would also have time to prevent the death of the MT or caster. Also with the zero agro effect of the AA it would also help with the agro issues of healing + slowing.<br />
<br />
Then increase tnarg's to 1450 HP's for 475mana. <br />
<br />
I think these 3 changes would allow you the flexibility you need with out unbalancing the other classes. The only difficult part is finding the reuse time for AA, for you can't have it less than 1min due to the fact it is mana free, agro free, and at 2100 Healed (7K HP's) it is a very powerful heal to have access constently. However I think it has to remain no longer than 2min to be a usful tool, for if you placed it on the cleric Divine arb timer it wouldn't provide the o **** factor, and flexibility it is designed for.<br />
<br />
2. Buffs.<br />
 I have read most of the post's on this and I think since stats are becoming useless like you said then I think the best and simpliest soulution to this is to add +atk and a +4 endurance regen to Fo7. Those to would make it a highly desired melee buff, and since the endurance is added it will scale for the higher game. For I know we haven't really had the problem of endurance running out as of yet but I feel that as we get farther into GoD and as the game progress further that this will become more and more of a problem.<br />
<br />
3 Damage.<br />
<br />
  The problem here is that wilth the way the game is going that DoTs don't have time to be 100% effect. But this is ever more difficult to adjust without making the shaman class overpowered, and minimzing the other classes. I think the easiest way to do this is with a second DD, that when used with veilum strike could be effetive but since you would need to take up 2 spell gems to utizlize them together for good burst DPS then it would balance things. If you are given a single high damage low recast time DD, then I think that would create balance issues. Kinda along the same reasong path that cleric DD's/stuns have always been high recast, slow cast time to ensure that we can't be DPS and effective healers. So that would now hold true for shamans since you don't have the spell gems to memorize all your debuffs, slows, and heals, along with canni, and the other spells you need. So I think requiring you to use 2 DD's to be effective at burst DPS would be balanced. Anyone the spell idea is simple.<br />
<br />
Spell: Posion recourse:<br />
Damage: Decrease Hitpoints by 1000<br />
Resist Check: Posion<br />
Mana: 500<br />
cast time: 7.0<br />
recast time: 6.5<br />
<br />
  So as you can see it would allow you to do burst DPS but would not allow you to chain cast it. Since the issue is fights that won't allow your DoTs to run thier full time; So using this together with velium strike would allow you the burst DPS you want for those short fights, bu I dont think it would be unbalancing.<br />
<br />
  I hope I gave you some valid suggestions, I wouldn't have made this post if you had not asked for a cleric point of view. So if you do not like them then please give the reason why and maybe I can adjust better to your needs and come up with some other suggestions, or if you do not wish a cleric to add to your discussion then I will not post anymore on the subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alternate viewpoints are good.  I'm pretty sure I disagree with the whole AA-health-transfer thing (unless you want to give it to a necromancer, which would make alot more sense to me) but its still interesting reading.  <br />
<br />
I don't think shaman are looking for a huge set of changes.  A larger heal would be nice, OR a larger nuke, but both would be asking for too much in all likelihood.  An 1800 point heal (vs. 1300) would be a nice upgrade.<br />
<br />
Your point about the better healing triggering increased DPS from the mobs is very valid; I think, though, that the problem is that the increased DPS from the mobs was already triggered by the better healing given to druids and clerics.  The shaman just got left behind.<br />
<br />
The shaman class isnt horribly broken; its just that the game is moving in one direction (ultra fast encounters) while our abilities are still plodding along in the same direction (ultra slow encounters).  The shaman class needs to start changing directions or soon the game will be un-fun enough that people wont bother playing a shaman.  I'm having alot more fun with my enchanter, my beastlord, and my bard these days.<br />
<br />
PS:  &quot;Satisfaction Garunteed or 96% of your EXP back&quot; -- I love that.  It actually made me laugh.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like Jaffo's ideas, maybe some hammering out.  I figure the average 65 shaman has 3k+ hitpoints (after ND3), so by the time they'd hit the max they'd be putting out a 1k+ life swap.  I'd like to see maybe 50% at the top.  So shaman would be putting out 1.5k to 3k health swaps.  The other stuff I'd have to think about, but it basically sounds swell to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well done Jaffo,<br />
<br />
healing first, The transfer is intresting and would be a nice toy, one I doubt theyd let us play with..  But your correct some type of AA extra healing like soul abbrasion would be great.<br />
<br />
The dot heal absolutly needs to be increased, IMO and no its not H.<br />
<br />
1450 for Tnargs.. even that would be acceptable, I was thinking more like 1500, but some that are hopeing for 1600-1800 are just dreaming.<br />
<br />
Adding attack and/or endurance regen to Focus.. never though of that, even if you took the Str add away from focus it would be worth it.  If someone ever really NEEDED the str, we could always cast a str buff, more mana and takeing up an extra buff slot.<br />
<br />
As far as nukeing.. hard to ask for too much and expect to get anything but If the devs are looking to upgrade our DD I hope it would be more then 1000.. If its not 1100 or more why bother?  more mana more recast time whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1: Healing: This is a difficult thing to modify without influencing the lower level game, and without hurting other classes. And I am not refering to clerics and druids. For healing changes also effect melees, since the game is tuned toward healing primarly.<br />
I fail to see how upping shaman healing to a level where they can keep up with a druid who does not have a slower would be unbalancing the game.<br />
Because that is where we are at given the fight durations of the last two expansions. With cannibalize and with slow we heal less then a druid who does not even have a bard to slow for him.<br />
That is not even counting the aggro from slow or the way that a slow resist on a hasted GoD MOB will just leave the shaman with a dead tank, or the various unslowable MOBs in GoD.<br />
<br />
That AA you proposed would actually pretty good though. As long as it is instant cast and low recast (1 minute should be decent enough) it would allow us to recover from resisted slows, which is one of the big concerns regarding shaman healing.<br />
<br />
And then increase the shaman HoT to 400 HP's tick for 5 ticks. Then increase tnarg's to 1450 HP's for 475mana. <br />
I am just going to assume you did not take the time to read through the heaps on threads here that analyze shaman healing. Let me summarize it for you.<br />
We heal so much worse then druids and clerics right now it is just silly. Slow gets mitigated too often, and even the least bit of slot mitigation halves the value of slow, often making it better for the shaman to just use Tnarg's and hope for crit heals.<br />
Shaman healing was balanced with 2 minute MOBs and 75% slow in mind. On GoD MOBs Tnarg's can often not even keep up with a slowed MOB's damage output, much less with the initital unslowed damage. Quite often a resisted slow means a dead tank. These bandaids will just not cut it for keeping anyone alive.<br />
Mana efficiency on HoT spells is, right now, the last thing on any shaman's mind. 360 or 400 HPs per tick does not matter much on MOBs that quad for 1300.<br />
<br />
2. Buffs.<br />
 I have read most of the post's on this and I think since stats are becoming useless like you said then I think the best and simpliest soulution to this is to add +atk and a +4 endurance regen to Fo7. <br />
Anything then other then stats would be an upgrade really. I would prefer to get something unique instead of ATK, shielding, strikethrough or as you said, endurance regen.<br />
<br />
3 Damage.<br />
The problem here is that wilth the way the game is going that DoTs don't have time to be 100% effect. But this is ever more difficult to adjust without making the shaman class overpowered, and minimzing the other classes.

If you are given a single high damage low recast time DD, then I think that would create balance issues.<br />
Balancing spells with recast times does not exactly work if you can get around that by memming two of them.<br />
<br />
Spell: Posion recourse:<br />
Damage: Decrease Hitpoints by 1000<br />
Resist Check: Posion<br />
Mana: 500<br />
cast time: 7.0<br />
recast time: 6.5<br />
The above is hardly burst DPS. It is a small DPS upgrade over Velium Strike and a huge efficiency downgrade. Oh, and it does 210 damage less then the current(not the ancient) cleric nuke, for 100 more mana, with the same casting and recast times.</div></div><hr />

Etc.<br />
<br />
I have seen nobody comparing our nukes to wizards and asking for anything close to wizard nukes.<br />
<br />
I've seen nobody asking for heals anywhere close to clerics. Druids, yes - clerics, no.<br />
<br />
Not a single person that I've seen thinks we are a melee class and should fight like bards, let alone warriors.<br />
<br />
I've seen many, many people saying things to the effect of 'screw dots, we dont want more dots'.<br />
<br />
Give us a little credit. We're not asking to be the best at everything. We're asking for some improvements to what we can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for posting Jaffo, it is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm about at the end of my rope listening to people throw this red herring around.  Look.  Any discussion of class BALANCE must include references to other classes.  The shaman class cannot and does not exist in a vacuum. <br />
<br />
Yes, let's talk about Class Envy.  Since we are going with definitions, I will provide this one for you.<br />
<br />
Envy<br />
Function: noun<br />
1 : painful or resentful awareness of an advantage enjoyed by another joined with a desire to possess the same advantage<br />
<br />
Now that we understand the definition of envy, let's talk about where to draw the line between legitimate comparison across classes and envy.  I think really the key word here is &quot;resentful&quot;.  <br />
<br />
When we make a comparison like:<br />
Mob X does 290 dps, after a slow, which is mitigated to partial.<br />
Clerics can heal 3275 / (3.75 + 2.25) = 546 dps<br />
Shamans can heal 1300 / (3.75 + 2.25) = 217 dps<br />
<br />
We have something useful here.  A clear statement of how one of our abilities is failing - even after a slow (not counting the time at the beginning that a mob is unslowed) we are unable to keep up on healing, let alone catch up.  There is still a comparison here, yet there is no class envy.<br />
<br />
Though there is comparison here, there is no resentment.  Do you understand the difference between that, and this:<br />
<br />
(I'm sorry to pick on the poster of this quote, it's nothing personal.  You could go back through my posts and find a million examples that would be just as good, I'm just using this because it is convenient)<br />
So... if shamans have weak heals to compensate for having slow, where are the zone's where mobs mitigate heals?<br />
<br />
I'd love to see mobs where slow was fully effective, but heals of the damage they do could only be &quot;slightly&quot; or &quot;partially&quot; effective. How loud do you think Clerics and Druids would scream if the situation was reversed?<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope the difference is clear.  I love to rant as much as the next guy and I don't begrudge people their right to do that.  What I don't like seeing is our concerns dismissed because someone's rant overshadows someone elses post that more fairly explains the problem.  Posting inflamatory comments that draw other classes to the board to respond to jabs against them is a good example of this. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And I'm sickened to see our OWN members starting to revert to this kneejerk type of commentary.<br />
The comments from me, which you have been attacking this morning, are far from kneejerk.  I am upset and bitter and angry about the state of the game at the moment for shamans too, it's very disheartening.  You've seen me post about it too, but through it all I try to maintain some facts in my posts that back up my arguments.  I can't say I am always successful in doing that and honestly I think some of my posts come off as whining and class envy too.  I am usually called on this by other posters...and I can accept that.  Right now, I am working hard to communicate my concerns about the class in a better way, with less content that can be perceived as whining or jealousy.<br />
<br />
We've been told specifically that SOE representatives feel that our board is full of class envy and whining.  Whether their perception is justified or not, if we want them to listen to what we have to say, we have to make an effort to change the way we present our concerns.  This is part of effective communication.<br />
<br />
{edit: spelling and good grammar are a part of effective communication that I also haven't mastered  ;)}</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't believe I am posting this, but I agree with bonestomper here.   :confused:  Another great way to avoid having a post be labelled as a class envy post is to address it foremost as a balance vs content issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are shamans balanced vs this content?&quot;<br />
<br />
If the answer is no, then you can show illustrations of how we fall short.  In your argument about what needs to be changed, it's easy to include some numbers on the performance of other classes, vs the content... and I think it can be done in a way that doesn't seem resentful or unfair.<br />

While I appreciate your Input Jaffo, and I realize you don't have the experience of playing a shaman in a group or raid enviornment... a 7 second 1k poison nuke with 7 second cast time and a 6.5 recast is WORSE than casting our 675/275 poison nuke TWICE which takes rougly 10 seconds for me to fire  off two, and would do 1350 damage for 550 mana. You spoke of memming 2 nukes to chain them, but Shamans are as bad as clerics as far as spell gem monopolization. <br />
<br />
While you might have 1) CH 2) SL 3) SR 4) SE 5) Yaulp 6) DA 7) DB 8) Cleric's Choice!<br />
<br />
We have 1) Slow 2) Malos 3) Quiescence 4) Tnargs 5) Cannibalize IV 6) Root 7) (Haste, FA, some other annoying spell that has to be recast a lot). and that leaves 1 slot for damage usually. I usually just mem spear of torment. It sucks, but at least it doesn't hit corpses.<br />
<br />
That AA is an interesting idea, but it's simply not going to be practical. It's not something that would really have as much an impact as you can think. Tnargs's is roughly 1650-1700 with maxed advanced healing adept and elemental sleeves. a heal that does 400 more than that (assuming I have 7k HP) and drops my life by a good chunk (someone else to heal)... It's flat out unusable around mobs that AE or can rampage.<br />
<br />
Regarding buffs, we've asked for time style effects to replace stat buffs - I.E. Accuracy, Strikethrough, combat effects, and the like. This would make such buffs more appealing than just the hit points. Sadly this isn't going to happen. ATK can be obtained everywhere, the problem is making something that's uinque. and useful (like blessing of reverence was unique and useful)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So you might say:<br />
<br />
Shaman suck at nuking compared to wizards.<br />
Shaman suck at healing compared to clerics.<br />
Shaman suck at melee compared to warriors.<br />
Shaman aren't as strong of dot casters as necros.<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
or you might say shaman suck at nukeing compared to wizards/druids/mages/necros/chanters leaving us compared to clerics (chanter nukes while not huge do interrupt spell casting)<br />
shaman suck at healing compared to Druids, never mind how insanely far behind clerics are.<br />
Shaman suck at melee compared to Clerics...sup with that?<br />
Shaman arent as strong of dot casters as Necros or Druids unless you plan on diggining out every dot you can find in your book and stacking them up druids out dot us every day of the week<br />
<br />
<br />
the flip side being<br />
shaman slow slightly better than chanters/bst<br />
shaman nuke slightly harder than clerics<br />
shaman heal slightly better than paladins<br />
shaman melee slightly better than druids<br />
shaman dot slightly better than...well theres really no comparason here, we are in 3rd of 3 dot classes 5th out of 6 nuke classes, 3rd out of 3 (4) healing classes and I wont even look at melee.<br />
<br />
in fights that last 30-50 seconds I malo/slow and Q for heals if its a long fight and I have even bothered to mem a damage spell I will drop a rain or nuke..with a bst in group I just malo and nuke with a Q here and there.<br />
<br />
the argument that we are out of balance with the game is valid, as a class its pretty valid since we arent the clear winners in even one catagory we belong to. while I would love to see a massive overhaul (i.e. melee type aa's, aa cani, fixed bearform graphic, some Resist modifiers on spells, fixing the can2 quest so it can be done by a lvl 39 or group of them instead of 50+'s maybe?) just fixing it so I can contribute instead of exp sponge would be nice.<br />
<br />
Can6 or whatever you want to call it should be painfully easy to get. this spell should have been in pop already can4 is outdated<br />
<br />
upgrade to druid heals right now, theres still no reason for shaman to be so far behind clerics and druids in this area.<br />
<br />
the new slow should be a true upgrade to turgurs, why should we get a spell thats not an upgrade to anything at 65? its past time turgurs was put to rest for the 65 shaman. I dont see why a 75% slow with a resist modifier built in and a long duration is so overpowering in the end game...dont you already have 2+ shaman on raids? one who malos and one who slows?  you would STILL have one shaman malos and one shaman slow? this type of slow would change nothing significant in the end game and have little effect on lower lvl parts. <br />
<br />
those 3 things top my list, no particular order just the things that make me the craziest and want to play an alt over my main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">shaman nuke slightly harder than clerics<br />
Clerics outnuke us.<br />
<br />
shaman heal slightly better than paladins<br />
situationally - paladins heal faster, paladins can heal the group.<br />
<br />
Just thought I would point these out - I agree with the main points of your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Clerics outnuke us.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not quite that simple.<br />
<br />
Clerics do more dmg in a single spell with thier pop nuke, not to mention their 2 upgraded GoD nukes than we do and the spells have a lower cast time than Velium strike does. The one downside they do have is a high recast time (7 seconds) so they can't chain cast them. With a single spell memed a shaman will do more dps chain nuking just because of the refresh. If the cleric mem's 2 nukes they can overcome the refresh time and will do more dps than a shaman. There isn't much of a downside other than taking 2 slots since all thier nukes have the same ratio and cast time since pop and just get bigger. 1100 dmg, 1210 dmg and then 1320 while their mana cost goes up proportionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Henora, I agree with you that presentation is important.  But I think it's ludicrous for the Official SoE Rep to say that as a community, we're too full of class envy and the &quot;grass is greener&quot; mentality to be reasoned with.  We (your contribution being instrumental) have presented numerous suggestions, with clear reasoning behind them.  We've presented them in a pleasant and objective manner.  And this is the kind of reply we get? <br />
<br />
Obviously there will be some extremists posting their views, but I'm incredibly disappointed that it's those extremists that Brenlo points to and says &quot;no, you're not doing it right&quot;.  If the tone on the Crucible has grown a bit virulent and ... perhaps acidic ... all that proves is that we've gone from a relatively easygoing community to one who feels betrayed and a bit overlooked.<br />
<br />
Again, an objective and less sarcastic tone (something I find difficult to muster) will do wonders in this debate.  My disgust was primarily with the tone of the posted letter(s) which basically seemed to point fingers at the players, saying that we're to blame for the state of our class, because we haven't.... what?  Asked nicely enough?  I'm confused.  And I'm disappointed, because I have the feeling it's more corporate yammering - because shutting people up with phrases like &quot;class envy&quot; is a LOT cheaper than spending time researching class changes, much less paying people to understand something about the game post level 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">LaughingWoman - I'll send you a PM.  I agree with you, I think things got off on the wrong foot between SOE/Brenlo and the Shaman's Crucible.  Let's give it another chance.  He's here now, he is listening now and making an effort to convey our concerns to the developers.  No one can change the past and what is done, is done.. and all that.  We've seen 2 representatives post here in the last couple days.  We wanted our attention and now we have it, let's not squander it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jaffo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hummm, ok very interesting points made about the suggestions I made.<br />
So I went back and read the posts your community has made over the last few days, and after doing so I understand what my error was.<br />
If someone could answer a couple of questions for me I would truly be grateful, then I may be able to make some more suggestions that would be benefical, or the worst case senerio they aren't, but I am only trying to be helpful, you never know when you all may be able to return the favor in the future :) <br />
<br />
Questins:<br />
<br />
1) On what level should shaman healing be acceptable. In other words do you feel that you should be able to be the main healer in GoD trials?<br />
Or acceptable secondary healer?<br />
<br />
2) On what level do you feel that your burst DPS should be.  Do you feel that you should be able to outnuke a cleric? Be equal to a druid? And if neither where would you wish your burst DPS ability placed in terms of classes?<br />
<br />
3) Also do you think that a combination of AA's + spells would be acceptable. Or do you think that each area should be solved via 1 spell and not the combination of multiple requirements?<br />
<br />
  Thankyou in advance for helping me better understand what your class is in need of. While I do agree you all need to regain your desirebility and flexability, I can't seem to get a grasb on where you think you should be scaled or placed within each field thus the request :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Osrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">fixing the can2 quest so it can be done by a lvl 39 or group of them instead of 50+'s maybe?) <br />
<br />
Canni2 is sold in Abysmal now so there is zero reason to do the quest.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The problem with class envy is that half of the argument is likely to be erroneous. Statements are being made based on a shaman's powers and the *perceived* powers of other classes. It's exactly the same with SOE looking at the shaman DOT's and assuming that shaman have great damage potential. They do, in theory, but in practice they don't. And you have to be a shaman in play to see why. The same tends to occur when one class looks at another.<br />
<br />
What this means is when a class comparison is used as the basis of an argument you have to be very sure you are being incredibly fair, complete and accurate. Otherwise it allows people to find weaknesses in the comparison and on that basis invalidate the argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Jaffo.... <br />
<br />
I had posted a similar idea on two different threads about the transfer of HPS.  It would be an AE effect rather than group maybe, just for fun.  Or group only, but I wouldn't transfer the health of the shaman that is his mana pool. <br />
<br />
I think the effect should be like stinging wort potions.  It does a transfer of hps and than a reduction of health over time.  This would reduce aggro that heals gain and offset the high DPS for a short period.  <br />
<br />
Imagine an AA that would burst a groups or tanks hps temporarily for about 2k and than drop back down over time.  Not a buff that was long lasting just an off setting item.  <br />
<br />
I think this with a good HoT and maybe a boost to tnarg would suffice well.<br />
<br />
1) On what level should shaman healing be acceptable. In other words do you feel that you should be able to be the main healer in GoD trials?<br />
Or acceptable secondary healer?<br />
<br />
We are not main healers and never will be.....<br />
<br />
We should strictly be there to patch heal.  We are experts in subtle changes.  A jack of all trades...<br />
<br />
2) On what level do you feel that your burst DPS should be. Do you feel that you should be able to outnuke a cleric? Be equal to a druid? And if neither where would you wish your burst DPS ability placed in terms of classes?<br />
<br />
We are a battle class.  We should be able to out damage a cleric easily in targets, not undead mind you.  More so in melee than anything, but we should fall in line I believe between the cleric and druids.  Better than cleric less than druids.  We only have two lines of damage for DD spells.  Poison and cold, which have very long cast times and are mana intensive. <br />
<br />
3) Also do you think that a combination of AA's + spells would be acceptable. Or do you think that each area should be solved via 1 spell and not the combination of multiple requirements?<br />
<br />
The resolution for the situation would be better resolved by granting AA like you said.  Have the higher end shaman earn an ability to cope with the higher level content.  Shaman that are not in GoD don't deal with insane DPS.  Like some have stated post Tactics it gets harder to be of a useful nature in content that takes a dramatic incline in DPS.  An AA should be granted to compensate, not change the game by introducing higher level heals that may be more unbalancing.  <br />
<br />
The problem with shaman abilities is that more and more things keep being introduced into the game that takes away from our effectiveness.  If we ask them to introduce better heals it may be perpetuating the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The variety of a shaman's duties, and the fact that he must do certain things first before doing either a heal or a DD or DOT, greatly factors in to reducing the efficacy of any shaman heal or DOT or DD from what it might easily be perceived to be.  <br />
<br />
Having to malos and slow, sometimes having to slow multiple times, or add in a malosinia too, means that shamans won't be able to apply heals, DOTs, or DD's for a long time.  It's quite clear that this makes better DOT's pretty irrelevant, but it's also fair to keep sight of the fact that it tends to put in perspective -- or it should put in perspective -- the fears of other classes that with better nukes, shamans would really compete with and even threaten the desirability of mages or druids, and with better heals, they would be competing with or threatening the desirability of druids and clerics.  With all the time shaman have to spend slowing and debuffing mobs, and then actively using canni(rendering them unable to do anything else, even move to follow their group!), shamans simply spend a lot of time all tied up.  Better heals and nukes look far less majestic when you're too busy debuffing/slow first off and then too busy canni'ing back mana afterwards to do very much of either.  Sneak in a heal or DPS, or sneak in a canni?  <br />
<br />
Shamans constantly have to make that decision on how to spend their generally slow casting spells.  No matter what improvements we get, the window of opportunity to even use those improvements is substantially smaller than the windows of opportunity that classes that are not forced to debuff up front and canni afterward are forced to deal with.  <br />
<br />
Before other classes add up our &quot;massive&quot; potential to do DPS or heal even if we get great spell upgrades, and then conclude we have it impossibly, unforgivably good, they would do well to remember how infrequently we're really able to use them.  <br />
<br />
Sure, some classes can chain nuke or heal...but if the mob is over half dead by the time it's slowed and shamans need to spend some time canni'ing to be ready for the next one, how are shamans going to find the time to do chain-anything in the first place.<br />
<br />
I can foresee improvements in the shaman class being leaped upon in a panic by other classes as if they turn the whole world upside down -- so it's important that they understand that all the abilities in the world don't really mean much if you only have the time to use them here and there.  <br />
<br />
If I can get a mob malosed and slowed and then get back mana in time, sure, maybe I can fire off another spell here and there.  But only after I do my own duties, by which time mobs these days are starting to get to perilously low health and the encounter is rapidly nearing its end.  Considering I have to actively canni back mana, the very design of a shaman's duties and abilities structurally limit his healing and DPS no matter how good his heals and DPS are.  Kind of like leaving your wallet at home -- the waiter doesn't want to hear about how much you COULD have paid for the meal.  It's what you've got right in your hands that you can actively put to good use that matters.  Time will limit a shaman's contributions enough that even remarkably better heals or DPS potential from a shaman on paper will rarely work out to be terribly impressive in actual gameplay.  Healers and DPS will be hard pressed to be threatened much by a shaman's ability to do either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">i am going to try and make two posts that are liked in a row on the same thread.  not gonna happen, but i am gonna try.<br />
<br />
i think the top limit on lvls when Velious was introduced was 60.  i think it went to 65 with PoP.<br />
<br />
at that time, the Mob we all wanted to kill was Derakor the Vindicator.  still a great BP and boots.  still better than my own gear.<br />

<br />
says:  quad for 700 max bash for 250 low delay cant be slowed or hit with any magic or ice based spells 110k hp high reg<br />
<br />
now then, Vindi is slow immune.<br />
<br />
compare the rate DPS of new (slow immune) mobs since Velious to Vindi and see if the shaman has evolved by the same percentage.<br />
<br />
actually, our heals went down in hps healed; for a decreased cast time.  in the way shaman are actually played.<br />
<br />
our slow has not increased in %<br />
<br />
our burst DPS has not kept up<br />
<br />
our melee damage certainly has not kept up.  our skill does not even increase.<br />
<br />
ok, we got an improvement in the dog.  but he has not kept pace with rampage mobs.<br />
<br />
buffs?  while the atk from FA went up 40, all the other stat buffs became useless from stat caps.   that does not keep up with mob increases.<br />
<br />
alchemy?  i will be serious, after my first shaman that hit 40 on Vallon i thought the whole skill was worthless and i would rather just buy the stuff from other shaman.<br />
<br />
gear?  sure we have better now, but not near the percentage that the mobs increased.  and for sure the bazaar gear.<br />
<br />
over the same time Sony nerfs soloing<br />
<br />
Sony had so so so many bones they could have thrown us to keep us from complaining.  they just didn't do it.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Eagle<br />
any improved SoW<br />
a fixed duration Invis<br />
longer duration buffs without stat increases<br />
combined fire/cold resist like we get talisman of tribunal  for poison and disease<br />
<br />
instead the nature of the game moved to higher DPS mobs that mitigate slow.<br />
<br />
Sony sucks.  if you think they need to define a shaman now, i think they needed to do it several expansions ago.<br />
<br />
i seriously do not care what other classes get.  but when i see the game content outpace shaman development in leaps and bounds, i want an adjustment.<br />
<br />
i didn't buy LoY or GoD.  and right now i still don't have a reason to.<br />
<br />
shaman will not get a meaningful adjustment.  we will get the smallest bone possible that keeps the most of us playing.<br />
people that think otherwise just because they post a few times really amaze me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">1) On what level should shaman healing be acceptable. In other words do you feel that you should be able to be the main healer in GoD trials?<br />
Or acceptable secondary healer?<br />
I think a shaman, factoring in slow, should heal at least as well as a druid whose MOBs are not slowed. A shaman's patch heal should be big and fast enough to recover from a resisted slow on the trash MOBs of single group content. Recovering from a resisted slow means that our patch heal outdoes the MOBs DPS by a big enough amount to attempt to slow again.<br />
<br />
2) On what level do you feel that your burst DPS should be.  Do you feel that you should be able to outnuke a cleric? Be equal to a druid? And if neither where would you wish your burst DPS ability placed in terms of classes?<br />
We should have the burst DPS of a cleric's non-undead nukes. We should (and we would, given cleric nukes) be able to outnuke a druid over a period of 20 minutes of straight nuking.<br />
<br />
3) Also do you think that a combination of AA's + spells would be acceptable. Or do you think that each area should be solved via 1 spell and not the combination of multiple requirements?<br />
Either would work for me, as long as they are readily available. This is a fix to out class and as such should not require ancient spells, huge quests or expensive AAs. I would not mind an AA ability that for 15 points total fixes my healing or a common drop spell (in say, sewers), that fixes my damage.<br />
I would mind a spell quested from rare drops in Ikkinz trials, or an AA consisting of multiple tiers, each costing 30 points.<br />
<br />
Thankyou in advance for helping me better understand what your class is in need of. While I do agree you all need to regain your desirebility and flexability, I can't seem to get a grasb on where you think you should be scaled or placed within each field thus the request :)<br />
