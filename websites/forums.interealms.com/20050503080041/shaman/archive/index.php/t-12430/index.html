<br />
Keep in mind that if you do the alternate quest (not killing the boss mob for the flag) you gain access to the new zone but not to zones after that in progression.  It is a good path if you want to xp in more zones but not to advance through PoP.<br />
<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
<br />
From PoN - Agony Mephit Heart ~ droped by an agony mephit<br />
<br />
From PoV - crystal spider brain ~ dropped by Lumini Crawler<br />
<br />
From PoI - Solid Block of Perilium ~ dropped by any named mob (ie. corroded prototype, corrupted system)<br />
<br />
You then hand these three items and 3000pp to Borik Darkanvil in PoK for him to combine to make the key to HoHa, alas Borki is not that experienced at smithing, and does have a chance of FAILING the combine, in which case you LOSE everything including the 3000pp.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can combine them yourself in a tanaan forge with a smithing hammer and a flask of water, trivial smithing &lt;= 175.<br />
<br />
Either of these methods should result in a box of souls.<br />
<br />
You then go to PoJ where you need to kill the tormented souls who live in a cell near the final stairs down to the trial area. You need to kill them 1 at a time until they spawn a named mob on death, named either exiled trooper of Marr, exiled officer of Marr or exiled soldier of Marr. Each shade in the room will spawn one of these mobs on death. Once the exiled spirit spawns, hand it the box.<br />
<br />
You should then recieve a soul orb and have the box returned to you.<br />
<br />
You need to do this once for each tormented spirit in the room, until you have the 3 soul orbs.<br />
<br />
You then make your way to PoV and find Grenic Drere, to whom you hand the 3 soul orbs. This will result in a ring of marr, your key to HoHa!<br />

Plane of Tactics<br />
<br />
Wembly the Forlorn says 'You agree to help? Great! I haven't even told you what I needed yet, or why. It is very noble of you to offer me your assistance. I've been trapped here for a little too long, I washed up on the shore still [tied to the mast] of my ship. Wonder that I even survived the <br />
storm.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'why tied to the mast' <br />
<br />
Wembly the Forlorn says 'The Diaku Raiders, filthy sort if you ask me. I was out on a shipping run, when Diaku attacked, they pillaged all of my goods, then tied me to the mast and left me floating a sea. Then the storm came and ate my ship, and I woke up here, I swear that I saw some [Diaku] washed up on the shore with me.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what diaku' <br />
<br />
Wembly the Forlorn says 'The Diaku that attacked me! Pay attention for Karana's sake! You appear to be the fighting sort. You can help me kill the Diaku at their source in [Drunder].' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what drunder' <br />
<br />
Wembly the Forlorn says 'Drunder! The Fortress of Zek, the Zeks don't trust any one mortal to have free access to the fortress. The Diaku come and go in fours, and four parts are needed for entry. Of course they won't part with them easily. If you find four, and bring me four, I can make the four into one, and with one, you can get into Drunder without three more. Then, with your one, you can kill all of them. I would do it myself, but with my bad knee and all. . .' <br />
<br />
Kill Daiku raiders and obtain four talismans and bring them back for your reward. <br />
<br />
Daiku raiders seem only to be located in the desert part of Plane of Storms. PHs are any roaming mob (unconfirmed). They are also very social mobs and KoS. If you aggro one any dubious con mobs nearby will also aggro.<br />
<br />
There are four different talismans though all have the same name (unless identified). There is no pattern to which talisman will be dropped and often no talisman at all will be dropped.<br />

Crypt of Decay ~ Ruins Lxanvom<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Grimror Plaguebringer' <br />
<br />
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'Grimror no have time ta talk. Gots stuffs ta do.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what stuffs' <br />
<br />
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'I wuz sent here by Zulort to, err. . . To gadder some alchemy type stuffs. Him have big plan, and need me to travel lots.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what big plan' <br />
<br />
Grimror Plaguebringer laughs. 'Me not tell you dat! Grimror keep secrets secret. You gonna help Grimror or no?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'i will help Grimror' <br />
<br />
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'Dat good! <br />
<br />
Grimror been getting compon ents for dayz now and Grimror still not finushed. You gonna get dem tings fur me?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what about dem tings' <br />
<br />
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'Grimror need bile, dat stuff es strong here! But Grimror keent seem to git eet all. Bile comz from da leetle bugs. Keel little bugs, and geeve Grimror dere leetel bodiez and Grimror give yuuz anyting dat yuuz want. Dere be four leetel buggiez dat Grimror still neez, seegeen, scaveen, genereen, and harroon. Yuuz bring Grimror dere skinz and Grimror geeve you anyting yuuz want.' <br />
<br />
<br />
The four mobs are sengian, harrion, scaevian, and generian larva. <br />
<br />
PH for Harrion larva = a malarian larva(not larvae like all the others, spawns near zone in a bit out near flies) <br />
PH for Generian larva = a planarian larva(again just larva, spawns east of castle east of river near pussling camps) <br />
PH for Scaevian larva = a Tsetsian Pupa(just pupa, not pupal, spawns a bit east of generian) <br />
PH for Sengian larva = tachnian caterpillars (in the north part of the zone, not single one close to zone)<br />
<br />
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'Yuuz dun guud! But Grimror keent geeve you anyting, but Grimror have dis. Grimror also have sekret information. Krypt of Deekay is in here. Dunt tink yuuz wanna go in dere. Dere be mean old rotten keengs in dere, yuuz dunt want ta mess wif dem, dere also be udder sortz uf baddies in dere, be carefuul if yuuz goin dat way.

Bastion of Thunder <br />
(this is full acess, not an alternate quest method)<br />
<br />
Starts in Plane of Storms, by talking to Askr the Lost. <br />
<br />
You need to get a &quot;Storm Giant Head (everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17654 newwindow)&quot; from any of the base giants in the zone. They drop this fairly commonly. <br />
<br />
Hand in the head to Askr, and when he asks if it was you who tore the head from it's previous owner, say &quot;it was me&quot;. You'll need to tell Askr to continue a few times. He'll then give you a four-slot container (Askr's Bag of Verity) which he'd like you to fill with one item from each giant tribe. <br />
<br />
The Ocean Giants drop a Storm Volaas Beard (everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18382 newwindow). <br />
The Desert Giants drop a Storm Taarid Bone (everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17653 newwindow). <br />
The Forest Giants drop a Storm Satuur Sash (everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17525 newwindow). <br />
<br />
Take these three items and combine them in the bag to make &quot;Askr's Sealed Bag of Verity.&quot; <br />
<br />
Askr will then tell you about the Bastion of Thunder. Ask him &quot;What Bastion of Thunder?&quot; and he'll give you another container (Askr's Sealed Bag of Verity again). <br />
<br />
You'll now need two Esoteric Medallions from different giant camps. The named giants in the Ocean, Desert and Forest camps drop these. They're all named the same, but identify as west, south and north. <br />
<br />
Take your two medallions and combine then in the container Esoteric Meld. Hand this in to Askr for the character flag to enter Bastion of Thunder. <br />
<br />
You must now enter the Bastion of Thunder from the Plane of Storms (it's in the center area, with the Tempest Toads, and the tornado). Just put invisibility up and click on the small shrine in the middle. Once you do this, you'll be able to use the zoneline in Tranquility. <br />
<br />
Reward(s): <br />
Access to Bastion of Thunder<br />

I thought I would just add that the alt flag quests are great if you want to get access to CoD, HoH, Tactics as exp zones however if you want to progress beyond you have to follow the storyline and get the flags via the raiding route. (behemoth, grummus, AD).</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exactly does that mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shantan Maverick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it means you can't get access to the tier 3 bosses without first killing the tier 2 boss, i.e. the key to Crypt of Decay will get you into the zone but you can't get to where Bertox spawns unless you've killed Grummus in Plane of Disease first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">http://www.mysticalorder.org/flagmap.htm has a nice pretty graphical ordering of stuff, but not much details about the quests themselves. It's nice quick reference.</div></div><hr />
