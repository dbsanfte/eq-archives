<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are switching from giant to SS faction, pick up a Talisman of Benevolance for range item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you've still got some giant faction left I'd do the girdle of reflection for a nice belt before you actually start witching faction. I'd also try to pick up a talisman from WW and a Dragon bracer from ww to if you have the means. Also pick up a pair of coldain skin gloves. You and a tank should be able to kill the guy in icewell for his head and then just turn it into a giant to get the gloves.<br />
<br />
For the face I personally like the enshrouded viel alot. Cheap to get usually and nice hps/mana with a bit of wis too. <br />
<br />
Might consider the quest for the kromriff leggings and coldain bracer to look into too. Both are things you should be able to solo and would be nice, but minor upgrades to what your currently wearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well sheet, if yer gonna just give yerself a CT eye, you might as well add in NToV gear as well.  *rolleyes*<br />
Don't forget the vindy bp, or the Shield of Wurms, Dozekar quest stuff . . etc. <br />
<br />
Gawd first thing you should do is lose the resist bracer as standard gear.  Get . . . anything else.  If you haven't switched factions yet, go kill some WW dragons till you get a bracer or two.  Supple scale sux pretty bad too.  You needum AC or yer gonna get torn a new one tryin to slow stuff in HoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Alright i got 5k now... bought my gems for armor... guild is raiding kael every night now... so i got good chances on some thurg armor soon um i was thinking enshrouded viel and 6 65 rings and some different bracers... um like... Dragon Bracer from WW or even go with some melee ones until i get my thurg...<br />
<br />
