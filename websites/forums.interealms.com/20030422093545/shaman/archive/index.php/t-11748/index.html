<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Avoozl0001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I figure I'd respond since I spent many hours at this camp shortly after luclin came out.  Nathyn's castle is the one with the sonic wolf guards in the yard.  Those guards are on a separate faction and they will not assist the regular town guards.  In fact you will get katta guard faction for killing these. If you're KoS to the regular guards then just pull to the side of the yard with the zone wall.  I beleive they can be single pulled at 58, could be earlier but I started fighting there at 58.  If you kill here for awhile just don't go visit nathyn because he'll lay the unholy smack down on you.  But otherwise you are safe as long as you don't open his door and go inside it.  Its a really good duo or trio if you have the friends that want to make the trip out there.  Soloing is also great because you can afk in the town and not worth about any dangers.  In addition the swords sell for 4pp each and they drop change in addition.  Selling is a short walk to the closest building.  Bring a level 60 rogue if you can because a majority of the male guards can be assassinated for quick exp.  <br />
