<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Twylite Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As some of you may know my new primary is a Half-elf rogue by the name of Styffler Quickhands... I've pretty much filled most of my inventory, but I've come to find myself in need of arms (to replace my mesh ones lol) and boots which I don't have anything for at the moment... if any of the rogues have any items that are just collecting dust in the bank or are no longer in need I would have no problem scraping up some plat to buy them... if you can help in any way just let me know =)<br />
<br />
Thankyou =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I might have a couple of weapons if you are interested. They are nothing to write home about, but if you have need - by all means they are yours...<br />
<br />
I will try and get a listing of his goods, but I know for sure, one of the weapons is a Walrus Tooth. If that'll help - let me know in game.  8)  Will find out what else he has....</div></div><hr />
