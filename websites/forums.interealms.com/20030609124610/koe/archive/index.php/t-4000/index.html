<br />
Hear the words of Herald<br />
<br />
There will be a great Race WAR on a server yet to be announced:<br />
<br />
Date:  Nov 30<br />
<br />
Time:  Start time for binding will be 8:00 p.m. est <br />
           Battle to start after 9:00 p.m. est (when all teams are present and ready.)<br />
<br />
Duration of the War:  60 min.<br />
<br />
Purpose:  Have great fun -  see story line posted in Tales<br />
<br />
We will have 2 teams, one the bearer of the red flag for dwarves and gnomes and another one the bearer of the green flag for the high elves and wood elves.<br />
<br />
Each team will be given at least 15 pp after a guild has been established for your team.  Any armor or equipment will also be split equally.  <br />
<br />
A thread will be started for each team so that you can sign up as either for the Red Flag or for the Green Flag.   The War leaders can plot strategies for victory.  Each player can be from level 1 to level 6.  Each guild can use the resources of the land to supply, arm and equip their guilds.  The battle will ensue in the Lesser Faye zone between the Steamfront zone and the Greater Faye zones.  Bindings will begin by Herald at 8 p.m. est on the day of battle.  <br />
<br />
There will be a great /guildwar that will rage for one hour or until one side is vanquished.<br />
<br />
The server will be made know in two days hence when each team has a leader and proposed guild name. <br />
<br />
Sign up under the flag you wish to represent.  Friends, recruits and members join in the fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Question:<br />
<br />
Are Tunare-worshipping Half Elves an acceptable racial choice (as they are also based out of the Tree House)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok.. for names.. I think part of the goal is to get close to your name..<br />
<br />
One thing I would caution is not to use the exact name or you wind up in the same files as your regular character for hot keys and such..<br />
<br />
This looks like it will be a blast.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would suggest you choose a server fairly soon - the guildcreation engine isn't going as fast as it ought to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem with having same names on different servers was fixed a while back, when they added the server number to the name files, so you should have no problems now if you choose the same name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Silly I know but simply Green Flag and Red Flag....hehe<br />
<br />
No need to get fancy with the guild name....:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Herald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahh you are so anxious to defend your cause.. brother against brother... sister against sister.<br />
<br />
Go now to the Zebuxoruk  Server and create your minions of the war.  <br />
<br />
Select a guild leader and create your guild so that the future can be unfold as it has been told.  <br />
<br />
Herald will meet with the guild leaders to dispense plat and armor that each side can use to better equip thyselves.<br />
<br />
Go forth and enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BTW all, I am DELETING all trash talk posts from the respective racial threads (I expect some when you post your initial choice), to enable the team leaders to more easily assess their forces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heyas Dorfs!<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering how you guys are set for the race war in terms of your guild.<br />
<br />
We got our initial approval for the Faydark Militia last night, so I am waiting for an email from V.I. (they made me the GM to counter the evil influence of Hammerstalker). I was just wondering how long it takes for the email to get through, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heya Wulf,<br />
<br />
They made me the GM of the dorf/gnome team. We submitted our guild name on Saturday. The Small Gods.<br />
<br />
We too have initial approval but I have not received an email from VI yet approving the guild. Soon as I do I'll let you all know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The email is in for the elfin team... see my post in general</div></div><hr />
