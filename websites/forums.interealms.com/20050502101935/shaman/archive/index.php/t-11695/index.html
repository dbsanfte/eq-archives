Let's face it, buying/obtaining anything in-game is pretty much like buying any piece of technology...  You have to do it and not look back, or you'll be sad about all the people that got something better and cheaper one month later.  Just enjoy what you have, and know you had it before everyone else. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went from like level 52 to level 60 and I think around 30 AA before I finally got torpor.<br />
<br />
A friend purchased it for me for 50 K. <br />
<br />
I dont remember the number of Guardian wyrms and Emporers and Jumpys and protecters and Juggs killed. It never dropped.<br />
<br />
If I get the components for Torpor and or malo. And get the completed spells. I will give them away. First to guildies. Then to people that are able to scribe them and do not have them. <br />
<br />
The problems of one shaman getting the spells. In a small guild.  For every person that says they got the spells easy, there are probably 5 shaman who have storys like mine. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wouldnt worry too much about a kick in the teeth.  To get the research material for torpor / malo the mob has to be level 60+.

<br />
Well, having just hit 60 a week or so ago, I can say I am DEFINATELY happy about the research option.<br />
<br />
I am part of a small, but outstanding, guild.  I love them to death but the odds of us regularly running out and killing dragons for spell drops just aren't high.  I've camped OS till my fur turns green and still nothing.  I certainly don't have the plat to buy the spells, not that I see them for sale anymore, so I was getting pretty upset about the fact that I was halfway through 60 and had 1 spell from 59 and 60 combined, and was missing many post 50 spells.<br />
<br />
Well, this is the answer.  I can head out and find the components needed to make the spells, and finally have the power that I have been looking forward to for so long.<br />
<br />
Is this a bit of a thorn in the side of all those shaman that have fought tooth and nail to get these spells?  Yes.  But in all honesty I'm willing to bet that many of those shaman wouldn't have given up those spells for the time they've had them and put off owning them until now, just to get back their 60K, or their time spent camping the spawns.<br />
<br />
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but I see this as a pretty big win for the shaman class(and others) and should let all of us be more powerful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just to reiterate what everyone else is saying but for those are complaining about 51-60 spell research, I have to ask you... isnt this what we asked for?<br />
<br />
Ive visited the shaman boards for a year now and the number one thing I hear shamans complain about is rarity of our spells.  Now we have an alternate way of getting malo/topor and yet some are complaining that the up and coming shamans will have it easier????  Thats like old school shaman like myself and a few others who leveled to 50 pre kunark bashing the new lvl 60 shamans because they got to that level in half the time it took for us.  Im just glad that when my new shaman reaches 60, he wont have to pay an arm and a leg for a spell that is more than 3 years old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">boo hoo! someone get out the violins. this is a HUGE boon to wis casters. the pieces aren't that easy to come by. this is what we've been asking for. i just do NOT understand people!!! do you have nothing better to do than whine and find things to bitch about!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I feel for all the people that spent 30K+ on spells like Torpor and Malo, I really do, but to be pissed about the fact that Shaman (myself included) that really don't make that much money, or could be bothered killing endless GWs at a chance of a drop (*grin*) now have accesability to these spells, seems a little wrong to me.  <br />
<br />
I know that if I get components for an extra copy of Malo or Torpor I will be doing a /who all 60 shaman and sending tells to see if anybody needs them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I paid alot for Malo, and a little for torpor.<br />
<br />
-I'm thrilled for my fellow guild shaman that finally will have torpor.<br />
-I'm happy for the shaman who have been working their tails off to get malo and torpor, who just haven't been lucky enough yet.<br />
-I'm indifferent to the level 55 shaman who complained about spell drops before.<br />
-I'm singing a song over those poor poor bastards, who were price gougeing various high level kunark and luclin spells.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to have 50k back on malo so I could buy something like fo7 but I'll live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Realizing that I won't have to use all the Mq's and strategies I was going to use to raise the money to buy Malo means I suddenly have the cash to do some gear upgrading.<br />
<br />
An extra 100 points of AC on my back last night more than made up for the stinging pain of having purchased Torpor a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
As a bonus, I mentioned to the emp-pharmer I bought it from that the spell would be researchable after the next patch (2 weeks ago), and I was able to knock 20k off his asking price.<br />
<br />
30k is still way too much money...long live research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Silver Lining is this: Now you can pick up a few of the rarer spells you may have been missing like oh.....GREATER REMOVE CURSE? and uhh..EVERLASTING BREATH?.....and other ones like that you may be missing.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I must agree with Grickk.<br />
<br />
It is getting so to the point that any druid can make up a shaman and then rise rapidly to the top of the class.  A lot of the things that used to seperate the shaman from the want-to-be shaman have just gone away and this cheepens the work that was once required to become a top end player of our class.<br />
<br />
Easy != Good.<br />
<br />
No more hell levels.<br />
No more book before 35<br />
No more 55 before bear<br />
New mini torpor<br />
<br />
Lots of the old milestones have become meaningless.  I would rather the shaman class be very hard and the reward very large then that we become just another popular twink class for druids.<br />
<br />
Next thing you know some dam frog will become an Oracle in 5 days played making trivial what was once a long, painfull, but rewording experiance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can understand you feelings on this. But to me the struggle for the spells before research was a character building event. I think we didnt toaly get shafted cause of the experience we gained from our journey.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm a lv. 60 Shaman in a small guild.  I do not have the following spells:<br />
<br />
Torpor<br />
Malo<br />
Pox<br />
Tigir's<br />
Voice of Bezerker<br />
Everlasting Breathe<br />

<br />
I'm sick of killing GW's and otherwise trying to kill for my spells.  Because I outleveled my guildmates, I have had to spent my plat on upgrading equipment ('cause guild could not take out mobs for me to loot decent stuff).  I'm broke now.  And quite frankly, I am not sure how long it would take for me to get these spells from mobs.  It is MUCH harder for a small guild (or more casual player) to get these spells.  I have not raced to 60, spent 14 months getting there.  I do not want to spend the next 14 months trying to get all my 50-60 spells!!!<br />
<br />
THIS IS A GODSEND and gives me hope!  I do not need to tell you how depressing it was to ding 60 and not have the above-listed spells.<br />
<br />
To the original poster of the thread, like others have said, things change in this game.  Because you &quot;had to walk the through the snow barefoot in tattered leather and chain armor&quot; do not begrudge us younger Shaman an easier chance to get our spells.  The rarity of shaman spells has been an issue for 3+years.  Cheer for us that they finally fixed it, do not whine that you get nothing out of it and had to pay $$$ for yer spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Shabby,<br />
<br />
I am also still missing a nubmer of spells incuding<br />
<br />
Pox<br />
Tirgir's<br />
Everlasting Breath<br />
Levitation<br />
Avatar or any of its variants<br />
Remove Curse<br />
Greater Remove Currse <br />
<br />
and Others<br />
<br />
No guild gave me my spells,  I farmed cash and baught some and others I looted from corpses.   It was not easy and it was not much fun but I took great pride in scribing those spells because it seperated me from the dross.<br />
<br />
Considering the availability of gear, the event of the bazaar, and the changes to the game,  I think it takes only about  half the effort it once did to level a shamant to 60 / equip him with good gear and a robust spell book.<br />
<br />
I was 54 with my 55 bear spell in the bank when the 29 bear was introduced.  This was a long term goal that I had spent a significant amount of effort to acheive at the time.  I am also an Ogre so I had the joy of scribing my 55 bear only to look like all he little baby shaman running around.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you have worked hard for your spells and I can understand your frustraition.  The process was not exactly easy for me either.  If the game is too easy then it is just cheep and meaningless unless you are only 12 years old and are impressed by pixels on the screen instead of the hard work that went into gaining them.<br />
<br />
SOE could easily put all the spells on vendors for 20p but then the game would truly suck.  They could also put all high end armor and weapons on a vendor for 20p and that woulde just be more suck.<br />
<br />
It is not that the older shaman have walked both way uphill in the snow with holes in the bottom of our banded boots.  It is simply that if you install a tramway to the top of Mt. Everest,  what is the point of climing it.<br />
<br />
Consider trade skills.  I have worked hard on a lot of trade skills and at some point will finish up my 8th shawl.  The other day someone asked what my smithing was and I said it was 185 and I was about done with FS.  Another said that he had 248 in brewing and had done it overnight using some macro while he was sleeping and that my 185 in smithing was the suck.  My brewing is 191 and I have no idea how to use a macro and it just makes me sick to think that the game has been comprimised by this kind of garbage.<br />
<br />
Note all shaman should have all the spells or even most of them.  If you have torpor and malo in your spell books it should mean something.  I personaly think getting the lvl 61 to 65 spells looks very easy and this sadens me.<br />
<br />
Easy sucks.</div></div><hr />

The silver lining is that rediculously rare drops were made easier (the degree is yet to be determined).  This helps your fellow shaman/people ebinezer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Everything in this game is getting easier.  Relatively speaking, being a shaman is no easier than it was before.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Radag, <br />
<br />
I understand your point about not making it too easy and feeling sense of accomplishment for earning things that took time and efforts.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I'm mostly a self-made cat and greatly enjoy game achievements...I could list all the quests I have done or the pieces I have self-looted from the cold dead mobs I just killed :)<br />
<br />
The point is, there was a serious RARITY issue of many 50-60 lv. shaman spells that people complained about for years!!! Now that we *think* that SOE implemented an alternate way to get some of these spells that may be easier (need to see where all pieces drop and how rare they are) I find it incredibly odd to find shaman complaining.<br />
<br />
Introducing spell research for priests and spreading drops all over Norrath and Luclin is not like putting the spell on a vendor.  It still takes time and energy to obtain the parts and a faithful friend to help with the combine.<br />
<br />
It will hopefully just make the prcoess of getting the spells a little less painful and gives us smaller guild players a bit of hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">It's cool that there's an alternate source of spells now.  Maybe I can look forward to an absence of whines about how Joe_Oracle doesn't have Malo/Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Krupp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">What assurances do we have regarding:<br />
<br />
- The frequency of the research components dropping?<br />
- The continued drop rate of the existing spells?<br />
<br />
I don't remember reading any guarantees that the new research will make spells widely available.  Did I miss something here?<br />
<br />
EQ Truths:<br />
- Grizzleknot is not that rare<br />
- Alchemy is not broken<br />
- Spell research will increse the availability of rare spells.<br />
<br />
I'll believe it when I see it.  In the meantime, I'll avoid starting a Whine Thread about something that's not fully implemented.<br />
