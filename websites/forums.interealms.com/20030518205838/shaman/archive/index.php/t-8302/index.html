<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bjarkithesilent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello all, I am a lvl 43 monk and my Fiancee is nearing a lvl that I no longer feel bad for twinking her (lvl 31) and was wondering what would be best to do. I have already planned on buying a iksar bp, any ideas on what else i should get? +wis, or +hp/manna?<br />
<br />
thank you in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this topic has been gone over countless times, and while some still disagree, most do not. Regen/hp/ac are the key points to consider(and later resists, maybe)<br />
<br />
That being said, the 2 most important items for your shammy will be regen bp(ikky or fungi, budget depending) and horse. These 2 items will help make the shammy better and level faster than most anything else. They will also last the longest in that he will use a horse forever and the ikky would be replaced by a fungi, then by torpor(still regen)<br />
<br />
After these 2 things(assuming you can afford both and have plat left over) Go for you hp and ac items, and a jbb if you can.<br />
<br />
I have used a horse quite a bit, and I tried to go back indoors after using one. At this point I would say that the horse will serve your hubbies shammy better than the ikky bp, if forced to choose. I cant reccomend it highly enough, and most everyone who has tried one feels the same way.</div></div><hr />
