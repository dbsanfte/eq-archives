<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if this still drops, and if so, off what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Casanova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It doesnt drop where it use to.. off bee's in PoS.. I havent heard of where it drops now =\ Guess I got lucky and got mines b4 it dissappeared <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jezekiell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Suposebly drops off the named bee now, the one that pops after you kill all the chieftains and such. Think all the bee drops were moved to him.<br />
<br />
Makeing it high risk, with chance of low stat weapons/armor not worth the risk of the encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elmarnieh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We killed that bee last night.  It dropped an okish earring if I recall 50 hp 50 mana 5 ac and some other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ojuillean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmmm - if memory serves - it dropped off one of the ocean giants in PoS for us - the hardass one as I recall - dunno his name but he's a pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pretty sure this ring was moved to Jeplak, Lord of the Srendi (it's close to that). He's the ocean giant boss, pretty tough, think AoW fight with some annoying crowd control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So, we were going to attempt that ocean Lord last night (after easily taking down the Forest Lord).  But he was in this building surrounded by ranks and ranks of giants.  At least 50 of them, maybe more.  A monk did a trial pull and got probably 20 at once (he died ;-P<br />
<br />
Is it normal for there to be that many giants around him, or was this bugged somehow?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We killed Ocean Lord, he is way easy if nobody dies, each death spawns an add...no crackling ring tho (at least on this one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can confirm it was/is dropped by the Ocean Lord after they nerfed the Bee drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Ladas. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Silvanoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">glad i got mine off bee's before they changed it.</div></div><hr />

Can the adds be mezzed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I honestly can't say...the first run we took at him, we didn't realize he has the Shei effect, so it was rather suprising when they started to spawn, chaos insued, and we wiped.  After we knew that he did that, we were more careful, and the (second) fight was really easy.  Adds only hit for around 300+, thats pretty much all I can tell you about them.</div></div><hr />
