Been Exping in CoM, and have the following pages. No idea if they are the right ones? if not can you let me know so i can destroy the crap?<br />
<br />
I have the following.<br />
<br />
1) Personal Diary Page - Seems Good<br />
2) Criers Scroll - Also Good<br />
3) Merchants Letter - Yup seen that listed<br />
4) Research Notes Part 5 - Err, not seen this mentioned<br />
5) Research Notes Part 6 - Not mentioned either<br />
6) Priests Diary Page - Not sure, seems like its one<br />
7) Students Log - Got off the courier (first drop woo!)<br />
8) Illegible Scroll - What is this?<br />
<br />
Can you let me know if i have all the pages i need out of that lot?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Mingh.<br />
<br />
Have looked through the walkthrough, but doesnt make sense on the pages.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit - I also have the Written Announcement, in another bank slot, just seen it, so is that all i need? - Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The part you're missing is the 'Written Announcement'.<br />
<br />
The research pages and the illegible scoll are not used in the shaman epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are listed in the walkthrough (http://www.eqshaman.com/epic/6com_reports.html)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have all the pages and some extraneous stuff. You can junk the Research Notes and Illegible scroll as those are used for other class quests(monks and mages if I remember correctly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes your missing the Written Announcement, Junk all the research and the Illegible Scroll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Student's log first time - you lucky SoB :) I'm sure it is in the walkthrough but anways, the others have answered the question :)<br />
<br />
Remember to pick up the icon for Kirn while you are there - from the floor in the temple area.</div></div><hr />
