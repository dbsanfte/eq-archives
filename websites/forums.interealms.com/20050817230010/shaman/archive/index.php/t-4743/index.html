Anyone aware of the regen differences come high level shaman time?  In my mind, I always though that trolls gained 3hp/tick and iksars 6hp/tick over regular classes.  A fixed class attribute.  After 50 trolls/iksar start to pull away though to the point where they are 8hp standing and 11hp sitting ahead of other classes at 59.  That's like half a fungi tunic or something.<br />
Meanwhile I'm sitting here as an ogre, gaining aggro on mobs trying to slow them only to find my spells getting &quot;interupted&quot;.  That's the draw of the Ogre shaman over other shaman type classes I suppose.  Inability to be stunned while facing an opponent.  Well that and hp.  But even still, that's one skill we never improve upon.  I propose they extend our ability to not be stunned while facing an opponent to include harder to interuppt spells while facing an opponent too...<br />
Maybe they already do this.  I dunno.  Just seems if they are going to randomly tweak out the natural regen rate post 50, they should look into why peole choose other shaman races and consider tweaking those out too.<br />
Just my two cents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as you scribe Torpor you cease to worry about your natural regen rate. For a drop of mana every race can jump straight to 300hp a tick for the next 24 seconds. An extra 8 or 11 isn't really a lot against 300.</div></div><hr />
