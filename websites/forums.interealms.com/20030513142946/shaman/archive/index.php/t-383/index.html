<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering...  Can this be Multi Quested and has anyone done it?  My Guild killed Boss mobs and someone killed him before I got there.  A Ranger Friend grabbed it.  I hope it can, but if not back to Fear!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It CAN be multiquested, however, the person turning it in MUST be of sufficient (read: max ally) faction to do so, and my money says that the ranger does not have any TrueSpirit faction, let alone ally.  The only real viable method of multiquesting the tear is to have a shaman who has the epic hand the tear in to Rak and then you can loot the scale after he is killed.  But if the ranger turns it in without sufficient faction, Rak will just eat the tear.<br />
<br />
Sorry to say it looks like you'll have to go to Fear again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ahaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">An enchanter with EPIC can MQ also, as I know chanter EPIC need True Spirit faction also, they can use spell change faction to ally, my chanter friend confirm that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe if the Ranger goes with the Shaman and is grouped for all the ealier steps in the epic those would all be True Spirit faction hits right?  Hope it works.  My monk has a tear for my Shaman to MQ when he is high enough.</div></div><hr />
