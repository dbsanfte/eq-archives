As we old Bears strap our spears to our sides for the last time, never to wield them again, as we allow Vobtik, our mighty and trusty warhound to roam again a free spirit, and as we close our spellbooks, to collect dust and yellow with age,  we have to wonder about those who take up the slack. Will they augment our allies and disempower our enemies as we did, or will they find better ways to do it? Will they understand what we were all about, why we loved our place in the game?

<br />
EQ still going strong, after all this time...amazing. All the friends I still have, and the ones I left behind, those I cared for or at least managed to get along with...I can only hope a strong Spear of Fate is behind them, bringing out the maximum capability of his allies and standing beside them, crushing their foes with detrimental forces only we could bring about. <br />
<br />
For those greying shaman, bent and old but with the fight left in them, and those young, with fire in their eyes and chanting in ancient tongues....please take care of the friends we left behind. It is your Spear that supports them, your shoulders that bear the burden, and may Rallos Zek give you strength to get off that last heal, the final debuff and park that last add. <br />

It's all up to you, fellow Heyokah. We are trusting you to care for those we left behind, so we might rest easy.</div></div><hr />

Kkrush,<br />
<br />
That was a nice read my friend...<br />
<br />
It is a loss to new players that they'll never be able to experience the golden age of Everquest..when most everything was unknown and friendships forged were even more meaningful because of that mystery. I miss the old days, although I myself intend on trudging the lands and moons of Norrath until the day the council of gods destroy our world(pull the plug ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I came in late to this game, just after Luclin (feb 25 last year). However still during that time I have made friends and others that will always enhance my play time. Eventually we will need to put our spears down and retire to reap the benefits of our adventures. When that day comes I will not fight it, but embrace it. We will remember those that have paved the way for others, the ones that follow the footsteps of those past will have them to thank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet the ones that take your place will be here to lead the younger ones into the places that even the bravest and oldest have discovered. We will teach the others like you taught us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I picked them out. <br />
<br />
- Recognition of effort: &quot;We will remember those that have paved the way for others&quot;<br />
<br />
- Assumption of responsibility: &quot;We will teach the others like you taught us&quot;<br />
<br />
And I feel better already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From all I have seen in the RL pic thread, it seems that the Shaman is a young WOMAN'S calling too. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am in same boat as Toshiro. I started almost the same time, and have also met many folks that I am proud to call friend. We all have our paths to take in life. Those that have fought the good fight for many years deserve the chance to step back and let the young continue the fight while hopefully still offering the sage advice their own experiences have given them. Yet even the new wave of adventurers will have their own Golden Age in their hearts and minds. That time when everything is magical...the food tastier, the drink sweeter, the camraderie louder. And as the months pass into long years, those times gleam brighter through the veil of passing time, tales to use to regale others with around a flickering fire on a midsummer's night<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In bear form I am old and majestic, An elder in title and in truth.<br />
<br />
I walked the permafrost when times were new. Before the age of the gods and before the fires of heaven scoured the land. <br />
<br />
I battled bear cub and goblin, with nothing more than an old stick and the knowledge that my calling as a shaman would be strong. <br />
<br />
I walked in the night when it was truly dark. Before the vengeful bards took shape and wandered the icy plains.  Before crafters learned to make the tundra rings of ice into armour. Before the lands were mapped and weighed and measured. <br />
<br />
I have killed Hill giants with only my mutt and my spirits around me when the deed was considered impossible but for those of the dark arts.  I walked Into lower Guk when the place was fabled and new. <br />
<br />
When Kunark was discovered, I carried the long arm of northern Justice to the sarnak. And to the undead in the ruins of Kaesora. I watched as frost froze the ichor of the emporer of long dead seblis in his spectral form.  <br />
<br />
I have wandered and led in the icy wastes of velious. Friend to dragon and slayer of giant. Much like the long times past in the mountains of rathe.  I was charmed and cursed in the Sirens grotto in the first day of walking that blasted land. I have raised my spear in salute of The Darkpaw and slain Yedelma in honarable combat. After many had done so before me. And many would come after me.<br />
<br />
I walked the Moon of luclin, once again delivering the Justice of the tribunal. And trying to rid the land of shadow. I have braved the scourge of the temple of Ssra, and walked in the airless depths of the grey itself. <br />
<br />
I have met my lords and protecters in the halls of Justice. I have stood before them and been Judged. And not found wanting. I wander now in the Halls of Honor, and the plane of tactics Proving myself with the stregnth of my arm and spirits and with the friends of all my past arrayed behind me. <br />
<br />
I am the tip of a spear aimed at the neck of the boar. The speed of the wolf inside me, the pack baying at my heels. I am a caller of spirits and a weilder of poisen and disease. I cripple and call upon the insects to weaken my enemies. I am a healer of my people and of all the races that stand with me. I am the growl of the Kodiaks that still live on the northern plains of my home. <br />
<br />
It has been a long Journy. One of fun and fright. Filled with laughter and pain, as old friends fall by the road and new friends pick up the pace. <br />
<br />
But one thing will endure. The memories of the Silverhammer. Standing in the firelight, looking out over the frost. The memories of the good and evil that I have come across in my jorney are still strong. And thankfully they are not at an end. My spear is still in my hand. And the Hammer of spirits is still only a reach away.  <br />
<br />
Justice will rule in the far north for some time to come.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I can only /bow in appreciation of the posts made here. I was drawn to the game in December (wish I had heard of it way back when) and I started a ranger. At level 51 I found myself watching and talking to shaman I grouped with, awestruck at the abilities they had. So, in March I started Karshak and have just dinged 54. This is because I have had the wisdom of you trailblazers to read and use, and the excitement of knowing that if I learned my class well I could solo mobs my ranger wouldn't stand in the same room as on their own. I have grouped and enjoyed the plethora of roles available.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to say thanks, not only for your advice and wisdom, but for the sheer roleplay and effort you put into your final posts. It made me, a fantasy lover, really want to continue progressing and play my shaman with pride.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Damn Snoww your stuff is always such a good read.<br />
You write professionaly ?.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh I wish. <br />
<br />
Nah I just like the charecter of Snoww. She tends to mesh well with my own. I have been a DM in several ongoing DnD and champions and fantasy hero games. Some of which ran for over 6 years. We would update each other sometimes during the week with E mails and such. So I got in the knack of writing in charecter some. <br />
<br />
Plus I have been roleplaying with Snoww for years. Low key. No thee's and thous or anything. (Like a 60 int Barbarian would use thee. Heh) But it is pretty easy to get into charecter of a 7 foot tall bloodthirsting speaker to spirits. Just grunt alot and Act like a lineman. (Grins)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the compliment though. I have several stories of some things I would love to write down, but the grammer and sheer scope of such a project scares me. It is easy to rip off a few pages every month or so of in charecter stuff when the urge strikes me But to sit down and write... Thats rough. <br />
<br />
Like the submission for the State of shaman address. I put it off and was busy alot. Then just sat down and whacked it out first try in about a half an hour. It was a depressing look but just the night before I was talking with an old friend about maybe dissolving my guild. And I wasnt in the best of moods with Snoww on my mind. <br />
<br />
Have a good weekend. And again thanks for the compliment. I wish I had some publisher or someone &quot;in the know&quot; who could mentor me a little bit. Who knows, maybe one day I will get a story made. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As I consider all that has been said<br />
I ponder on the runes wind-written in the snow<br />
Feeling old I was before these things I read<br />
And now the Shaman spirit sparks and starts to flow.<br />
<br />
Sixty winters long and biting cold<br />
I have endured, and one beside.<br />
But at the ancient Shaman's words so bold<br />
I am but young, and as a Shaman will abide.<br />
<br />
There's much to hunt, and seek, and learn<br />
And lands I have not dared to brave<br />
And though the spells of evil wights may burn<br />
I'll stand by friends, and fight, and seek to save.<br />
<br />
On pages tattered, bent and stained<br />
I read the stories of the great and wise<br />
As firelight flickers, hunts explained<br />
And stratagems that others did devise<br />
<br />
All these and more I store against the day<br />
When I, with such a journey still to go<br />
Will need them, then my debt of thanks I'll pay<br />
As each sweet blow falls crippling on the foe.<br />
<br />
So take heart, all of you brave souls and good<br />
There are still Shaman proud and learning fast<br />
True to our friends and calling, as we should<br />
True also to the memory of the past.<br />
