<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garborg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is anyone else having problems with the timer refreshing sometimes? Seems like it happens when I first get into a zone or get a rezz. I will not be able to use a clicky for 40 mins or so. It is not greyed out for a good 30 mins. But once it grey's out and the 10 min timer finishes it will work fine until I zone again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, I can't say that I've seen that.  What I have seen is if epic clicky is spent and you zone, it's not greyed out but the timer is still resetting, you are just unable to see the progress.  If you wait the remainder of the 10 minute recast, it works fine and greys out again as normal.  I use it quite often directly after a rez too and not witnessed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been having major issues with this, but it's not useable at all after I use the effect the first time each time I start playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I haven't had any problems with it other than 1 time when there where some obvious server problems (couldn't cast any spells). It does kinda sound like disc problems people have sometimes. Seems to be related to system clock on your computer vs the clock on the server. Might wanna make sure your computer date/time is right.</div></div><hr />
