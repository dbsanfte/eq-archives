<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">...DPS is 99% of the time is a defined ratio between the ammount of damage you do and the time it took you to do it.<br />
<br />
There's certain asshats (Bracy comes to mind) who have zero concept of DPS, and think it has to do with efficiency, or think that since &quot;a wizard can do 3000 damage 1 second, then no damage for the next 10 seconds&quot; that DPS can't be applied.<br />
<br />
Since damage is never continual in this game, the application of &quot;DPS&quot; like you'd talk about &quot;MPH&quot; isn't exactly the same. No matter how small a slice of time you take, a car travelling at 90mph will be going 90mph.<br />
<br />
In everquest, such a division of time can't be made, even by the slowing down of time as many of us shamans supposedly have mastered. <br />
<br />
All damage comes in bursts, even what is normally referred to as &quot;Sustained&quot; damage. Melee comes in hits. DoTs do damage in ticks. Nukes... do a big blast, then nothing for a while.  A car travelling at 60mph, or 5,280 feet per minute, or  1056 inches per second... That's something continuous.  A car doesn't move, stop, move, stop, etc... Though one could say that driving through new york city stopping at lights, you averaged 20 miles per hour.  Again it's a whole ratio thing.<br />
<br />
hope this clears it up for you.</div></div><hr />
