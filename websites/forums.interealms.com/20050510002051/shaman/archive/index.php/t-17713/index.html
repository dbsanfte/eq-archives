<br />
I can solo my own epic sirs, can you? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, unsure why it would matter, but yes a couple bst have soloed thier epics, or gone back and re-done them solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can solo my own epic sirs, can you? <br />
<br />
Yes - but soloing the Shaman epic is a bigger accomplishment. ;)<br />
<br />
(The Beastlord epic is probably the easiest epic in the game - most 65 Beastlords with 100+ AA and decent equipment could solo it. I've done many of the fights solo just for the heck of it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah ok, Never actually done much of the bst epic so I thought it was a remote challenge =(<br />
<br />
Back to the drawing board!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hm... I think the best way to think of this is that you cant solo your epic when you would use it.  And neither can a BL.  If you killed those mobs with your current magelo, congrats but it's not like you have average gear.  Your stuff is pretty pimp if you ask me (a lowly sham with 1/2 your hp and ac unbuffed :) )<br />
<br />
As far as a BL in the same level gear as you I'm thinking would absolutely stomp his epic solo.  The BL epic is the easiest around.   I think that's the general consensus at least and I only helped with 2 of the BL fights that were a complete cake walk.  We did it with 2 groups of lvl 60s where the tank took one heal I think and we were all looking around muttering why the BL wasted all of our time.  Of course we were congratulating him and didnt really mind helping but it was TONS of overkill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*sigh*<br />
My epic took multiple raids.  Several groups of people from my guild working to help me get a spear that would greatly increase my wisdom and damage ability.  20 wisdom was so awesome, and resists better than some of my &quot;resist gear&quot; at the time.<br />
<br />
I enjoy remembering the quest for what it was.<br />
<br />
Congrats on being able to do it without help now, it is a strong solo accomplishment.  <br />
<br />
I know epics aren't what they once were, but to me it is still a little sad that people no longer need to make friends to get them.  (Not saying people don't have friends, just that you don't have to have them.)  I always thought of epics as being the thing to bring people together to help people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing I think would make it hard is that those mobs they trigger all summon and they are all unslowable and unrootable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My roommate is a BL.  We duo'd most of her epic, and we were cautious (not knowing better) and brought a full group for the end mob.  Later I solo'd the end mob for the BL epic for a guildmate's twink, he is cake.<br />
<br />
A few of the other mobs are a bit more trouble, but nothing really bad.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman Epic is not that hard. Sorry to burst any delusions you may be harboring, but along with Monk (Once pipes acquired) and Rogue (MQ and purchase) it is one that can be accomplished in 8 hours. And if your e-penis is shriveling up from that one, remember this - it used to be EASIER. <br />
<br />
If you want a challenge - solo the Enchanter Epic. Other than Fear and Cabilis I think you can do it. The Hate portion is definitely soloable (albeit boooring) as is Tangrin (DC helps).<br />
<br />
When you see level 20 Shaman running around with their Epic, well, personally I think it's a collective kick in the gut to the community. Then I realize the content is 3-4 expansions old. Having said that - congrats on your accomplishment. Mana free damage is always nice.</div></div><hr />

The bear was very very hard to duo with (not sure if I was buffed competely but i don't think that i was).  Near the end of his fight, i was around 20m when he died and most of the time I was fighting just to keep myself with mana/hps.  I know a pally can solo most of those fights too.  <br />
<br />
i'm curious about the Rak fight though.  I'm thinking that I might go in and try him soon to see what I can do.  I'm curious about what spells I would have to use though.  It's been a while since I fought him and I can't remember what does and doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

Zorlac are you a noobie.  The list above for a 65th shaman doing Elemental planes is all GARBAGE.  <br />
<br />
Improved healing IV<br />
Spell Haste IV<br />
Improved damage IV<br />
<br />
Are all abilities best fit for other slots.  Other than the primary slot.<br />
<br />
At least the shaman epic gives valuable resists compared that listed garbage above. <br />
<br />
The Epic for beastlords in the department of damage, effect (haste and slow), and delay is seriously replacable once your an Elemental Planes guild.<br />
<br />
So don't give me this Trash talk that the Beastlord epic is not replacable.  <br />
<br />
Our monks in our guild get handed passed weapons that would make beastlords wimper and cry for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Zorlac are you a noobie.  The list above for a 65th shaman doing Elemental planes is all GARBAGE.  <br />
- Oh look, a retard with below room temperature IQ crawled out from under his rock.<br />
<br />
(1) Someone pointed out he/she/it could solo shaman epic and that beastlords couldn't solo theirs.<br />
(2) I pointed out that soloing or simply getting shaman epic at this stage of the game was a waste of time because of much better bazaar bought alternatives.<br />
(3) I also mentionned that BST epic can't be replaced with Bazaar bought gear that is worth about 40K.<br />
<br />
Now tell me dumbass, what does all has to do elemental gear and whatnot? Nothing, just a missed opportunity for a personal attack eh? Nice try, negative7/10 for effort on a scale from 1 to 10.<br />
<br />
The Epic for beastlords in the department of damage, effect (haste and slow), and delay is seriously replacable once your an Elemental Planes guild.<br />
- Reading comprehension 101? You know understanding basic english is pretty easy ... wait ... must be very hard for your nonexistant or negative IQ. Oh and you also forgot a slight detail, offhand epic has also 30 ATK worn ... thought I'll point that out.<br />
<br />
So don't give me this Trash talk that the Beastlord epic is not replacable.  <br />
- Point out a 40k plat worth gear that you can buy in Bazaar that is better than beastlord epic. Oh and I never said it was not replacable, so stop putting words in my mouth ok? I said (now stay with me and try to grasp basic english), again, I said that you can't find a piece of gear in bazaar worth around 40k that is better than beastlord epic BUT at the same time, there are at least 5-6 items worth around 40k each that are far superior to shaman epic. Get it now? <br />
<br />
Now let me teach you basic understanding and logic.<br />
<br />
In one senteance, I said: You can pick up for 40kish in bazaar an item that destroys shaman epic in utility. <br />
- For your mentally retarded tumor (aka your brain) this means that you can buy (no I won't teach you economics) an item in Bazaar (no I won't show you the zone) that is superior (I know, it's a hard concept) to shaman epic. Not hard to understand right? (well maybe for you it is, but re read the above few lines over and over and maybe it will sink in).<br />
- Then the following sentence, I said: Something you can't do with beastlord epic. Ok now, this is the hard part. Because you need to associate the above sentence with the fact that you can buy better items than shaman epic in bazaar. Now the real hard part of this is that you have to somewhow use your inferior tumor (aka your brain) to substitute shaman epic WITH beastlord epic and the same time negate the whole  expression. Now I know, it's hard but it would result into something like this: You can't buy in Bazaar an item for 40K that is of better utility than beastlord epic.. Now go take a glass of water because your tumor (aka brain) is swelling too much from a process we normal people call: elementary logic.<br />
<br />
Dumbass mental retard.<br />
<br />
PS: When you can understand basic english, give me a call will ya?<br />
<br />
kkthxlalalalalbyebye!<br />
<br />
PPS: Did you mother tried to drown you when you were a kid? You know that surviving drowning can lead to mental retardation? Or where you already so mentally retarded that you tried to hold your breath for a long time thus doing even more permanent damage to your tumor (aka brain)?</div></div><hr />

Your post is a mess with verbal attacks and slurring words.  Plus it looks like your having the worst panic attack.  Finding out that you may have wasted time on making a beastlord and really should have stuck with your shaman.  Who is a much more powerful class.<br />
<br />
1.  The fact is the stuff you linked is crap compared with what respectable shamans of high level are wearing now adays.<br />
<br />
2.  The beastlord epic is totally replacable.  You probably don't know that because your still probably raving about the fact you finally got your epic as a beastlord.  LOL  Man, we got monks in our guild, equiped BST use able weapons that would make you cry.<br />

<br />
 Finding out that you may have wasted time on making a beastlord and really should have stuck with your shaman.  Who is a much more powerful class.<br />
- So you got caught with your pants down and are trying to change subject? Or it's your mental retardation showing up again with your total lack of comprehesion of basic english and basic logic?<br />
<br />
1.  The fact is the stuff you linked is crap compared with what respectable shamans of high level are wearing now adays.<br />
- I was comparing shaman epic with those items, dumbass. How hard is that to comprehend. Oh wait, your tumor (aka brain) can't grasp basic logic. My bad, I forgot that. So following your logic, when someone posts a comparison between I don't know ... pffft ... warrior epic and bazaar bought garbage, he deserves to be flamed for it because plane of time weapons are better ... right? Your non-existant grasp of logic is amazing and sad.<br />
<br />
2.  The beastlord epic is totally replacable.<br />
- With a 40k item bought in Bazaar? No. With raid items? Yes. Thanks for pointing that out &quot;Captain Obvious&quot;. Again, change of subject but that's expected from a mental retard with zero understanding of english.<br />
<br />
  You probably don't know that because your still probably raving about the fact you finally got your epic as a beastlord. <br />
- Stop changing subject. I know it's hard for a sack of wasted human DNA like you, but try a bit harder. I was comparing Bazaar upgrades for shaman epic and non existant 40k Bazaar upgrades for beastlord epics. Of course when your initial flame fails horribly you need to divert the subject to save face right? Dumbf-uck. <br />
<br />
 LOL  Man, we got monks in our guild, equiped BST use able weapons that would make you cry.<br />
- My, my, my, another feeble attempt at subject change. I guess basic english still evades you, not to mention anything related to normal human brain functions as thinking, logic, understanding.<br />
<br />
Oh and is &quot;LOL Man&quot; your best that tumor on your neck can come up with? <br />
<br />
3. Grow up idoit. Stop, over reacting.<br />

He didn't and nor did I.  We both agree that an elemental shaman is probably not going to want Zorlac's preposed items/links.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, then you probably don't have your shaman epic.  Because the items he listed are totally garbage.  There are much better equipment slots that are better ment for focus effects other than going for items that fill your Primary, Secondary, or range.... <br />
<br />
<br />
 Of course they dont go for 40k on my server due to &quot;the&quot; guild rules about selling elemtnal items for personal profit, so when on the rare occasion one finds them for sale they go for almost 100k, which is still better then our epic imo.<br />
<br />
But 'EQOracle', you said your not flagged for the elemental plains.  <br />
Is your guild visiting the elemental planes?  <br />
An furthermore &quot;the&quot; guild has a rule about not selling these elemental drop for profit.  <br />
Probably, meaning if anything these items get recycled in the guild hopefully.  <br />
<br />
Um, EQOracle, base on what you just told me in the quote above you should be in very near shot of Elemental items.  And guilds aren't made on being greedy especially if they have a rule to not sell elemental planes gear.<br />
<br />
Here you go Zorlac:<br />
The two items below that can be bought for under 40 K and when Augmented (for zero cash) with Vampire Kiss and Vampire Talon put the Beastlord epic to shame.  <br />

Hell, with AAs in 'Advanced gift of healing,' 'Advanced healing Adapt,' and 'Heal Gift'.  <br />
<br />
Oh and think about it if our classes weren't wasting our times putting Impove damage or Improved healing items in our secondary or primary slots like Zorlac would.  <br />
<br />
Those two abilities (Improve Damage and Improved healing) could be figured into the potiental those two items above, provide to a NON-Elemental Planer BST.  <br />

- Haha! There is your lack of comprehension of the english language again.

PS: I doubt any beastlord would give up 40% haste, 125 HP and 30 worn ATK and not to mention superior resists for any of those garbage you posted. Of course there is a SOE rule that you cannot augment epics! You can't! That's right. No player is allowed to augment epics! NO WAY! Dumbf-uck. <br />
<br />
about it if our classes weren't wasting our times putting Impove damage or Improved healing items in our secondary or primary slots like Zorlac would.  <br />
- Why are you trying to change subject again? Who gives a flying f-uck if you can get IH IV on other slots? Oh right, you got owned and trying to safe face again right? Idiot. Dumbass. Oh and by the way moron, go look up some elemental/time loot and see how Improved Damage focuses and many of better parts (Anger, Wrath, etc ...) are on quite a few PRIMARY and SECONDARY items. Of course you knew that right? Dumbf-uck.<br />
<br />
Those two abilities (Improve Damage and Improved healing) could be figured into the potiental those two items above, provide to a NON-Elemental Planer BST.  <br />

<br />
Note:  Combat proc items are affected by focus effects, clicky items are not.<br />
- Wow. Genius. Did you figure that out by yourself? Oh wait ... clueless moron, my elemental pants work perfectly fine (right click Pox of Bertoxxulous) with may range item (30% DoT focus). Of course your wide knowledge of game ... erm wait, you are a clueless dumbf-uck. Never mind.  Before you tell me what you mean, I know you meant DDs, I just wanted to demonstrate how easy is to put words in your orifice you call mouth.<br />
<br />
For Zorlac, is just a child and gets riled up with thinking out side the box.  He is crazed...  Seriously, he is so deep in the closest (his box) he is finding Christmas presents.<br />
- Coming from you I take it as a compliment. Then maybe your mental retarded tumor (aka brain) has no clue what you just typed.  Could be all related to quantum mechanics. Yeah, that's it.<br />
<br />
So let's recap:<br />
- I post a comparitive post about shaman epic vs other items brought in bazaar. Pointing out that getting shaman epic is waste of time.<br />
- You come out and flame me (for the sole reason to flame me) with zero understanding of english language and no grasp on basic logic. Hell you showed perfect sign of vegetative brain ... erm tumor on your neck.<br />
- You keep trying to change subject to draw the fire away from your stupidity and obvious cluelessness (is that a word I just invented?) about elementary game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Neat. Priceless.<br />
<br />

This is funny ... more of this please !!!<br />
<br />
And a hint for you both ... you need a better doc :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Before anyone carries on flaming me, I've had my epic for several years now, I purely did this for fun, I only did the later fights and the tear wasnt wasted, it got a friend's shaman his epic.<br />
<br />
It was purely a little bit of fun from a half retired bitter old luclin era shaman =P<br />
<br />
As for the fights themselves, I lucked out on Neh as her ghost was up at outside the big pool house in the center of CoM, she didn't put up any kind of a real fight, buffed pet/rabidbear/pet swarm and it was over shortly.<br />
<br />
Terror (for the tear) was harder, and I didn't clear the area alone (Was with a few friends killing golems for aon/epic bits), but I had no assistance with terror and wasnt even properly self buffed (/rude worry wraith adds).  I probably could do it fully alone but it would take a fair while to clear.<br />
<br />
Rak is suprisingly easy now, buff an alpha pet up to the hilt, and just let the pet chip down rak whilst you keep it upright.  I can win the fight with about 30% mana left at the end without using a horse now so I think a shaman with lesser mana preservation/FT could still do this fight np.<br />
<br />
Oh and to tidy up a few points, I still carry my epic with me to this day (Although admittedly I do carry a LOT of toys =) and it still gets clicked in longer fights, granted a ton of stuff has better stats now, but the sham epic is still a lovely saves piece with a useful click.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the Tangrin for the ench epic is pretty easy too now, if I'm bored in the evenings I'll pull him to the newbie area and play with him there, grummus, VP and 350ish mr makes him fairly easy to tank.<br />
<br />
If I offended anyone with my post, apologies, it was just meant to be a bit of light humor, relax =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Zorlac Sabboth I don't know any shaman that would bag his epic for that junk that you linked.  You can get armor with those effects.  The epic is much better then those primarys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">In my magelo you can see what I used to replace the shm epic :) but it took my guild a looooong as time to get one (guild first).. anyway.. most of the things you mentioned that can replace shm epic are found on ornate items.. improved heal iv, mana preserve etc.. only thing is the spell haste item is cool as hell but I feel like that is better suited for range while using the shm epic on primary.. <br />
<br />
I still don't feel like you gave me a list of items that can easily destroys the shm epic..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hey zorlac when you chill out call me ok? moron<br />
<br />
if you want to be a beastlord go ahead, but quit whining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Re Zorlac's points, I'd disagree there, Faern is very correct in that the shaman epic is pretty easy, most epics are now if you have sufficient friends with the only limitation being the rarity of some items (of which the shaman epic only really has 1 item bottleneck aka the tear which can be gotten around np).<br />
<br />
The shaman epic may be a bit light on the raw hps now (Eased up a bit by it having 10 sta, remember not all shaman are fatties with oodles of base sta), but its still a very nice item in every other respect having free damage, very respectable saves and plenty of mana + bonus fluff stats.<br />
<br />
However in favor of the tradeskills held totems, ornate (Especially chain) has become a lot rarer again and your not likely to see many new twinks/bazaar built characters with full suits of the stuff and the accompanying focus effects now, so the totems are very useful for pluging gaps in your focus set if your not one for raiding or have just been unlucky.</div></div><hr />
