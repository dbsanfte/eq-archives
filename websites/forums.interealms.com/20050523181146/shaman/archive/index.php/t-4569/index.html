<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vortigern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does alternate experience increase at same rate as regular xp.  That is, if I dedicated 100% of xp gained from hunting to alt. xp, would it go up at same rate as my regular xp with zero dedicated to alt xp?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">alt xp goes up at about the same rate as grinding through level 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am pretty sure 1 AA level equals close to the exp its takes to level through 52. <br />
<br />
AA level increase has no relation to your current level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive &quot;heard&quot; its like going through lvl 51 in the amount of exp needed. All i know for sure is when i worked a few points of aa at 55 (100%)it went quicker than the exp i was getting in 55. I suppose if you worked on it at 51 it would be the same? But there are also no exp penalties worked into AA exp either so as an iksar i wasnt working against the 20% penalty. <br />
<br />
   So yes for the most part AA exp moves quicker than doing regular exp. I just dont know for sure if its any quicker if you did so say lvl 51, 52 or 53 and how much different it would be. From reading what lvl 60 players are doing seem to be able to get an AA ding in 3-6 hrs while that same exp at lvl 58 would move the blue alot less.</div></div><hr />
