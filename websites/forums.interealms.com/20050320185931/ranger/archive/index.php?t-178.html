<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythryn</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would sentient suits be a viable option for a 52 ranger and 45 cleric duo in terms of experience vs. time?  I am trying to get the cleric caught up with me as our ranger/druid combo makes it hard for us to find groups, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jooneau</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Suits of sentient armor hit hard and have a bunch of HPs.  For a 52 ranger and 45 cleric, I would recommend the Hole, Nagafen's Lair, or Lower Guk, especially if your goal is to try to get the cleric caught up with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythryn</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info.  We'll probably do solb or lguk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marader0ro</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The suits are do able. I would add a Shaman to the mix they can turn almost any mob a lump of goo with  there Slow, Cripple, and Malo line. Not to mention there buffing abilities.<br />
<br />
What can I say besides &quot;Shaman, there the heat!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khashik</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about a 54 Ranger partnered with a 54 Shaman? Would this be worth trying for exp? The hole started to go light blue at 53....about a third of the mobs at the entrance are light blue now. I need a new place to exp.....<br />
<br />
If the suits are too tough, what about LDCs in Sol B? Anyone know how much HPs these have? <br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />

You can't single pull these without it until 57.  That said, the other suggested alternatives are still better unless you have a need for Velious quest gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tannus Vidar</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a few duo suit camps with my 55-56 shaman and any 54-56 melee I could get to join me, the exp was great and the quest gems droped plenty...an well as sentient armor.<br />
Exp starts to taper off at 57<br />
<br />
56 was the magic level for consistant solo pulls with my shaman...would usually get them solo at 55, but not always</div></div><hr />
