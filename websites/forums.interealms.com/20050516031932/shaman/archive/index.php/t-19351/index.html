<br />
Spell Casting Sublety<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
Quickened Curing (reduce reuse time on Radiant Cure by 10% per rank)<br />
<br />
Before I forgot... for whatever reason SCS isn't costing me any AAs.. i was able to train up to level 3 without using any AAs.  I'm not complaining.. just wondering what's teh deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well scs would be handy. and radiant cure is good doing it quicker be good, but i wouldnt want it there if it replaced something beter:) (mind nothing i seen so far better)<br />

fury of magic mastery? is that dd? unless they give better dd nope.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SCS will be awesome.  Out of all the new AA's I've seen so far, I might buy it first.  We can put out a lot of aggro, and even a 10% reduction is huge.<br />
<br />
FOMM is cool, too.  It isn't a huge upgrade or anything, but I do a significant chunk of my unimpressive damage via nukes.  Damage isn't that important to me, but if I can upgrade it, I'll take it gladly.<br />
<br />
Hastened Curing definately isn't bad, but I'm not sure how useful it will be.  It would cut RC down from 3 to 2 minutes, but I rarely need it that often.</div></div><hr />

You have a good point-- the big issue is that if a cleric or enchanter gets agro, can I slow, get agro, and save their arses?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You may want to check with the necros about SCS before you get too excited...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SCS for shamans?  You have got to be kidding me.  Is agro generation really an issue for us?  And even if it is, so what?  We can take a hit or two.  Granted those 1-2 hits are *all* we can take at the high end of the game, but still...<br />
<br />
We have spent our entire shaman careers learning how to manage our agro, and I for one am damn proud when I can malos/slow/cripple/dot a critter and never get its attention.  We don't need SCS.  We never have, and never will.  Those that are interested are just lazy.  Plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm people excited about SCS and FOMM... <br />
<br />
1. Agro is not that bad to be honest. If you know how the play the class then you should have a clue or 2 how to (a) minimize agro  (b) handle agro till pulled off you  (c) just avoid it entirely (ie let the damn tank build some for a change).  SCS is nice but I do not see it as a real boon to us.   While better than the endurance regen it is not an AA that makes life better for us really.<br />
<br />
2.  FOMM...happy for those that nuke but those that do not what is the point.  Now if this affects Critical affliction I am happy to take this path but if not...well I have no crit nukes now and doubt I will ever.  My nukes barely come out as is.   <br />
<br />
Sony needs to review our current GoD AA line up and give us a bone or 2, not these junk AAs or the ones currently in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">SCS - the good:  It would be nice to be able to lay a few more dots on a boss before getting summoned and splattered.  Of course, this is why I wanted AFFLICTION SUBTLETY.<br />
<br />
If this is a toggle-able ability, it's a wonderful godsend, and I'd get it in a heartbeat.  But I doubt that'll happen.  Considering my ability to save chanters and clerics with aggro, I think I need that aggro a lot more often than I don't need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Oh, and FOMM sounds great.  Since slow is being mitigated, and the emphasis is on DPS above all else, I'm glad we're getting this bone thrown to us, since giving us a decent DD spell is apparently too unbalancing.  *fails to toggle /sarcasm off*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hail,<br />
<br />
All of these sound nice to me.  I'd get each one.<br />
SCS would probably be first on my list, as I'm frequently the puller in LDoN, and having the mob come back after you (dragging the group with it) because Bane is causing aggro to come BACK the last tick or two is annoying.<br />
<br />
Affliction Subtlety would be better, but I can live with SCS, even if it is innate instead of triggerable.  What would really be nice is one of those focus items like the Sharp Ended Broken Lever the enchies get (reduces Tash aggro) only for spells with disease counters (Turgur's) instead.  That would be awesome.<br />
<br />
FoMM sounds like it won't be high on my list, but something I'd get eventually.<br />
<br />
Reducing Radiant Cure's recast would be worth it to me.  Many times I've had to wait to recast RC after hitting two successive traps within a minute when moving through an Adventure dungeon.  Again not a high priority, but I'll take it. :) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Agro isn't that bad?<br />
<br />
I don't like flaming, so I'll shut up on what I think of those statement :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Here is my take on the agro problem, though...<br />
<br />
Agro while soloing is irrelevant. Agro in exp group IS relevant, and irritating, and disproportional with our contribution... but it's manageable.<br />
<br />
Agro in raid is unbelievable... unless you think the only think you can contribute in a raid is a first class debuffing and a fourth rate heal. And even then, the agro just on slow in ridiculous. And, don't get me wrong, there is definitely fights where healing (or curing, or crowd controlling) IS the right thing to do. But, more often than not, if you think that malos and slow are the extent of your responsibility to your raid... quite frankly, you're a waste of bandwidth.<br />
<br />
And there lies the problem with agro. Because not to STEAL agro from the MT, I got to limit myself to doing less than 60% the DPS necros or druids routinely put out with less or no undue agro. And less than HALF of what I could put out if I had ANYWAY way to control my agro.<br />
<br />
Luckily, Spell Casting Subtlety is a good solution to that. If you honestly think you don't need it, don't buy it. Me, if we FINALLY get it, I'll buy it before Secondary Forte.</div></div><hr />

Do you really think 20% will change anything to the inherent aggro problem of DoTs?<br />
I will still be able to chain nuke for more damage than I could do with my DoTs after this change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">20% may be enough that my druid or cleric won't have to waste mana chain healing me for 10 seconds because that first taunt after slow failed. 20% is DEFINITELY going to be enough for me to sneak in a couple of additional DOTs on the MOBs on where I already do my job without pissing off my main tank. Usually got 3 or 4 other shamans in raid and if we can all do it, here comes a lot of shorter (and thus easier) fights.<br />
<br />
And, again, the really great thing about this is that, if you don't believe you need it, you can skip on it and NOT buy it... and continue to become a grease stain on the floor more often than you would have if you had.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it's one of those upgrades with no downside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Honestly, I disagree. Slow hasn't been a problem for a long time. I don't know when the last time was I died due to slow aggro(only place this argument may be valid is Water). <br />
It's easy to say this has no downside and thus it's good. A new Disease DoT has no downside either, is it good, though?<br />
<br />
My aggro problem is bad, I admit that. But the sole reason for that is the broken DoT coding and SCS would theoretically enable me to generate 20% more &quot;detrimental&quot; hate. How many DoTs can you stack without getting killed? 2? 3? What's 20% of that? There's my point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">We don't need SCS. We never have, and never will. Those that are interested are just lazy. Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
Could very easily argue that it's just the opposite...  How is wanting to be able to cast more or sooner lazy?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it'll be handy.  Will take a bit of learning to know what you can get away with with the 20% reduction, though.  I'm very good at not getting aggro now, but wouldn't mind being able to do more when wanted/needed.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'll probably get most of the defensive AAs before this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">bah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I am just surprised that we are looking at possibly getting one of the things we have been asking for, and now people are complaining about it.  I usually do not have too much trouble with aggro, if I have tank that knows how to hold aggro.  I was able to cast slow on things as soon as they were pulled in an adventure the other night, without having to worry about aggro, and a warrior was the tank.  With SCS I probably would have been able to put a poison dot on immediately following slow and still not had to worry about aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">OK, let me be a bit more blunt.  SCS does not work with DOT aggro (at least not like you'd expect).  Go read the nec or wiz boards for more concrete info about how it does work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yeah, I didn't think it would be likely to work with dots, but I like it for slow aggro anyway...  I've just started doing some hard LDoNs, and my warrior doesn't make it very long versus an unslowed mob in there, so the sooner I can safely slow, the better.  Those hard missions even have me thinking the new slow might be handy.  /shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">i think it cos they wanted the agro from poison dot spells in particualr dealt with, as said the scs doesnt help to much with dots., still should help with the other stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">After spending a few nights occasionally being quadded for 4k by reguras, I think I'll take the chance of 20% less aggro being useful. 20% less aggro means you dont have to hold back, can slow faster, or can go 20% further on damage/heal and stay the same. If you dont need it, dont buy it. Me? I'll take that any day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If you don't feel scs is going to help you with survivability then don't buy it.  Of course it's not a solution for the nuts aggro on poi dots (whether it actually works on dots or not is a discussion in itself).  The skill sure as hell isn't going to hurt the shm's odds of living through a debuff cycle.<br />
<br />
Depending on play style this might not be a high priority for some folks, and after playing a little bit with other groups of witchdoctors I can see how some don't have a problem with aggro.  I wouldn't either if I waited 10seconds after the mob was engaged to start a debuff cycle.  Simply differing play styles, neither is right or wrong.<br />
<br />
In the end, it boils down to having the option to buy the skill is better than not having the option.  Suppose we could have been fed Super Advanced Rabid Bear, or some other knock off.  Dev was probably asked by alot of people for some form of aggro reduction, and personally I'm happy to see it.  (provided it goes live of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">if you die/get agro on a debuff cycle on a boss mob you most likley did it too early on a rampaging mob.  There should be no other reason, save the tank dying.<br />
<br />
From my experience PoP agro is largley proximity based, stay out of melee range and give the tank 10-20 seconds to grab the mob and you are fine.  Malos on incoming after the tank arrow tagged the mob isnt an issue either ... 1 arrow &gt; malos agro.<br />
<br />
Another thing i use is, I have spell messages on and watch for an EB proc.  If the tank procs it early i slow right away, 1 EB proc &gt; 1 slow resist agro.<br />
<br />
There are soo many things you can do to optimize your debuff efficiency without grabbing agro, just have to pay attention and not be lazy.<br />
<br />
SCS /shrug i dont die often enough to spend 18 or more points on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">SCS for shamans is completely worthless, in all ways, except maybe if you're the only shaman on the raid and want an extra chance to slow if it bounces.  Depending on the rest of the raid, I can chain rain or nuke from about 95% mob health and I don't get summoned or attacked.  If I lay on a third or fourth dot, I get summoned soon after.<br />
<br />
SCS reduces the initial aggro generated by a spell.  If your spell continuously generates aggro (like DoTs), SCS really does nothing.  When a DoT lands, it places counters on a mob and that generates aggro (for poison it's a lot of aggro) and that will be reduced.  The 1000+ damage per tick for a few stacked DoTs is still pushing you up the aggro list pretty quickly.  You get an extra boost because the people who do the most recent damage on a tick get a little extra aggro.  DoTs are the last damage to be calculated on a tick.  This is why tanks call off other attacks if they lose aggro, they want to be the only one attacking the mob and generating aggro.  Even if one other person is still attacking, it makes regaining the mob's attention a little more difficult.<br />
<br />
Slow aggro is inconsequential on raids.  By the time you're in a decent raiding guild, you should know when you can slow a mob without getting aggro.  Some mobs require more debuffing than others and you have to wait for Tash or Malosinia.  Seldom do raid mobs get below 95% health unslowed, if they're slowable.<br />
<br />
If you're frequently getting slow aggro in an xp group, then kick your tank out, because he stinks.<br />
<br />
I'd rather get Spell Casting Expertise and Mastery of the Past than SCS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">From my experience PoP agro is largley proximity based, stay out of melee range and give the tank 10-20 seconds to grab the mob and you are fine.<br />
<br />
This is really only true for EP gods (FR, Xegony, Coirnav and AoE).  Proximity aggro for them is VERY high.  You can debuff Xegony completely before she even reaches the raid and as long as your tank intercepts her, she won't touch you.  Same with AoE, he just needs to be snared because he runs fast.  Lesser PoP bosses will still rush you or summon you if you bounce too many slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">i didnt say anything about chain slowing =P, but yes if you bounce a few you better take a little time for the next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Anything that reduces agro from any of our spells is great to get.  So what if you don't get agro from slowing.  I get agro all the time from slowing, andI'm sure that the tanks that I fight with have just as good of agro equipment/abilities that yours do.  What this should let me do is generate that much more dmg per mob and make me better at dps.  I'm not one of those shamans that sit there and slow a mob than not cast a spell.  I slow.. wait a few seconds, then start laying in the dmg.  In any normal ldon, I pull.  I pull, slow the mob on the pull and bring it back to camp.  I let the tank get it off of me, throw bane on it (if there are more thana mob in camp this applies) and then nuke.  On hard, I do the same thing and even if i don't stick on the dot, I get summoned after the second DD (mob can be at 40% health with me doing 1k dmg overall.. it doesn't matter).<br />
<br />
Have you guys ever done phase 3 of time.  My clerics actually make bets in their channel of who can heal me at the lowest possible health without me dying.  It doesn't matter who your tanks are, you are going to get agro off of slow in that trial (the trick is to get it and lose it asap of course).  I still on average die at least once or twice.. sometimes more depending on how awake our assist tanks are.  Any form of agro reduction will be much needed for me, cause the mobs are coming into camp two at a time every 20 secs or so, and that's not including the named.  I'm not the type that sits there and just debuffs, so I'll take my less agro and be happy with it.<br />
<br />
With crit dots, secondary forte, and higher crit nukes now, I will prob change my current lineup of spells that I cast on gods.  Usually I use maybe bane and then start with either rains and mixing in some VS if i'm not chaining rains (also started using pox a bit since I got ele legs).  Now, i'll prob be throwing on all dis dots (new one, pox and ultor) and then using rains and maybe torrent in there more.  I was an advocate of not getting crit nukes for a long time, and i still don't think that it should be got over the many other useful AAs that we get first.  However, I do think that once you get it, you should get all of it (well.. at least up to FoM2) cause it will add another dimension to your abilities to do more dmg.  <br />
<br />
Any form of agro reduction is great for us.  I'm sure that I can keep the chanter or cleric happy with getting them off of them with this AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
LOL.....sorry to dissapoint you Ceno, but the endurance system most definitely is live, and yes, melee (at least my warrior does) can certainly use a higher rate of endurance regen. It sucks big time when defensive or some other disc lasts half as long because your endurance bar has run out (firing a disc followed by a few casts of incite drains it pretty fast).<br />
<br />
On the 99 counters thing, that data is from test and likely comes from new spells which are initially templates when placed in the system. As they tweak spells those sorts of things get adjusted. If you bother to look at the history of most of the GoD era spells on test, you will see that most have undergone MANY changes from their first introduction, and probably will undergo a few more. For example, when the first player spells came out, BLs got two new slows similar to our new ones. Those two slows are now a useless stat buff and a dot. Getting your panties in a knot about templates is counterproductive, wait till the thing goes live (allthough I suspect folk like you have your panties pre-knotted before the stuff even hits test  :D )</div></div><hr />

1.  Does SCS just reduce the amount of aggro when a detrimental spell lands, or does it continue to work through time?<br />
<br />
2. Do spells like Slow and Cripple continue to generate aggro while landed, or do they simply put you on the aggro list?<br />
<br />
If SCS is at the time of casting only I think it's usefulness will be highly situational, mostly around mobs that are resistant to slow and cripple.  Being able to cast 2/3 more attempts before getting eaten is nice, but I doubt it's worth a bunch of AA's.  In our guild we have shaman's rotate slow attempts to distribute aggro among us so no one gets on top of hte hate list too quickly.  That seems a more practical situation than spending 12 AA's to be able to cast 2 or 3 more times.<br />
<br />
Will FOMM work on our rain spells?  If so it *might* hvae some usefulness assuming they 1) give us one that does more damage 2) lower the resists on it. <br />
<br />
I can cast BoS on a mob 10 ten times without a resist, but I can't cast my rain once without getting at least one resisted wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Root the mob or heal the player - that works in most cases. Heal is nice aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nukes break root. You also cant rely on the people in your groups to have the brains to back off and let you have proximity aggro, which sometimes people just cant do for some reason. Nor can you rely on a train not coming through and you needing the ability to drag a mob.<br />
<br />
People can generate some serious aggro. Try tanking in PoP while some wizzy thats used to a SK or Pally decides to nuke his brains out. How about when the cleric gets aggro, do you really wanna cast TB 2 - 3 more times then normal to get the mob off them? Heal aggro is crap. It doesnt generate alot of hate unless you chain cast it over and over and over and if your doing that, then your not tanking.<br />
<br />
I like to consider myself a experienced shaman tank. Im good with CC and spliting and pulling adds on to me. I consider myself a weak knight if the situation is right. I also consider myself VERY skilled at handling my aggro at this point in the game. This AA concerns me and those abilities. Again, it would be nice, but being a inate check, is it going to be worth it in the long run for the style shaman i play cause as i said, i have a high skill level in maintaining my aggro levels. So basicly do i want a AA to take over that for me and make it easier or fully maintain a manual control on it.  <br />
<br />
Tough call, i wish i could try it and unspend AA if it was too much reduction.</div></div><hr />

This is a ****ing joke of a comment. On my raids, even when I am the only Shaman, 99% of the mobs are Slowed in under 5 seconds. Sometimes even before they hit the camp and I still tell you I don't get aggro from Slows. Not all mobs behave the same, but again Slow aggro isn't the issue and SCS won't do much for DoTs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what kunark mobs you are facing, but I start malos on a mob before he gets to camp, and by the time that he's slowed just after he gets into camp, I'm getting hit a good % of the time.  Regardless of whether or not he hits me or stays on me, I still want to be able to start casting spells on him asap and SCS should let me do that a bit more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">On raids, I try and make a point of standing near the MT. Puller rounds the corner with the mob, and the MT starts tossing arrows or whatever to draw it's attention, that's when Malos goes off. Quickly followed by Slow.<br />
<br />
Haven't been slapped around yet. Though depending how/when the MT goes down, I'm on a one way trip to a rezz request, but generally it works.<br />
<br />
Way I look at it is, if I draw aggro above the clerics healing the MT, this is a good thing. Gives a few extra seconds for a ST or someone else to draw aggro on themselves, rather than letting something knock clerics around. It's just easier to get rezz'd by living clerics, than wait for them to get rezz'd themselves and have to wait.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I personally use slow to break mobs off from multiple pulls, so less agro on that spell not be good for what I want.  Have never really had problems dying from slow agro.  And since the evidence from the necro boards doesn't seem to indicate that scs will help with my dot agro, it seems kind of mute for me to get it.<br />
<br />
I find it funny that people are saying they can chain nuke and not pull agro.  None of them seem to pick up on why that is.  Is it because our nuks generate a lot of agro, or is it because our nukes just plain suck?  If I was a mob and I saw a shaman chain nuking me, I'd be more worried about dogdog hurting me than I would be about the shaman.  Please, use a different argument people...<br />
<br />
The only agro I want reduced from my spells is the agro generated by my dots.  This aa does not solve that problem, plain and simple.  I'm waiting to be impressed by GoD and so far, it hasn't happened.<br />
<br />
Where is the upgrade to Q and our other healing spells?  Where is the longer duration and greater percentage on our new slow?  Where is the nuke we wanted or the dots we wanted fixed?  How come there are no reports that our pet is lvl 60 and dw'ing on his own?  And how come our buffs still suck???  Fix the main issues Sony and stop dicking us over...</div></div><hr />

I can slow mobs before they're even damaged and not get aggro pretty much everytime. <br />

I find that Kunark remark kinda humorous. I think you're my new hero.<br />
<br />
Less posting, more learning when to slow which mobs, Sir. Maybe you can avoid dieing in P3 then(I'd start with the basics and start slowing the MA mob first instead of slowing offtanke mob #2 and #3 which aren't engaged yet. That suggestion was free of charge btw).<br />
<br />
And Snap, I don't Malos 99% of the mobs. Trash mobs don't require Malos usually.</div></div><hr />

I rarely use malos on anything but named, and I work on basically the same principle giac does.  IE its slowed before it gets into camp, or right after.  Sure I get agro occasionally, but it doesnt happen as often as you might think, especially if a bst manages a preslow faster than I cast :).  I don't even die very often, usually :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, good idea.  But then, there goes all that agro on the healers who were healing the guy getting hit with mob #1 because mob #2 and #3 have not been engaged yet.  No, i will continue casting malos on every mob into camp and slow them asap.  I'd rather let myself die than let clerics die, because like it's been posted before, we own at getting mana back quickly.  <br />
<br />
The only deaths that I don't take lightly is when the mob hitting me is still 100% (or 99% from my dmg shield).  It happens once in a while and I get on my tanks for it.  Dying is our way of life.  The less agro I get from slow, the better.<br />
<br />
And you are right, malos is not required on all trash mobs that are pulled.  Mobs in alot of the lower tiered planes can be slowed fairly easy without malos.  Mobs in some of the earth rings can be slowed without malos.  Mobs in earthb and above, get used to being at your bind point if you don't use malos there.  On that note, i'm not waiting till the mob is at 90 - 95% to start tryin to slow.  I'm not jeopardizing the life of my healers for my own health.</div></div><hr />

Rabid Companion 3 is a proc for pet that does the following:<br />
Rabid Companion Effect III Detail | History | Raw Data <br />
<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1: Decrease Hitpoints by 75 <br />
<br />
<br />
Mana: 0 Casting Time: 0 <br />
Recast Time: 0 Fizzle Time: 0 <br />
Resist: Disease Resist Adjust -30 <br />
Range: 200 Location: Any <br />
Time of Day: Any Interruptable: Yes <br />
Target Type: Single Spell Type: Detrimental <br />
Source: Test 01/22 <br />
<br />
Looking at my log, my pet proc'd 30x in 5minutes and 18 seconds when the skill was still there.<br />
<br />
Ancient Fury needed some work, the crit rate was rather low(Not expecting it to be fairly high either).  Most of the crits were for under max dmg, a few were in the 70s and I had a couple for 100ish.<br />
<br />
These &quot;pet AAs&quot; were more than just &quot;fun&quot; They actually improved our pets. The skill they should of removed was the advanced spirit call.<br />

If people don't know to back off a rooted mob at 65 I don;t know what to tell you. And how in the hell is having an ability to aggro more gonna help you if you get trained? If someone is nuking their brains out and gets aggro that is THEIR problem, THEY need to learn how to manage THEIR aggro. Dunno about you but I am always able to do more when I don't have aggro than when I have something trying to beat my brains out and interrupting my casts. If you are dying for a kickass CC ability, look into VP3, it's very nice. And didn't you quit EQ or something anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Merwenn0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">****, if your that worried about getting aggro, take the aa's you were going to put into scs and put them into CA3, CS3, ND3, LR5, and ID5.<br />
