<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is a Journeymans Walking stick, worth the inventory slot for shamans? or it just another death wish? <br />
<br />
I was thinking of getting one incase the enchanters got killed. But I was depating  if I would acctualey use it. I carry bags full of stuff atm. So I am not sure if I need to carry one more thing.<br />
<br />
Anyone have one? and how often do you use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Love it. Definatly get one. Hand it to ya mele when partnering against high MR mobs, invaluable to the non malo shaman (me) =)<br />
<br />
Just dont forget to get it back!<br />
<br />
Dont expect it to be that useful if you are going to be the one swinging it unless you have a very high 1hb skill,  have a haste item and some celerity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">think it would be most useful in pvp, for that reason I really want one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've carried one for ages, HOT was the original reason I got it.  The chanters at the time would always wait til it was 1/2 to3/4 dead before tashing, so I busted out the stick to tash it myself.  Actualy worked somewhat well, but these days I don't hardly ever bust it out unless I run into something hard to slow without a chanter or bard, which I don't normally run across anyways where I'd need tash.  The chanters on the raids now are much more trustworthy, and I don't have to do it myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i like the tash stick, I often hunt with a monk who has a tash stick and that makes so much possible, of course i could just get 60 and scribe malo but all in due time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Damn, that reminds me, i need to get my tash stick back from my drood friend.  I hope he didn't sell it, man . . .<br />
Cause i remember the day when i won that from a crypt group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it won't kill you, procced tash doesn't taunt anywhere near as much as enchanter cast tash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually it does. Chanters are just sissies...<br />
<br />
I hear yah in HoT. Sometimes the chanter is awake and tashes semi early. But usually someone with a Jman stick (bards pror stacking purposes) tashes it first so I can slow. Goddam they are delusional abut the aggro on that thing. One melee swing or a single taunt outaggroes it. Of course they learned that it's huge aggro then they cast it after just a hit with a bow or such like most level 30ish chanters would...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have one of these sticks, use it from time to time. Definately worth the slot, especially compared to some of the other junk I carry around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Playing with severely unskilled enchanters is a royal pain.  <br />
There have been times I've just given up and left raids over this issue.  <br />
There have been times I've booted chanters from the group for being asses.  <br />
Nobody is immune by class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Have one, love it.<br />
<br />
Really handy vs. Dragons with no Enchanter around (Hi, Yeldema).<br />
<br />
You won't use it all the time (because it can take a while to proc sometimes), but it can be really handy in certain situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got a malisement stick from Kedge a while back, had 5 charges of Malisement, now i've never used it before yesterday, but a red mob came up, and i figured what they hell better than standing around canning through the fight.  Hit it and bam instantly the mob was hit with malisement.  So i'm left to wonder.  Will it always stick or was it pot luck that malisement, a spell that has trouble sticking on blues, stuck on a red in an instant? I only have 4 charges left, any way i can recharge or should only reserve this for the most dire of circumstances.  Until level 6 any more than 4 charges would have made this stick phenominal.</div></div><hr />
