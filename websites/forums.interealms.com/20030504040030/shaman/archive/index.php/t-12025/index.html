<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Prices on 63 up spells on Karana.  SHAME ON YOU!  Most traders do NOT have guild tag showing - too embarassed to let community know what a bunch of HOSERS they are.  Please join me in refusing to pay out the ying yang for these spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buffcake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not on your server, but I know what you mean.  I have been a victim &amp; guilty as well.  It's all about supply &amp; demand.  How much did you pay for Torpor? For Malo?  I got Torpor @ a guild Dragon kill (phew!) but paid 60k for Torpor (ack!).  They were high-priced due to the caliber of mobs that dropped them &amp; rarity of the drop when you DID kill that mob. <br />
Now, with 63+ spells there's a new factor: FLAGS.  You want that 63-64 spell, you have to be flagged for the tier zones that drop Spectral Parchments.  You want the 65 spells, get flagged for the tier that drops Runes.  Until you get those flags, you are either lucky enough to the 63+ spells from a friend who IS flagged, or you pay out the wazzoo to the person who is selling these spells that are low in supply but high in demand.  I paid 30k for Talisman of the Boar &amp; 25k for Blessing of Replenishment, but I also sold a duplicate copy of Focus of the Seventh for 120k in less than an hour of being on my Bazaar mule.  Supply &amp; demand.  Right now, it's great for the peeps with the supply &amp; sucks for the ones with the demand.  But I commend you if you can hold out a few months for the supply to increase.  Remember those Spirit Call spells that went for (@ least on MY server) 10-20k when PoP came out?  I saw one today selling for 1.2k in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got all four of my SK's lvl 62 spells for a total of 400pp.  And am content to wait for saturation.  Last time I tried to speculate I paid 10k for one of the 61/62 spells with resale in mind and the next day the bottom fell out on 61/62 spells.  I am CERTAIN the bottom will fall out of 63/64 and probably 65 latter - none seem as rare as torpor and malo - which in my troll size brain pan are worth a ton of money because of their rarity.<br />

Oh well life goes on.<br />

<br />
Just target them and type /guildstat<br />
you should know in which guild they are if they have one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tsag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/guildstatus &lt;nameofcharacter&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wait a minute, are you saying that 60k for Talisman of Alacrity isn't a bargain?<br />
<br />
/cough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Alvar Coldraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, the most part they wont have any guildtag on their toons if they dont want people knowing their guild is off-loading spells or they are, which is kinda moot if there are only a couple of guilds obtaining these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, there's a much less sinister reason traders go /anon :)<br />
<br />
My guild requests you make your trader anon so that they don't clog up the guild listing making it harder for people to see who's really on and available for fun.<br />
<br />
Of course this is less of a factor since the guild list was expanded past 20 lines, and the new guild tool was released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You should play on Sullon Zek, our guild enchanters rock.  We do not pay for ANY spells and all are merit.  Then again, on a team server our guild is united, and even though we are 200+ we all take care of each other.   I am missing only 2 lv65 spells and 4-5 63-64s.  Neutral team is the way to go for endgame.<br />
