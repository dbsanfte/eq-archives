<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been pondering this for a while, and I wanted to compile a list. What changes have been made to the game that you could no longer live without? <br />
<br />
Note: This is not an attempt to lighten the hearts of our community, just a personal interest. Here's a few of my personal favourites that have been implemented since I began in 2000. Id be happy if people could add their own favourites.<br />
<br />
List:<br />
<br />
Duck (The D key. Previous to this, spell-casting was interupted only by moving and waiting for the spell casting to end)<br />
<br />
Being unable to combine items in a container unless they were a recipe.<br />
<br />
Containers no longer accepting stacked items when combining.<br />
<br />
Not having to meditate looking at your spellbook. (Rearranged my spellbook dozens of times out of boredom!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Being able to type a certain amount of money instead of using the slider bar.<br />
<br />
Being able to open bags IN the bank. <br />
<br />
The compass.<br />
<br />
Raid channels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Opening more than 2 bags at once.<br />
<br />
(Money thing = phenomenol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Being able to pick up items off a stack with out having to use the slider.<br />
<br />
10 banks of 10 hotkeys instead of 6 of 6 and more socials</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being able to buy a stack (or partial stack) of things at one time instead of clicking 'BUY&quot; 20 (or 40, or 60) times (I could supply numerous /gu comics references for this)<br />
<br />
I second more than 2 bags at once<br />
<br />
additional bank space from LoY<br />
<br />
Maps --Previous to the introdiction of the maps with LoY I had (and still have, actually) 6 binders beside my PC with maps for each (some hand drawn, some from EQAtlas).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dirtnap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when giving items to the wrong NPC they will return it to you &quot;I have no need for this item&quot;.<br />
<br />
Dog not taking exp anymore.<br />
<br />
Shared Bank slots<br />
<br />
Shared money<br />
<br />
and everything mentioned above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some people think they take away from the roll play aspect of the game but I LOVE the PoK stones.  I always hated the &quot;down time&quot; of the boats.  I have seen so much more of the game because of those stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Graveyards - can t remember how many CRs it saved me.<br />
The new tradeskill UI - good bye carpal tunnel.<br />
LDoN - only got 2 hours? Grab an adventure quick and see real progress.<br />
<br />
and much more, most of which has been mentioned above. I will never understand how I put up without many of these things when I started in '99. Much is just too obvious a solution to a pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brysk Grayfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Linked Item...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Linked Item...<br />
<br />
Was wondering why no one mentioned this yet!  :D  Had to put stuff in bags and trade it over, plus not every knew all the items by name so you would have to type out all of the stats...<br />
<br />
I second Pok stones and the ingame maps  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">long duration food/drink but I kinda miss my muffins ;)<br />
custom UI's<br />
&quot;Hide All Traders&quot; is quickly moving up the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Linked Item, sheesh, thats a daddy of a change. I still recall having to decide whether I wanted the loot by reading the stats written out... <br />
<br />
Str5 Sta5 hp40 mana20 svc5 svp7 svf10 clr/dru/shm/nec/wiz/enc/mag hum/hie/ etc etc.... nightmare!!<br />
<br />
Imagine some of the time loot now, if it had to be written out like that!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Im gonna have to agree on the stones, i hated waiting for the bloated belly to travel between Kunark and Antonica. <br />
<br />
Bank slots from LoY.<br />
<br />
Linking items.<br />
<br />
Chat windows.<br />
<br />
But to tell you the truth, i miss the spell book.  It was nice when you hit 30 to finally get a sense of accomplishment, however small it may be, and in pvp, it was a VERY big accomplishment.  You no longer had to worry about medding and getting attacked blindly.  Ahhh the good old days eh? :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The new UI and the removal of the spell book while medding. They saved the game for me, made a huge difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1. Plane of Knowledge books ... oh, wonderful, wonderful for an impatient shaman!<br />
<br />
2. I would like to kiss the person who added extra bank slots with the LOY expansion. Being a guild officer is hell on a man's bank space. Whoever you are, I love you. No, really.<br />
<br />
3. Friendly NPC's who do not steal items they don't have any use for.<br />
<br />
4. Hide all traders. I highly suspect this was designed by the same person who gave us #2 on my list. Again, I love you. Seriously.<br />
<br />
5. &quot;Shared&quot; money ... Gives me a slot for my personal plat and a slot for the guild's plat ... and makes it easy to transfer plat between alts. I love this person, too.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Most of the changes I do like, but there are a couple that I don't care for.<br />
<br />
1. Bring back the spell book for medding at low levels. As much as I hated staring at it, there were 2 very good points to it. the first was I leveled my butt of to get rid of it, and second was the sense of accomplishment at finally having gotten rid of it.<br />
<br />
2. PoK stones - These do make travel very easy, but the rob alot of the thrill from the game as well. Remember the thrill of running from Qeynos to freeport for the first time, running Kith at night, the challenge of getting from Paineel to Qeynos while KoS in Erudin? At higher levels they are fine, but for those starting out the thrill of discovering the world, and the challenges of moving through areas where it feels like you are being hunted have a rush all thier own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">things not yet mentioned.<br />
<br />
1. mounts.<br />
<br />
2. the Bazaar itself.<br />
<br />
3. cheap 10 slot Giant bags on a vendor in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Surprised this isn't mentioned yet:<br />
<br />
mass/target group buff<br />
<br />
now if only it worked for shrink!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Number one:  People no longer being able to loot your corpse if you gave them /consent.<br />
<br />
Everything else:  distant second, but here's a random couple.<br />
<br />
Chat channels, including raid channels and all the raid goodies.<br />
<br />
Anything involving handling inventory.  As a max tradeskiller, handling inventory used to be absolutely brutally time consuming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think the bag tokens in the baz is a cool thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A very old one, but the ability to change color of text.  There was eqcolors, but don't think that was out for a while when EQ was first released.  Purple tells ... ew. <br />
<br />
And everything else mentioned in previous posts, I agree, I couldn't live without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Maps --Previous to the introdiction of the maps with LoY I had (and still have, actually) 6 binders beside my PC with maps for each (some hand drawn, some from EQAtlas).<br />
<br />
I still have a HUGE ****in binder of maps, alchemy recipies, and spell listings somewhere around here. It was massive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Aye Garf, I still have a 3-inch binder full of maps for nearly every zone on every continent, and I have a 2.5-inch binder full of spell lists, slow information, recipes and guides for each tradeskill ... and in spite of in-game maps and such, I use them both almost every day. :) Sometimes you just can't beat paper.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">OMG i forgot...<br />
<br />
1. /memspellset<br />
<br />
2. autoinventory when looting your corpse!<br />
<br />
the only maps i still have on paper are the continent maps with all the zone connection /loc's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">tradeskill UI is big for me... I wouldn't have my earring without it - no way in hell would I have done the thousands and thousands of combines manually... NOTHING is worth that.<br />
<br />
I miss the helms with horns though... I want my horns back - but not on the old model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ALT-TAB.  Made my PC useful again.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I can live without all of that - I fact I am doing that just now. Should be a big clue to SOE that no matter how many small convieniences they implement in a very slow pace it still doesnt change the core of the game becoming more and more unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Making root and snare stackable. God I hated those days when one would overwrite the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I miss the helms with horns though... I want my horns back - but not on the old model.<br />
<br />
I still remember fondly the day I got my JBB helm and stood in the EC tunnel showing it off and admiring my helm + mostly totemic gear. I loved the viking horn look on the old model, it was so boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Surprised nobody mentioned it....(except BlargX but his was more in the way of channels)<br />
<br />
The Raid functionality. No more ninja-looting. No more moaning about not being in the xp group. Automatic raid chat channel. Visibility of exactly how many and of what levels/classes are in the raid... how did we live without it!?<br />
<br />
More minor ones that I've not seen above (some great ones already listed!)<br />
<br />
AA skills. Finally had to make decisions on progression and I find it more interesting than the direct level grind<br />
<br />
GoD Leadership skills - I love HoTT and spell awareness amongst others<br />
<br />
Rogue SoS - How many times have raids recovered from wipes thanks to this?! Also a godsend for doing VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I miss the helms with horns though... I want my horns back - but not on the old model <br />
I was happy when I got my Incorporeal Helm and it still had the horn graphic. But I do miss those GIANT horns from the old totemic on the old models.  You felt like a real shaman the first time you put your horns on (upgrading from the giant polar bear head)<br />
<br />
OH and all that stuff already mentioned is great.</div></div><hr />
