For those of you that spent time in VT, or are allready in the elemental planes... this doesn't apply to you, but the rest of you should seriously look into this item.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Benevolence was my old range slot, and seems to be pretty common among shaman.  Switching to this increased my HP by 1(woot!) and I lost about 50 mana.  I'd gladly give up 50.. even 100 mana for this focus effect.  It reduces time for all buffs obviously, but also reduces Torpor and Tnarg's.  I've got QB2 right now and my Torpor has a 3.3 second cast time.  If I got QB3, that'd be 1.8 second Torpor!  I think this is a must have for anyone that doesn't have a ridiculous item in their range slot.<br />
<br />
It drops in CoD, off of what... i'm not sure.  If you're looking to buy one, you can normally pick it up in the 30-50k range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it drops of some of the minis in the bertoxx ring or it might have been when we did Carpin.. cant remember.. Its not easy to get anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am pretty sure that you cannot get the cast time's below 50%, so you'd find QB3 a total waste of time.<br />
<br />
It is a v nice range item tho - I would love to get hold of one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I get the &quot;spell recovery time not yet met&quot; stuff more often now with the bone.. Specially when I cast canniV and torpor after..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm... can anyone confirm that you can't get cast times below 50%.. don't wanna waste 9 aa's =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can test it pretty easily, qb2 gives 25%, the bone gives 20%, so add in the cleric spell haste buff (10%), you should have 55% haste.  Then look at your spell cast times, they should all show as exactly 50%.  It's also beneficial only, so no speed up on dots, slows, debuffs, etc.  Not sure if that includes heals or not, anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Haste of Mithaniel does affect regular heals such as tnarg's but not kraggs. Tnarg goes down to 3.0sec with just this focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spell hastes can not go below 50% of normal casting time. QB2 + enhancement haste 3 item + cleric buff = half cast time not 25 + 30 + 10 or 65% off. Save your aa points.</div></div><hr />
