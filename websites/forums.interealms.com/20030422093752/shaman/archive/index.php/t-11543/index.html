<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dubarnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay i am currently in the process of updating my equipment.  Until just recently most of my gear was from the Kunark zones.  I sold my Hiero Cloak and obulus death shroud and upgraded much of my jaundiced bone armor (helm/feet/hands), Upgraded my rubicite bp, and my jasarth scale leggings, and of course replaced the armor in shoulders/back.  I was also able to purchase a horse (glue factory) with the cash.  I currently have 3K pp left over.<br />
i am thinking that i should Sell my JBB since i primarily group in PoP and have no need for it since there are no really good places to solo.  If i sell it i should get around 18K (Xegony Server).  With about 20K in mind, what of my equipment should i upgrade (i'm looking at ears/face/ring (jasper one) and maybe my primary/secondary/range stuff.  Please give me some advice.  Also i dont want to save money for spells, my guild raids enough and i can get to zones and loot these spells eventually.  I dont want to drop a bunch of cash into a scroll, it doesn't seem worth it.<br />
Here is link to my equip:  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=536791</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. Ditch the +wis ring for a velium fire wedding ring(6ac, 65hp. 400pp<br />
<br />
3.  Do the Earring of the Solstice Quest. 7-9kpp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just some ideas from looking at your profile...<br />
<br />
Back: hiero cloak <br />
Arms: Grey Flesh Arms<br />
Fingers: 6ac/65 hp.. Valorium Ring of Gallantry... Circled Toe Bone<br />
Shield: Orb of the Infinite Void... Tae Ew Shield(smithed)<br />
Range: Goranga Idol....Talisman of Benevolence(quested)<br />
Head: Circlet of Falikhan(quested)<br />
Ear: Silver Hammer Earring.... Earring of the Solstice(quested)<br />
Belt: Chitinous Belt... Artificers(smithed)<br />
Shoulders: Dragonhide mantle(worked, reinforced... and so on)<br />
Neck: Tracking Wolf Collar<br />
Face: Death Mask of the Elysians<br />
<br />
Almost forgot... Epic!!<br />
 <br />
    All of this is fairly easy to get as a drop and/or find in the bazaar. The easiest thing to do in terms of looking for upgrades is create a realistic goal(such as 2k hps and 1k ac while keeping wis at 175ish) and see what you need to do that.<br />
Try to fix your ac in your profile(defense skill is probably not set properly)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dubarnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) how many RL hours does it take to do equip quest?<br />
2) why would you ditch i ditch 7 wis for 65 hp?  doesn't seem like an even trade off, not to mention that small amoun of hp is insignificant.<br />
3) 9K for an earring?  I've seen that earring it's not that good, i'm not looking for top of the line stuff, i'm just looking for an upgrade to gear that is good for my lvl that i can replace w/ Planar/Luclin/Velious items.</div></div><hr />

The latest thinking is that hp is the most important thing, followed by AC, then mana, then wisdom.<br />
<br />
Wisdom (and +mana items) determines the total size of your mana resevoir. But the secret is, not how much mana your resevoir can hold, but how quickly you can refill it. <br />
<br />
i.e. Mana regeneration is more important than total wisdom. Unless you have lots of flowing thought stuff (and most of us do not), your main source of mana regeneration (apart from sitting on your a$$) is to cannibalise. So, your rate of mana regeneration is determined by both your total hp and your rate of hp regeneration. Spells such as torpor, used in conjunction with cannibalisation, basically giver you loads and loads of hp for conversion to mana, thus keeping your rate of mana regeneration high regardless of your wisdom.<br />
<br />
Hp have the added bonus of keeping you alive.<br />
<br />
that, my friend, is why hp &gt; wisdom</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're level 58, right? Using can IV to regen mana at 148 a pop?  Surely you can see the value of 65 hitpoints when you are casting Can IV over and over again.<br />
<br />
Plus, you're going to keep leveling and eventually want Can 5, an incredibly powerful way for shaman to regen mana.  It takes off 1924 hitpoints every time.  It's a good idea to plan your gear goals around what it would take to solo with your own buffs while using can 5.<br />
<br />
I've always thought it's not base mana pool but mana regen that really makes a difference, the secret to shaman mana regen is all about hitpoint to mana conversion.</div></div><hr />

1. The quests take time, but how much time depends on how fluent you are in the game, if you have a group of friends you play with or if you are in a guild. Hard to say.<br />
<br />
2. We get all our mana from cannabalizing our health. We don't sit on the ground medding,we cannabalize. Get as much HP gear as you can IMHO.<br />
<br />
3. The Earring of the Solstice is like 5ac, 5sta/wis/int, 55hp, 55mana, +5 resists. Its acquired through a quest which requires you to collect like 8 specific crafted items and combine them before giving them to a halfling in Luclin. You can find the quest on Allakhazam. For the money its one of the best earrings out there period. Plus it has the effect Flowing Thought I on it which adds a point of mana regen that is always working for you. More mana is never a bad thing.</div></div><hr />
