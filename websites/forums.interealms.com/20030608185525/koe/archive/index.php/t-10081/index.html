<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all.<br />
<br />
I was wondering... how much should a 49 mage expect to pay, and where should one go to find the three pets that need to have the spells researched?  I have been without these spells for over a year.  I have earth, but am looking for fire, water, and air.<br />
<br />
Any info/help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Baracus knows the pain and suffering i've endured related to these darn things.  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Baracus introduced me to this wonderful thing just off the Nexus zone called the &quot;Bazaar&quot;.<br />
<br />
I found someone selling both the Water and AIR pets (level 49) so all i need now is FIRE.  :) <br />
<br />
Wohooo!<br />
<br />
Thats a pretty cool new addon, i really must say.  Good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OMG, yesterday was AWSOME!  Not only did I get my Jboots but I also found someone selling the 49 FIRE PET in bazaar yesterday for a very very reasonable price.  SWEET!<br />
<br />
Not only did i get it for myself, but I spread the word to other sorry mages like myself who were without out one of the most wonderfull pet spells around.<br />
<br />
Burn baby burn!!! :)  <br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
All of the level 49 pets can be vendor bought in Katta.  None of the drop-only pets are available, but all of the research pets and most of the research spells can be purchased there for the usual 30pp or so....<br />

<br />
Sorry man.</div></div><hr />
