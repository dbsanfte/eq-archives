<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is just another one of those thank you notes for all of the information that I have gathered from the board here.<br />
<br />
I started reading back when I was about level 20 or so.  I had some pretty bad gear, but I was having a ball.  As I started to grow, I realized the change that happens in the life of a Shaman when we get Canni and finally a pet.  I knew what to expect with those changes because of what I read here.<br />
<br />
After getting my pup, I realized that I was badly lacking in AC and defence.  I spent a lot of time tanking for my pup to increase defence and slowly improving my gear to have better AC.  I am not a total AC freak, but I think that I am doing well.  I made some mistakes when creating my character, so my starting Wis was pretty low.<br />
<br />
At level 44, I left the Tundra Yeti caves for the open Mountains of Rathe in the hopes of gaining enough to buy a JBB.  I was tanking for my pup as I was taking on Hill Giants.  Money was slow, but it was the best that I could do.  I was gaining some defence slowly and having fun.<br />
<br />
The value of what I had learned all came to light last week.  I finally got my JBB at level 46.  (I had to borrow some plat to pay the 13k that it was selling for)  After heading back to Rathe to make some money to pay off the loan, I started to learn some strategies for using the new toy.  I found what worked best for me was to slow the giant, then root it and send in the pup.  Once that was done, I stood back and started to click on my wrist.  If root broke, it broke.  I can take the hits and channel through.  That is when it hit me:  I can take the hits and channel through!<br />
<br />
I owe this realization and the ability to the information that I have learned here.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />
