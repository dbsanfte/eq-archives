Warriors new cap is 2100 and Rangers are about 1800. However, I cannot find anything to substantiate this. Are these just rumors? Or is this true, it would be nice to actually feel like my 1700 AC is actually doing something.</div></div><hr />

i never parsed the defense stuff, the only thing I usually test is offensive things; the above numbers were simply taken from other people's conclusions, not any info I got for myself.</div></div><hr />
