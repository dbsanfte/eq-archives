<br />
A guide to mobs that can be slowed, with thanks to Nixx for the inspiration, Seredith for her years of work on the guide and all the shamans on the crucible for their contributions.  Due to the Size, the actual slow tables will be hosted on the Shaman's Crucible Website.  This allows for better formatting and easier editing.<br />
<br />
SHAMAN'S CRUCIBLE GUIDE TO MOB SLOWABILITY  &lt;==Click me!<br />
Last Update: December 01, 2003 <br />
<br />
<br />
When posting updates please only include personal first-hand confirmations of slowability.<br />
 -FULL NAME OF MOB<br />
 -NAME OF ZONE<br />
 -SLOW SPELL USED (MAGIC - TURGURS or DISEASE - GRUMMUS)<br />
 -IMMUNITY OR MITIGATION MESSAGE<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are reporting a &quot;contested&quot; mob is slowable, screenshots are appreciated! It is assumed that magic/disease debuffs are cast - Shaman Malos line (or Insidious Decay), Enchanter Tash line and/or bard debuffs like Harmony/Occlusion of Sound.<br />
<br />
I'll be periodically cleaning up this thread to aid in readability, while I update the tables on the web.  If your post doesn't include full mob names, zones and slowability info that is used to update the tables it will be removed.  All posts used to update the table will be kept for future reference.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for your contributions!<br />

<br />
With malo-&gt;malosini, oos, tash, and insidious decay I and my fellow guild shaman (both 62) have failed to slow him on 3 encounters, with both magic and disease based slows.<br />
<br />
Anyone else got recent experiances with Velketor? Maybe I've just been unlucky, but maybe he's been changed a bit and needs ** next to his name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have never been able to slow Velketor and have never seen him slowed. I have not yet tried him since I hit 65 and had malos and malosinia though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Re Velketor. He was always listed as unslowable until relatively recently when mob resistances were changed and reports started to filter in about landing turgurs on him.<br />
<br />
Shortly after that Tunare was reported as slowable but I think she got adjusted again, been a while since I went up against her but I started to think she'd gone back to slows bouncing.<br />
<br />
The chart will be fluid by nature, so, Velketor, what say you all? Could be that Prophets are able to land it when Oracles have trouble - a bit like Ixiblat, I never managed to slow that rotter before hitting 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I tried to slow velketor recently (at level 60) and had no luck.<br />
<br />
What Seredith says about Oracles and Prophets is a good point - it would be useful to have the level of the slower included in the chart. So an oracle like me, say, could look and see &quot;veleketor, slowable with turgurs, reported by a level 65&quot;, and know that I probably have no chance :)<br />
<br />
Just an idea though, this info might not be available or it might be too much work to include. Either way, this is a great resource, thanks for making it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">&lt;b&gt;A Mystical Arbitor of Earth - slowable ? &lt;=====<br />
<br />
Plane of Earth B <br />
**************************** <br />
War Chieftan Awsano - slowable ? &lt;=====<br />

War Chieftan Galronar - slowable? &lt;=====<br />
Warlord Gintolaken - slowable? &lt;=====&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Arbitor is &quot;mostly&quot; slowable. All 3 War Chieftains in Earth B are slowable (partially or slightly I think, don't remember). Warlord Gintolaken is not slowable in my experience, though he does not give immune flag. He seems to be magic immune as we've never landed Malosinia, Cripple or Turgur's on him. Same experience with Insidious Decay and Cloud of Grummus (after casting Malicious Decay of course). I think he's about as easy to slow as landing Turgur's on Rydda Dar or Mithaniel Marr. Maybe it lands 1 in 1000 tries, but you're better off healing or casting some poison on Warlord I think (don't use dots or rains around the time that he's going to blur, or you may go splat).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">&lt;b&gt;Also the &quot;Clones&quot; of VZ during the rallos script really seem to vary.... the harder hitting ones are either fully or partially slowable. the pussified ones that only hit for like 650 are immune.&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
There's only 2 clones during that VZ. One is fully slowable (and not mezzable) the other is slow immune (but mezzable). We've done that part of the script more times than I can count, this is how it has always been for us.<br />
<br />
During the real VZ they vary a lot. Some are fully slowable, some are immune, some are partially slowable.</div></div><hr />

It took three tries, and even then I got the message that the spell was only &quot;slightly successful&quot;.  I've found that I am better off saving my mana for spot heals than wasting it on the slow.  <br />
<br />
Sort of a related point, these mobs make warriors viable again.  I've wiped to the BoT named a few times with pallies and SKs tanking.  Then the ranger logs off and gets her warrior, he goes evasive, and the encounter becomes trivially easy.</div></div><hr />

1. Yael no longer exists, it's a lvl 70 Construct (reaver wannabe).<br />
<br />
2. Most constructs cannot be magic-slowed, are partially slowable via disease, and are susceptible to all except pure magic. (Ie high MR, normal to low cold, normal fire, disease, and poison.)<br />
<br />
3. Gargoyles are slowable, IIRC.<br />
<br />
4. Ghosts are slowable.<br />
<br />
5. *No* named (&quot;Old&quot; something, &quot;Ancient&quot; something, etc) is slowable.<br />
<br />
(Above based on testing done via a high 50's group, with 56 shaman doing the slowing. Also based on a 58 and 59 chanter trying. Logs are available from my (paladin) perspective with the note inserted via /g regarding the impact spells were having.)</div></div><hr />

It's usuaully Malicious Decay then plague for a quick slow, but like it was said, they are only partially slowable.  The ghosts down there are a quick and easy magic slow usually without malos.  All this done by a 65 Shaman<br />
<br />
Do need to add that I have slowed Naggy before.  It took about 15 casts and when I did it he was standing over me.  He was at 50% or so.  I did have a screenshot of this, but I had to reformat my harddrive and lost it.  I do have an up and coming beastlord though that I will suicide to try to see if I can slow Vox and Naggy with soon though.  Wondering if I need to have him debuffed first or what.<br />
<br />
Also, all phase 1 Time bosses are partially slowable minus the water one.  If I had his name handy I would provide it.  All gods in Time are Immune minus one and I'll let you figure that one out (unless someone else spills the beans)</div></div><hr />

It's listed on the list as Magic slow with mitigation of slightly.<br />
<br />
I slowed it with Cloud of Grummus (disease) and it did mitigate slightly<br />
<br />
<br />
just fyi<br />
<br />
Note to confirm this. Done it twice in the last month or so for backflagging and Turgurs would not land for all the tea in China (after landing Grumm on the second run, 2 of us kept trying Turg until it was dead just to see if we could - we couldn't). Grumm landed first time and, as Gilly said, mitigated slightly.<br />
<br />
Not sure if RD's MR is just so high that it's unlandable or just plain hard to stick, but it certainly isn't worth the effort trying imo when Grumm lands so easily.</div></div><hr />

Lord Mith Marr is magic slowable, but it's VERY hard to stick. He has incredible MR, and I bounced Turgur's eight times after separate casts of Tash and Malos. I stuck Turgur's at around 60% but it was mitigated to &quot;partially.&quot; One of the other shaman claims to have landed a disease slow on him right off the bat, but couldn't confirm it in the battle spam.<br />

MM and the cats are very easy to slow with Grummus after MD, I dont think we ever had a resist after malos, and MD. However, I have never landed a Turgur's on that fool, and it once took me 15 tries to land sinia on one of the cats ( I was deteremined to land it :p )</div></div><hr />

I *Know* your saying he is not, and I know the guide currently states HP can't be slowed.<br />

I'm telling ya I saw him slowed by a fellow shaman using MR based slowing Turgars.  The numbered discipals were immune the other named in HP chamber and the HP were all MR based slowed.<br />

This was done last week so unless you have tried sicne then and verify an IMMUNE message don't tell me NO.  Cause I know what I saw.<br />

on the slow stuff, you may want to add where you found most of the information you have used, and note what communitie's hard work has allowed the list to even exist in any sort of nearly compleat way/shape/form...<br />
<br />
might want to mention the differance between unslowable and immune.  i also saw some labled slowable, what type of slow would be usefull information update that with.<br />
<br />
may want to check to see if your list is actually updated.  for example i noticed magma is mislabled on your list.  there were several other errors as well.<br />
<br />
it is a shame our shaman list hasn't been updated in so long, but now you have to actually look at the posts to see if there is new information on old/new mobs.  it isn't the quickest way but it works.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u161"><b>Abzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p161">Landscape printing = PITA<br />
<br />
Too wide for portrait. Columns such as links to bestiary and strategy guide are useless in a printed chart. Tier is a nice touch but, not only is it completely blank, it's just not needed. &quot;Track From&quot; is also nice, but that's the tracker's job not mine.<br />
<br />
Now I'm just being picky: I prefer the look of the old chart. Whether it's the HTML guru in me or that small imaginary gay guy that sits on my shoulder trying to make me less of a beefcake he-man and more of the sort that can match drapes to a couch I'm not sure, but the new chart lacks visual appeal. When it's hour 15 of the current play session and you suddenly realise you're brainfarting on a mob's slowability and you dive for your printed chart, readability and ease of comprehension gets high marks. Colored cells on mitigation info was a nice touch too.<br />
<br />
Suggest you gank the layout of the old chart, add spawn timer info (keep overall width the same though), update it, call it a day. If you want to make the mob names into links to bestiary for those that won't print it out, more power to you.<br />
<br />
If you or Samana don't want to do it but someone else has the time and ability but not the hosting, I will provide it. This is a project that I would have done myself long ago for the Shaman community (and especially myself hehe), but I just don't have the time between work, play, helping run my guild, leading raids, running guild website, etc.</div></div><hr />

BTW buff raid with Tribunal and leave first buff slot open.</div></div><hr />

Went on to visit Krekk Brimblade in RCoD (another Warrior epic 1.5 mob).  He is partially magic slowable also.  Very resistant to spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Ajjantis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">Hello! Sorry for jumping in, i did not read through all posts but saw the link with the mob list. Just wanted to add that Talendor, Venril Sathir and Trakanon fullyslowable are ;-) (Forgive me if someone else allready posted this info, i did not read through the entire thread)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u168"><b>GheffGutterbrains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p168">I've got a goal here...<br />
<br />
a.  Update the data and keep it updated in a format that can readily be taken over by anyone with a common application, Excel in this case...<br />
<br />
b.  Create a script that will dump the data into format alot like Num's old slowing story <br />
<br />
Here's what I have so far, ie the data<br />
Consolidated Slowing Guide (http://gheffgutterbrains.home.mchsi.com/SlowGuide.xls) <br />
<br />
From this post forward, I'll take your update posts and update the raw file.. Sorta busy in RL at the moment, but I will get that script created.. motivated by I hate paper print-outs or using my 2nd machine to look up whether some mob is slowable...<br />
<br />
Feedback is always appreciated, sometimes ignored!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>GheffGutterbrains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">Here's what I have so far, ie the data<br />
Consolidated Slowing Guide (http://gheffgutterbrains.home.mchsi.com/SlowGuide.xls) <br />
<br />
<br />
Macro done.  Tested last night.  A few quicks with some colors in links but I'll work through them as I click through each file.<br />
<br />
It's an Excel file so you can either open in your browser or save locally to your drive.<br />
<br />
Open the spreadsheet, make *sure* the slow table is the active sheet (ie you are looking at it), and then run the macro (Tools, Macro, ExportToSlow).<br />
<br />
It will prompt you for a location to save the files - I choose the StoryLine directory to save me time from having to copy it manually.<br />
<br />
Code is unprotected for those that want to see what it does before they execute on their machine.  I'll clean it up some so that it looks a bit more graceful (from a coder's standpoint)<br />
<br />
One annoynig thing for now is that where there is lack of data for slow and amount, it writes out 0 - 0.  Debating on whether to clean that up as .. to be honest.. all mobs should have valid data.. but alas, I'm sure I'll get annoyed enough to put in checks...<br />
<br />
Assumptions Made:<br />
1.  The spreadsheet is the active sheet when macro is run<br />
2.  The data is *pre-sorted* by Era, Zone (I do mob as well.. not required)<br />
3.  The columns are in the Era, Zone, Mob, Slow, Amount columns *AND* that the first line is the header (macro starts on line 2)<br />
<br />
By all means test it, provide feedback, and report issues when you find em.  And again... keep the posts coming for updates in the raw data itself!!!</div></div><hr />

Walls of Slaughter, in the &quot;star chamber&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Partially&quot; slowable, Very MR. Malos+Malosinia REQUIRED for Turgurs to land, then it's a struggle. Malos+Nihil slightly more reliable, but duration of fight mandates the use of Turgurs, so once he's pre-slowed, get 'Sinia on him &amp; turgurs.<br />
<br />
Got a &quot;did not take hold&quot; message from Grummus, after PD was cast on him. Not terribly disease resistant.<br />
<br />
Rampages + quads 900, small aoe, 800dd, -300 attack, tiny mana drain. AOE is short duration, Purespirit cure, not worth the mana though. Resist check -300 cold.<br />
<br />
Excellent mini target for an Ele. raid force that always nets 2 69+ runes &amp; 1 piece of RSS-quality gear.</div></div><hr />

Smack me stupid... but what was different about Morden server?  I'll die if we have US vs non-US server, Blue vs Red, ect type thing for mob slowability flags.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Korabor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">was saying that all PoTime phase 4 and 5 mobs are different on Morden compared to Karana<br />
A PoTime difference<br />
Morden: Phase 4 mobs slowable (mitigates, not positive on how much)<br />
            Phase 5 mobs slowable (mitigates, not positive on how much)<br />
<br />
Karana: Phase 4 mobs Immune<br />
           Phase 5 mobs Immune<br />
<br />
Was just trying to say there may be other differences between servers. I'm on Karana, been told about the slowablility of Morden by 3 shamans now. I'll try to find some other differences and post em</div></div><hr />
