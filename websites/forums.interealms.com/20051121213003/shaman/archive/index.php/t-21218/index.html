<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolf Shadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dark Wolf ran wildly through the forest, her raven black coat shining when she leaped through patches of moonlight. She ran with a determined stride. She would not be caught by this so called shaman. He thought she should desire to be his spirit guide simply because he had called her weak minded brothers to him...well he was wrong.<br />
  She heard the panting of a human not far behind her. She lengthened her stride as she thought 'he must be on Horse.' She ran like her sisters, the winds, had taught her. She would not be caught by him. She was not a beast.........okay so she wasn't all beast.<br />
  Dark Wolf ran until she saw the light of her fathers country house. Finally! Dark Wolf ran faster than ever before. She lept over the corral fences, lept over the flock who of course being used to her ignored her presence,then with a burst of strength she lept through her open window and onto her bed.<br />
  As she landed her body morphed giving her a sweet pain that she craved and transforming her back into the mortal she pretended to be by day. She grabbed her nightdress and had it on with her body under the blankets when her father knocked gently on the old oak door of her bedroom.<br />
  &quot;Yes, Papa?&quot; she asked in a sleepy voice as if being roused from a pleasant dream.<br />
  &quot;Lord Hamal and his shaman are here to tend to your illness, my child.&quot;<br />
  Dark Wolf let a very unladylike curse slip from her lips, barely above a whisper. Luckily her father didn't here.<br />
  &quot;But Papa I'm in not but my night clothes.&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's quite alright, Vivian. You are after all ill.&quot; With that her father opened the door to allow in Lord Hamal and the shaman that Dark Wolf{Vivian} had spent the last eight hours running from.<br />
  Fortunate for her the shaman didn't recognize her.<br />
  &quot;Welcome.&quot; Vivian said in a voice hoarse from coughing. But despite the cheery smile on her wan face every man in the room could feel the venom she had put into the words, just as she had hoped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nicely done, Wolf :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolf Shadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">again i thank you. you seem to be the only one who replys to my writings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolf Shadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;Lord Hamal..How gracious of you to come and see to my illness.&quot; said Dark Wolf<br />
 &quot;No need to thank me, after all I can't have my cleric home with his daughter when I need him at the estate. The slaves are becoming unruly.&quot;<br />
 Dark Wolf ran through every curse she knew, which is quite a bit, in her mind at the mention of slaves. Smiling through her teeth she thought about how nice his head would look burning in a fire. Her mother had been a slave, a wolfan as they called the few humans who could transform they're shape into that of a wolf. No one but Dark Wolf's father had known this but still she had been revealed and burned at the stake for witchery.<br />
 Dark Wolf glanced at her father to see his reaction to the slaves. What she saw made her happy. Misery, after all, loves company. Dark Wolf's fathers' face was drawn tight and pinched with strain and pain.<br />
 A movement caught her eye and Dark Wolf turned and saw the shaman step towards her. When she looked into his eyes she saw a spark of recognition there. Her eyes returned with a spark of fear. He had recognized her.<br />
 &quot;Darcrac why don't we leave your daughter to the ministrations of my shaman? Come.&quot; Lord Hamal clasped Dark Wolf's father on the shoulder before escorting him from the room, softly closing the door behind him. <br />
 And with the closed door came silence. He had left her alone with the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolf Shadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As the footsteps faded down the hall the shaan stepped closer. He looked at her for a moment, his mind working for logical explanations. There were none.<br />
 &quot;You!&quot; he snarled at Dark Wolf, &quot;How did you get here? Where is the mans' daughter? What have you done with her?&quot;<br />
 Dark Wolf sighed here we go. More lies. &quot;Sir Shaman I haven't any idea as t what you are implying. I am Lord Darcrac Ferinys' only child. I've not left my bed for the last several weeks,&quot; she paused, &quot;I understand you are here to heal me. Would you do so? I haven't really the patience lately to deal with frauds and or insane men.&quot;<br />
  The shaman snarled at her before green fire began to glow around his hands. When there was a large amount aquired he threw the fire at Dark Wolf. She opened her mouth to scream but couldn't the pain roaring over her skin was to great. She felt tears as hot as lava cascading down her cheeks.<br />
 I cant die yet. I've yet to find it. It must be found, was Dark Wolfs' last thought before she fainted pain roaring in her ears.</div></div><hr />
