My guild is thinking about trying him, but if he hits for unslowable 1100s, that might be a little beyond us.</div></div><hr />

Think AoW on crack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The boss bee is also not really worth the time to clear to him and the raid force necessary to actually kill him.  He drops one item from an unexceptional list.  Oh, and we got an ethereal parchment too.   Wheee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think we killed him once then said screw it. Really a LOT of effort for the reward, even worse then the other PoS bosses which are horrible Time Vs Reward encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nice thing about him is the tradebale 36% haste belt he can drop... we've gotten 1 in 2 kills of him...<br />
<br />
is unslowable btw<br />
<br />
Also, have your pullers be careful, because I've had him fall under the world on me and stay bugged once during a pull... that sucked since it took an hour to spawn him..</div></div><hr />
