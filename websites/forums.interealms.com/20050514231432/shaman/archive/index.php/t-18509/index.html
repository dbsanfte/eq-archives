<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">That horrible HoH Trail Dragon is giving me and the guildies fits.<br />
<br />
Ok I read that Rydda`Dar is magic slowable.  I can't count on two hands the number of slows we bounced off him after Malos and Tash.  Heck had a Magician burn almost all his mana bouncing Malosinias, before he died anyways.<br />
<br />
Same seems to happen with disease slow...bounce bounce bounce.<br />
<br />
Are we doing something wrong?  Should we just give up on slow all together and spam heal the MT instead?<br />
<br />
We're just having trouble with this beast in general, and I was hoping some fellow shaman might be able to give us some tips on how they and their guild handles this monstrosity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have never done him and perhaps I am speaking out my butt, but were you in melee range? That is the only thing I can see making you bounce all your spells. Same thing happens with Ashenbone drakes in PoHate. No melee range [bounce bounce bounce] in melee range [teh win].</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Indeed I was in melee range.<br />
<br />
It was a painful death after the MT dropped.<br />
<br />
Bounced 5 slows in the meantime after Malos and Tash.  Don't know if that's just bad luck or just high MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hate Rydda.  Yes, Rydda is slowable.  It *is* possible to land Turgur's on him, but you won't do it before one side of the battle is dead.  Its also possible to land Grummus - but here's a secret.  Its not worth it.  Rydda mitigates slow pretty harshly.  Combined with the lower effectiveness (and longer cast time) of Grummus (plus the fact he resists THAT a lot, too), the net result is benefit from slow that comes too little and too late in the fight for it to be worth the time.  We often have a lot of shaman, and at least 1 or 2 will continue to try to land some kind of slow while the rest move on to effecting the combat.<br />
<br />
Drop extra heals on the tanks.  Patch heal other folks who take damage.  Run Quiescence on the key raid members if your clerics are not using HoTs for healing support.  Or ... even consider adding dps yourself.  If I recall, both cold and poison land well (yes, be cautious with dot aggro).<br />
<br />
This isn't an encounter that we shine in.  There are others that will make up for it elsewhere in PoP (Babnoxious + Blood of Nadox = win, just off the top of my head), but this is one that just has to be beaten.  Do what you can, and help wherever (heals vs. dps) your guild needs you most.  Good luck with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did you have a bard to HoS?<br />
<br />
I find that to be a HUGE help too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neldoreth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have made this trial often and I have never managed slow it with turgur’s, we use M .Decay and Bard disease debuff and then Cloud of Grummus, but his resistance is very high even after the debuff and due to the mitigation his dps after the disease slow does not change notably.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did her yesterday, well i have tried her about 4 times before and failed all , so this time i used the DR line, slowed i first try... i was a happy camper after that, but she only got slowed slightly.. so it dont help much....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dis lands much easier than magic as others have said.  IMHO, even saving one atk per round or two is worth it on this mob.  Keeeping the MT up is key, and every bit helps (casting a heal &lt; one hit and going oom quick isn't as good as a slow imho).  I have magic slowed, but not often.  One heavy dot shouldn't get your aggro (usually doesn't for me even after slowing/resisting slow).<br />
<br />
I am gonna point this out, just because it seems very few shaman actually use this, IM.  Malicious decay is not your best dis debuff.  Use your best after MD with low mana cost and quick recast to make landing slow (overall) faster and safer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think we've had any luck landing Turgur's on that dragon ever. Granted we did the trials pretty early after PoP came out, but 4-5 of us casting it 3 or 4 times each on a couple runs made us put it on the slow only with Grummus list. Never had more than a random resist on Grummus, but the others are right, it's barely worth doing.<br />

<br />
<br />
Uh..it's unresistable, 1 second cast time, and debuffs  10 more dr than the previous in the line. *** are you talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Insideous Malady I believe debuffs 8 more DR than Malicious Decay.  Not realy significant enough to bother, but its not like there is anything else to do while waiting for Grummus to refresh.  I use it every once in a while on Burrower, but never found anything else that resisted Grummus that much.  <br />
<br />
Rydda Dar is all about the bards (enchanter pets and AM3 rangers don't hurt either).  Feared/stunned clerics = wipe.  They help the tank resist the proc too iirc.  I have never stuck Turgurs on him and don't bother trying anymore.  Grummus should stick in the first couple of casts usually.  Stand as close to him as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've always landed Grummus from a far corner in room, usually sticks 90% of time.  And slowing him is DEFINATELY worth it.  Even though it is mitigated to 25-30% thats a huge drop in dps.  It'll make or break your fight especially if you do him with 35-40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its -52 for MD vs -60 for IM.<br />
Yes, technically IM is a better debuff AFTER MD is in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">AD is magic slowable but it is really hard and given the fight unless you get lucky one side or the other is gonna be nearly dead once you land it. Grummus does land but it is a lower percent and is pretty harshly mitigated. Last few times we've done him we haven't even bothered with that.<br />
<br />
The 2 keys seem to be MR and dps. Keep your clerics and melee's unfeared and your alot better off and the faster he's dead the better off things are for you. If you've got enough clerics to manage it a Supernal light chain seems to work well for us now but that is more mana intensive and works better with healing aa's and focuses. Also he seems to proc some sort of disease based bard song on the mt so chain casting cure disease on the mt helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bards and enchanters make or break this fight.<br />
<br />
As you've probably noticed, once RD spawns, all the npcs including pets despawn.  Have your enchanters set up in the next room and charm their pets. (To give you an idea of how much dps pets are, we once wiped to RD at about 80% and we eeked out a victory because we had 6 chanter pets.)<br />
<br />
As soon as RD spawns, have your rampage tank engage, and then have your main tank pop his AE taunt.  This should set rampage quickly.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have as many bards as possible playing MR resist.  If you only have a few bards, here is your grouping priority 1) MT &amp; clerics 2) enchanters and wizards 3) rogues and other dps.<br />
<br />
If you have multiple shamans, arrange before the fight to cast malos and malicious decay right off the bat.  Immediately after, all spam grummus till it sticks.  One designated shaman should be chain casting abolish disease on the MT to deal with RD's proc.<br />
<br />
RD is still a pain in the ass even after you've killed mobs like Bertox a couple times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As i said after MD.  And as another said, it's while you're waiting for slow to refresh.  Or don't do it at all, /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rashallam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Make sure you keep the MT and RT cured.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Make sure you keep the MT and RT cured.<br />
Hmm, interesting, cured of what exactly? Posion? Disease? Curse?<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">RD is pretty easy once you work out the MT is getting owned by the dot, that pets don't aggro RD when he spawns and that disease slow is much easier to land :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>korshatiz123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Find out which chanters you have with total domination aa have them make pets of the wrulons things, Have MT and only the mt fight the trigger have everyone else back off at 10-15% to ensure he gets aggro from rd upon spawning then send the CoD pets in as rampage tanks pets are best for this since they are fear immune. Your raid needs relative high magic resists or they wont be helping any due to fear.</div></div><hr />
