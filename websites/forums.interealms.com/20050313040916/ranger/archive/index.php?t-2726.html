I know there are benefits as far as meditation while standing still, but is it worth it? Also, will i run as fast as my horse? Or as fast as sow? (assuming horse is slower then sow)</div></div><hr />

The 8k one is just a hair faster than most mobs, and the accelaration on it makes you feel like you're in an ice rink. It gets *really* annoying really quick.</div></div><hr />

I dont think any horse is worth is price unless its the most most expensive kind.    Why use a 30k horse(roughly the speed of SoW) when.....you can cast sow?<br />
<br />
If you can save up 60k, I'm sure you can muster another 40k sometime.    Or hell you can just go kill Seru or something and get an uber horse, hehehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drewno</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main query was to whether or not the meditation bonus is worth it on a horse. I spend a lot of time duoing with a shammy friend of mine who never has any downtime. So the speed of our group depends partly on how fast i can meditate to regain mana. And so....Can you meditate only while sitting still on a horse? Or can you do it while running around on it, and while fighting?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meding on a horse while fighting has already been fixed to not work if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about bow kiting though? =)<br />
<br />
I bet a horse works while bow kiting. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it was fixed so that if you are in combat, you are not medding on horseback. If you are moving, you are not medding. I think unless it is just for show (look, I have a horse !) than anything less than the best is a waste of cash. It works great for casters as they are not actually sitting on the ground, so don't draw extra agro, can look at thier spell book and still cast spells (so I have heard), and have something to talk about in group, guild or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what i've heard, kiting on horses is a pain in the butt because of the acceleration and deceleration thing.<br />
<br />
It's a big problem for casters because it makes it hard to get stopped for casting, and cuts into your time between casting intervals.<br />
<br />
And it would seem to be just as much of a probem for bow-kiters.  It seems that most of the time you are moving a few feet and then shooting another arrow.  Now you may not be coming to complete stops, but because you are not at full run all the time, you are basically in the acceletation/deceletarion speed most of the time.  I'd think it would be like trying to kite while running around kneedeep in a swamp.  Which means you are going to get caught by the mob a lot.</div></div><hr />
