<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Punjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm lvling up shaman (lvl55 now) with my monk lvl 60 in HS. I tank mobs with mnk solo, then FD and let my pet finish off the mob. Shaman should get all exp. Question is : does shaman gets all exp or pet will steal some of exp too ? I've heard or read somewhere that when only pet tanks, pet owner wont get full exp from mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Charmed (or maybe just 60+ charm) pets will take exp according to how much damage they do to a mob (not sure the %'s).  Regular pets used to take half exp if they outdamaged the rest of the group (in this case, the shaman), but now I believe they only take 1% of total exp if the pet outdamages the owner.  If the pet does 100% of the damage, I believe he takes a bit more.  You might want to sic the pet then nuke once, just to be sure you're getting exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, unless they changed our pet... as long as you do 1 point of damage to the mob, you get full exp (not matter how much damage it does vs. how much you do).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, just one point as far as summoned pets go.  I've heard that you need to work a bit harder with the charmed pets, specifically dire charmed.</div></div><hr />
