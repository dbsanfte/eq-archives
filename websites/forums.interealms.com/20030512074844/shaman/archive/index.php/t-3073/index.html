thanks in advanced</div></div><hr />

Poster:  You can't skip this part because Kirn drops a ring that you must hand in to Neh in City of Mist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>buga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It depends on which part of epic stage you are in. The last part I finished was the 6 pages in CoM. Afterwards, I did woe/envy/marrs over and over again till I got max faction. In between this time, I did the captain trueshoot a few times. It takes approximately 4 - 5 sets of woe/envy/marrs to bump up 1 faction. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raisan Ironhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have also recently been told that if you do the Rathe Mountain part of the Epic over and over and max out your Truespirit Faction that you can skip over the Hole and the CoM portions of the Epic leaving you only with the Tear and final battle to do...was told that this is why so many shamans have their Epics?  Just wondering if anyone else knows about this?  Is it indeed true?How many times you have to do the Rathe Mountain part was not stated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Breathable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can anyone explain to me how i get the tear in fear, the epic guide doesnt explain what drops it on when its up and stuff, thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">was told that this is why so many shamans have their Epics?<br />
<br />
No, the reason so many shamans have their epic is because it's one of the easiest epic quests to complete. Many of us did it without skipping parts.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain to me how i get the tear in fear,<br />
<br />
2 of the 3 named golems (Fright, Dread, and Terror) in Plane of Fear will spawn an iksar broodling when killed. I always forget which one does not spawn the child. Kill the golems, then kill the iksar broodling and loot it's tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raisan Ironhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Rathelon,  I agree it seems like it's one of the easiest epics.  I just want to through out what I had heard and find out if it was true or not.  Seems to me it would be just as easy to just go ahead and do every step of the Epic than to have to take the time to raise faction just to cheat the system.  I for one, would not to risk having to start all over or in some way ruin my ability to do the epic all together by skipping some steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Breathable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">would have you start over? doesnt the whole epic depend on your faction when you turn in tear? so all you would have to do it get a little more faction and another tear and turn it in? Im warmly now after finishing the com book part, and ive started doing the shield of falsehood part over, and soon to be over again so i can max my faction and skip a few parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sheymalra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fright and Terror spawn the Iksar Child Broodling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just did the turn in that gives the shield of falsehood, and just as the text was displayed that one would respond, &quot;What shield of falsehood?&quot; to, I went LD. I came right back online, but my mates tell that the spirit had despawned. Do I have to go back and get the three items again, or can I just say the phrase to the spirit now that I have sufficient faction?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">just ask the wandering spirit for the shield again, this can even be done just after the test of patience, it just doesnt give you the text until after you do thee fools harvest. ask for as many shields as ya like! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did it start to finnish and step by step with NP's what so evere. Personly I do not fell sorry for people that skip parts and then dont get thire scale.</div></div><hr />

The problem with that is that getting to Kirn in the Hole can be a real pain in the tuchas.  Not only do you have to go through some unpleasant stuff in the underground city of The Hole, but there's also a tower full of REALLY unhappy undead that you have to go through as well.  It's obviously not insurrmountable, but most people that want to go to the Hole aren't interested in doing the tower part.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually, I did Kirn with 1 - 2 groups. A Pally, A Munk, A Cleric, Me, A Chanter, and 2 druids. Once you make it to the tower, just IVU up to where Kirn is and kill what's in his room. Bit risky, but can be done :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ghenn on Bertoxulous should get props for the most inventive Kirn strat. It involved a level 34 cleric, a 55+ Mage, and one group of stalwart adventurers. It was alot of fun too =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yup - drop a level 34 Brell cleric into the Hole, using divine aura. They use ITU and run to the safe ledge. Then kill your mage, and use a brell rogue to drag them to the safe ledge, and the cleric rezzes them. Then the mage uses Call of the Hero to summon your party to the safe ledge.<br />
<br />
I used a similar strategy to kill Kirn myszelf, only we got our mage to the safe ledge by tagging along with another raid the day before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Getting to Kirn isn't hard, just take on balanced group with a cleric who has a rez you are willing to accept, and suicide in via the drop down, cleric DA's.<br />
<br />
Got Kirn that way myself, and it was surprisingly easy.  I mean too easy.  I think almost all the epic mobs in the hole can be done this way.  It makes getting there easy and quick, no more going through the city unless you WANT to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, suiciding in deposits you at Master Yael's feet. The cleric, unless a brell worshipper, would at that point get stepped on, no? I don't quite see how that works, unless your cleric is Brell and drags the corpses to the safe ledge.</div></div><hr />
