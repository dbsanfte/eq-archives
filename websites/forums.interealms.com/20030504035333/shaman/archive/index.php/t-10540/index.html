<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hobo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone explain to me what the difference is between all your Malo spells?  And also what is the difference between all your Slow type spells?<br />
<br />
I know the basics, like the malo line reducing resists and the turgar line slowing mobs.  But what I don't get is this...<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is the best (75%) slow at level 51?  What good are the slow spells that you guys get at later levels?  Are they really worth even trying to get?  When I am duoing my monk with a shaman I always prefer the 75% slow over anything else, wouldn't other melee's also prefer the better slow?  I *know* I must be missing something here but so far I can't figure it out.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the Malo line.  Why would someone want the level 65 Malos that decreases resists by 55, when the level 63 Malosinia decreases resists by 70?  Same goes for Malo vs Malosini.  <br />
<br />
Are there other shaman spells like these two lines that seem to get worse as the level gets higher?<br />
<br />
Sorry for my ignorance but after an odd incidence a cuople weeks ago, you guys got me all interested in the shammy class.  So much so that I started my own twink and want to get him up higher enough to help my monk.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well first off Turgurs improves with level, its 65% at lvl 51 and 75% from 60+.  The other slows we get along the way are situational including a disease based slow (can land on mr creatures) and an AE slow (can hit 4 targets).  Both are lesser slows than turgurs but can be nie in certain situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Malo and malos are unresistable.  You land these then try and land one of the bigger (malosini) resistable slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best slow is at 51, but its effectiveness continues to increase up to level 60.  At level 60 its a 75% slow - at level 51 its only 66%. Note that a level 60 enchanter slows better (70%) than a level 51 shaman - although after tashing they may regret it!  At 56, no other class is better at slowing, period.<br />
<br />
You may be getting confused by Tigir's, Plague of Insects, and Cloud of Grummus. Tigir's is an AE slow (50%, max 4 mobs) and PoI and CoG are disease based slows for 25% and 40% respectively. Tigir's is very situational and rarely used in xp groups. I like it in chardok raids. <br />
<br />
The disease based slows are generally of use for a limited number of boss mobs with very high mr but much lower disease resistance. With malo and insidious decay (unresistable pr/dr debuff) you'll find the disease slow lands where the normal one won't.<br />
<br />
http://www.dith.demon.co.uk/slows/ shows you which mobs to use the disease slows on - they are very few and far between.<br />
<br />
As for the malo line, Malo and Malos are unresistable. Malosini and Malosinia are resistable. On highly mr mobs you might start with malo/malos and then try to add malosini/malosinia to get that little bit more of a debuff. Other cases you may just use malo, or just use malosini - depends how mr the mobs are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hobo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Excellent information!  Thank you very much.  I'm slowly understanding more and more.  I either have to get my shammy (shammie?) leveled up fast or find a frined to duo with daily.</div></div><hr />
