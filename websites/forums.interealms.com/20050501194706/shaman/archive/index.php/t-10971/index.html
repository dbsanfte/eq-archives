Jealous? Hardly. I accepted mediocrity in this game a LOONG time ago because I don't have the time to commit to it. I'm ok with that. Impressed would be more accurate. I don't have the patience it takes to achieve those stats.<br />

Stick around a bit punk. You'll see I have no problem stating my opinion.<br />

I know what my intentions were and they were in jest from the outset. You have some pretty low hangin brass to have the audacity to tell me what I meant. Why don't you just piss off now junior.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Chuk appreciates your attempt at defending him, but he doesn't need it. Chuks a well respected member of this community and has been around long enough to know when he's really being razzed vs when someone is just poking fun.<br />

He's probably using a book or some other non-swingable weapon in primary.  When you do that I believe it uses your HtH skill, which even if maxxed is only at 75.  That or he horribly neglected his melee skills =P</div></div><hr />

Is that a fake magelo you just created or is it a real person? Vindi BP+2 fennin loots on a magelo thats up in the 560,000s  makes me curious . <br />
<br />
Tbh the only BP in the game  that I can see myself putting in for now to replace my trusty Vindi = Rosraks, we are at the stage where we are getting cursed bps and it annoys me to see shaman put in for the chain void bp over rangers/rogues, its debatable if its better than a vindi (Imho its inferior).  The mail of Judgement is nice, but again its just not enough of an upgrade over the vindi for me to justify myself putting in for it when it would be far better on a cleric/druid.  The only real upgrade I know of is the elemental planes one.<br />

Interesting to see how the evolution of the uber occured tho.  Used to be max wis was most important, but that was a long time ago.  Then it was max AC!  Then max hps/AC!  Now it's Max hps, who cares bout ac, maxed FT as an afterthought, and max mana! <br />

<br />
There are many ways to clock alot of hours on EQ and using a bazaar mule is one of the better ones. You do realize that you can actually do other things while having a merchant set up in the bazaar dont you?<br />
<br />
I think the important thing here is whether you plan the rest of your life (sounds like this wont amount to much for some of you here) around EQ or it is the other way around.<br />

http://www.saraquael.com/Images/ElderGlorianaColorVersion2.jpg <br />
<br />
<br />
After attaining Elder title, camping VT shards, getting various flags, working on level 65, I kinda felt &quot;old&quot; in EQ, so I changed my braids to silver.  After the change, I sent Saraquael an email and asked him for another pic to reflect how my character has evolved in the game.<br />
<br />
He asked me what gear I was wearing and I realized that although it's still mostly wolfcaller's, that could change at any time, so I suggested an outfit that wasn't gear dependent.  The idea of being barefoot on snow was my idea as well, since for some reason my unbuffed CR is always much much higher than my other resists.  I wanted a cloak because he had drawn such a lovely cloak for Hermana.  <br />
<br />
I also wanted the leather band since my original avatar was the brunette with the leather band, I asked for more feathers because they seemed nice and shamanly.<br />
<br />
This is just a draft of Sara's, but I already love it!!!  <br />

As far as the epic looking like the wizard epic, eh, I kinda like Sara's interpretation.  His use of lighting is incredible, the light off the epic is all reflected on the figure and in the snow, I think it looks great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the amount of hours people like chuck play, the image in my mind is quite appaling, over-weight and bald, stained shirt full of yesterdays pizza, sitting in nothing but dirty boxers, foul oder from missing last months shower, and trying how to maximize game performance using one hand while scratching oneself with the other.</div></div><hr />

Hah! Doctors and lawyers are now equated to EQ addicts. Im sure they would all be happy to hear that comparison. Theres a big differenced between working your ass off on your feet for 16 hours a day as an intern or as a lawyer working 16 hour days non stop doing research, travelign to interviews, court papers, and court appearances:  then between sitting on a chair, staring at a screen, stuffing take out and potato chips down your throat, for 15,000 hours of your life playing eq. At least Doctors and Lawyers have acutally accomplished things of merit, instead of braging about how many HP's and ueber leet items they have in a fictional online game.<br />
<br />
Looking back on how much I played when EQ started, I was sickened with the huge waste of time. Seeing how much many of you play in these forums and how obessive compulsive you are about a game, is utterly disgusting. Sure eq could be a great diversion, but when your spending 40-60 hours plus a week on your diversion, then somethings a bit out of whack.</div></div><hr />

I can see why the left is smaller, because it's turn away, though it should be a tad bigger.<br />
<br />
Your right breast should have an exposed nipple where the cloak is currently, unless you have naturally point out boobs ;P<br />

If it makes you feel better to tell me to shut up, go for it, raise your fascist flags and silence all those who have opinions that might shatter your self-created utopian world that you have fostered in order to make yourselves feel better about your mundane lives. <br />
<br />
I have 7k hp's, 1500 ac, uber leet gear and 100's of virtual friends, so my life must not be meaningless, look everybody, I am good at something, I have a place in our society, im not a shut-in or social outcast, its very healthy to waste 50% of my life playing a game. If my opinion distrurbs you so much, perhaps you should take a deep look inside your self and figure out why it does. Truth and reality are quite the bitter pill to swallow. <br />

Most of us here are adults and thus are able to come to that decision ourselves, without help from a nameless little person like you.<br />

Yes, we have the ability to completely ignore you, and I am pretty sure most people reading this are. But I will feed the dorky little troll simply because I am on my coffee break. <br />
<br />
I think you should take up religion, if you haven't already, and stand on the corner of your main street in whatever crappy little town you live in, and scream out &quot;Non-believers will go to hell! Jesus loves you, he just hates what you're doing!&quot;. I am sure you will get more attention, and you will still be forcing your beliefs on other people.<br />

Go away.<br />

I can't decide whether or not to go with the bare chest under cloak look, it sounded like a good idea in theory, now it seems a bit sleazy.
