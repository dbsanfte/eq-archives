<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>delboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
Im creating a shaman to take a break from my mage and was wondering what the opinions of the more seasoned shamans were with respect to the fungi tunic. <br />
<br />
1. Is it worth the (now very large pp) investment? <br />
2. Will it have a significant impact in decreasing my downtime once I can cannibalize? <br />
3. Would it be better to buy an iksar bp for far less money and use the money saved to buy other equipment?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for replies to the first of what will prolly be many questions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yatta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My opinion would be that it depends on whether or not you plan to invest time into your shaman. If it's just a twink you might not want to spend such a large sum on it, however the fungi WILL make leveling your shaman a breeze. If you really want to balance out your shamans equipment nicely, you could get a full suit of good ac\hp gear for the amount of money it takes to buy a fungi.<br />
<br />
I guess to answer your questions:<br />
1. For a shaman, Yes.<br />
2. Even to the 50s, yes.<br />
3. Depends on whether or not you'll be playing your shaman long term (versus a flavor of the week).<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
