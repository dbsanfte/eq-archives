<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was wondering if anyone is familar w/ changing servers, my main intrest is keeping my gear, but i don't know how long i would i have to stay on legends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Theres no guarantee the legends transfer trick will work. I've tried it and got sent back to my home server before, so your milage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't expect the Legends transfer to work at all.<br />
<br />
Except for 2 or 3 items nearly all of your gear is droppable.  If you had the cash to blow you could just as easily put all those items on a mule, get him sent to legends.  Create a new character on Legends, put the gear on him.  Cancel Legends and have him transferred to the server you want (characters created on Legends can be move to any server with gear intact).  Then transfer your shaman over to the server you want, and give him back his gear.  You'll lose the no drop stuff but will have the rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly though you would be better off liquidating the gear you have on Ayonae Ro and seeing if you can trade plat for plat (or even gear for gear) with someone on the server you want to go to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">legends transfer trick cost $$$; here is another way to cross server transfer:<br />
<br />
go find some online auction site, ask them if they do cross server PP transfer services, some of them do that and ususlly charge some % fee (I think depend on server or who). that mean if you want transfer 100k from server A to B, you pay 100k to them at server A, and they give you 75k or so at server B; depend on % of fee<br />
<br />
I know this because a friend in guild told me he transfer pp by that way(only pp, they don't accept item); wish I didn't gave away all my item/pp before transfer :(</div></div><hr />

Be very careful where you auction to do this.  It's against the EULA and if someone doesn't like you or is just feeling pissy that day, they could /report your &quot;/auc WTT plat here for plat on Prexus&quot; and petition it and you could get warned.<br />
<br />
Keep it out of game if you can, i.e. offer the trade on a message board or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I recently tried the Legends trick, but they are paying more attention to what they are doing now (especially if you are trying to transfer to a special rule server like FV). A friend of mine knows a Legends GM and they are looking out for any of the tricks that you can do...too bad I didn't find out before spending the money on Legends.<br />
The GM that denied my transfer and sent my character back to Rodcet threatened to ban my account for trying to &quot;defraud a GM&quot;.</div></div><hr />

 :rolleyes: Show me where in the EULA it says that, you can't because it doesn't exist.  All you are doing is giving plat from one character on a server to another character on that server, and then doing the same thing on a different server.  The only way it would be against the EULA is if RL cash was involved.</div></div><hr />
