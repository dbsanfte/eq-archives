<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was helping a Guild mate tonight, with a spot of assisted levelling :) Not PLing, as he's a 52 SK with great gear and was just duoing with me in Droga.<br />
<br />
Normally I get 2% AA per kill and some loot, and i like the easy pace of it.<br />
<br />
The xp didn't really rush in though, and when he asked in /gu where is best to PL a 52 SK with a 65 shaman, the answer was &quot;NOT DROGA&quot; - is this right?<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere better? Chardok is out as my faction is nearly up to ally... Planes maybe? But that's boring!<br />
<br />
Any suggestions, and why not Droga??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">try the lower tier planes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PoN is decent with my bst.  Try a few different strategies:<br />
<br />
1) Dot mobs down to 5% and zone out, let SK finish.<br />
2) Just slow mobs and heal SK, nuke after 50%.<br />
3) Group the two characters and annhilate the entire west half off the zone.<br />
<br />
All these work for me.  Haven't done enough testing to really know which is best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This would be better off in the 'where to hunt' section; there are lots of ideas there.  I would suggest veksar (maybe a bit slow), PoM (if the SK is really meaty) or even PoH.  If the SK is fairly gimpy, just go somewhere that is good for the 65 solo shaman and use him as a dot, like the dog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Plane of Hate is pretty nice xp, but CR is not fun if you mess up.  Droga mobs just have too many hps to be terribly good xp in my experience. If you can get him flagged for Valor, he can probably tank slowed stuff there.  If not, I would go to Innovation or Justice.  You can butcher stuff pretty quick there.  Nightmares has a few too many mobs with weird resists for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I lvled a SK twink of mine from 57 to 60 in Droga, with 2 boxed 65 sham.  Seemed to go very fast.  Nurga and Droga both have decent Zems and the cash is hard to beat for those lvls.  Faction from lvling there is very nice for Chardok quests aswell.  All in all, I say go where its fun.  I get bored to tears of PoP grinding, and go slumming all over for kicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">for pure exp speed droga/nurga are certainly not the best, but for exp+loot+faction I really really cant think of a better place, what melee doesnt want chardok faction for the clicky ring and other quest loots?<br />
screw that I woulndt leave droga/nurga for better exp just to come back later and farm faction when its worth less exp, thats silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks all - as ever, intelligent and reasoned responses. All in all, I think it's a balance of faction/loot/fun vs pure xp speed.</div></div><hr />
