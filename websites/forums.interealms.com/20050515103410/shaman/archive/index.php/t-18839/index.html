<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search on Corinav and the Council on this site and didnt find much that was relevent to the encounters.  Anyone know of any good write ups on these two encounters?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We typically don't do detailed spoilers on this board, try http://www.thesafehouse.org/ .<br />
<br />
My advice:  recruit wizards, enchs, and clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zamiel Breezeplease</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you asking on what a shaman is supposed to do or what everyone is supposed to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probably won't find many write ups on the two most difficult mobs needed to get into Time.  Those guilds that have done them usually aren't going to freely give the strats they spent a lot of time developing.<br />
<br />
Best thing is just go try them.  Each guild does them a little differently to suit their own individual guild make up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">coirnav: you have 15 minutes, kill everything before time runs out<br />
<br />
rathe:  12 of them, 6 mez, 6 dont.  You have something like 6 or 7 minutes to kill the remaining 11 after the 1st dies. <br />
<br />
<br />
With that general info you should be able to quickly figure out the strats that everyone is using.  There's pretty much only way one to handle the rathe, and coirnav is pretty much just DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My best advice for you is suffer through the encounters time and time again until you figure it out.<br />
That is one of the joys in eq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Make sure you buy catheters for your enchanters and bards before you attempt the Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If SOE ever fixes some of the bugs and puts true instancing into Time, then you might see spoilers flow forth like little mineral springs.  The chances of that happening are just so slim. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If SOE ever fixes some of the bugs and puts true instancing into Time, then you might see spoilers flow forth like little mineral springs. The chances of that happening are just so slim. =/ <br />
Im curious of the bugs now :) What bugs are you thinking of? And how is the instance wrong now? Do you mean 2 guilds cant be in at the same time or something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The main &quot;bug&quot; is basically someone else running off with your instance and viola! no mobs p2 onward.  Several ways of doing this have been posted and the only reason it is a problem is because there is no true instancing ala LDoN.  You put 3 guilds into a rotation and it is annoying, but throw a few more guilds into Time and it really becomes unworkable...especially if those guilds share timezones.  Sure you can cockblock repeatedly to slow other guilds entry to Time, but eventually those guilds will gain access and you will be left scrapping for instaces and sabotaging eachother.<br />
<br />
Of course, the next expansion will draw attention away from any Time-related issues and they will go unchanged.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Okay, granted, probably not many guilds would but I was hoping that some might have posted a general guide.  But in either event, any words of wisdom for a shaman about to enter into each of these encounters?  Any advice on resists, best dots, etc. ?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already posted enough information for most people to figure out a general guide.  I really hope you aren't in charge of strats for your guild.<br />
<br />
Maybe post on your guild forums and see what you and your people can come up with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The strat is out there somewhere.  Our local resident guild with no life got to this encounter and in the first hour of their first try ever, they managed to get to the 11th councilman.  No way without someone providing them a strat.<br />
<br />
My advice to you.. is to not slow too fast, and nuke too hard, and keep curse cure spells up on both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Coirnav encounter:<br />
Location: Plane of Water, aka Reef of Coirnav.<br />
Event description:<br />
Coirnav is sitting on his throne in the Worldstone Keep. He then summons wave after wave of mobs with each having a &quot;leader&quot; or mini boss.<br />
First wave: Corenzo (sp?) the Annihilator and his cronies. They are fire immune.<br />
Second wave: Ahmed the Cursed and his cronies. Adds are cold immune, Ahmed and other generals are magic and poison immune.<br />
Third wave: Bartuc the something and his cronies. All lightning immune.<br />
Fourth wave: Some named Demon and his cronies, poison and fire immune.<br />
Fifth wave: Lister the Tormentor and his cronies. They all have stun and pushback attack, immune to fire.<br />
Last wave: Coirnav himself. He spawns adds and can clone himself. Coirnav is fairly easy, has a nasty cold AE that pushes back.<br />
<br />
Rathe Encounter<br />
Location: Plane of Earth B aka Ragrax Stronghold of the Twelwe.<br />
Event description: You need to push five seals to spawn boss (from east to west). <br />
First seal: no effect.<br />
Second seal: Spawns Infector of Souls and his cronies. Kill them all. Infector os mostly poison immune and can be fire and/or lightning immune, on rare occasions is phisically immune. Cronies are poison immune.<br />
Third seal: Spawns Lord DeSeis and his cronies. His cronies can curse so melee be ware. DeSeis is immune to two random spell types.<br />
Fourth seal: Spawns some named Gloom with cronies, they are immune to lightning and drain mana.<br />
Fifth seal: spawns The Rathe himself.<br />
<br />
Rathe is pretty badass, lightning based targeted AE attack, root prison and cold AE from melee. His melee is very tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">OMG! Zorlac why do you have to go and give l33t strats like that?? OMG!!!11 one one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heh my guild just downed Coirnav last Sunday and Rathe Monday(go go back to back) now to just down Rathe again so we can hit time, can't wait &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
PS - kill shot on first Rathe so powa~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Excellent info, Zorlac. Lister was a real pain for my fire sorcy. :)</div></div><hr />
