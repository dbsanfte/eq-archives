<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KaninZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in Everfrost hunting those lucrative mammoths last night, doing my usual, snare, swarm, fear, hackhackhack, arrows to finish off. I was hanging out on one of the hills near the mammy-ramp (it was crowded, as usual on the weekend) and had a mammoth spawn right behind me. As the crowd converged I snared the beast and started towards it, checking it's hp bar to make sure noone had landed anything before I did.<br />
   When I got to it and started to hack &amp; slash...this Vah Shir BL (who was still on its way to the beast) yelled 'MINE&quot;. OK....whatever...I backed up....and saw there were 4 people about to pounce on this thing. I moved back in, cranked up the WoFS/Fiercewind combo and fingered the &quot;Ignite&quot; a few times. Dropped like a stone, he did. The BL says &quot;You just ks'd me a$$&quot; After checking who and seeing that this was a 12th lvl person I replied nicely &quot;No, a$$...you attempted to ks ME...and lost.&quot; then moved on and began tracking again.<br />
   Here's the capper...later on I see the BL ding to level 13 and 3 people say &quot;WTG MOM!!&quot;  This explains SO MUCH! I'm still gigglin' :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I find people do this a lot. I go running into Najena the other day, and there were ten people there. I was shocked, seeing as there is, usually, a max of 3, and two of them are Mages, or a Necro looking for Najena's robe for their epic. Well, the Mages are there, like four of them, of course, and the others are a low level group. Well, ok, fine. I check track when I near the turn off for Najena's room to see if she's up or if I need the keys. <br />
<br />
She was up, so, I take off that way, as the other Mages are busy down by Rathyl's room and down where Trazdon spawns. I get there, have Najena more than half way down (I still get a very little bit of XP from her),and the other two Mages don't aggro because they are green. This other Mage comes running up when I have Najena down to one bubble and goes, &quot;I was coming after her!&quot; Then shouts to the zone how I KSed Najena.<br />
<br />
Luckily, one of the Mages was down near him at the time and sends a shout back about how if I had Najena, he shouldn't gripe because he left his camp. So, I got the room, but Najena dropped the tome on that kill, so I left anyhow. <br />
<br />
The moral of this story is, &quot;No matter how easy something appears to be, there is always that fool who wants to take the words &quot;idiot proof&quot; as his/her life long goal to disprove.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Myrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A couple of weeks ago I was on with my Paladin in Kurns Tower in a pickup group. We had an Iksar Shaman in the group who was CONTSTANTLY OOM, never healed, and generally just sat around soaking XP and getting loot. After about 45 minutes, I ws about to kick him out of the group altogether after one Monk and I died in yet another combat where he did nothing, and he starts asking &quot;how old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I answered &quot;Over 21.&quot;<br />
<br />
He says &quot;Oh, you're at least 11 years older than me, I'm 10.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gaped at the screen for a while and said. &quot;You mean like 10th level, right, not 10 years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm 10 years old. Are you really 21?&quot;<br />
<br />
OK, that explains a lot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>clailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I started playing EQ when I was just about to turn 13 and I admit I did some stupid things while LEARNING to play, but I dont think I ever KSed anyone or anything like that...I actually let people run over me cause I really wanted to be accepted some where at the time. (I was being homeschooled- constantly sick.)<br />
<br />
Anyway... I havent been having issues with KSing lately... I have been having issues with FFA groups. There is a certain warrior in KC who starts groups alot and ends up saying FFA but he grabs every single corpse the 2nd it hits the ground. <br />
I am an enchanter (yes I know this is a ranger board and I do have a ranger but it is not my main- This board rules =+)) I have to move around the targets ALOT to mezz quickly as possible- I can make groups work in hand room with out a cleric. I feel sorry for the people sitting who cant even get a chance at loot but i will grab as much as I can and split it. I swear- most people say commie sucks, but if you have some one decent doing it you will make money off of it. I am in KC so much people dont think I sleep anymore =+P They know I am a good commie girl and I am the NUTTY chanter (I scare people with my pulling)<br />
<br />
BTW- I have had tons of people ask how old I was and i will reply 15 and they will say &quot;wow your mature for your age&quot; My reply &quot;really? I act like such a nut I thought you would think i was a 9 year old&quot;<br />
<br />
it just shows how mature so many players are.<br />

  Heh....you reminded me of a guy I kept running into back when I was hunting in Blackburrow. I grouped with him a couple of times and even though it was worked out that we'd alternate corpses, he had a happy trigger finger when the mob dropped. He looted some of them clean before they could hit the ground lol. <br />
  He had a really surprised look on his face when I pulled those 3 elites (and a Commander....just for good measure) disbanded the group and said &quot;Well, time for bed...'nite.&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />
