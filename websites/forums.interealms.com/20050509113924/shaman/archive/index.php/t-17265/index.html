<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">or close to a month anyways.<br />
<br />
When it first came out I was a mad man. I ranked in the top 20%<br />
Then one day.. I took a break from doing adventures.. and have only done a few since..<br />
<br />
Did I burn myself out... or is it just not that much fun anymore? <br />
<br />
Racing thru them was something new and different, but it failed to keep me entertained for long like previous expansions.<br />
Ive played a few since the last patch and fail to see an improvement in anything.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm just curious if people are still finding it fun?<br />
<br />
On a related note... I have 3 accounts... I bought it for 2 accounts... how the heck do I stop it from having me to click &quot;Later&quot; on the other account... I have no intention of buying it for that account</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of my guild seems to love it. Personally I find them boring. I let them know that I'll do hard adventures and thats about it. I have 10 completed adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are fun as long as you don't do that all day long... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found them fun at first.... really fun..<br />
<br />
Then after the umpteenth time doing X, Y or Z mission at the different camps.. you have seen it all.. already.. and the high lvl dungeons are the same as the low level dungeons..<br />
<br />
I think it would be great if they were all just static dungeons heh.. adding 16 something dungeons with neat drops and whatnot in the tradition old eq style(not the post kunark suck dungeon style). <br />
<br />
I guess I am one of the old guard that looks at the days of Lguk having 100 people in it fondly. It was so much more social, and felt like more of a community. Then the community moved to OS, then velious came out and ****ed the casual dungeoneer in the ass.<br />
<br />
And while someone who plays casually can enjoy ldon, I find the experience anything but casual and relaxing. Oh great, a time ticker is running and half the group is ****ting themselves over any little faux pas even though you have an hour left on the timer. Guess its time to work on my Sk for a while till my friends get bored with ldon =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tend to agree that the &quot;luster of LDON&quot; has worn off a bit, but for me its the players who have changed.  When it first came out peeps would get in groups and just charge in and it was fun.  I have noticed in the past few weeks, though, that peeps are going back to their old bad habits of being ultra conservative, willing to wait around for literally hours to find &quot;their&quot; perfect group composition and for that slaughter mission.  It seems that a few bad missions makes everyone into a chicken.  Well, that's my experience at least.  I did 2 hard ones a week ago and enjoyed them as they are a nice challange but it's still almost impossible to convince folks to do them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did not do a single dungeon the first few days I had it. Since then I have done about 20 dungeons total. I use it as a change of pace and that is working very well. I like it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How to disable the pre-order screen:<br />
<br />
Open your eqclient.ini file with a text editor (notepad works well)<br />
<br />
Change the line that says LDoNPreorderLastView=1058676742<br />
to<br />
LDoNPreorderLastView=1100000000<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You lost the fun of a crowded zone, no ooc chat/drama, no fighting for camps/mobs, and the 40 new zones that all look the same.<br />
<br />
Nothing really to look forward to but do a million adventures and get vt quality loot.<br />
<br />
However the raids are fun, but the loot sucks.  Every aug ill get will be coming from a vendor.  Thanks 30 points!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm enjoying Ldon, playing a hard adventure is more challenging fun than grinding out aa in sol ro/tactics.</div></div><hr />

I thoroughly enjoy high risk...but they're nearly impossible without a bard, and we don't always have access to one.  Out of my 48 adventures, probably 50 or less have been high risk.<br />
<br />
I'm just really sick of crapass normal risk.  I go from tactics before ldon, with nice AA rate and decent rare loot...to normal risk after ldon, with crap AA and crap rare loot.  Bleh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love LDoN!<br />
<br />
All of my normal PoP hunting grounds are nice and empty :)<br />
<br />
It's great for people leveling up though, as the dungeons fill in some of the gaps and as you level up you can find groups your own level instead of seeing all of the soloers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Boring at begining ,it's still boring now  ;) <br />
<br />
All donjon are based of same concept. ALL mob inside are nearly identical (the worst are whirlwind , we can found them in all 5 themes with any different stat).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It has started to get old for me, I guess the novelty value has worn off. I think its a good expansion with good ideas, its just its appeal only lasts so long. However yet to try a raid in ldon, that could be interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with most of you. At first it was great. I used it alot to level my warrior. He went from 39-51 in under a week doing 3-4 adventures a day. But now with alot of the competition from people to be the #1 person it just doesnt seem fun. Especially since alot of the missions are immpossible if you dont have the right group Here is my breakdown of them:<br />
<br />
Rescues- Noone ever does them cause the hastle of having to return the guy back to the zone. Only real good way to do it is to have a ranger in your group.<br />
<br />
Collection- These missions are horrible if under 25 items. Even with the latest patch, the drop rate is still terrible even if your group can kill nonstop with no breaks. It's pretty bad when you can kill 25-30 mobs in 15 minutes and get ONE of the items. I mean come on give me a break here.<br />
<br />
Assassination- These are ok depending on where you are doing them at. I found they really easy in small zones like Takish-Hiz, Rujarkian Hills, and Mistmoore Catacombs. As for Deepest Guk, never did one there. Miragul done 4 and never won a single one because regardless of the fact that we had a great dps group, a map and were going the right direction the entire time, we still could not make it to him in time even with pacifying the last 15 mobs on the way to him.<br />
<br />
Slaughter- Everyone seems to prefer these cause you can go any direction and it doesnt matter as along as you kill mobs. I had a group finish one with the pally as healer (cleric went ld at the begining).<br />
<br />
Another thing is a majority of the people only want to do Mistmoore Catacombs because of all the undead which is great for pallys and necros. Hate to say it but it isnt the only one with undead. IMHO it's worthless for plate classes to do missions there unless you are below like 40. The plate gear the is sold by the merchants is crap. Besides clerics should be doing Takish-Hiz for at least the group Temperence if not the best plate armor(1492 points, level 65 rec). I found as far aas augments go that Rujarkian Hills missions are the best to do. Vendor in Ec carries agi8(160 points), wis9(220 points) and str10(340 points). But unless you are about 57-58+ it takes at least 10-20 missions to get 160 points. <br />
<br />
Anyway That's all I have to say about that. In the meantime i'll continue having fun farming the plate cycle in Kael and working on the coldain rings and shawls for alts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is still great fun for me, when I'm able to do it. Unfortunately my computer SUCKS, and I rarely can, because I never know when I might suddenly spike to 5k ping and 40% packetloss, and have to reboot my computer a dozen times (no joke) to fix it.<br />
<br />
I was bored with XPing in PoP the day PoP came out. There's not a single zone in PoP which I actually ENJOY going to for grouping. I really like LDoN. I don't care about how fast I am or am not getting XP. Obsessing about such things just leads to burnout and long stretches of having no fun, so I don't indulge. <br />
<br />
<br />
Being nearly finished with tailoring and by extension, all tradeskills, I was beginning to fret that, not wanting to be in a guild and part of the raid scene, that I would lack anything to do. LDoN gives me purpose. Short term for the mission, long term for whatever widget I want to buy from the adventure merchants. I don't see myself getting tired of it any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I raced to hit the top 20 as well.  Made number 4 and gained two pieces of Spectral Armor within the first three weeks, and almost have enough for the extended range augment.  I am thoroughly sick of Mirugals, and have only been allowed to do one in Guk, because it's nearly impossible without a bard (almost like hard missions).  I'm still looking forward to grinding for more augments, but I for sure do not have nearly the drive I had in the beginning.<br />
<br />
Rescues- Noone ever does them cause the hastle of having to return the guy back to the zone. Only real good way to do it is to have a ranger in your group.<br />
I would agree for the most part, but I do rescues exclusively in Tak...that zone is so very easy for this mission type, the dungeons are all relatively small here, and most maps only have two spawn points.  Since the NPC is always up, you can head to the one you &quot;think&quot; it might be at, and if you are wrong, you still had to clear mobs to get him to follow you anyway.  Having a tracker helps, but not totally necessary.  Most rescue can be won in 30 minutes fairly easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not bored with it at all, unlike PoP which I have had no desire to return to since LDoN was launched.<br />
<br />
PoP was sit in one spot and grind grind grind. Sure the XP was through the roof but it was so damn repetitive I'm glad to have an alternative now.<br />
<br />
In LDoN I'm constantly moving and never sitting in one spot. Sure, the patterns of the dungeons look the same but at least it's not the exact same spot for hours on end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I dont like LDoN much. I have lots of time to play. I prefer to get a group going, and to keep it going for hours at a time. LDoN has forced breaks every 20 to 90 mins, and thats an opportune time for people to leave.<br />
<br />
In part, I am spoiled. Both of my characters have elemental access, and the experience in PoEarth and PoFire just blows away anything I've see in any LDoN adventure.<br />
<br />
But I have also grown bored with LDoN. Even the 5 themes all feel exactly the same. Sure its different mobs, in a slilghtly different setting, but the feel is always the same.<br />
<br />
Im also pretty pissed about the nerfage they did in the last patch. I was seriously considering working on buying an LDoN BP and augmenting it to hell and back. Now, after the nerf, there is no reason to replace my Scaled Avatar BP. Which means even less reason to go to LDoN.<br />
<br />
So I still go to LDoN from time to time to waste some time. But I will take a group in the elemental planes in a heartbeat over LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">LDoN is also boring for me now.<br />
Played it for god knows how long brought Bane and now sick of the sight of it.<br />
Seems to me LDoN was programmed with the Console/Younger generation in mind.As in go in blast hell out of everything as quick as you can ad infinitum.<br />
Hey you got the concentration span of a glass of water,cant stand to play the same thing for more than 90 mins well then LDoN was made for you.<br />
When LDoN was announced I was really looking forward to it as I mistakenly thought it was going to bring some new fun dungeons into the game.<br />
How dissapointed I was to play the finished product.<br />

<br />
This is the part that amuses me the most about the people bored of LDoN. The dungeons all feel the same with the same mobs, but going to PoP and sitting in a 2 inch square for 5 hours killing the same 3 (or less) mob models over and over and over and over and over and over and over isn't boring. /boggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Amen Arriana.<br />
<br />
And whatever SoE tells us in their advertisings, LDoN dungeons are not in any way 'handcrafted dungeons' like Sebilis or Chardok.<br />
<br />
So everyone complaining about boring mobs, boring dungeon layouts, boring content (lol, what content?) - boggle? It is a fast paced, simple slaughter action - no immersive dungeon quality to look for.<br />
<br />
Still fun when you like that type of gameplay - as others have said, you can burn out very, very fast though. Myself i give a month or two more of regular LDoN visits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What nerf are you talking about? Only nerf I saw was with xp, and although I hate it I would rather xp in LDoN anyday over PoV, HoH, and PoTa.<br />
<br />
With elemental planes access you should be doing hard missions which net you so many more points over normal that those armors should be in easy reach. I can't understand why people are whining.</div></div><hr />

Because they disagree with you, the reason why they no longer like it is because of burning out doing too many adventures?=p There is a period of time called the &quot;novelty period&quot; a lot of people upon passing this can look possibly fairly at an expansion. While you may retain the idea that person_001 is experiencing burnout, person_002 may argue you are simply in the novelty period=p<br />
<br />
While I retain it is perhaps one of the more &quot;original&quot; expansions, its content is very quickly unlocked. It does provide a very nice alternative to the mindnumbing exp places pop introduced us too, but Ldon is very single dimensioned in what it provides. Ie in 6 months time, nothing particular is going to be unlocked in comparison to other expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Loved it - still do sorta.  Except on my server (Tholuxe) it's like pulling teeth to get people to go to other dungeons than Mistmoore.  I've been forming my own groups and telling people as they join we're goin to Miragul's or Rujark or Guk.  That seems to work pretty well, but I've been met with threats of leaving to stay in Mistmoore.<br />
<br />
This is by people who've done 20+ missions in MM and wonder why they have no stats on their Adventure stone yet *sigh*.  I can't wait till people realize that you gotta go to all of em and do 10+ to get some stats in all.  Can't wait till people actually want to go to Guk and Miragul's and Tak.  Rujark's fairly popular once you show people how easy it is and how cool the orc/goblin setting is.<br />
<br />
LDoN has certainly ruined a bit of EQ though.  As mentioned by someone else, groups break almost always after one adventure is completed, esp if one of the much needed classes leaves and there isn't a replacement in 20 minutes.   I miss the times before LDoN and just /shout LFG, then you're in a group for hours on end :P.  Yeah people still had to leave but constant xp keeps people there, and working with the same people is great for more than an hour.<br />
<br />
I've got a couple of clicks of folks in LDoN that I can count on stayin with me for 3-4 adventures a day.  It works great as you know how everyone works, thats what LDoN is missing.  The time limit for the adventures is good for a push but failing by 10 minutes and getting 1 point (under 50 I haven't seen more than 1 point given for lesser reward in 3 fails).<br />
<br />
I hope that SOE decides to remove the time limit, add a medium/moderate difficulty (so things are more likely to con even and some yellow instead of yellow and red).  And perhaps make it so the adventure is attached to the group leader and then you invite people for your adventure.  As having to wait for some crack whore to get a KEI for 20 minutes can break a group too...because you cant grab the mission till she gets back (no I'm not bitter).  And just  sitting around for literally an hour tryin to find a damn cleric or chanter because people dondt want a druid and shaman or 2 shamans healing is a pain.  Sometimes I dont feel like healing though, nor are my spells enough to keep people up under multiple hits for enough time within the time limit so waitin for a cleric doesn't bug me that much - but the enchatner isn't needed as bad as some people think.<br />
<br />
Remove Timer, but keep the points attached to it some how.  Like after 90 minutes don't instantly gimp the adventure points, have them slowly trickle down every 15 minutes or something by 1 point.  It's not often that it comes down to the wire, but when it does and you're fighting the last mob and kill it 20 seconds afterward its no fun.<br />
<br />
I just wanna see people in KC and OS again.  But I guess PoP helped to kill thos off a bit, LDoN finished the job.  Was fighting in DL a couple days ago, and enjoying myself in a group for hours on end chain pulling and havin a ball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">On my server Emarr, the groups i get seem to be pretty damn faast paced (level 65).  Not too much bitching about group makeup, as long as we have me and healer and enough to put out some damage its all good.  Its a pain getting people to guk or EC at least for me but other than that not bad.<br />
<br />
I love LDoN, i can burn half an aa in about an hour collect some points and meet new people.  Much better than bot or other pop zones i can get into, sit in one place and camp xyz mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">LDoN was fun the first few times we played it, but once the novelty wore off it became deadly boring.  And I have only done 4 adventures so the novelty didn't last long.<br />
<br />
Part of the entertainment in EQ has always been group (and guild) chat.  But with the timer ticking away no one indulges in conversation except when necessary.  The result is that you are actually more alone in an LDoN group than if you solo (where at least you can exchange insults with other people in the zone).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I hate the expansion. I went on 20 missions, a few in each camp but most in Miraguls since that where all my guildies were CAMPING points and faction. I doubt I&quot;ll ever go back unless its absolutely the only way I can ever see myself getting a focus effect or new spell.<br />
<br />
In a way LDoN has shown how selfish most EQ players are. I've seen players regularly go ballistic over someone going linkdead(as if its planned), angrily sending petitions that they get an adventure wiped off their record because it affected their stupid LDoN FRAGboard standing. I've seen players growl and zone wide slander players and try to get them blackballed from groups becaus he had took 90 seconds to go for a piss or deal with a child or wife. I really do think a surprising number of EQ players must pee themselves or pee in a foul smelling bucket under their desk rather than leave Norrath unattended.<br />
<br />
I was expecting dungeon as epic as guk or sebilis not friggin dps time trials. Ya know, your own person Sebilis. No camp checks, no walking freely from the top to the juggs because everything is dead. Fighting your way from the lowly sentry to the boss man himself. Like a D&amp;D dungeon crawl. I'm sure there are many reason this wasn't done, but DAMN!!, they didn't even find a middle ground between dungeon crawl and this **** they call a dungeon today.<br />
<br />
Ya know this expansion kind of reminds me of turning all of Everquest into one huge collective DKP guild system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I have couple of RL friends I play with, and we all get on the phone when we play. Shaman (me), Enchanter and Bard. We bum a Virtue, get three DPS, and hit it. Melees say &quot;NO CLERIC ***!?!?&quot; and we say &quot;Hey, we will complete this in under 45 minutes, you can ride along and do DPS or leave now&quot;. If they stay for the first group, they stay all damn day.  :p <br />
<br />
Best was when this uber Pally was our MA, his sword procced a group heal about every 30 seconds. I only healed him like four times in an adventure. That one was actually my first one in under 30 minutes, we were told we had to 'rest up' before we could get another!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I've done about 70 adventures.  It was fun, but I feel like I've experienced all the content now.  Despite the advertising, there are really only 5 zones (in terms of how you &quot;feel&quot; about ldon anyway, only 5 zones).  <br />
<br />
Planes of Power is still the last &quot;real&quot; expansion EQ has had.  I am beginning to wonder if PoP is the end of EQ, or if there will ever be another expansion that actually adds real progression to the game.  <br />
<br />
For the price, LDoN is a nice little supplement, sort of like a &quot;game within a game&quot;, like a Gems where you actually play EQ.  It feels a lot more like an arcade/console game than a real mmorpg experience.<br />
<br />
I like it as giving me something else to do, but I am still dying to see new &quot;real&quot; zones to explore.  For those of us who like to solo/duo and poke around on our own, LDoN just doesn't provide that fix... <br />

I loved ldon when it came out, it was fun and new.  Now i'm a bit bored with it, normal adventure are just boring as hell.  My group tries to spice it up with 'new rules' like a pull is no pull with less then 4 mobs + bards can't mes unless it's a healing mob.  There is just no danger in normal mode.<br />
Hard mode on the other hand, is bigtime fun!  Keeps everyone focused and playing very good, the sence of danger and risk is awsome. <br />
<br />
My group isn't elemental lvl yet, we just got keyed for vt and starting to raid it this week.  We still stick to slaughter on hard atm, but this will change this week.<br />
Both xp and loot is great in hard adventures.<br />
I also like the short time on the adventures, a quick adventure to finish the day after long raid = fun.</div></div><hr />

I've done something close to 60 adventures now. Half with my shaman, half with my rogue. I am one adventure from getting Bane, so I should have that tonight. Im leaning towards focusing on hard adventures only with my rogue, mainly because the easy ones are boring me stiff. <br />

There is a certain same-ness about them, but they're not identical. And I still think they're more fun and more challenging than BoT or HoH, even if not as much AA.<br />
<br />
I will only do dungeons with guildies, or people I know though.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I have is 6 people all with their own goals, so we have to decide where to go. The last couple of times, I've had the whole group rolling and winner chooses the dungeon (but is out of subsequent rolls). That seems to be fairest, if you don't get a group together with a specific place in mind.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I think LDoN is a wonderful expansion.  For those of us who don&#8217;t have and/or want high end PoP flags it&#8217;s a great way to meet people, get some XP and perhaps a new augmentation or item.  I own two pieces of Tae Ew armor and that&#8217;s the best gear I have.  So many of the item drops in LDoN are upgrades for me.  From my own experience, though there is down time between adventures we usually keep most of our groups for two or three adventures.  So the experience is similar to what I have in regular dungeons.<br />
<br />
I certainly agree that after you&#8217;ve gone on several adventures in each theme there is very little new to see.  But the same is true, if not more so, for any zone in the game.  There are certainly ripples caused by this expansion, as there are by any expansion.  The main thing I dislike about LDoN is it tends to hurt guild grouping.  We had a level limit in our guild of 45 so we could always group together.  With a seven level range on adventures it&#8217;s easy for many guild members to be left out of groups.  But overall I feel LDoN is a good addition to the game.</div></div><hr />

Well I tend to agree that the dungeons all seem to blend together with no real distinctive &quot;flavor&quot;.  It would be nice to be able to say,  &quot;wow, this is the map with xyz, crawling down xyz, past xyz, with the big xyz, etc.  Well, we all know what it's like now and aside from a few little nice touches here and there the maps all look and feel the same within the respective camps.  I think that halfing the instanced dungeons and spending a lot more detail time on each one would have been much better.<br />
<br />
LDON is a terrific idea and actually I think it was implimented pretty well (even including changes in LDON armour).  I just wish it had a special feel to it like Chardok, Seb, etc. have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">EQ's biggest strength used to be the fact that it did a great job of creating zones with atmosphere and character.  They started to lose their touch with PoP, and completely flushed that down the toilet with the randomly cobbled together crap of LDoN.<br />
<br />
It is also another step towards arcade-style gaming, which I despise.  EQ is not my life.  I do occasionally get phone calls, need to answer the door, do something for my wife, run to the john, etc.  I can usually do that in a traditional xp group, and for some stretches of raids.  With LDoN's killkilltimelimitkillkilltimetickingomg  I can't, at least not without screwing over 5 other prople.  Pac Man is cool and all, but turning EQ into Pac Man is a huge mistake.<br />
<br />
They just should have made some great new dungeons a la Guk and Sebilis and instance some of them, and added some raid encounters and instance all of them.</div></div><hr />

Its another masterful stealth nerf to players.  When people used to grind out 2,3 even 4AA in a 4 hours session, now you are lucky to see 1AA in the same time after you screw around with groups and which adventure to do and from which camp you do it.<br />
<br />
SOE needed some way to slow down aa progression without turning off the players and the only way they can do that is by making you think you are getting something out of LDoN.  But if you look at it, you will see it for what it is.  A diversion, a time sink.  I actually saw some lvl 65 player, with EP gear, shout &quot;woot!&quot; (and meant it) when a +6 PR augment dropped at the very end of our adventure, from a chest no less.

<br />
Anyway, my 2 copper...I loved it when it came out and I still do.  I'm not sure if they changed the xp (don't think they did, but I could be wrong), but even if they did a slight nerf, I still prefer ldon dungeons to xp camps.  (at least for my 61 warrior...I'll have to see what I think at 65)<br />
<br />
One thing I wonder about for those of you that don't like it anymore...are you a casual gamer that's less than 65 with 50 AA's?  The reason I ask is it seems to me that's what the expansion is made for - people like me.  I don't (and probably never will) have elemental gear, so ldon gives me a chance at getting it given my limited play time.  Also, I find it much easier to get a group with my warrior in ldon than I do anywhere else (heck, outside ldon I can sit for hours without getting an invite...in ldon the longest I waited was 30 minutes.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">For the powergamer that is not in a raiding guild, there is literally no other option for gear advancement past ornate unless you do LDoN.

As far as xp, I'm not worried about the xp rate, it's immaterial, because according to my calculations I'll have capped my AAs (only xping in LDoN) by the time I get all the gear I want. :)<br />
<br />
LDoN's a great opportunity for me to get my monk into ~Ssra level gear, and I'm going full-bore towards that goal, heh.  For my shaman...eh, more AC, more HP, more FT, few more focuses...it's not all that big of a deal.  LDoN doesn't help him nearly as much as it helps my monk.</div></div><hr />

I pushed my bard to 30 takish adventures to buy my first piece of 1492 pt plate armor, and haven't been playing tons since. So I can definitely see the burnout factor coming into play. But I'll be back at it enthusiastically soon. I'm really starting to itch to get the shaman through some more adventures.

The expansion offers some interesting points however. You can buy gear with time. Time is expensive. If you upgrade your gear, your time investment is lost.<br />

Yeah, that's the one thing I really don't like about ldon.  I wish I could sell stuff back for some points.  I really don't like the idea of saving up for the 1492 armor set (it'll only take me about, oh...3 years  :p ), then getting a drop that's better.

Now that sounds like someone I’d enjoy grouping with.  This appears to be a person who’s playing EverQuest just for the fun of it and having a blast doing so.  EQ isn’t about how quickly you can outfit yourself in elemental gear, or at least it isn’t for me.  Its about having fun.  And the little things can be just as fun as the big things.  After two plus years in Norrath I finally killed Hadden last weekend and looted a fishbone earring.  None of my characters needed it, they already have better, but I was practically dancing in my chair for the rest of the evening.  Heck, I’m still smiling about it.<br />
<br />
I don’t do adventures for the adventure points, the experience or the loot.  I participate in those adventures because they’re fun.  I get to group with my friends and I get to meet new people.  I met the most amazing bard a couple of adventures ago.  After grouping with her my opinion of the bard class, or at least its potential, rose significantly.  That adventure was a heck of a lot of fun.  And as a bonus to all the fun I’m having I also end up with adventure points and experience.  And sometimes I even win a roll on an augmentation or a piece of gear.  Now that’s what I call a deal.</div></div><hr />

I hope they rethink this part.They probably base this system on most raiding guild's loot systems: you &quot;pay&quot; for upgrades with raid points.  Since most good items are NO DROP, when you upgrade that item whatever raid points you spent are gone.  It encourages people to spend wisely.<br />
<br />
Adventure points become your own personal raid point system.  You can spend a little bit of points on items that could quickly become throwaway, or you choose your items carefully.<br />
<br />
Why do they bother?  I believe its because it gives people a greater sense of accomplishment to get fewer greater items.  Its the nature of EQ equipment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I began in 99... and to be honest, this feels pretty similar to some of the dungeons of old, with the notable exception you dont sit on your ass in one room waiting for the ghoul lord or whatever to pop. The only significant different between deepest guk and lower guk, imo, is that guk had more &quot;height&quot; variation (tunnels up/down, towers) and these zones feel rather flat. But no one really explored old dungeons (in fact, it was discouraged by design) because if you killed a ph, you were simply doing a loot farmers work for them if you moved on. Even in 99, the prevailing attitude was to sit and stare at the same spot for hours on end.<br />
<br />
I like ldon. Its repetitive, but so is all of eq. It feels a lot more like a D&amp;D dungeon than camping disco in seb ever could, because, omg, you MOVE through an area, sometimes facing traps, rescuing people, etc. I wouldnt mind another type of mission introduced, that relied on tradeskills to win (gather items, combine, hand in).<br />
<br />
Tak and, say... mistmoor really feel about as similar as seb and najena. They have mobs that punch you, or cast.... /shrug. Taks bard golem thingies at least sing their songs. Pulled some mobs in there, and 2 members of the party were promptly charmed... made a more interesting fight than beetles in seb, or lame ass dogs in KC... sorry if you feel different.<br />
<br />
I'm in a raiding guild... we do stuff nearly every night, so my ldon time is rather limited. I prolly have 25-30 wins, 14 losses (a good number of those from raids being called mid adventure). And yes, I only group with friends or guildmates.... I'm not gonna screw over outside people if we have to go kill bert or something.<br />
<br />
I wish there were more nice ldon items that fit in multiple slots, in case you win an upgrade. Was going to save up for the spell haste aug, but was recently awarded an 18% spell haste, so may buy an extended range aug and put it in a ldon bracer or something when I unlock more points in miraguls.<br />
<br />
More importantly, it lets my melee friends add some useful augs to their weapons. My roommate has a BoC and ... whatever the hell the sword from Agnarr is... throwing some anger 3 augs on those will really help him out.  I've got a good chunk of aa, so dont mind taking an exp cut to give him a hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was really disappointed when I first read that there was a minimum group requirement.  What's worse is that the drops and mobs are scaled up based on the number of players in the group, not just the player level.  I was looking forward to 1-3 man groups.  Also, basically requiring 6 people in the LDoN groups significantly slows down the adventure process.  I would play LDoN a lot more if I could go in with any number of players in the group.<br />
<br />
It would also be nice if there were adventures of various designed time lengths, ranging say from 30 minutes to 3 hours or something.<br />

I like full groups working efficiently together.  I've done all kinds of missions with all types of groups and have a great success rate.  I like the classic dungeon crawl feel.  I've met lots of good folks doing LDoN and identified a few idiots to avoid - LDoN helps with both.  Having another option besides the bazaar (the adventure points) for getting and/or augmenting loot is nice.<br />
<br />
I like the social aspects of MMORPGs but excessive idiotic public channel spam drives me nuts (PoK/Bazaar are always uber spammy).  I don't miss the days of 100 people in lower guk all camped 20 ft from each other for a handful of mobs...waiting forever for spawns...and spamming /ooc and /shout constantly for lack of anything better to do.  On the other hand, many zones are so freaking empty these days that it's sad (but it was this way before LDoN too on Xev - most folks are higher average level and/or stick to a tiny handful of popular uber xp zones).<br />

<br />
I work 2nd shift and play late nights - about the time I log on most of my friends are just logging off.  With LDON I get groups much more quickly than before (usually within 5 minutes of turning on LFG). I have met some amazing people though pickup groups (and a few that I now have on ignore).  <br />

Fortunately I don't care about my win/loss record - I think I am at 36-18.  But win or lose, I am likely to have fun, unless it is one of those groups where we don't make it past the 2nd room - ack!

Well....DUH. It isn't designed for you any more than PoP is made for non-powergame raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">&quot; I actually saw some lvl 65 player, with EP gear, shout &quot;woot!&quot; (and meant it) when a +6 PR augment dropped at the very end of our adventure, from a chest no less.&quot;<br />
Yes your generalization must be true. Its not just elemental people if you take a browse through the threads again. Again because people disagree with you, its their flaw. New argument please.<br />
To illustrate my point there is a guy I think called Karelan, inspect his gear on magelo, its not elemental and thats just one I picked out.<br />
As to the appeal of ldon it was meant for a appeal for all. Hence why they put raids in, hence why they put hard adventures. I also notice a criticism from casual players, they absolutely hate the time restraint. But omg this criticism must make them elemental+.<br />
<br />
I am not saying Ldon is bad, I am saying imo its gets old fast, and this is not just from the view of elemental people or people that have done so many adventures that they are now going through a stage of burnout. Imo thats a kinda shortsighted argument and very suggestive of a contrasting perspective of the &quot;novelty&quot; period although this obviously does not apply to all. It is a fun expansion to a degree and I am looking forward to some of these add-ons which are promised in the new year. Hopefully with these they will use variety, and they will change perhaps the type of mobs as you progress through. Maybe even add a few quests(gasp!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Biggest complaint I am seeing is &quot;LDoN gets old fast&quot;, not like sitting in a corner in BoT or PoE and pulling the same 20 mobs over and over, THATS fresh baby.<br />
<br />
I love LDoN. Its a perfect answer for that &quot;couple hours to play, what should I do&quot; question. Its a fantastic way to meet people. Its a great way to get XP and some cash without having to GRIND. Every success gives you SOMETHING. <br />
<br />
I will continue to use it to balance my EQ experience. Thats the key for me. Raiding all the time gets old fast. Grinding XP in one spot gets old fast. Soloing gets old fast. Tradeskilling gets old fast. LDoN gets old fast. But put them all in a bowl, mix em up, and you have a recipe for some serious entertainment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing is for the appeal of all. Not Velious, not PoP, not Hershey Bars, not Britney Spears, not President Bush. Most certainly not LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">If thats not self explanatory I don't know what is..., should I perhaps write it in french for you?</div></div><hr />

Is the point I was refuting especially, my point is that there is a fair number of each not overjoyed by the expansion.</div></div><hr />
