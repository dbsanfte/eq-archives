			<div><strong>Class Balance Proposal</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>Dear EQLive Team,<br />
<br />
My character name is Montegue Lonerunner, and I have been an avid EverQuest player since the year 2000. For the majority of that time I have been playing a Ranger. I love the class and the fantasy element it brings to Norrath, but like many other Rangers, I feel the class has been left behind when it comes to balancing issues. <br />
<br />
The following discourse is based upon the logs, parses, and experiences of Rangers from the high-end game all the way down. It is my opinion, and the opinion of many members of the Ranger community, that the class needs retuning from the ground up. This letter will address the following issues with the class: Tanking, Damage Dealing, Archery, Spells, and Utility.<br />
<br />
Please note that the suggestions below are a compilation of hard data generated by players who post to The Ranger’s Glade, Steel Warrior, and EQHunter. At the bottom of this letter is a list of links to the supporting data.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tanking –<br />
<br />
Rangers have not tanked well since Kunark. The majority of rangers feel that our Hit Points and mitigation is probably at an appropriate level compared to the other melee/hybrid classes. However, we inexplicably have the second lowest Defense skill among all melee and hybrid classes, and some of the lowest caps on Riposte, Parry, and Dodge. Being a chain class, it stands to reason that our caps on avoidance should be higher than they are, and our Defense cap (though increased recently) might need some attention in the end game.<br />
<br />
Many Rangers very much enjoy tanking for experience groups. It is challenging and rewarding. The more the other melee classes pull ahead of us in this category, the less we will be able to perform that function. Rangers don’t really see themselves tanking the big mobs and raid targets. However, they do like to tank for regular groups in zones appropriate for their level and gear. <br />
<br />
Damage Dealing –<br />
<br />
The EverQuest community generally agrees that there are two types of melee-based characters – those that tank, and those that inflict melee damage. Rangers are most often considered in the damage-dealing category, largely because we make such poor tanks (and also due to the common misconception about the strength of archery damage). <br />
<br />
However, recent testing performed over a period of more than 10 hours using the very best weapons in the game have shown that Rangers place close to the bottom of the melee damage heap. The gap between the amount of damage per second a Ranger can do in melee combat and the amount of damage Monks and Rogues can do is rather large. The gap is not so large between Rangers and the Knight classes, and in fact Shadow Knights are capable of out damaging Rangers when they throw their spells into the fray. <br />
<br />
In order to bring our damage into line, many Rangers have suggested a few fixes. One of those fixes would be to add Triple Attack to our repertoire of melee advantages. This would help bring us past Warriors (thus increasing our desirability) and would help put us solidly in the lead among the hybrids for overall damage. Also, putting Rangers on a melee damage table someplace between Warriors and Monks would help us compete with the other pure melee classes for damage without eclipsing them completely.<br />
<br />
Many Rangers feel that Dual Wield needs to be re-tuned. This would add to all melee characters capable of Dual Wield. The re-tuning of two-handed weapons changed the pecking order of damage-dealing methods. Since Rangers were granted Dual Wield to offset their lower Hit Points and Armor Class when compared to the other Hybrids, it stands to reason that Dual Wield should outpace Two Hand Slash in the damage department. The development team has already mentioned the possibility of re-tuning Dual Wield, and many Rangers anxiously wait for the results. <br />
<br />
If our damage ratio was increased compared to the other melee classes, the suggested  changes to our ability to perform as tanks would be less needed. As it stands, we don’t do either particularly well in comparison to our cousins, and thus we have the very core of our issue. <br />
<br />
Archery –<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, Archery damage is not overbalancing. The development team has already publicly acknowledged that fact. Archery damage, given comparative melee weapons, parses out as less than melee under optimum conditions. This means to say that environmental geometry or other characters do not obstruct the mob fired upon and there is no system lag. It also assumes the target is not too far above or below the Ranger. <br />
<br />
Most Rangers don’t feel the need for a major upgrade to our archery damage at this time. However, nearly all of them agree that the mechanics of archery require attention, and that an auto attack option must be added to the game. <br />
<br />
Some Rangers and members of other classes have said that Archery is the class-defining ability of the Ranger. There are as many different views on that statement as there are Rangers, it would seem. One thing is clear, however - If archery is to be our class-defining ability, it needs to be fixed and it needs to be a viable tactic from day one of a Ranger’s career.<br />
<br />
Spells –<br />
<br />
Most rangers agree that our attack buffs and group attack buffs are a welcome addition to grouping situations. That line of spells is unique and offers us a chance to shine in a group. However, the Ranger class has had concerns over it’s spell selection for a long time now. <br />
<br />
The spell list for the Ranger involves a mixture of many different spell lines, much like the Druid’s spells. However, unlike our hybrid cousins, we do not draw the stronger spells from our parent class. For example, a Paladin is capable of casting a 90% resurrection spell, group heal spells, and solid HP/AC buffs. Shadow Knights have pets, life taps, poison and disease nukes, Snare, fear, and corpse summoning spells. These spells are *in addition* to the unique lines of magic those classes receive. We, however, draw much less from our casting parent class. Entire spell lines of the Druid are ignored completely when it comes to the Ranger. Some additional spells from the Druid’s major spell lines would go a long way to balancing the utility and value of the Ranger spell book when compared to the other hybrid classes. <br />
<br />
We do see that you are considering an improved heal spell. This would be a wonderful addition, however, many rangers feel that at present time the proposed amount of HP the spell will heal is not going to be of much use to many rangers. Please consider making the heal valuable without overpowering when compared to the Paladin’s ability to heal. <br />
<br />
Players at he high end of the game note that their direct damage spells are too often resisted to be useful, forcing us to rely solely on our melee for damage at the end game. As has been shown, our melee damage is not competitive with other damage classes. This makes many Rangers at that point in the game feel somewhat less than productive on raids and in groups. <br />
<br />
We have noticed that you intend on adding a nuke with a negative resist modifier. This is also a step in the right direction, though many Rangers think that a negative modifier on our nukes before that spell would not overbalance us in zones where resists are not an issue, and would keep things even in zones in which resists play a higher role. If Hybrid spell damage is to be considered a portion of their overall damage capabilities when comparing them to the other classes, the damage needs to be much more reliable.  <br />
<br />
If the mana pool is to be the balance against the pure melee endurance pool, many Rangers feel that our recast times should be eliminated. Many Rangers feel that we are capable of managing our mana, and the ability to dump it would vastly increase the scalability of our class on raids. Reduction or elimination on the recast times of nukes has been suggested a number of time. I don’t think Rangers would see any problem with this being changed across the boards for all hybrids. <br />
<br />
There is a sentiment in the Ranger community that many of our spells have been farmed out to other melee classes in the form of click effects on items. This is indeed true, and is a source of frustration for Rangers. If our spells are to be one of the advantages of our class, they should not be handed out to others. <br />
<br />
Utility –<br />
<br />
Some have claimed that Rangers are a utility class. This is true, to some extent. We are excellent trackers. Unfortunately, Rogues tend to make even better scouts when they get Shroud of Stealth. It would be nice to have an AA ability akin to shroud of stealth useful only in outdoor zones. The Advanced Tracking AA looks promising, but it would need to fairly precise in order to compete with Shroud of Stealth scouting. <br />
<br />
As mentioned before, our utility spells have largely been farmed out in the form of potions, click items, and new abilities given to the pure melee classes during their rebalancing. Please consider improving the utility spells we have to be better than the ones a person can drop a few platinum on. <br />
<br />
Another issue with our utility is the reduction in hate on spells like Flame Lick, Ensnare, Entrap, and Tangling Weeds. The reduction in hate makes it significantly more difficult to effectively peel a mob off an overzealous caster or to split mobs up on a bad pull. This utility was one of the major reasons groups sought out Rangers in Adventures. With the addition of the Warrior’s Incite line of disciplines, they can easily replace us in that role. <br />
<br />
In conclusion<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. The Ranger community as a whole would appreciate it if you took a look at the issues we are having. These issues were compiled from the posts and threads found on The Ranger’s Glade, and the solutions are compiled from suggestions of the posters there. <br />
<br />
Rangers, in general, do not expect everything that is weak about the class to become strong. That wouldn’t be very challenging! However, when you take all these weaknesses in total, it shows a trend of erosion in the total power level of the class and indicates a serious imbalance. Therefore, we would very much like you to review the entire class as a whole, and not just focus on fixing one or two small things. <br />
<br />
There are thousands of Rangers out there. Some of them are locked in battles with four-headed dragons in the Plane of Time. Some of them are protecting the bears of Surefall Glade. All of them need a little bit of  help in their chosen path. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yours, <br />
<br />

1. Kill the first paragraph.  Its unnecessary.<br />

3. Dont start a paragraph with "Finally," and then have four more paragraphs full of different ideas following it.  "Finally" really should be your final idea.<br />
<br />
4.  Dont give a summation at the end.  You are writing to bright people (I hope.)  They will have already summarized your ideas in their own minds.  Never underestimate the reader.</div>

<br />
In terms of making this more widely known:<br />
<br />
1) First, continue to gather consensus here. Tweak based on suggestions but don't alter the fundamental structure. Gather signatures if you think that would help.<br />
<br />
2) Once you are sure that you have a broad base of support, post this somewhere easily accessible as an "open letter", and then send a short "press release" to eqcasters, allakhazam, and the other major news sites so they can link to it as a news item.<br />
<br />
3) Email a copy to Sony directly via their developer feedback email address.<br />
<br />
Couple of minor nitpicks:<br />
<br />
Spelling: pursue, not persue.<br />
<br />
Archery damage under perfect conditions: It would be more accurate to say: In the end game, and for the vast majority of our career, archery damage under perfect conditions is eclipsed...<br />
<br />
You might also say "...in the end game, our archery damage is eclipsed by our melee damage, which in turn is eclipsed by the melee damage of the pure melee classes..."</div>

I should have been more clear. I'm sorry. <br />

I was hoping to be corrected on grammar, spelling, and factual information (for example, where we currently sit compared to other classes DPS). <br />

You personal opinion about where you think we *should* sit is all fine and good, and I appreciate the comment. I disagree with you, however. Thank you for the comment, though.</div>

I keep giving time for changes to be made and we keep slipping further behind.  I am Ele flagged and not far from Time, been to every zone outside Time in the game.  Soloed, grouped, raided, quested, trade skilled, done the works.  And I am just getting tired.  I find it hard to see why I should bother playing any more.  For the first time I am really considering just giving it all up.  Its not that we have suddenly got bad but rather we have been ignored and sidelined for so long that we have fallen behind.  If there is somewhere to put my name I will be quite happy to.</div>
