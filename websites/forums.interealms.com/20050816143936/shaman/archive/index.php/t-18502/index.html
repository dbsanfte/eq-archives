<br />
I Dont think so that they will raise level cap to 70<br />
<br />
they will add more aa abil bla bla..<br />
<br />
like they stated last time when they raised level cap.they told us at that time that the raise from 60-65 was a high discussion and that it would not be done again in the future... but was needed at that time.<br />
<br />
i think you must read the new expansion features again... nothing is mentioned there about a new level cap...<br />
<br />
they did mentioned that there will be a lot more aa abil. and on<br />
<br />
focus on that <br />
<br />
<br />
level cap is just a rumour started by somebody</div></div><hr />

They are much better off adding a bunch of AA skills, it won't triviallize older zones so much while still giving people ways to upgrade themselves.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would like more levels in a way, gives a sense of progression again. However, the point is if they raise the level cap they do obsolete old zones, and in theory they need to supply as many new zones as they obsolete. If they increased the level cap to 70, it would trivialize most of the guild progression tree they developed in pop. This would be detrimental unless they could supply an alternative progression tree for guilds of all levels. However Soe makes the rules and they will be aware of this factor. This new expansion could in theory pave the way for a lvl 70 cap in a following expansion.</div></div><hr />

&lt;--dibs on the 'plane of pie'! <br />
<br />
I hope they don't go up to lvl 70, mainly because of the way it would affect the range of what's blue to us. We'd be basically tied down to tier3+ PoP, LDoN and whatever's in the new expansion which isn't something I'd look forward to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't think they are going to add more levels.  A few reasons have already been stated.  One is the reason that Shadrak stated.  I specifically remember this happening before several expansion packs were released.  Spell parsers would start seeing spells that were higher level than players could currently progress to, but when the expansion pack would come out the spell level would actually be lowered to a level that players had been able to get to in the previous expansion pack.  <br />
<br />
Another reason is because there has been no mention of the level cap being raised or even hinted at on the features list for Gates of Discord.  <br />
<br />
Ruins of Kunark's features hinted at a level cap increase by the line:<br />
*Increased level difficulty range allows players to advance further in the game.<br />
<br />
For Planes of Power it was hinted at by the phrase:<br />
*Further character progression making players even more powerful<br />
<br />
The Gates of Discord only lists these features:<br />
* 100 new Alternate Advancement abilities offer more options for character progression with new and unique skills to master. <br />
<br />
* Gain leadership experience and unlock many group- and raid-enhancing tools. <br />
<br />
* 20 new zones, 10 new instanced zones and 10 new traditional zones including a huge ship city zone, complete with merchants, tradesman, and quest-givers, where you can gather your party and launch expeditions. The new combat zones are for characters level 50 and over. <br />
<br />
* New Berserker class empowers you to ravage your enemies with two-handed axes or by hurling large objects. <br />
<br />
* 20 all-new NPC models make for hundreds of challenging encounters unlike anything seen before in EverQuest. <br />
<br />
* New Tribute System enhances gameplay by allowing players to choose beneficial attributes, skills, or effects through offerings at their home cities. <br />
<br />
* Dozens of new and exciting story-driven quests and content for the hardy adventurer. <br />
<br />
* New tradeskill recipes to produce hundreds of new items. <br />
<br />
* Unearth arcane spells, mighty weapons and other hidden treasures!<br />
<br />
<br />
I think they would at least hint at a level cap increase in this list if they were planning on raising the level cap.</div></div><hr />

There have just been a few people in my guild talking about it and I thought I would use my fellow shamans as a sounding board of thoughts and disagreements or agreements.  But it looks like some people read into things a little too much and start flaming.  Its ok though, you guys can have you own thoughts on what you think I was goin after.  I wont hold that against you  :p  But I do think its a valid point to talk about, and look at all the old memories its bringing back and all the sub arguments it will create. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They could expand the levels as high as they wanted I suppose.  The problem that raising levels creates is the immediate trivilization of previous content. What happens to Grummus or Terris Thule when suddenly they are confronted with 20 level 70's in level 70 gear?  Instant bloodbath.  Emporer?  Splat with 6 to 10 people.  Kunark dragons?  Rogues could solo them.<br />
<br />
We saw this with PoP and the level/gear getting pushed up. Suddenly, paladins could solo Gore and peope were one grouping ToV and VP. Everywhere is Seb became doable with 2 people.  Sony has to be carefull with how powerfull they let players get now or risk trashing PC/NPC balance in older expansions (farther than it has been already that is)</div></div><hr />

Um, no.  They should not trivialize major mob encounters like you say.  I know what you are saying but you aren't taking into account say...Ssra Emp, Tier4, etc.<br />
<br />
That's quite a bit different than the oh so big trivialization of moving from Sol A to Sol B...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They trivialized Trakanon, Veeshan's Peak, North ToV, Yelinak, Tormax, etc.  Those things were all just as bad ass at one time as the current end game is.  Hell, the Velious endgame (AoW) was comparably more bad-ass, as it was not even completed on most servers until after Luclin was released.  Some day, Quarm will be just like Vinidcator is now.<br />
<br />
EQs structure is:<br />
Kill mob A to get level II and sword 1<br />
Use level II and sword 1 to kill mob B and get level III and sword 2.<br />
Use level III and sword 2 to kill mob C and get level IV and sword 3.<br />
Use level IV and sword 3 to kill mob D and get level V and sword 4.<br />
Use level V and sword 4 to kill mob E and get level VI and sword 5.<br />
etc <br />
etc <br />
etc.<br />
<br />
They cannot stop adding levels (or things that aren't technically levels but have the same effect as levels do) without the game collapsing.  Of course that trivializes the older stuff, but they have no choice in the matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jr4atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Man its too early for this (Just waking up).  A guildy that does a lot test server investigation and plays a lot on it was mentioning that he saw some things that led him to believe that the lvl was gonna be increased to lvl 70.  So, I in turn came here and said bah dont feel like doin all that quote crap.  You know what I said. No need for me to have to point it out.  Your assuming that I was talking about the expansion only cause its coming out soon, but when I made the post, the expansion wasnt official yet either on its release date bla bla.  If you have a thought on the subject, thats great, but I guess next time I need to word my posts diffeirently so that people dont try to read too much into them that is way off the subject.  Like now I am talking about where i was goin with this and all I was trying to do was start a post on opinions on whether our fellow shamans  would like the lvl 70 increase or not like it and hoping some could place some of their reasons for their decision.  But, right off the bat your thinking I am talking about the expansion only cause I put the word &quot;now&quot; in my sentence.  Well the word &quot;now&quot; was in there cuase I had just heard about this. So, in my eyes it was &quot;now&quot;, as in bringing up a discussion.  Anyways we alll know that the ground work for our language is shot too hell and you can say something 4 ways to Sunday and everyone from the homeless guy to the President cant take anything you say and turn it into what they want.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've heard rumors of a second expansion due a couple months after Gates of discord being the one raising the level cap. Every expansion has made the previous one(s) significantly easier even if they don't raise the level cap. Luclin and Velious both trivialized the previous expansions with out any increase in level caps. New gear, new spells, now a days new aa's all make players more powerful. If the expansions didn't follow the next bigger badder mobs dropping better stuff people probably wouldn't buy it. Heck even LDoN has done alot to make pop easier. Aggro proc augments, hps/mana augments, new spells. <br />
<br />
As far as some specific things goes I doubt emp will ever be 1 groupped even several expansion later. 8 mobs plus emp is just a bit too much for a single group to deal with. You realistically need a group or more just to handle the adds (2 enchanters min mezzing, couple tanks and heals) For emp himself you'd need a tank and a couple clerics plus some dps so it doesn't take all day. Seru on the other hand is almost single groupable now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You made this post yesterday, Gates of Discord was announced before you made your post, it was official, and a release date had been announced as well.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure who you are talking too, but you wanted to start a discussion on whether or not the level cap was going to go up and what our feelings were about that.  Why would you complain about people's responses when they are in line with the discussion you started?</div></div><hr />

<br />
what's an OOIV?<br />
<br />
i seriously hope they stop bumping the level cap.  bumping the cap breaks things far worse than most anything else they do and we all know SoE is pretty good at breaking stuff.  i'd much rather see more AAs and more spells for the existing levels.  and more places to explore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Please stop being so simple. Who Gives a rats ass if 2 year old content is trivialized. IT SHOULD BE.<br />
<br />
You are the one with blinders on, you fail to see the big picture. And I wasn't talking about zones like Upper Guk, Sol A, etc.  Of course zones designed for the earlier levels will be trivialized eventually.  Try quoting the entire thing in context not ripping out just parts of it.  You missed the part where I said &quot;To increase the level range to 70 would mean numerous more zones would not be useable for xp by a majority of the population.&quot;<br />
<br />
How many people are in Sebilis?  None, cause it sucks for xp.  Its not because people have moved on, its because of the level being raised from 60 to 65.  If the level cap was not raised with PoP people would still be doing xp in numerous zones like Sebilis because they are still dark blue.  But now they sit empty because most people are reaching 65 and the xp there sucks.  Raising the limit to 70 would make places like Tier 1 and 2, LDoN normals, and a bunch of other zones worthless for xp.  By keeping the limit at 65 the zones are still useable for xp.  Sure they'll be a bit easier with new AA and spells, but they'll still be useable.<br />
<br />
As far as raid content, increasing the levels only speeds up the progression of guilds to where more and more get jammed into the very top end of the game.  Guilds on my server are now flying through NToV, Ssra/Luclin, VT, and into Elementals because the level cap completely triviallized the progression through everything before PoP.  It allowed them to progress at a highly accelerated rate through Ssra and into VT and now into Elementals.  Raising the cap to 70 will add even more guilds that will plow through VT like its crushbone and quickly enter Elementals destroying the Gods like they were nothing.  You'll see tons of guilds that will reach Time in a fraction of the time current guilds have.  So by the mid point of GoD there will be 10+ guilds on each server fighting for the same top end zones.<br />
<br />
When Velious was the current expansion most servers didn't have but 1 or 2 guilds doing NToV till near the very end.  Same with Luclin, most didn't have but 1 or 2, maybe 3 in VT up until PoP came out.  Now it seems every server has 6-8 guilds in Elementals and 2-4 guilds in Time.  On Brell there were 2 guilds doing NToV at the end of Velious, 1 guild doing VT at the end of Luclin.  We currently have 2 guilds in Time and I expect 2-3 more before GoD is released.  We also have 8 or 9 guilds Elemental capable with more very close.  The progression rate has been completely destroyed for everything prior to PoP.  What took guilds 12 months is now taking current guilds 6 months, adding 5 more levels will speed that up even more.  I personally don't want to see what servers like Karana and Tunare are going to be like when they have 15 guilds competing for the top level mobs.<br />
<br />
And really, why do we need more levels?  What difference does it make to grind out 5 more levels or 100 new AA points?   Levels by far completely unbalance the progression rate compared to new AA's.  Sure, AA's help, but not nearly as much as levels do.</div></div><hr />

However i like the concept of new planes, if we get to level 70 i get dibs on &quot;Plane of Meat&quot;  Man I love meat so much... Anyway im sure they will revamp old content as they have, and they did a good job in some places (New SG is awesome, but im gonna shutup now cause if your on BB theres nothing to see there...)  I bet eventually we will see level 70 come and go just as 65 went, and once we see new areas after awhile old content will just seem easy and it will be the same old stuff.  I've been playing since Kunark with many different alts, and saw from when the first Trakanon kill was huge to when people were talking about how Vex Thal was boring, lame, and even to now when PoP was being stated as one of much better expansions.  These things come naturally, and by the time we get a level 70 cap we will adapt to it, the game will become as it is now.  Im sure by the time people stop playing EQ GoD zone in things will be just like PoP ones, my brother pulled 5 PoI zone in things a bit ago, and even with my bad equipment it was easy as pie.  Remember PoI when it first came out?  I assume it will be the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">level cap is just a rumour started by somebody<br />
<br />
That would be Verant, who early on in beta and the first stages of release always claimed they saw level 75 as the end goal for player expansion.  I must add that SOE did nothing to put a stop to this rumor. For when asked about raising the level cap post-GoD, they had no comment. (Since EQ is the test bed for EQ2 code and ideas, they may be tempted to try.)<br />
<br />
So many people loved the original EQ game balance that when they added more in Kunark, the player reaction was very bad. And the new levels were so ill thought out, that it took them more then a year to address the major problems. (Kunark was so utterly broken...) A lot of old timers walked away from EQ then, never to be seen again.<br />
<br />
Which leads us to the sorry (but faster) state of the game now where there isn't one shread of game balance left, except for making the numbers go higher and higher. Sure, many things done to EQ are for the better, when it speeds up this snail paced game. But game balance just has not been a big part of the plan since Velious went live and SOE took over. Quality is better then quantity, in all cases. SOE is just a business and not a game designer. They'll only put out what sells en masse, and care nothing for leaving good memories of a fine game.<br />

In summation, raising the level cap is a bad idea. SOE loves bad ideas, as long as they make money.</div></div><hr />

If, as someone above alluded to, there is a completely new planet (Lord please - no Luclin lag), then there will potentially be an even further divide between the hard core 24/7 player and the frustrated power-gamer (cough) and the casual.<br />
<br />
One idea would be to make the new expansion HARD. REALLY hard, but with massive rewards. However, the downside is this - it's a one way ticket to the new world. Once you go - you can never come back.  You retain the shared bank account etc, but you are auto bound the second you zone into the friendly confines of the new FV or OT.  Ports, etc no longer work out. (There are however new places for Wizzies and Druids to port to on the new world).<br />
<br />
This would reward the power gamer while alleviating some of the clogging of the planes.</div></div><hr />

Lhranc has always been that level for the SK turn-in.  He just has 32k hp's.</div></div><hr />

In there I asked the question and it was kinda implied that there will be another expansion after GoD and very possibly another raise in level limits.  From what I was told, right now the cap just puts too much strain on giving out new spells (just like it was said before.. how many different versions of Avatar do I need at level 60).  So, I'm looking to see them raise the limit at least 5 more with the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">hehe every expansion has rumors of lvl increase one is due soon.<br />
<br />
And new lvls is a fine Idea but I just hope they remeber that to add new lvls it needs to be a massive expansion.  Adding new lvls makes alot of the old places to hunt and exp out dated and no longer viable.  To add 5 lvls the expansion would need to be min 25 new fighting zones for 10 probly 35+.  Also some firm advancement in those lvls both in spells as well as for melee  IE probly more lvl restrictive aa's to increase mitigation/defense and hp mods etc .<br />
<br />
They can't increase the lvl limit without doing this or they are gonna get alot of backlash from the players.  With pop uping the lvl limit 5 lvls I think they did this quite well.  So hopefully next time they will as well.<br />
<br />
As to how far can they go ... I don't see an upper cap as long as they keep adding content viable for thelvls they create.  will be fun having a lvl 200 monk and shaman one day should the game last long enough to get that high hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I think that a sudden jump in the level cap to 70 would certainly make Velious content trivial (most of it already is to be honest), it would likely make most of Luclin 1-2 groupable and it would certainly make PoP a playground for people making the Elementals very very crowded.<br />
I dont see this happening for several reasons.<br />
First, level 70s getting access en masse to the Elementals would certainly cause server instability; from all accounts of the elemental planes that I have read, they are laggy with one raid force there, let alone with 2-3 raids having a pissing contest for (by then) very trivial mobs. Secondly, by making the carrot suddenly that much more powerful, SOE will lose contact with its larger player base, the mid ranged, mid geared average joe....as much as I like to post and read these boards (and other boards), I do get tired of the upper tiered guild people that post here most frequently...sadly SOE caters to you, granting you content after content, but the bulk of their customers have likely never even seen 61+ The reason for the upper end content is simple, it gives the lower end people something to strive for, so its understandable.<br />
Assuming there is a change in the level cap, I dont expect it to be 5 or 10 levels, I think that a smarter move would be 1-2 levels at a time, thus allowing them to drag it out over 5 expansions or 2-3 years of expansions (I know that assumes that EQ will last that long, which despite doom and gloomers and WoW proponants, it very likely will).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I still stand by my post above from 2 months ago.  I don't see them adding any more levels without seriously hurting the game.   Raising the level cap to 70 would make nearly all non-GoD content useless for xp'ing and greatly trivialize the raid content for everyone, even those that have yet to progress to that level.   It would ruin the experience of killing those mobs for those that haven't done it yet because they would completely over power the mob from the start due to having more levels than the mob was designed for.   Emporer Ssra would become a blue con!   Sorry, they need to stick to the AA's and things like Leader abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I whant more lvls and if old raid content get more easy dont matter much becouse if it stayed the same diff we whould have no progress yes aa is fun and a good ide but they make old raid mobs easy and so only nead more of them then of for the same power uppgrade as a new lvl .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">More levels are coming and in the works... you can count on it.<br />

If not the next expansion the one after it will up the levels by five.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">My 2 cents, for what it's worth . . .<br />
<br />
Sooner or later they HAVE to raise the level cap.  The basic nature of the game requires it.  Consider--with each expansion, they have to add new spells and items, right?  Pure content works somewhat, but they need selling points for everyone, not just raid stuff, but stuff for the non-raiding folks.<br />
<br />
So, what new spells can they offer?  (If you're a shaman, nothing worth mentioning!)  Look at a cleric or a paladin.  They keep getting new heals of larger and larger amounts.  This is a good thing since average hp on the high end folks goes up with each expansion (new equipment).  However, if the level cap stays the same, then effectively two level 65 clerics are the same.  Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Cleric1--GoD geared, all spells.<br />
Cleric2--just hit 65, not a raider, but thanks to Yantis has all his spells.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are differences in hp and mana pools, but in terms of spells, they are exactly the same.  With no differentiation, you have just trivialized any content prior to the last expansion.  These 2 characters do different mobs, etc., but cleric2's mobs of choice have been utterly trivialized by the new spells.<br />
<br />
I probably haven't explained myself well, but think--why would you have spells of varying power within 1 level?  From a balance standpoint, it doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
Of course, that could be what SoE is attempting by making all the spells for GoD no-drop--to limit distribution to those who actually belong in GoD from a level/equip standpoint.<br />
<br />
I don't much care for the AA argument either.  If new kickass AA are implemented (obviously never for shaman), then people will buy the new kickass AA and skip the earlier less-useful AA.  Same effect--making a more powerful character quickly, thus trivializing content.  Arguably they could turn it into a more level-like system by making more pre-requisites of earlier AA abilities, but all of a sudden it sounds like the spec system from DAoC.  One change in prior pre-reqs, etc, and suddenly you have to refund everything.  That would make changing the AAs or retuning them a real nightmare.<br />
<br />
Obviously I can't comment definitively, but I don't see how you can avoid raising the level cap.  They sort of needed to do it this expansion.  I think it's almost a forgone conclusion for the next expansion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">There will always be new levels. The jumps will get smaller and eventually the level cap will only be raised by a single level at a time, but they can only realistically increase the power of characters through levels.<br />
<br />
I don't get the &quot;trivialize content&quot; talk. Did you guys do the Efreeti when it took 2+ groups to kill him? How bad is it that he has been soloable for a while? Trivializing old content is fine and part of the game. You simply move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">What folks seem to miss is the level is simply a number.<br />
<br />
You can be level 100 And if they wanted to your power level would not change one bit.<br />
<br />
Remember folks Monks weapon skills capped at level 40 I think. 252 skill<br />
<br />
They could set up a meaningless level where to combat stats you are = to level 65 even if level is 100. Mob levels could go up and yet still be blue.<br />
<br />
It is software if they can think of it and code it then it is true. The problem is Verant lost all thier talent years ago. They have coders sure. and graphics guys. but the soul is gone and has been for years.<br />
<br />
Verant can do anything they want. As long as you keep paying they will milk it. (And yes I am still paying too. I don't want to leave my friends, but EQ itself can bite my ass.)<br />
<br />
Mudflation is here to stay, Or in an older term Monty Haul campaign.<br />
<br />
The only choice we have is keep playing till something else comes along and bitch bitterly. Or leave the game and the friends and good memories and keep in touch with a outside Program but without the common bond of EQ How many people will truely be friends.<br />
<br />
Levels in the game don't matter one bit. gear and AA don't matter. There is always going to be something that will kick your ass and your 72 closest munchkins along with it. When you beat that they just wave thier hand and poof new critters. Same old game tho.<br />
<br />
A kodiak bear at level 5 is the same as a Super uber GoD mob. The only differance is scale. And a few numbers in a database. And the fun and stories you shared along the way with the other people you play with.<br />

Kunark, raised lvl's increased power signicantly, trivilized and cleared out original Antonica.<br />
<br />
Velious, place to use that increased power to get ones self serious gear.<br />
<br />
Luclin, place to use that serious gear to get ones self OMG Gear.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power, increase lvl's to get more powerful along with some serious gear.<br />
<br />
PFFFFTTTTTT, excuse me sorry who let that LoY here?<br />
<br />
LDoN, place for casual customer base to outfit themselves pretty good without competition from the guilds above them, but with actual grouping help from those guilds above them most of the time.  Providing a rather excellent way to provide gear to those willing to put in the time who don't have many other options.<br />
<br />
GoD, place to use that serious gear to get ones self OMG Gear. With merchants who con red.<br />

Thats why LoY was put here. <br />

Personal opinion on this topic: they should continue doing exactally what they're doing.. Revamping old world zones to better meet the needs of players. In the end, yes.. they are going to have to raise the level cap, but while they do that, they should continue to expand and update the old world.<br />
<br />
Content in Kunark, and Velious could use some serious tweaking.. remember when Velious quested armor was every players dream? <br />

I mean, give me a break..<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward an expansion that's not geared towards the &quot;uber&quot; players.. They're not opening older content to new players, they're giving elemental/time enabled guilds more monopolization of the game.<br />
<br />
I REALLY hope they update the epics.. i don't care if i have to do the quests over.. just make them EPIC once again.</div></div><hr />

Which is exactly what LDoN and LoY were...<br />
<br />
As for how many levels they can expand to.. I'm betting on 255, as that's probably the maximum the code can handle right now =-p</div></div><hr />
