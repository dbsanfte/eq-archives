<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi all<br />
<br />

<br />
My weapon skills are going up kinda slowly does anyonw know <br />
of any good and fast weapons to help me out, but they have to be cheep too<br />
<br />
what is the most important stat for a shaman wis or sta<br />
<br />
how do most shaman fight melee, dd's or dot<br />
what is the best combo<br />
<br />
thanks all for the help<br />
<br />
see you around later:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok basically do what you want till 34(don't DD too much, just DoT and tank is best method). When you hit 34 you'll get your pet. You'll have 2 choices, either a root rotter or a tanker. Tanker IMO and many shamans opinions is the best option. This means concentrate on AC/HP then WIS. This is because your tanking so it's obvious you need AC and the HP is for that and so you can cannibalize(convert HP to mana, canni 1 at level 29). In this situation our dog is like a DoT. <br />
    <br />
     In the other method you root the mob, DoT him then slow while you sit and med your pet tanks and you heal as appropriate, this will take more wis and is not as good at method 1 till the high high levels (50+ im thinking). <br />
<br />
P.S. don't nuke so much, waste of mana and not a &quot;shamanic&quot; think t'do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree tank as much as you can before you hit your 50's.  AC and hitpoints good for this (sta good since sta=more hitpoints).<br />
<br />
You need to melee a lot pre-50 so that you can max your defense at 200 (this is critical!  Defense skill = free AC).<br />
<br />
IMHO it is nice to have maxed weapon skills, but not critical to max all of them ( I focus on piercing and 1HB--no two handers for me, I like shields :)  ).  Find cheap weapons by going to the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
DoT's are much better for shaman's than our DD's.  Cast DD's to keep evocation up as you level, but DoT's much more effective.<br />
<br />
Like many here, I focuses on the AC/Hitpoints over high Wis, and would highly recommend it.  Until level 52 or so, my Wis was never higher than 150-155 or so.  Never had mana problems.<br />
Wis now hovers around 200-210, but that is because there is more wisdom on higher end gear and I do not need to sacrifice AC.  With stat food and Kei, Wis around 230 atm.   /Shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make sure to get your defense up more than your offense, but some decent items are out there.  Bronze Main gauche (if one sold in bazaar, would be like 10pp) is real fast piercer (23 delay?).  There are also a number of 1hb's similar (I think wraithbone hammer is 26-28 delay and sells for like 75pp).  2hb is really hard, usually have to get something slow until you can afford a good fast weapon (17/20 2hb in cazic-thule)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not sure what level you are but there are a couple weapons you could probably either loot or offer someone the 4pp they would get from a vendor for in Echo Caverns. Bogling spear and hammer are both 6/24 iirc and would allow you to practice piercing and 1hb and would basically be free. The hammer is also good for n00b monkys because it has a weight of zero. Another thing to do while you're in EC is spend some time with skeeters beating on you to help max your defense. They attack at some ridiculously low delay (like 9 I think) so they hit really fast and with your Dex buff you should be able to keep your def maxed. If they are too tough then try them again later, just remember to use your attack debuff instead of slow on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks all for the info<br />
<br />
if anyone has info on good and fast weapons<br />
<br />
please reply, 1h blunt or Piercing less than 4kpp would help<br />
<br />

<br />
thanks all <br />
<br />
see you later</div></div><hr />
