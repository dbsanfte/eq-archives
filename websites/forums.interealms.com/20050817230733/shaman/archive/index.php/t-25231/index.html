<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Additionally, people who have Station pass are likely to have it in order to play other games, and those people are less likely to use or need the additional characters since their time will be even more limited than someone who only plays EQ2.<br />
<br />
It was probably an easy thing to do with very little downside for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why so few character slots though. In EQ1 we had 8x(number of servers). In WoW they get slightly less than that but still a large amount.<br />
<br />
4? 8? Why not 25 or 30?<br />
<br />
I can rationalize a reason like oh it helps the roleplay experience but really they are giving us vastly less in terms of character slots, and it's strange.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, I'm not here to bash EQ2. :) Its just even in games we love there are sometimes things that seem off. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's an easy one.<br />
<br />
In EQ2, they are storing a LOT more information about characters.  Just storing information on all the quests is huge.  Spell data is a lot larger, and all characters now have &quot;spells&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I can certainly see why fewer slots were implemented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides, 4 characters?  How many years will it take to fully level those 4?<br />
<br />
One other note, many of the tradeskill occupations are highly specialized and have a great amount of inter-dependance upon each other.  If each player had more character slots, they'd simply use them to create crafters of every profession and destroy interdependancy, and perhaps the economy with it.  Tradeskill level is independant of adventure level in EQ2.<br />

This was a decision made by MBA's, not DBA's.   They did the same thing in SWG to push more accounts.</div></div><hr />

Tack on another 50% of your monthly fee to get twice as many character slots.  To say that this is a &quot;cost-driven&quot; option, you'd have to believe that HALF the cost of your (original) subscription fee goes to pay for...   hard drive space.<br />

Hard drive space.  Seriously.  You believe that?  We're not talking about complexity or heavy thinking on the part of teams of database admins.  We're talking about quest one having a binary field ticked to 0 for &quot;not done&quot; and 1 for &quot;done&quot;.  Ditto for quests 2-200,000.<br />

If it makes you feel better about shelling out another $7 or so by saying that Sony HAS to charge you that much, because we all know hard drives are the really expensive part about computing nowadays..... that's dandy, but it's silly to come here and try to convince people that the &quot;complexity&quot; of your game demands it.</div></div><hr />

If you don't like EQ2, fine, don't play it.  If you don't have anything meaningful to add to the discussion, please, don't.<br />
<br />
Some of us were rationally discussing the possible reasoning for a decision that was made.  We'd like to get back to that now.<br />

I still think it was highly driven by the desire to keep crafting interdependance high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jindaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Storage is cheap?<br />
<br />
I'd like to know where you get that idea from.  I work in Infrastructure Services for the largest pharmacuetical company in the world and storage costs are one of the most expensive items we manage.  SAN storage and others like it cost large chunks of money to both implement and manage effectivly, all of which needs to passed onto our customer base within research, corporate, marketing, ...<br />
<br />
The reason your 250mb of &quot;free&quot; storage from your Yahoo mailbox is free is 1 - they know you won't use it all so it is not permanently allocated to you, 2 - it's advertiser driven and paid for (you do see all the banner adcertisements all over your web mail page and Yahoo service).<br />
<br />
It's quite simple - SOE like most services industries - online gaming is a service based business - has moved to an &quot;A La Cart&quot; menu type system - just like the phone company, your cable provider, or a restaurant - you pay for what you want from the menu.   The basic meal of a 12 oz. Prime Rib, a Potato, and Vegetable may cost you $13.95, but if you want the &quot;king&quot; cut 16 oz. Prime Rib and Desert you are going to pay $21.95.<br />
<br />
People always get bent out of shape when they think someone is getting something they are not - but the truth is as long as it's offered to all subscribers (the option of upgrading), it's just simple business practices that quite frankly make sense.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp,<br />
<br />
Jin<br />
<br />
PS - I had to add after I read about the costs of hard drives being used in this arguement that if for one second you think SOE is going out and buying MAXTOR IDE $79.00 hard drives to place in enterprise computing solutions to cover critical storage needs and backup purposes than this arguement is mute because enterprise computing is well above what you are referring to.</div></div><hr />

Compared to bandwidth.  Compared to programming.<br />
<br />
To compare the business needs of your own company to what MMORPG's are doing is ludicrous.  Thanks for playing, Jindaan, but I don't think pharma IT needs are QUITE parallel here.  Or maybe you have a couple hundred thousand people from around the world yanking down a nice hunk of data for a few hours at a time.  All together.  Nice try tho, you at least knocked a couple neurons together to frame YOUR response.<br />
<br />
I don't actually dislike EQ2 overly much.  It's a huge improvement over EQ1, honestly.  It's pretty funny to watch some people spew venom all over themselves when I suggest that *gasp* they're doing it to make a buck BECAUSE THEY CAN.  I wonder why my saying that freaks them out so much?<br />

<br />
But think about that, the couple pennies generated by banner ads can pay for a system that permits *up to* 250mb of storage per account.    Why?  Because storage costs scale down with volume.  You're exactly right though, average users will only touch a fragment of that.    <br />
<br />
Just because you paid a lot for your system doesn't mean storage is your highest expense.  You also work in the medical field and I'm sure you have plenty of &quot;hospital grade&quot; horror stories and medical imaging is probably the most data intensive field shy of supercomputers.  With that aside, I bet if you took the salaries, facilities, network connectivity, etc. you'd find that storage is a fraction of your budget.  When I worked in network integration, labor alone was 70% of our bill.  <br />
<br />
With the disclaimer that I haven't played EQ2, I'm going to assume that it uses a system similar to what they developed for SWG where your characters can tack on containers, items with varying stats, and structures that can themselves contain more data nodes | recursion.  So I don't doubt that EQ2 characters take FAR more space, but offering 4 plus 4 more if you shell out tells me that they built the system to support 8 and haven't even waited for the honeymoon to be over to being the domestic violence that is SoE's treatment of it's customers.<br />
<br />
I appreciate that the launch of these two competing MMORPG's is beginning to polarize folks like sports fans and I apologize if I'm antagonizing anyone.  I'm just frowning at what looks like, to me, dodgey treatment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A lot of WoW players aren't play EQ2 simply for the fact that they view SOE as &quot;The Great Oppressors&quot;.

But you really need to stay off the EQ2 boards. I've seen far more WoW players jump in EQ2 threads and bash SOE than EQ2 players bash Blizzard. It does nothing to curb the stereotype that WoW fans are rabid B.net fanbois.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">First, we’re talking about a difference in cost of what, $6.00 a month??<br />
<br />
So that’s around $72.00 a year extra you are paying for this. Last time I bought a hard drive it cost me $50.00 for a 100 Gigabyte drive.<br />
<br />
4 Character slots don’t take 150 gigabytes of storage. They could have added character slots at a reasonable rate of 50 cents to 99 cents a month and been fine with it. That way people have the choice to scale to their needs and budgets. Not to mention the other Sony products simply aren’t worth it for 99% of us. (Guessing from what I’ve read)<br />
<br />
Large scale storage is pretty cheap, cheap enough that they would make a ludicrous killing charging $6.00 extra per month. Anyway, that’s just my take on it.<br />
<br />
 If each player had more character slots, they'd simply use them to create crafters of every profession and destroy interdependancy, and perhaps the economy with it. Tradeskill level is independant of adventure level in EQ2.<br />
<br />
I think pretty highly of your input Sudedor, but I’d like to address the accuracy of this comment.<br />
<br />
First, with 4 slots I could already make enough tradeskillers to be fully self sufficient if I wanted to. Adding 4 character slots won’t change that.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the time required to level up artisans for 8 accounts would be INSANE. It takes 75 subcombines to make ONE STACK of Iron Gaul Ink for my Alchemist. (At roughly 1 minute per subcombine.) NOT time efficient or plausible. Yes, some obsessive people will probably do it, but they would do it anyway, regardless of this latest marketing move by Sony.<br />
<br />
Finally, Tradeskill level isn’t REALLY independent of adventure level. In order to realistically do tradeskilling in Tier 2+ you need a MUCH higher Power pool than a level 1 or even a level 10 adventurer can do. You’d need around a level 30 adventurer, especially since all the gear that has any sort of power pool to it is level restricted. It doesn’t matter if you are a level 50 Alchemist, the equipment you can wear is based on your adventure level, so these people would also have to invest time into the adventure side to enhance the power pools for their tradeskills. (Even Tradeskill made gear has level restrictions.)<br />
<br />
So to me, the “They’re just trying to create interdependence” is much less likely than “They want more money, lots of it”<br />
<br />
With all that said.. I’ll be fine, and I’ll keep playing. It just steamed me up to see how they presented this as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
uhhh, I highly doubt SOE is using 7200RPM ATA HDDs.  They would be fibre channel which are much more expensive.  Plus they would be raided and probably backed up to some off-site tape.<br />
<br />
But either way it makes no difference to me what they give people who pay the $23.  I just enjoy pissing off the WOW fanboys.  It's great seeing all these people who used to love all playing the same game absolutely hate each other now...it's great!  Laughingwoman is a perfect example of the idiocy of this scenario.<br />
<br />
Laughingwoman thinks to himself<br />
&quot;Hey I know what I'm going to do...I'm going to go into the EQ2 forums and bug all the people there because they are playing a game that I hate (even though I never tried it).  Yea...that will fufill my day.&quot;<br />

I mean, if people are willing to pay it, fine.  But I think if we see SoE drop the price on this to a few bucks, we'll know that it wasn't as successful as they might have hoped it to be.<br />
<br />
And quite frankly, why shouldn't they try and get as much money as they can out of us.  For $15/month, we're truly getting a great deal, given the amount of time most junkies play.  When you consider that even a casual gamer is putting almost 10 hours a week into the game, and for most people that # is tiny, $15/month is nothing folks.<br />

I don't think there is a reasonable comparison for the cost of EQ, except maybe versus the cost of some ISP's and XBox Live. :)  The bang for the buck that EQ or any other online game provides is just insane.<br />

SoE is a profit driven company.They obviously know the demand is out there for 4 more char slots so they will charge as much as they think they can for them.<br />
$75 for a server transfer on EQ1..Someone justify that pricing.<br />
Does anyone really believe that people were restricted to 4 char slots because of crafting.If that was the case why would they let you buy another 4 slots ?.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Until Sony comes out and states that the character limits are to keep server/bandwidth/storage costs down, all of these arguments are just speculation.<br />
However, there are precedents showing that they are limiting character slots so they can use additional slots as marketing tools. <br />
Firiona Vie is a great example. You are allowed only 1 character. Most of the people I played with on that server have at least 2 full active accounts so they can have an alt. This was seriously not rare.<br />
When I was playing Star Wars Galaxies, I knew many people with at least 2 accounts, but it wasn't as wide spread as on Firiona Vie (but the game wasn't as good as EQ, either).<br />
Then comes Final Fantasy online...1 character slot per account, but you can pay .99 per month for an additional slot. Final Fantasy characters can pretty much change classes as will from what I hear, so it's not as wanted or necessary for multiple character slots as it is in EQ/EQ2.<br />
Now comes EQ2. I knew they were going to use more character slots in ways to make money. Before they offered the 4 extra slots for All Access accounts, I thought they would offer the .99 thing and/or put them in expansions to sweeten the pot, like they did with LoY and the extra bank slots.<br />
I'm not bashing SOE...if they didn't make money previously because of limiting characters, they would not have implemented the limits. It's not keeping me from playing, but I would have preferred more character slots per server, not per account.</div></div><hr />

I'm not flaming EQ2, it has a lot of great aspects. It's to the credit of EQ2 players and fans that they can discuss criticisms better than the WoW fans who seem to have a heart attack if you say their game is anything other than a flawless gem.<br />
<br />
I agree it's a little pointless after you have done it a few times, but still pretty easy to get through.  Also, there are actually a few reasons to use IoR for other purposes - such as tier1 tradeskill farming.  IoR used to drop &lt;10 tradeskill books too, but no longer.<br />
<br />
What I'm *very* glad Sony allows characters to bypass though is the tutorial.<br />
<br />
As for the diversity of starting city, once you get to Freeport and Qeynos they are pretty huge cities that offer a lot of exploration, so the diversity exists it's just not as physically seperated.  I'm still learning the city zones and expect to be doing so for a good time to come.  There are also several instances of IoR so all the newbies aren't really crammed into the same zone, so to speak, but sure the background is the same and it can get old after rolling a dozen characters. :)<br />
<br />
In keeping a low number of original starting cities, Sony has also allowed for a huge amount of expansion.  The first EQ2 expansion could include just one new starting city and it would add an enormous amount of content to the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you choose the same race for all your characters, sure, you'll get the same experience as you level up.<br />
<br />
However, playing a Barbarian Shaman (Oakmyst, Down Below) is different than playing a High Elf Cleric (Peat Bog, Down Below).  Let alone the difference between Freeport and Qeynos.<br />
<br />
As far as expanding, I don't really expect that there will be more cities.  I think the design idea in EQ2 was to keep the cities meaningful from level 6 thru end game.  Instead of PoK, we have our cities.<br />
<br />
I'd expect the expansions to begin roping in the Lore of what happened to the other continents during the Cataclysm.  Erudin, Faydwer, Kunark, Velious . . . what happened there?  I don't know, but I bet we find out.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Keyline Wintermystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Isn't the idea of the extra character slots to be sort of a reward for having the access/station pass?  Meaning you can only get it if your account has more than one game attached to it, not if you have multiple accounts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>WhoMe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Our little 700 GB SAN ran us 80k, and the expansion to it (bringing it up to 2 TB) cost another 40k.<br />

Enterprise level is definitely not consumer level.<br />
<br />
 As one who has to buy and maintain all the storage for our medical offices I will 2nd that one. Information storage, retrival and backup is not cheap. <br />
<br />
 I myself would not pay the extra to have more char space, after all 4 is more then enough to do your crafts anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Right now 4 suits my needs.<br />
<br />
I have a scholar alt going jeweler.<br />
I am an alchemist.<br />
I have a provisoner alt.<br />
I have a craftsman alt going woodworker.<br />
<br />
<br />
But in six months or more, if I get bored, I'll upgrade and add another 4 tradeskill alts.... maybe do carpenter/tailor/armorer/weaponsmith, leaving sage out. (Sage looks like a lot of pain).<br />
<br />
But right now I am content.</div></div><hr />

SoE is a profit driven company.They obviously know the demand is out there for 4 more char slots so they will charge as much as they think they can for them.<br />
$75 for a server transfer on EQ1..Someone justify that pricing.<br />
Does anyone really believe that people were restricted to 4 char slots because of crafting.If that was the case why would they let you buy another 4 slots ?.<br />
Profit rules for SoE as it does for any company.<br />

 Heck I figure if you have played for 5 years and made all those payments they should have a 1 move per year for free. Even the car dealer I buy cars from gives me a free oil change once a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">there is a really good aspect to fewer character slots: it's now less likely that the name you want in game for your main has already been taken by someone's level 2 character that they made and don't plan to really play.<br />
<br />
I don't have a huge issue with the restricted slot numbers. It just seemed odd to me, but I dont really need more than 4.</div></div><hr />
