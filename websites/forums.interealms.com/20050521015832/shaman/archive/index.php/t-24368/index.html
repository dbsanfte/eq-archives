Even if they don't stack, no reason to dispel the buff. they showed with haste that they can code effects to appear on various forms without stacking. You can get 3+ haste at same time on you and only best one counts (ex : miraculous vision, talisman of alacracy, vallon's quickening), why not do the same here ?</div></div><hr />

The other hastes stack because their haste components are in different slots.  If two slots have the same effect, the buff with the lower effect will be overwritten. That is unless there are rules on the slots that say not to overwrite for certain criteria. Evasive uses the same slot for its avoidance component as Sense: slot 1.<br />
<br />
Miraculous Visions uses slot 3, Talisman of Alacrity uses slot 1, Vallon's Quickening (and most other haste+stat enchanter buffs) uses slot 5.  That's why they all stack.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the probably don't want warriors having more than 50% avoidance and that's why Sense doesn't stack.</div></div><hr />

Adding a bard to your group easily made everyone swing twice as fast, and your melee became lawnmowers! :P</div></div><hr />
